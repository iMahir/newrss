       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>'<em>Rockstar</em>'-fame actor Nargis Fakhri's sister Aliya Fakhri has been arrested in the murder probe of her ex-boyfriend and his friend in Queens, New York. Aliya, 43, allegedly set a two-story garage on fire, which led to the death of Edward Jacobs, 35, and Anastasia Ettienne, 33.</p>

<p>Aliya Fakhri arrived at the garage early morning on November 2 and yelled "you're all going to die today" at Jacobs, who lived upstairs. A witness came out hearing her voice and found that the building was on fire, said District Attorney Melinda Katz.</p>

<p>Jacobs was sleeping during the incident. Ettienne came downstairs when alerted, but returned to save Jacobs. But neither of them could make it out of the burning building safely. Jacobs and Ettienne died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries, Ms Katz's office said in a press release.</p>

<p>Aliya Fakhri has been charged with four counts of murder in the first degree and four counts of murder in the second degree. She has also been accused of arson by a grand jury. She faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted of the top charge, the attorney said.</p>

<p>The court has remanded her and her next appearance is scheduled for December 9.</p>

<p>"As alleged in this indictment, this defendant maliciously ended the lives of two people by setting a fire that trapped a man and woman in a raging inferno. The victims tragically died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries," said Ms Katz.</p>

<p>A witness to the crime scene also narrated a disturbing account of events. Recalling that he smelled a sweet burning odour, the witness said he found the couch on the stairs on fire. They had to jump over the fire to escape the inferno. The witness said Ettienne had jumped across with him but went back in to save Jacobs.</p>

<p>Calling their relationship an abusive one, the witness also said that Ms Fakhri had previously threatened to burn Jacobs' house down.</p>

<p>Jacobs had broken up with Ms Fakhri about a year ago but she wasn't accepting the rejection, her mother Janet told the New York Post. She said her son was a plumber and was working on a project to convert the garage into an apartment.</p>

<p>Nargis Fakhri, best known for her role in the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer <em>Rockstar</em>, is yet to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>Their mother, however, couldn't believe Aliya Fakhri could murder someone. She said Aliya was a person who cared for and tried to help everyone. She also revealed that Aliya had struggled with opioid addiction after a dental mishap, which she believes may have led to her behaviour, according to multiple reports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday named billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his pick for US ambassador to Britain.</p>

<p>The longtime Republican donor was once reportedly opposed to Trump and gave money to a group dedicated to stopping him from winning his party's presidential primary in 2016.</p>

<p>Stephens, whose investment bank Stephens Inc is based in the southern state of Arkansas, has since funneled money into a political action committee that backed Trump's 2024 election campaign.</p>

<p>"Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time. I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America's most cherished and beloved Allies," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>The incoming president has made a raft of nominations for his administration in recent weeks ahead of his inauguration on January 20.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He recently named Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, as the US ambassador to France.</p>

<p>During his first term in the White House, Trump appointed another billionaire and campaign supporter, businessman Woody Johnson, as US ambassador to Britain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump will attend the weekend reopening of the restored Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, which was ravaged by a 2019 fire, he said Monday.</p>

<p>The 850-year-old edifice will welcome visitors and worshippers again this Saturday and Sunday, with several world leaders expected among the guests, after a sometimes challenging restoration.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago," Trump wrote on his Truth Social network.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron conducted an inspection of the restoration of the medieval cathedral on Friday, saying workers had done the "impossible" by healing a "national wound."</p>

<p>He had set the ambitious goal of rebuilding Notre Dame within five years and to make it "even more beautiful" than before, a target that French authorities say has been met.</p>

<p>Trump wrote that Macron had "done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!"</p>

<p>Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were brought in for restoration work costing a total of nearly 700 million euros (more than $750 million at today's rate).</p>

<p>It was financed from the 846 million euros in donations that poured in from 150 countries in a surge of solidarity.</p>

<p>Macron said in December 2023 he had invited Pope Francis to the reopening of the cathedral but the head of the Catholic church announced in September, to the surprise of some observers, that he would not be coming.</p>

<p>Instead, the pontiff is making a landmark visit the following weekend to the French island of Corsica.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President-elect JD Vance's photo with his wife Usha Vance's Indian family has gone viral on social media. In the picture, Mr Vance can be seen wearing a blue t-shirt and jeans while holding his son on his shoulder. His wife, dressed in a yellowish-brown outfit can be seen on the left side, holding their daughter. Alongside the couple, about 21 family members can be seen enjoying themselves in what appears to be a party in the backyard of a home.</p>

<p>Asha Jadeja Motwani, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, shared the undated pic and captioned it as saying: "JD Vance at Thanksgiving. Reminds me of the big fat Indian wedding."</p>

<p>As the post went viral, reactions poured in from all quarters with the majority appreciating the Ohio senator for his sweet and loving family.</p>

<p>"JD got a sense of real family," said one user, while another added: "Lots of respect to Vance here for spending time with his wife's fully Indian family. It can be hard for an outsider to adapt to Indian culture, especially with the older generation. Seems like they had a great time."<br />
A third added: "His son is sitting on his shoulder in a pure Indian way."</p>

<p>However, some white supremacists once again launched racist attacks on the Republican leader and his wife for the picture. Nick Fuentes, a far-right commentator, infamous for his absurd takes, posted the image and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1863260808169283846" rel="noindex, nofollow">wrote</a>: "If you support JD Vance you are either being paid by Peter Thiel or you're ngmi."</p>

<h3><strong>JD Vance's love for India and Indian food</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking to popular podcast host, Joe Rogan, earlier this month, Mr Vance waxed lyrical about the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine and how his wife had influenced his food choices.</p>

<p>"For any vegetarian out there, indulge in paneer, rice, and chickpeas. Skip the nasty fake meat. If you want to embrace a vegetarian lifestyle, turn to Indian cuisine. It offers wonderful vegetarian options," said Mr Vance.</p>

<p>The Republican leader also recalled an early attempt at impressing Usha with homemade vegetarian food that didn't go as planned. "I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes." The result, he said, was "disgusting".</p>

<p>Usha Vance and JD met at the Yale University in 2014 while pursuing their law degree. JD's memoir describes Usha as his "Yale spirit guide" who helped him navigate life at the elite varsity. The couple has three children together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Monday announced a new $725 million military aid package for Ukraine that features a second tranche of landmines as well as anti-air and anti-armor weapons.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden's administration is working against the clock to provide billions of dollars in aid to Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, after which future assistance for Ukraine will be in doubt.</p>

<p>Less than two months before Trump is set to be sworn in, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the package was part of efforts "to ensure Ukraine has the capabilities it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression."</p>

<p>It includes anti-personnel landmines, ammunition for HIMARS precision rocket launchers, Stinger missiles, counter-drone systems, anti-armor weapons and artillery ammunition, Blinken said in a statement.</p>

<p>The United States announced a first shipment of landmines to Ukraine last month -- a major policy shift slammed by rights groups.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said that the decision was necessitated by Russian forces leading with dismounted infantry units instead of vehicles.</p>

<p>The Ukrainians "have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians," Austin told journalists last month.</p>

<p>The outgoing US administration is working to get as much aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump -- who has repeatedly criticized US assistance for Kyiv, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours -- takes over the presidency.</p>

<p>Trump's comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about the future of US aid, and Ukraine's ability to withstand Russian attacks in the absence of further American support.</p>

<p>The United States has been a key military backer of Ukraine, committing more than $60 billion in weapons, ammunition and other security aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his country needed security guarantees from NATO and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a statement on Elon Musk's X social media platform, Tesla said it would appeal the verdict.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge on Monday upheld her decision to reject Elon Musk's massive $55.8 billion compensation package at Tesla, denying an attempt to restore the pay deal through a shareholder vote.</p>

<p>In a court filing, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery ruled that Tesla's attempt to ratify Musk's compensation package through a June shareholder vote could not override her January decision striking down the package as excessive and unfair to shareholders.</p>

<p>McCormick found multiple flaws in Tesla's ratification attempt, including "material misstatements" in documents provided to shareholders about the effect of their vote.</p>

<p>"The motion to revise is denied," McCormick wrote.</p>

<p>"The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law," she added.</p>

<p>In a statement on Musk's X social media platform, Tesla said it would appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>"Shareholders should control company votes, not judges," said Musk, in a separate post.</p>

<p>The court also awarded $345 million in attorney fees, significantly less than the $5.6 billion requested by the lawyers of plaintiff Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder.</p>

<p>While acknowledging their calculation method was technically sound under Delaware law, which bases fees on the percentage of benefit achieved, McCormick ruled that such a large award would constitute an excessive windfall.</p>

<p>Shareholders originally backed the Musk compensation plan in March 2018 that was specifically designed to reward the 53-year-old founder for Tesla's significant growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a lawsuit, Tornetta accused the defendants of failing in their duties when they authorized the pay plan and alleged that Musk dictated his terms to directors, who were not sufficiently independent from their star CEO.</p>

<p>He also accused Musk of "unjustified enrichment" and asked for the annulment of a pay program that helped make the entrepreneur the richest man in the world.</p>

<p>During a trial in 2022, Musk countered that investors in Tesla were some of the "most sophisticated in the world" and able to keep tabs on his management.</p>

<p>He said Tesla had been the laughingstock of the auto industry, and it was only the massive success of the company's Model 3 that turned things around.</p>

<p>Musk insisted that he played no role in coming up with the package nor discussed his deal with the board members, some of them close friends, who ultimately signed off on it.</p>

<p>The Delaware Court of Chancery has been a pillar of US capitalism for more than a century and is the jurisdiction where roughly two-thirds of American Fortune 500 companies are registered.</p>

<p>Musk on Monday reposted other users' X posts calling for companies to leave Delaware.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harvey Weinstein was taken to hospital on Monday for treatment after an "alarming" blood test result that required immediate medical attention, and he is expected to stay there until his condition stabilizes, his lawyer said.</p>

<p>The disgraced Hollywood movie mogul's lawyers have previously said he is beset with health problems. He was rushed to the hospital from New York City's Rikers Island jail on Sept. 8 to undergo heart surgery.</p>

<p>A jury found Weinstein, 72, sexually assaulted former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and raped aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. They are among more than 80 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the New York case, and to 16 years in prison for the separate California case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which seized Aleppo in a shock offensive over the weekend, is an Islamist movement that has long ruled swathes of the country's northwest.</p>

<p>The group has sought to moderate its image in recent years, including by cutting ties with its one-time sponsor Al-Qaeda, but it faces an uphill battle convincing Western governments it has fully renounced hardline jihadism, experts say.</p>

<p>Aleppo had been held by Syrian government forces since late 2016.</p>

<p>HTS says it no longer has any links to Al-Qaeda after severing them in 2016, five years into Syria's civil war.</p>

<p>It took on its current name the following year, arresting Al-Qaeda and Islamic State group jihadists, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank.</p>

<p>But it remains blacklisted by the United States and the European Union.</p>

<p>In large parts of the northwestern Idlib province it has controlled since 2019, it has set up a so-called "salvation government" that controls the rebel stronghold's economy and whose judges are largely loyal to HTS.</p>

<p>"Throughout parts of northwestern Syria, the rebels have started setting up and building upon already established proto-governance structures, indicating their ambition to govern and maintain control," wrote the New-York-based Soufan Center.</p>

<p>"Some of these efforts date back years, with sophisticated attempts to subsidise the cost of food and stabilize the banking and energy sectors in the areas under HTS control."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Insurgent group' -</strong></p>

<p>Jerome Drevon, a jihadism expert at ICG, said HTS "provides basic services to the population", coordinating with US aid agencies helping to funnel humanitarian aid to the millions in need in territories it holds.</p>

<p>Even if some view it as authoritarian, "it provides homogeneous governance, which contrasts with other regions in Syria", he told AFP.</p>

<p>French journalist Wassim Nasr met HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani last year.</p>

<p>"He and his group are no longer committed to whatever is meant by international jihad, that was crystal clear. They consider that it 'only brought destruction and failure to their communities'," he told a publication of the Combating Terrorism Center linked to US military academy West Point.</p>

<p>"Women go to school, women drive, you see people smoking in the street. Of course, they far from espouse democratic values or those of a liberal free society, but it's a shift."</p>

<p>Drevon said that, whatever the reasons for HTS breaking ties with Al-Qaeda years ago -- whether it was tactical to avoid unwanted US attention or not -- "now it behaves like an insurgent group" with domestic aims, without any "dimension of international terrorism".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Incredibly opportunistic' -</strong></p>

<p>Several experts, however, warned the group has not fundamentally broken with its past despite its rebranding.</p>

<p>Tammy Lynn Palacios, of the New Lines Institute, said HTS "has demonstrated that it is incredibly opportunistic in its allegiances and associations".</p>

<p>It "remains a jihadist organisation until HTS leadership successfully omits connections of its rank and file with more hardline jihadist groups and individuals", she told AFP.</p>

<p>"Al-Qaeda is not done with HTS, no matter how much HTS is done with al-Qaeda and thus nothing short of public and formal disavowal of al-Qaeda will truly lessen the threat of jihadist extremism in northwest Syria," she added.</p>

<p>The Soufan Center also points out that "while there are signs that minorities and non-Sunnis will be respected by even extreme elements of the rebels such as HTS, terrorist organizations' participation in the offensive causes some alarm".</p>

<p>Like the Taliban in power in Afghanistan since 2021 but not recognised in the West, HTS will likely struggle to leave Western "terrorist" lists.</p>

<p>Hans-Jakob Schindler, the director of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), said this was justified.</p>

<p>"If you have to ask for permission before you break ties with al-Qaeda, from the leadership of Al-Qaeda, the sincerity of the ideological reorientation is in question," he told AFP.</p>

<p>He pointed to the case of a young Austrian man who Munich police shot dead in September after he opened fire at the Israeli consulate in the German city.</p>

<p>Investigators last year found three videos he had recorded in 2021, showing scenes from a computer game "with Islamist content", according to Austrian prosecutors.</p>

<p>In one of them, the suspect had used an avatar with a flag of the "al-Nusra Front", the name of HTS before it severed ties with Al-Qaeda in 2016.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no debate about the fact that they should remain listed as a terrorist group," Schindler said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said there would be "hell to pay" in the Middle East if hostages held in the Gaza Strip were not released prior to his Jan. 20 inauguration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday warned Gaza militants of massive repercussions if hostages are not released by the time he takes office.</p>

<p>The threat comes after exhaustive diplomacy by outgoing President Joe Biden's administration that has so far failed to secure a deal that would both end Israel's war in Gaza and free hostages seized 14 months ago.</p>

<p>"If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>"Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!"</p>

<p>Trump has vowed staunch support for Israel and to dispense with Biden's occasional criticism, but has also spoken of his desire to secure deals on the world stage.</p>

<p>Hamas staged the deadliest ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The assault resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants seized 251 hostages during the attack, some of whom were already dead. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 35 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 44,429 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Monday issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and 93 others in a case related to last week's protests in Islamabad by his party supporters.</p>

<p>Khan, who has been incarcerated since 2023, had on November 13 issued a "final call" for nationwide protests to be held on Nov 24, demanding the restoration of the PTI's electoral mandate, the release of detained party members, and the reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.</p>

<p>The main protest in Islamabad ended in clashes in which 12 PTI supporters were killed, according to the party, while hundreds were arrested.</p>

<p>The Islamabad Police submitted a list of 96 suspects in the Islamabad-based Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC), including prominent leaders of PTI, such as Khan, Bibi, Gandapur, former president Arif Alvi, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, PTI Chairman Gohar Khan, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and several others.</p>

<p>It asked the court to issue their arrest warrants and ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra accepted the request and issued non-bailable arrest warrants for 96 suspects.</p>

<p>The first information report (FIR) registered after the protest included various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act.</p>

<p>It accused the PTI leaders of attacking police personnel under a "conspiracy" and using government employees for their purposes during the protest. It also said that the actions of protesters led to locals being trapped in their homes and spread fear and panic.</p>

<p>Khan was already sent to jail on judicial remand in seven cases related to protests between September 28 and October 5.</p>

<p>Dozens of cases have been registered against him since his government fell in April 2022 due to a no-confidence vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Volkswagen Group, which include the brands Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Porche, and Lamborghini has been accused by Indian authorities of evading $1.4 billion (Rs 118.6 billion) in taxes, which is roughly Rs 11,865 crore.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Volkswagen Group, which include the brands Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Porche, and Lamborghini has been accused by Indian authorities of evading $1.4 billion (Rs 118.6 billion) in taxes, which is roughly Rs 11,865 crore.</p>

<p>The companies within the Volkswagen Group accused of import duty manipulation include the Indian unit Skoda Auto Volkswagen and the models of cars involved in the alleged scam include Audi's A4 and A6 sedans and Q5 and Q7 SUVs. It also includes Skoda's Octavia and Superb sedans, its Kodiaq SUV, and Volkswagen's Tiguan SUV.</p>

<p>Relevant authorities in India have claimed after detailed scrutiny that Volkswagen has deliberately and "wilfully" manipulated its import in such a way that it evaded a higher tax slab by categorising parts to be imported under a lower tax category. This is something Volkswagen has denied, saying it complies with all local laws and is cooperating with Indian authorities.</p>

<h2><strong>UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORT DUTIES</strong></h2>

<p>To promote local manufacturing, India levies an import duty of 35 per cent on Completely Knocked-Down units or CKDs. These are imported as a kit and then assembled into cars at the manufacturing plants across India.</p>

<p>For other parts of the vehicle that are manufactured locally, but require components within it to be imported, the import duty for such components varies from 5 per cent to 15 per cent.</p>

<p>Should a 'ready-to-drive' car be imported in its entirety from another country, 100% import duty is charged. This steep duty, imposed for decades, is credited behind auto manufacturing plants being set up in India.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT VOLKSWAGEN ALLEGEDLY DID</strong></h2>

<p>Upon detailed scrutiny, Indian authorities have claimed they found that to bypass the 30-35 per cent import duty on CKDs, Volkswagen intentionally "mis-declared and mis-classified" its component imports by declaring them as "individual parts" - which, as mentioned above, attracts a much-lower import duty of 5-15 per cent.</p>

<p>The authorities claimed that over time, Volkswagen imported 97 per cent of all parts of the car models mentioned above by declaring them as "individual components", accumulating to nearly a billion-and-a-half dollars of import duty evasion.</p>

<h2><strong>HOW VOLKSWAGEN IMPORTS AUTO COMPONENTS AND PARTS</strong></h2>

<p>Volkswagen has an international inventory management system called NADIN for all its brands. It also has a separate software called ProCKD which it has developed to track and manage all inventory for manufacturing plants based in India.</p>

<p>Based on the feedback and projections sent by its sales and operations teams across India, the Volkswagen Group uses the these software - NADIN and ProCKD - to place orders for its various vehicle models across brands. This is how the manufacturing and assembly flow is managed.</p>

<p>Using the information entered in both software, an order is placed which NADIN then divides into a range of between 700 and 1,500 components which are necessary for a vehicle to be manufactured. The NADIN software is directly connected to international suppliers of three of Volkswagen's brands - Audi, Skoda, and VW - in Germany, Czech Republic, and Hungary.</p>

<p>Once these brands receive the orders for components from India, the suppliers in these countries send the parts&nbsp; to a "consolidation centre" for each brand from where it is shipped to India. Components are stamped with unique IDs that helped the production teams in India to identify which part goes where in the said car.</p>

<p>A 17-digit alpha-numeric number is also printed on the parts to identify them for each vehicle. A separate 16-digit ID number was also given so that factory workers could know that these parts need to be assembled together before being installed in the car.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT VOLKSWAGEN CLAIMS AS COMPARED TO AUTHORITIES</strong></h2>

<p>These individual parts mentioned above then reach various Indian ports as multiple consignments and multiple invoices, all separate from one another, but usually arrive on consecutive days within a week. Authorities claim that the vehicle body is supplied along with the main components and the rest of the parts arrive separately in different packages to avoid detection as CKDs.</p>

<p>Volkswagen says this is purely a logistical model which it has adopted over the years to improve efficiency. However, authorities call this "intentional and deliberate" to avoid paying higher import duties.</p>

<p>The notice sent by Indian authorities to Volkswagen Group has been accessed by news agency Reuters. If the allegations are proven correct, it would be one of the biggest cases of import duty evasion in India's history. It would also significantly impact the Volkswagen Group, which is already facing tough competition in the Indian auto market.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Marburg or "bleeding eye" virus in Rwanda has killed at least 15 people so far and infected hundreds others, ever since its outbreak and spread across 17 African countries over the past two months.</p>

<p>An advisory issued by Travel Health Pro, which is run by the UK Health Security Agency, has warned travellers against the spread of Marburg in Rwanda, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Uganda, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Panama and Peru.</p>

<p>Besides Marburg, the advisory has also cautioned against Clade 1 and Oropouche fever, two other serious infectious diseases that have also spread across the above countries.</p>

<p>People travelling to these regions have been advised to exercise additional vigilance.</p>

<p><strong>What Is "Bleeding Eye" Virus?</strong></p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the Marburg virus disease, formerly known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever, as a severe and often fatal illness in humans. Rousettus aegyptiacus, a fruit bat of the Pteropodidae family, is considered the natural host of Marburg virus.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>

<p>According to WHO, the incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) varies from two to 21 days. It is marked by high fever, severe headache and malaise. Muscle aches and pains are common features. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, cramping, nausea and vomiting is likely to begin on the third day.</p>

<p>From day 5 of the disease, patients may develop haemorrhagic manifestations, including fresh blood in vomit and faeces, and bleeding from the nose, eyes, ears, mouth, gums or vagina. Orchitis (inflammation of one or both testicles) has been reported occasionally in the late phase of the disease.</p>

<p>In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight to nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong></p>

<p>The "bleeding eye" virus can spread through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.</p>

<p>Healthcare workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus. Funeral services that involve direct contact with the body of a victim can also contribute to the transmission of the virus.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>

<p>Currently, there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved for the "bleeding virus" but early supportive care with rehydration, and symptomatic treatment can improve survival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden after repeatedly pledging not to. Below is a look at the circumstances leading up to the pardon and its legal consequences.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DID THE PARDON COVER?</strong></p>

<p>Hunter Biden was pardoned for his conviction by a jury in Delaware and a guilty plea in California. Hunter Biden was also pardoned for federal crimes "he committed or may have committed" between Jan. 1, 2014 through the end of this year.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT CRIMES WAS HUNTER BIDEN CONVICTED OF?</strong></p>

<p>A Delaware jury in June found the president's son guilty of lying about his addiction to illegal drugs on a disclosure form that is required to purchase a firearm. The trial included hours of embarrassing testimony about Hunter Biden's addiction to crack and reckless behavior. He was scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 12.</p>

<p>Biden separately pleaded guilty to criminal charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes while spending lavishly on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. He was scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 16.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT SENTENCE WAS BIDEN FACING?</strong></p>

<p>He was facing decades in prison, although sentencing guidelines suggested he was likely to receive a much less severe punishment.</p>

<p>For the gun charges, sentencing guidelines are 15 to 21 months, although legal experts said defendants in similar situations receive shorter sentences and are less likely to be incarcerated if they abide by the terms of their pretrial release. Hunter Biden's attorney had told the judge that he was complying with terms of his bail, which included drug testing to show he was not using illegal drugs.</p>

<p>A juror told CNN after the trial they did not think Hunter Biden belonged in prison.</p>

<p><strong>WASN'T THERE A PLEA DEAL?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. In June last year Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of willfully failing to pay income taxes and an agreement that would have spared him a conviction on a gun-related charge. The agreement prompted accusations by Republicans that Hunter Biden is receiving favorable treatment as the president's son. A federal judge questioned the breadth of that agreement and declined to accept it, paving the way for Hunter Biden's trial on gun charges.</p>

<p><strong>COULD HUNTER BIDEN BE CALLED TO TESTIFY IN ANOTHER CASE?</strong></p>

<p>If the US House of Representatives or the Justice Department decides to probe the Biden family business dealings, as some Republicans have promised to do, Hunter Biden could potentially be called to testify. Before he was pardoned, he could have declined to do so, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The pardon could limit his ability to invoke that right, because he no longer faces criminal jeopardy for any federal crimes committed during the period covered. Presidential pardons do not protect people from prosecution for state crimes.</p>

<p><strong>ARE PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS UNUSUAL?</strong></p>

<p>No. Presidents beginning with George Washington, the first US president, have granted pardons. Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace, Bill Clinton pardoned his brother-in-law and Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and the father of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House on Monday defended President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son, Hunter, and said the president believed his political opponents would have kept persecuting his son going forward.</p>

<p>"They would continue to go after his son," White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One during a trip to Angola.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre said this was not the first time a president had pardoned a family member.</p>

<p>Biden said in June that he would not pardon his son. In an interview with ABC News, Biden replied "yes" when asked if he would rule out pardoning Hunter.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre declined to give details on why or how Biden had changed his mind.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in September to federal tax charges in federal court in Los Angeles and was due to be sentenced Dec. 16 under Mark C. Scarsi, a judge nominated by Republican President-elect Donald Trump. A jury found him guilty in June of making false statements on a gun background check; he was due to be sentenced for those charges this month as well.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earth is an ocean world, with water covering about 71% of its surface. Venus, our closest planetary neighbor, is sometimes called Earth's twin based on their similar size and rocky composition. While its surface is baked and barren today, might Venus once also have been covered by oceans?</p>

<p>The answer is no, according to new research that inferred the water content of the planet's interior - a key indicator for whether or not Venus once had oceans - based on the chemical composition of its atmosphere. The researchers concluded that the planet currently has a substantially dry interior that is consistent with the idea that Venus was left desiccated after the epoch early in its history when its surface was comprised of molten rock - magma - and thereafter has had a parched surface.</p>

<p>Water is considered an indispensable ingredient for life, so the study's conclusions suggest Venus was never habitable. The findings offer no support for a previous hypothesis that Venus may have a reservoir of water beneath its surface, a vestige of a lost ocean.</p>

<p>Volcanism, by injecting gases into a planet's atmosphere, provides clues about the interior of rocky planets. As magma ascends from an intermediate planetary layer called the mantle to the surface, it unleashes gases from deeper parts of the interior.</p>

<p>Volcanic gases on Earth are more than 60% water vapor, evidence of a water-rich interior. The researchers calculated that gases in Venusian eruptions are no more than 6% water vapor, indicative of a desiccated interior.</p>

<p>"We suggest that a habitable past would be associated with Venus' present interior being water-rich, and a dry past with Venus' present interior being dry," said Tereza Constantinou, a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy and lead author of the study published on Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.</p>

<p>"The atmospheric chemistry suggests that volcanic eruptions on Venus release very little water, implying that the planet's interior - the source of volcanism - is equally dry. This is consistent with Venus having had a long-lasting dry surface and never having been habitable," Constantinou added.</p>

<p>Venus is the second planet from the sun, and Earth the third.</p>

<p>"Two very different histories of water on Venus have been proposed: one where Venus had a temperate climate for billions of years, with surface liquid water, and the other where a hot early Venus was never able to condense surface liquid water," Constantinou said.</p>

<p>The Venusian diameter of about 7,500 miles (12,000 km) is just a tad smaller than Earth's 7,900 miles (12,750 km).</p>

<p>"Venus and Earth are often called sister planets because of their similarities in mass, radius, density and distance from the sun. However, their evolutionary paths diverged dramatically," Constantinou said.</p>

<p>"Venus now has surface conditions that are extreme compared to Earth, with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater, surface temperatures soaring to around 465°C (869°F), and a toxic atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds. These stark contrasts underscore the unique challenges of understanding Venus as more than just Earth's counterpart," Constantinou said.</p>

<p>The story appears to have been different on Mars, the fourth planet from the sun.</p>

<p>Surface features on Mars indicate it had an ocean of liquid water billions of years ago. No such features have been detected on Venus. Mars, according to research published in August based on seismic data obtained by NASA's robotic InSight lander, may harbor a large reservoir of liquid water deep under its surface within fractured igneous rocks, holding enough to fill an ocean that would cover its entire surface.</p>

<p>While Venus has been studied less than Mars, new explorations are planned. NASA's planned DAVINCI mission will examine Venus during the 2030s from its clouds down to its surface using both flybys and a descent probe. Also during the 2030s, the European Space Agency's EnVision orbital mission is due to conduct radar mapping and atmospheric studies.</p>

<p>"Venus provides a natural laboratory for studying how habitability - or the lack of it - evolves," Constantinou said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawyer defending Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, &nbsp;the Hindu priest arrested and accused of sedition in Bangladesh, has been attacked, the ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) has said. A court in Bangladesh is expected to hear the case on December 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a post on X, Radharaman Das, the spokesperson for ISKCON, said, "Please pray for Advocate Ramen Roy. His only 'fault' was defending Chinmoy Krishna Prabhu in court. Islamists ransacked his home and brutally attacked him, leaving him in the ICU, fighting for his life".</p>

<p>Many lawyers in Bangladesh, however, have denied any such event.</p>

<p>Last month too, there were claims on social media and a few news outlets that a lawyer defending Chinmoy Krishna Das was killed. But investigations revealed that the murdered lawyer, Saiful Islam, was an assistant public prosecutor and he was not defending Chinmoy Das.</p>

<p>The post from Radharaman Das read:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Please pray for Advocate Ramen Roy. His only 'fault' was defending Chinmoy Krishna Prabhu in court.<br />

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a prominent former leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Bangladesh, was arrested in Dhaka last month after protests by the Hindu community in Rangpur, demanding stronger legal protections for minority groups. He has been accused of sedition and was denied bail by a Dhaka court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Bangladesh has seen widespread political violence and protests over minority rights since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Amid attacks on minority Hindus in the neighbouring coutry, Radharaman Das had earlier posted on X that two disciples of Chinmoy Krishna Das have gone missing in Chattogram after a second Hindu monk, Shyam Das Prabhu, was arrested.</p>

<p>India has condemned the arrest and urged Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and other minorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrest has also been strongly criticised by Indian religious leaders and members of the civil society.</p>

<p>Protest rallies have been held in West Bengal and several other staes that share border with Bangladesh.</p>

<p>In Tripura, the criticism has taken the form of boycott. Hotels and restaurants have decided not to accept bookings from tourists from Bangladesh, the top association of the travel sector has said.</p>

<p>Earlier today, more than 50 protesters allegedly entered the premises of the Bangladeshi mission in Tripura capital Agartala, leading to panic among the officials and staff at the complex. India has described the incident as "deeply regrettable".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States announced new export restrictions Monday targeting China's ability to make advanced semiconductors, drawing swift condemnation from Beijing as competition deepens between the world's two biggest economies.</p>

<p>The moves step up US efforts to tighten curbs on exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, aiming to hinder the country's ability to make chips that can be used in advanced weapons systems and in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The announcement comes weeks before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House, where he is expected to advance Washington's hawkish stance on China.</p>

<p>"The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security," said National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in a statement.</p>

<p>He added that Washington will keep working with allies and partners "to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how so they aren't used to undermine our national security."</p>

<p>Beijing vowed Monday to defend its interests, with a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson saying the United States "abuses export control measures" and has "hindered normal economic and trade exchanges."</p>

<p>The latest US rules include a restriction of exports to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier Technology.</p>

<p>They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the Commerce Department.</p>

<p>Others include entities in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.</p>

<p>Being added to the "entity list" restricts US suppliers from exporting to them without additional permission.</p>

<p>The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chipmaking equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.</p>

<p>"We are constantly talking to our allies and partners as well as reassessing and updating our controls," noted Under Secretary of Commerce for industry and security Alan Estevez.</p>

<p><strong>Military focus</strong></p>

<p>The efforts further a policy beginning under Trump's first administration, to hold back Beijing's ability to gain ground and become a leading tech economy.</p>

<p>On Monday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo stressed that President Joe Biden's government has been especially tough in "strategically addressing China's military modernization through export controls."</p>

<p>"The semiconductor manufacturing equipment controlled by today's rules is needed to produce advanced-node integrated circuits, which are necessary for advanced weapon systems and advanced AI used in military applications," the Commerce Department said.</p>

<p>It added that overall, the actions are to slow China's development of advanced AI that could "change the future of warfare," and impair China's development of its own semiconductor ecosystem.</p>

<p>But the department maintained that this is in line with Washington's "small yard, high fence" strategy -- an approach that Chinese President Xi Jinping last month urged against.</p>

<p>Calls to further close the semiconductor supply chain have grown since the world became increasingly aware of the powers of AI, with the launch of ChatGPT.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The root causes of diseases like cancer, dementia and heart disease are expected to be better understood following a "significant" research partnership involving an Indian-origin entrepreneur's genetics initiative.</p>

<p>Gordon Sanghera, CEO of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, said the development of a world-first "epigenetic map" of the human genome could lead to breakthroughs in new diagnoses and treatments.</p>

<p>The new resource for medical researchers will be created following the UK government's strategic partnership with the Oxford-headquartered life science company, UK Biobank, NHS England and Genomics England unveiled last week.</p>

<p>"This project represents a significant leap forward in epigenetic research, an increasingly important area of study related to disease progression and response to treatment," said Sanghera, born in the UK to a Punjabi family.</p>

<p>"Working with UK Biobank to create the world's largest epigenetic dataset aligns with our commitment to drive discovery in healthcare and genomics. By capturing comprehensive methylation data, we aim to open new doors for understanding disease, especially cancer, and ultimately enable more personalised, effective treatments for patients," he said.</p>

<p>Epigenetics is the emerging study of how inheritable traits, such as the risk of developing a certain disease, can emerge and change without actual changes in our DNA code, but rather as a result of modifications that change how our genes are expressed. These modifications can arise randomly, but also in response to environmental factors like smoking or UV exposure.</p>

<p>According to the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), put simply, if our DNA is the instructions in the cookbook, our epigenome is the chef; different chefs will interpret the cooking method in their own way, and as a result, the meal produced will be different.</p>

<p>"Diseases like cancer and dementia have brought heartache to every family in the country. By bringing government, the NHS (National Health Service), researchers and leading businesses together in partnership, we can transform our understanding of these conditions," said Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle.</p>

<p>Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said the government's '10 Year Health Plan' wants to shift the focus of healthcare from sickness to prevention, to tackle the root causes of diseases such as cancer and dementia.</p>

<p>"We will marry the care and compassion of the NHS with the ingenuity of our country's leading scientific minds, to develop new cutting-edge treatments and technologies, and make our NHS fit for the future," he said.</p>

<p>For the UK Biobank Epigenetics Project, Oxford Nanopore Technologies will use its pioneering technology to conduct genetic sequencing of 50,000 samples from UK Biobank - the world's most advanced source of data for health research.</p>

<p>This work is expected to deliver the world's first "comprehensive dataset of epigenetic modification in the human genome", dubbed a potentially game-changing resource for health researchers worldwide.</p>

<p>According to DSIT, recent studies have shown that epigenetics can play a major role in uncovering cancer's underlying causes, enabling more targeted treatments and improved patient care by addressing the non-inherited factors driving tumour progression and resistance.</p>

<p>This could pave the way to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for patients, giving hope to the millions of people who live with conditions like these.</p>

<p>Professor Naomi Allen, Chief Scientist at UK Biobank, explained: "Our lifestyle and environment can cause chemical changes to our DNA, which can contribute to disease by altering the ways genes tell the body which proteins to produce.</p>

<p>By understanding these chemical changes, known as epigenetics, we can learn why some people fall ill and others don't, even when they share the same genes.</p>

<p>"Right now, researchers only have small amounts of epigenetic data to study - this project will create a dataset unlike anything else in the world. It is orders of magnitude bigger, and because of the technology, the data will be much more detailed. Combining epigenetic data with the existing genetic, imaging, proteomic and lifestyle data that UK Biobank holds for our participants, will lead to a much better understanding of how diseases develop in mid- to old age."</p>

<p>Oxford Nanopore is hailed as one of the UK's most successful spinout companies, having been founded at Oxford University in 2005.</p>

<p>The latest work will utilise the company's novel sequencing technology, which uniquely analyses a wide range of epigenetic changes during the DNA sequencing process.</p>

<p>The project will see them continue to improve the insights from their data and translate these into impact for NHS patients in the country.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

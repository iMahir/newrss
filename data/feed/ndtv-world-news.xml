       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Ministry on Friday termed as fake a 'secretly issued memo' that has surfaced on social media and that falsely attempts to link Indian diplomats abroad with violent crimes.</p>

<p>No such memo has been issued by the Government of India, the External Affairs Ministry said.</p>

<p>"The said GoI communication is fake," the External Publicity and Public Diplomacy Division (XP Division), of the Ministry of External Affairs said.</p>

<p>The April 2023 dated fake memo purportedly from former Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra asks Indian diplomats to "cultivate" Indian diaspora groups in Canada "as a vital force in the street confrontations with Sikh extremists".</p>

<p>It goes on to mention names of various groupings of the diaspora including the Indo-Canada Association (ICA), Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce (ICCC), TiE Silicon Valley (TiE SV), and USIBC amongst others.</p>

<p>This comes amid the ongoing India-Canada standoff over India's allegations that Canada acts as a safe haven for Khalistani separatists. Last week devotees and other people were attacked at the premises of a Hindu temple in Brampton, Ontario. India has condemned the violence and urged Canada to provide security to Indian diplomats.</p>

<p>Last month, India "strongly" rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were "persons of interest" in Nijjar's killing and termed it as "preposterous imputations" and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government.</p>

<p>Following this, then High Commissioner Verma and five other diplomats were recalled by New Delhi.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada soured after Mr Trudeau alleged in the Canadian Parliament last year that he has "credible allegations" of India's hand in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<p>India denied all the allegations, calling them "absurd" and "motivated" and has accused Canada of giving space to extremist and anti-India elements in their country.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed outside a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince William has described the past year in which his wife Catherine and his father, Britain's head of state King Charles III, each battled cancer as "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life.</p>

<p>The heir to the British throne was speaking to reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace in February announced that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.</p>

<p>The following month his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, 42, revealed that she too had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

<p>"Honestly, it's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life," William said.</p>

<p>"So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."</p>

<p>Both Charles and Catherine have since made limited returns to public duties, although Charles is still undergoing treatment.</p>

<p>Catherine said in September that she had completed her chemotherapy and was looking forward to undertaking more engagements "when I can".</p>

<p>"I'm so proud of my wife, I'm proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done," William added.</p>

<p>"But from a personal family point of view, it's been, yeah, it's been brutal," he said.</p>

<p>This year's awards ceremony for William's Earthshot prize was held in Cape Town on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The initiative honours projects seeking novel solutions to the challenges facing the world's nature and climate.</p>

<p>William is also committed to a five-year programme, Homewards, launched by his philanthropic foundation to tackle homelessness in the UK.</p>

<p>When told he appeared relaxed, William said he "couldn't be less relaxed this year".</p>

<p>"It's more a case of just crack on and you've got to keep going," he said.</p>

<p>"I enjoy my work and I enjoy pacing myself, and keeping sure that I have got time for my family too," he added.</p>

<p>In addition to health problems, the royal family has this year faced continuing tensions surrounding William's estranged brother Harry.</p>

<p>Harry's ties with his family have been increasingly fraught since he and wife Meghan quit royal life and moved to California in 2020.</p>

<p>William and Harry used to be close -- a bond that was forged with the death of their mother Princess Diana in 1997. But according to British media reports, they have not spoken to each other in two years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab banned entry to many public spaces from Friday, including parks and zoos, as it sought to protect people from severe air pollution in parts of the eastern province.</p>

<p>The provincial capital Lahore has been engulfed in a thick, smoky haze this week and was consistently rated the world's most polluted city by Swiss group IQAir in its live rankings, prompting the closure of schools and work-from-home mandates.</p>

<p>The Punjab government's Friday order placed a "complete ban on public entry in all parks ... zoos, playgrounds, historical places, monuments, museums and joy/playlands" until November 17 in areas including Lahore.</p>

<p>Many parts of South Asia suffer severe pollution as temperatures drop each winter and cold, heavy air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from stubble burning - the illegal practice of burning crop waste to quickly clear fields.</p>

<p>Punjab last week blamed toxic air wafting in from neighbouring India - where air quality has also reached hazardous levels - for the particularly high pollution this year.</p>

<p>IQAir rated Delhi the world's second most polluted city on Friday, with government data indicating that farm fires in the neighbouring farming states of Punjab and Haryana were among the major contributors.</p>

<p>To discourage the practice which has been lower this year, India's federal government doubled fines imposed on violators on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Farmers with less than two acres of land will now have to pay 5,000 rupees ($60) for violations. Those owning between two and five acres will pay 10,000 rupees and farmers with more than five acres will pay 30,000 rupees, the environment ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump has clocked a significant victory in the US elections, setting up his mandate to drive into power by January. Hours after his victory was clear, the Taliban-led interim government in Kabul released a carefully worded statement online that reflected its attempts to formalise its diplomatic presence on the regional and global stage, and, by extension, market its political reality as the sole source of power and governance in Kabul. The biggest goal for the Taliban right now is to achieve international legitimacy. To some extent, it has managed to do so. While the drama of the US elections was still unfolding, Indian officials were already in Kabul to continue what is a contested, difficult, yet critical engagement with the Taliban. This visit included a first meeting with the acting defence minister of the Islamic Emirate, Mullah Yaqoob, who is also Taliban founder Mullah Omar's eldest son. India has a strong history of people-to-people ties with Afghanistan and maintenance of the same remains a top priority despite initial hiccups over visa allocations and allowing access to Afghans after 2021.</p>

<h2><strong>A Complex Statement</strong></h2>

<p>The Taliban's statement stopped short of congratulating Trump on his victory (ideologically, as per their interpretation of Sharia, democracy is not recognised by the group), but it did express hope that a pragmatic approach would be taken towards Afghanistan. It further reminded the world about the success of the Doha agreement between the Taliban and the Trump administration which had ended a two-decade-long war. Interestingly, in the statement's finale, the Taliban expressed hope that the Trump administration would work to end the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Like many in the region, the Taliban has also taken a strong stance against Israel, putting its weight behind the Palestinian cause but without expressing overt support for either Hamas or Hezbollah, both of which have been designated as terror groups in multiple countries since the mid-1990s.</p>

<p>For the Taliban, its political survival today is of paramount importance, and its fragility as a political system palpable. The Taliban hierarchy had a relationship with the Trump administration—especially with former US special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad. Trump has also previously criticised the way the Biden administration conducted the exit from the country. The President-elect in September said that the US should have retained control of the Bagram Airfield, the biggest military installation the US operated 60 km outside Kabul. He based this argument not on counter-terrorism or on the suggestion to deal with the Taliban directly, but on Afghanistan's proximity to China and the swathes of natural resources there that remain untapped. True, during his campaign, Trump did promise to “get back” Bagram. But it is still highly unlikely that the US under him will actually return to the country in any formalised capacity. It also remains to be seen how Republicans under Trump will view anti-Taliban groups, and whether support for them will find renewed interest within the party.</p>

<h2><strong>Taliban's Growing Engagement</strong></h2>

<p>Naturally, with the US out of Afghanistan now and Trump back in power at the White House, the Taliban will have to dig in deep to remain politically engaged with the US. The group has in fact made notable strides in engaging regional and international communities. It has re-marketed itself as a palatably extremist group that can take on more nefarious, violent and globally expanding groups, such as the Islamic State Khorasan (ISKP). In the Middle East, it has operationalised embassies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman, while maintaining its political anchoring in Qatar. Taliban's key ideologue, Sirajuddin Haqqani, even got a travel exemption from the United Nations Security Council and flew to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage. He also visited the UAE, which the Taliban has long had relations with.</p>

<p>The larger anxiety for the Taliban regarding a Trump presidency will come from his erratic decision-making. This is particularly important in the sense that multiple Islamist groups have taken part in the Taliban's wars over the decades, including Al Qaeda. There's a view that Al Qaeda did not announce a chief after the assassination of Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul due to the Taliban's pressure on the group.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to take a hard stand on Iran too in the coming years. This is based not only on predictions, but facts. His administration unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear agreement of 2015. In the Gulf as well, despite normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, a harder position by Washington would be welcomed. “Bad news for Tehran and its proxies. Netanyahu is the big winner. It is time to go after Iran's nuclear facilities,” said noted UAE public intellectual Abdulkhaleq Abdulla on social media shortly after Trump's victory.</p>

<h2><strong>The Iran Question</strong></h2>

<p>One of the core gains that Iran has seen over the past few years has been the exit of the US in Afghanistan. Even though Tehran does not particularly agree with or enjoy the Taliban as a neighbour, it sees functional relations with them as more palatable than American military presence on both sides of its eastern and western borders. With its ‘forward defence' strategy involving proxies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, and a relatively calm border with Afghanistan, Tehran hopes to put enough distance between itself and US forces in the region. Taliban, whether it likes it or not, is part of this design. In February, much to the Taliban's concern, Iran's special envoy to Afghanistan, Hassan Kazemi Qom, had alluded to Afghanistan being part of Iran's ‘Axis of Resistance'. Under the now-slain Quds Force chief, Qassem Soleimani, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) even recruited Shias from Afghanistan for the Fatemiyoun Brigade fighting across Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>The Taliban's options are limited. If there is a broader conflict between Israel and Iran, it will have little choice but to cosy up to, if not fully join, Tehran's positions. The group's ideological underpinnings will make it hard for the movement to have a rational or diplomatic position. Groups residing in Afghanistan may mobilise on their own merit or make the state a staging ground, as has happened before. This would be a direct challenge to the Taliban's efforts to project political neutrality.</p>

<h2><strong>A Period Of Uncertainty</strong></h2>

<p>Afghanistan remains a state in flux even if it has been able to engage with several countries, including India. It continues to deal with internal ideological battles between power centres in Kabul and Kandahar, border clashes with its former patron Pakistan, and economic vows. But the fact that it has managed to strike a deal with the US and regain control and power is also a success story, one that has been celebrated widely from Al Qaeda to Hamas.</p>

<p>While Trump's gaze is not expected to land in this part of geography anytime soon—including on Bagram—his presidency will be a test for the Taliban's political and diplomatic acumen, just as it will be for the rest of the world.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the dispatch of two planes to Amsterdam to evacuate Israeli soccer fans who were attacked by an alleged Pro-Palestinian mob on Thursday night.</p>

<p>The fans had travelled to the Netherlands to watch the Europa League match between Maccabi Tel Aviv vs Ajax Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The assault began after Maccabi Tel Aviv's loss to Ajax, with attackers targeting Israelis at various locations across the city, chanting "Free Palestine" and throwing insults in Arabic.</p>

<p>At least 10 Israelis were injured in the violence, with some reports suggesting that two individuals are still unaccounted for. Additionally, attackers stole passports from some of the targeted individuals.</p>

<p>Israel Foreign Ministry has advised its citizens in the Netherlands to remain indoors and avoid going out, while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar has asked Dutch authorities to help Israelis safely reach the airport.</p>

<p>Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir condemned the attacks, describing them as an act of anti-Semitism with Israelis being beaten, kicked, run-over, and even being thrown into the river.</p>

<p>Former Israeli special envoy Noa Tishby claimed one fan was forced to say "Free Palestine" before being released.</p>

<p>In response to the violence, Israel PM Netanyahu called for Dutch authorities to act swiftly to ensure the safety of Israelis, calling the incident "serious."</p>

<p>Former Israel PM Naftali Bennett also called for immediate action, urging authorities to act immediately to prevent further harm.</p>

<p>The Israeli Embassy in the United States stated that Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were attacked as they left the stadium.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India deserves to be included in the list of global superpowers as its economy is currently growing faster than in any other country, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.</p>

<p>Addressing the&nbsp;plenary session of the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, Putin also said Russia is developing relations with India in all directions and there is a great degree of trust in bilateral ties.</p>

<p>"India should undoubtedly added to the list of superpowers, with its billion-and-a-half population, the fastest growth among all economies in the world, ancient culture and very good prospects for further growth," he said.</p>

<p>Calling India a great country, Putin said: "We are developing relations with India in all directions. India is a great country, now the largest in terms of population: 1.5 billion people, plus 10 million every year. " He said India is leading the world in economic growth.</p>

<p>"Our vision of where and at what pace our relations will develop is based on today's realities. The volume of our cooperation is increasing many times over, every year," Putin was quoted by Russian news agency Tass as saying.</p>

<p>Putin added that the contacts between India and Russia in the security and defence sphere are developing.</p>

<p>"Look at how many types of Russian military equipment are in service with the Indian armed forces. There is a great degree of trust in this relationship. We don't just sell our weapons to India; we design them jointly," he said.</p>

<p>Putin named the BrahMos cruise missile project as an example.</p>

<p>"In fact, we made it [the missile] fit for use in three environments - in air, in sea and on land. These projects, conducted for the benefit of India's security, are ongoing," he said.</p>

<p>"This is widely known and no one has issues with that, but these projects demonstrate a high level of mutual trust and cooperation. So this what we will keep doing in the near term, and, I hope, will continue to do in the more distant future," he said.</p>

<p>Putin acknowledged certain difficulties on the border between India and China, the agency reported.</p>

<p>However, he said wise and competent people who keep the future of their nations in mind, are searching for compromises and will eventually find them.</p>

<p>"If this approach continues to gain momentum, compromises can be found, and they will be found," Putin said.</p>

<p>The ties between India and China nosedived following a fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades.</p>

<p>On October 21, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in New Delhi that an agreement had been finalised between India and China following negotiations over the past several weeks and that it would lead to a resolution of the issues that arose in 2020.</p>

<p>The agreement was firmed up on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Donald Trump first entered the White House eight years ago, rattled Chinese leaders responded to his tariffs and fiery rhetoric with force, resulting in a trade war that plunged ties between the globe's largest economies to multiyear lows.</p>

<p>This time around, Beijing has been preparing for Trump's return by deepening ties with allies, boosting self-reliance in tech, and setting aside money to prop up the economy that is now more vulnerable to fresh tariffs already threatened by Trump.</p>

<p>While some retaliation to those moves might be unavoidable, China will focus on exploiting rifts between the US and its allies, experts say, and aim to lower the temperature to help strike an early deal to cushion the blow from trade friction.</p>

<p>Zhao Minghao, international relations expert at Shanghai's Fudan University said China probably wouldn't replay the playbook from the first Trump presidency when Beijing had a very strong reaction to Trump's moves on tariffs.</p>

<p>He pointed out Chinese President Xi Jinping's message to Trump from Thursday, in which Xi called for "cooperation" and not "confrontation," emphasising "stable, sound and sustainable" relations between the two superpowers.</p>

<p>"Trump is not a stranger to Beijing at this time," Zhao told Reuters. "Beijing would respond in a measured way and make efforts to communicate with the Trump team."</p>

<p>While Chinese tech giants are now far less reliant on US imports, the economy - hit by a massive property crisis and saddled with unsustainable debt - is in a weaker position than in 2016, struggling to eke out 5% growth compared to 6.7% then.</p>

<p>To make things worse, Trump has pledged to end China's most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first term.</p>

<p>Fudan's Zhao said Beijing has this scenario gamed out but expects tariffs to come in below the level pledged on the campaign trail because "that would significantly push up the inflation in the US".</p>

<p>Still, that threat alone has unnerved producers in the world's largest exporter because China sells goods worth more than $400 billion a year to the US and hundreds of billions more in parts for products Americans buy elsewhere.</p>

<p>Li Mingjiang, a scholar at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said that as a result, the Chinese economy might require even more stimulus than the $1.4 trillion expected on Friday.</p>

<p>"It'll be a very serious blow to China's international trade that will affect jobs and government revenues," said Li. "China will probably have to come up with a much bigger stimulus package domestically."</p>

<p><strong>CHARM OFFENSIVE</strong></p>

<p>To boost global trade, China has been on a diplomatic blitz, shoring up alliances, mending fences with foes, and continuing difficult talks with the European Union, even after the bloc imposed stiff tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Last month China ended a four-year military stand-off with India on their disputed border; in August, it resolved a two-year spat with Japan over the discharge of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant; and Premier Li Qiang in June visited Australia - the first such trip in seven years.</p>

<p>Also last month, both Xi and Li attended separate summits of BRICS - which now accounts for 35% of the global economy - and the 10-state Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, as China deepens ties with the Global South.</p>

<p>"The first Trump administration did not show a lot of interest in robust engagement in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, which provided the Chinese a lot of latitude to operate in these markets largely uncontested," said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of the China-Global South Project.</p>

<p>In Europe, trade tensions with China could be counterbalanced by worries over Trump's potentially reduced role in the Ukraine war and his economic policies, creating an opening for Beijing, say some experts.</p>

<p>"China will carry on reaching out to Europeans, the British, the Australians and even the Japanese, not only to try to drive a wedge between the US and the countries of the north," said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert at Hong Kong's Baptist University.</p>

<p>"But also as part of its mission to rebalance its foreign trade in favour of the Global South," he said.</p>

<p><strong>TECH PUNCHLINE</strong></p>

<p>During the first trade war, Trump banned high-tech exports to China and sanctioned companies including China's largest chipmaker SMIC, prompting its tech sector to become domestic-focused and self-sufficient.</p>

<p>Winston Ma, a former managing director for the China Investment Corporation (CIC), China's sovereign wealth fund, said a major trigger for this shift was Trump's ban on the sale of components to Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE in 2018.</p>

<p>That was "really scary from a China perspective, so they began to prepare. It was the start of that sort of defensive thinking," added Ma.</p>

<p>Soon after, Xi urged the nation to boost self-reliance in science and tech, pushing China to build-up crucial industries including AI and space.</p>

<p>The result: Eight years ago, China had only four government procurement projects worth over $1.4 million, replacing foreign hardware and software with domestic alternatives. That number has exploded to 169 such projects this year, data show.</p>

<p>Despite these strides, chipmakers "definitely feel the tightening - these Chinese companies couldn't supply to global clients and can't have access to the latest chips," said Ma.</p>

<p>Nazak Nikakhtar, a Commerce Department official under Trump who knows his advisers, said she expected Trump to be "much more aggressive about export control policies towards China."</p>

<p>She anticipated "a significant expansion of the entity list," that restricts exports to those on it to capture affiliates and business partners of listed companies.</p>

<p>Ma, the ex-CIC executive, said the restrictions will have an impact for some time as the US expands the sanctions regime to overseas suppliers.</p>

<p>"I think the punchline is that the coming years are the most critical for this US-China tech rivalry."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year's UN climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, marks the world's 29th leadership gathering to confront global warming since the first "Conference of the Parties" in 1995.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most significant moments in the history of climate talks:</p>

<p><strong>1800s -</strong> For about 6,000 years before the industrial era, global levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) remained around 280 parts per million ("ppm"). Several European scientists begin studying how different gases trap heat, and in the 1890s Svante Arrhenius of Sweden calculates the temperature effect from doubling atmospheric CO2 levels, demonstrating how burning fossil fuels will warm the planet.</p>

<p><strong>1938 -</strong> British engineer Guy Callendar determines that global temperatures are rising in line with increasing CO2 levels, and hypothesises that the two are linked.</p>

<p><strong>1958 - </strong>American scientist Charles David Keeling starts measuring CO2 levels over Hawaii's Mauna Loa Observatory, resulting in the "Keeling Curve" graph that shows CO2 concentrations rising.</p>

<p><strong>1990 -</strong> At the UN's Second World Climate Conference, scientists highlight the risks of global warming to nature and society. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher calls for binding emissions targets.</p>

<p><strong>1992 - </strong>Countries at the Rio Earth Summit sign the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The treaty establishes the idea of "common but differentiated responsibilities," meaning developed countries must do more to tackle climate-warming emissions because they emitted the most historically.</p>

<p><strong>1995 -</strong> UNFCCC signatories hold the first "conference of parties," or COP, in Berlin, with the final document calling for legally binding emissions targets.</p>

<p><strong>1997 -</strong> At COP3 in Kyoto, Japan, parties agree to varied emissions cuts for each of the developed countries. In the United States, Senate Republicans denounce the Kyoto Protocol as "dead on arrival".</p>

<p><strong>2000 -</strong> After losing the US presidential election, Al Gore begins giving talks worldwide on climate science and policy that eventually are made into the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth. The film wins an Academy Award, while Gore and the UN climate science authority - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - receive the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

<p><strong>2001 - </strong>US President George W. Bush calls the Kyoto Protocol "fatally flawed," signaling the country's effective exit.</p>

<p><strong>2005 - </strong>The Kyoto Protocol goes into effect after Russia ratifies it, meeting a requirement for ratification by at least 55 countries accounting for at least 55% of emissions.</p>

<p><strong>2009 - </strong>COP15 talks in Copenhagen nearly collapse after wrangling over a post-Kyoto framework, with countries voting to instead "take note" of a non-binding political statement.</p>

<p><strong>2010 - </strong>COP16 in Cancun fails to set new binding emissions targets, but the Cancun Agreements establishes a Green Climate Fund to help developing countries cut emissions and adapt to the conditions of a warmer world.</p>

<p><strong>2011 - </strong>COP17 talks in Durban, South Africa, falter after China, the United States and India refuse binding emissions cuts before 2015. Delegates instead extend the Kyoto Protocol through 2017.</p>

<p><strong>2012 - </strong>As Russia, Japan and New Zealand resist new emissions targets that do not extend to developing nations, countries at COP18 in Doha extend the Kyoto Protocol through 2020.</p>

<p><strong>2013 -</strong> Atmospheric CO2 levels cross 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history.</p>

<p><strong>2015 - </strong>The global average temperature rises beyond 1 degree Celsius over the preindustrial average. The COP21 talks result in The Paris Agreement, the first pact to call for increasingly ambitious emissions pledges from both developed and developing countries. Delegates also pledge to try to keep warming to within 1.5 C (2.7 Fahrenheit).</p>

<p><strong>2017 -</strong> US President Donald Trump pledges to remove the United States from the Paris treaty, which happens in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>2018 - </strong>Teen activist Greta Thunberg captures global attention while protesting outside Swedish parliament, and over time, rallies youths to join weekly climate protests worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>2020 - </strong>The annual COP is postponed amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>2021 - </strong>Newly elected US President Joe Biden rejoins the Paris Agreement. Later at COP26, the Glasgow Pact sets a goal of using less coal and resolves some rules for trading carbon credits to offset emissions.</p>

<p><strong>2022 - </strong>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that the world is at risk of catastrophic and irreversible climate change. Later that year, COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, agrees to form a Loss and Damage Fund for costly climate disasters, but does little to address the emissions fuelling such disasters.</p>

<p><strong>2023 -</strong> At COP28 in the oil-producing United Arab Emirates, countries agree to transition away from fossil fuel use.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Union Petroleum and Natural Gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri said oil will remain a key part of the world's energy supply for years to come.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's decision to buy oil from Russia amid global uncertainties helped prevent a potential spike in global oil prices, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in a recent interview with CNN.</p>

<p>Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson on the sidelines of the annual energy industry event ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, Union minister Puri explained that if the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/indias-russian-oil-imports-rise-11-7-in-sept-from-aug-data-shows-6801145">Indian government hadn't bought Russian oil</a>, global oil prices would have gone up to 200 dollars for everyone.</p>

<p>Oil will remain a key part of the world's energy supply for years to come, he said.</p>

<p>Mr Puri told CNN, "Earlier I said I hope there will be a reduction in oil price. Today I'm more confident that there will be.".</p>

<p>"By 2026, when more energy is available in the market, As a student of the situation, I think that the likelihood of prices remaining stable and coming down are higher," Mr&nbsp;Puri said.</p>

<p>On being asked <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/us-urges-india-to-maintain-implementation-of-russian-oil-price-cap-5370773">why India reduced oil imports from Russia</a> in October by around 10 per cent, Mr Puri explained that happened because of competitive oil rates in the market. "There are other people willing to supply at the same competitive rate because the OPEC position is they don't deal with price. There's healthy competition going on. If you don't get it from one, you get it from someone else", he said.</p>

<p>On being questioned whether the reduction in Russian oil imports was a strategic decision, Mr&nbsp;Puri said, "These are oil decisions taken in the marketplace. When we faced February 22 there were 13 million barrels of Russian oil on the market suddenly if that oil had gone off the market and India had decided to shift its 5 million barrels to say suppliers in the Gulf, the price of oil would have gone up to 200 a barrel. So I think we did everybody a favour".</p>

<p>He said technological changes such as green hydrogen and the transition to cleaner energy will change the global oil demand landscape in five years.</p>

<p>Mr&nbsp;Puri also took to his X account to share details and said, "India did the entire world a favour by buying Russian oil because if we had not done so, the global oil prices would have skyrocketed to USD 200/barrel. Russian oil was never under any sanctions and there was only a price cap, which Indian entities also followed."</p>

<p>He also pointed out that some "ill-informed commentators" wanting to put restrictions on India when European and Asian countries had also engaged in significant energy purchases from Russia.</p>

<p>"Let us not forget that while some ill-informed commentators talked about putting restrictions on India, many other European and Asian nations bought much more crude oil, diesel, LNG, rare earth minerals worth billions of dollars from Russia. We will continue to buy energy from whoever offers the best rates to our oil companies" Mr Puri wrote.</p>

<p>The union minister also noted in his X post, "We need to ensure steady availability, affordability and sustainability of energy for our 7 crore citizens who visit a petrol pump every day. That's our top priority. India is the only major consumer where fuel prices have come down significantly in the last three years despite unprecedented global price increases in other nations".</p>

<p>India is the third largest oil consumer in the world, as estimated by the International Energy Agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A virtual 'nikah' was solemnised in Himachal Pradesh with the groom in Turkiye and the bride in Mandi. The marriage ceremony of Adnan Muhammad, a resident of Bilaspur, had to be performed virtually as the company for which he works in Turkiye refused to grant him leave, his family members said.</p>

<p>Also, the ailing grandfather of the bride insisted that she get married at the earliest, they added.</p>

<p>The family members of the groom and the bride agreed to a virtual 'nikah' and the barat from Bilaspur reached Mandi on Sunday. The marriage was held on Monday.</p>

<p>The couple connected through video calling and a qazi performed the rituals with the duo saying "qubool hai" thrice.</p>

<p>Akram Mohammad, the uncle of the girl said the wedding was made possible only due to the advanced technology.</p>

<p>Last year in July, Ashish Singha from Kotgarh in Shimla and Shivani Thakur from Bhuntar in Kullu tied the knot through video-conferencing as the barat could not reach its destination due to landslides and flash floods.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge again rejected a bid to hold Mark Zuckerberg individually liable in two dozen lawsuits accusing Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies of addicting children to their products.</p>

<p>US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who is overseeing the cases, sided with the Meta chief executive officer on Thursday, finding that a revised complaint still wasn't legally sufficient to proceed. The decision dismisses <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/internet/news/meta-bans-accounts-tracking-private-jets-mark-zuckerberg-elon-musk-6856057">Zuckerberg</a> as an individual defendant without affecting claims against Meta as a company.</p>

<p>Lawsuits filed on behalf of young people have alleged that Zuckerberg was repeatedly warned by Meta employees that Instagram and Facebook weren't safe for children but ignored the findings and chose not to share them publicly.</p>

<p>Holding CEOs of large companies personally responsible for wrongdoing is generally difficult because of a corporate law tradition of shielding executives from liability.</p>

<p>"While possible that discovery may reveal a more active participation and direction by Zuckerberg in Meta's alleged fraudulent concealment, the allegations before the court are insufficient to meet the standard for corporate-officer liability," Rogers said in her order.</p>

<p>The cases naming <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/cryptocurrency/news/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-usd-201-billion-fortune-6684341">Zuckerberg</a> are a small subset of a collection of more than 1,000 suits in state and federal courts in California by families and public school districts against Meta along with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok, and Snap Inc., owner of the Snapchat platform. Rogers and a state judge in Los Angeles have allowed some claims to proceed against the companies while dismissing others.</p>

<p>The case is In Re Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, 22-md-03047, US District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists investigating a 400-year-old grave in northern Poland have found the remains of a young woman buried with a sickle across her neck and a padlock on her left big toe. Legends and burial customs of the time reveal that people believed such measures would protect them against any potential supernatural acts.</p>

<p>Named "Zosia" by locals, the woman's remains were first unearthed in 2022. Since then, scientists have been analysing her skeleton to understand her background and why she was buried in a way that suggests fears of vampirism or demonic reanimation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, Swedish forensic artist Oscar Nilsson recreated her facial features using a 3D-printed model of her skull. “He added so much feeling, so much emotion,” Dariusz Polinski, professor at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Poland told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/07/science/vampire-woman-facial-reconstruction-poland/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>, calling the reconstruction “mind-blowing.”</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/ueek4a3_anti-vampire-grave-poland_625x300_08_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Further studies on Zosia's skeletal remains have offered clues to her life and possible hardships. Analysis revealed she was likely between 18 and 20 years old and may have suffered from health issues such as severe headaches, fainting spells, and a chest tumour. These conditions were not the cause of her death, which remains unknown. More tests are underway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fine silver and gold threads found in her grave suggest Zosia may have belonged to a high-status family, perhaps from southern Scandinavia. Mr Polinski said that during this era, Poland and Sweden were engaged in conflict.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/j1a1uqu8_anti-vampire-grave-poland_625x300_08_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The burial methods – initially a padlock on her toe, later the addition of the sickle – were typical “anti-vampire” practices of the time. Mr Polinski explained, “Initially she was buried in a coffin in a natural position, with the head towards the west and on a pillow and the padlock on her toe.” But superstitious locals might have reopened her grave, disturbed her remains, and placed the sickle across her neck, likely after a local misfortune was attributed to her spirit.</p>

<p>The burial site, which archaeologists began exploring in 2005, is believed to have served as a cemetery for around four generations in the 17th century, although no written records exist. The team continues to explore the site, where other unsettling graves, including that of a child buried face down and a pregnant woman, suggest a broader ritualistic pattern.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Donald Trump's landslide win in Tuesday's US elections, shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group surged, adding nearly $300 million to the President-elect's fortune. Trump Media shares rose almost 8 percent by midday, reaching just under $37, following a premarket surge that briefly sent shares above $40, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/11/06/donald-trumps-net-worth-adds-nearly-300-million-after-election-win-as-trump-media-shares-surge/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">Forbes</a> reported.</p>

<p>This bump has pushed the value of Trump's approximately 57 percent stake – around 114.75 million shares – in the media company up by $290 million, now totalling $4.1 billion. The uptick in trading comes on the heels of a volatile Tuesday session when shares initially soared by over 18 percent to $40.74 before slipping back and eventually closing down by 1 percent.</p>

<p>Despite this market boost, Trump Media reported a $19.2 million loss for its third quarter, with revenues falling 5.6 percent year-over-year. Nonetheless, October was a banner month for the company, with shares jumping 119 percent, peaking at $54.68 – the highest since June.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's net worth is estimated at $6.3 billion, according to recent evaluations by Forbes. His fortune, tied heavily to Trump Media's fluctuating stock value, briefly surpassed $8 billion earlier this year amid high trading volatility. The company, which went public through a reverse merger, has seen its stock rise and fall in response to Trump's campaign activities, including significant shifts after debates with US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Since going public, Trump Media has been closely aligned with Trump's political trajectory. Valued at nearly $10 billion in May, the stock saw a dramatic dip below $11, risking restrictions on Trump's ability to liquidate shares. In recent weeks, however, the stock, pushed by election-betting markets favouring Trump's campaign, rebounded significantly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 17-year-old student in China hailed as a "genius" for her score in a maths competition cheated, competition organisers said. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, came into the limelight in June after securing 12th rank in the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition's preliminaries. She was the first finalist since the contest began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school. The majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The competition results turned Ms Ping into an overnight sensation, with many calling her a "prodigy" on social media, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3285002/teen-chinese-maths-genius-was-helped-teacher-ace-global-contest-probe-finds" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>. However, the attention also prompted scrutiny as other contestants questioned her scores and maths competence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a joint letter sent to the organising committee in June, other finalists alleged that the 17-year-old had made "several apparent writing mistakes" in an online video and that she "seemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols". They demanded an investigation into Ms Ping. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the event's organising committee said an investigation found that Ms Ping achieved the results with her teacher's help. It said that the teenager had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself. "This has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise," organisers said in a statement, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87xj8d0131o" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Ping's school, Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, also confirmed that Wang Ruihui, the teacher of Jiang Ping, had helped the 17-year-old and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers' awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The competition committee apologised, acknowledging shortcomings in the management of the event and pledging improvement, the outlet reported. The committee also announced its winners on Sunday, recognising 86 participants for their achievements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, Sunday's revelation sparked a wave of criticism of Ms Ping and her teacher. "Mathematics is objective and cold. You can cheat for once and fool all the people who know little of mathematics, but you cannot fool all of the mathematicians in the game," one user said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, some users spoke up for the teenager, arguing that the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher. "Jiang Ping is not innocent, that's without question. But who are the worst parties in this? The adults brought this child along to do a bad deed, and let her suffer all the consequences," said one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Even if the whole thing was faked, Jiang Ping was not the mastermind behind it. She should not be burned at the stake," commented another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian news outlet has raised concerns over press freedom after it was blocked by Canada for airing an interview with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and the press conference of Australian Senator Penny Wong. Responding to the ban, The Australia Today's managing editor Jitarth Jai Bharadwaj said the move has made it difficult for the team, but they are undeterred by such obstacles.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's Australia visit ended Thursday, during which he met Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and co-chaired the 15th Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue with Ms Wong. Canada blocked the outlet's social media pages soon after it held a press conference with Mr Jaishankar and Ms Wong. The move coming amid diplomatic tensions between New Delhi and Ottawa, sparked a strong response from India, who called out their "hypocrisy" towards freedom of speech.</p>

<p>The Australia Today responded to the ban this morning, stating that they will be undeterred by such obstacles.</p>

<p>"The recent restriction and ban on our interview with Indian External Affairs Minister @DrSJaishankar and the press conference with Australian Foreign Minister @SenatorWong on #socialmedia, under orders from the Canadian government, have been difficult for our team and those who value free and open #journalism," said Mr Bharadwaj's statement.</p>

<p>The Australia Today vowed to continue advocating for an open and inclusive media landscape as it thanked the fraternity for being a beacon of strength amid the restrictions. "We remain steadfast in our mission to bring important stories and voices to the public, undeterred by these obstacles," said managing editor Mr Bharadwaj in the statement.</p>

<p>Besides concerns over press freedom, the ban also turned out to be the latest point of friction between India and Canada that threatens to worsen their diplomatic tensions. On being asked about the matter yesterday, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the social media handles and pages of the "diaspora outlet" have been blocked and are not available for viewers in Canada.</p>

<p>"We were surprised. It looks strange to us. But, nonetheless, these are actions that yet again highlight the hypocrisy of Canada towards freedom of speech. In his media interactions, the External Affairs Minister spoke about three things: a pattern of Canada making allegations without evidence, the surveillance of Indian diplomats - which he termed unacceptable - and the political space being given in Canada to anti-India elements. So you can draw your conclusions from that on why the Australia Today channel was blocked," said the top diplomat.</p>

<p>India-Canada's ties strained after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed Indian agents for the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The charge was trashed by India as baseless. Last month, the relationship hit a new low with Canada terming the Indian High Commissioner as a "person of interest" in the killing. The move saw India withdrawing some top diplomats from the country while dismissing the charge as "ludicrous".</p>

<p>Last week, India flagged a violation of diplomatic conventions by the Canadian government for putting some of its consular officials under audio and video surveillance. Canada could not hide behind the technicalities to justify its harassment, the government had said while lodging a protest with the Canadian government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 77-year-old slice of wedding cake from the 1947 royal wedding of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip has just been sold for £2,200 (around Rs 2.40 lakh) at an auction. Described as a “very rare slice,” the cake has remained preserved since the couple's marriage on November 20, 1947. But it no longer appears suitable for consumption.</p>

<p>The slice, kept in its original packaging, features a small box with a silver emblem of the then-Princess Elizabeth. Inside, the box holds an intricate doily, which has helped preserve the cake for over 70 years. The original recipient of this specific slice was Marion Polson, a housekeeper at HolyroodHouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, who received it as a gift from Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>According to auction house <a href="https://www.reemandansie.com/news-item/slice-of-queens-wedding-cake-sells-for-2k/" rel="nofollow,noindex">Reeman Dansie</a>, Marion Polson was the housekeeper at the Palace of Holyroodhouse from 1931 to 1969.</p>

<p>Alongside the cake, Polson received a personal letter from Elizabeth, thanking her for the wedding gift. “We are both enchanted with the dessert service; the different flowers and the beautiful colouring will, I know, be greatly admired by all who see it. This is a present which we shall use constantly, and whenever we do we shall think of the kindness and good wishes for our happiness which it represents,” reads the typewritten note, signed by the future queen.</p>

<p>“The Wedding of H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth to Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece R.N. on 20th November 1947, (later H.M. Queen Elizabeth II and H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh), a rare piece of wedding cake in original box with presentation card and original packaging addressed to 'Miss Polson, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh, Scotland' Postmarked 21 April 1948. Sold with a printed letter from H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth thanking the Royal Household Staff for their Wedding Present,” the auction house wrote on its website.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/07/style/cake-elizabeth-philip-wedding-sale-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>, the original wedding cake was an elaborate creation, standing nine feet tall and weighing 500 pounds (around 227 kg). Decorated with coats of arms from both families, it also featured sugar sculptures representing the couple's favourite activities. The massive cake provided 2,000 slices for wedding guests, with additional portions distributed to charities and organisations. One tier was saved for the christening of their first child, Prince Charles.</p>

<p>While a few pieces of the cake have been preserved and auctioned over the years, they remain highly sought after by royal memorabilia collectors. In 2013, another slice from the 1947 cake was auctioned by Christie's, fetching £1,750 (around Rs 1.91 lakh).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans see immigration as the most pressing issue for President-elect Donald Trump to address, and a large majority believe he will order mass deportations of people living in the US illegally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed Thursday found.</p>

<p>But respondents to the two-day poll, conducted in the hours after the Republican clinched his election victory, were divided about his plans to expel large numbers of people.</p>

<p>Asked what Trump's top priority should be in the first 100 days following his Jan. 20 inauguration, 25% of respondents said he should prioritize immigration, a much larger share than any other issue. Some 14% of respondents said Trump should focus on income inequality, 12% said taxes and smaller shares picked healthcare, crime, jobs or the environment.</p>

<p>Some 82% of respondents in the poll considered it likely that Trump would order mass deportations, including similar shares of Democrats and Republicans. Many said they are concerned about the expected policy, including 82% of Democrats and 40% of independents. About nine in 10 Republicans said they were not concerned Trump could order mass deportations.</p>

<p>Trump campaigned to return to the White House vowing a vast immigration crackdown, including a promise to deport record numbers of immigrants in an operation Trump's running mate JD Vance estimated could remove 1 million people per year.</p>

<p>During his campaign, Trump frequently called attention to crimes reportedly committed by immigrants lacking legal status, though numerous studies have shown immigrants do not commit crimes at higher rates than native-born Americans.</p>

<p>Trump backers - including some who could enter his second administration - anticipate the Republican will call on everyone from the US military to diplomats overseas to turn the promise of mass deportations into reality. The effort would include cooperation with Republican-led states and using federal funding as leverage against resistant jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Immigrant advocates warn that Trump's deportation effort would be costly, divisive and inhumane.</p>

<p>Trump told NBC News in an interview on Thursday that he would carry out his promise of mass deportations regardless of cost, saying, "It's not a question of a price tag. It's not - really, we have no choice."</p>

<p>Americans are divided over the possible mechanics of mass deportations, such as whether they might involve detention camps.</p>

<p>Some 58% of Republicans in the poll - but only 15% of Democrats - agreed with a statement the immigrants without authorization to be in the country should be "arrested and put in detention camps while awaiting deportation hearings." About 75% of Democrats opposed rounding up immigrants in that manner, as did 31% of Republicans.</p>

<p>Trump plans to use a 1798 wartime statute known as the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged gang members, an action that would almost certainly be challenged in court.</p>

<p>The law has been used three times, according to the Brennan Center for Justice: the War of 1812, World War One and World War Two, when it was employed to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent.</p>

<p>The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,471 adults nationwide and the results had a margin of error of 3 percentage points for all respondents and 5 points for Republicans and Democrats.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people were urged to flee an out-of-control wildfire burning around communities near Los Angeles on Thursday, with scores of homes already lost to the fast-moving flames.</p>

<p>Fierce seasonal winds had cast embers up to three miles (five kilometers) from the seat of the fire around Camarillo, with new spots burning on hillsides, farmland and in residential areas.</p>

<p>The Mountain Fire grew rapidly from a standing start early Wednesday, and by the following day had consumed 20,485 acres (8,290 hectares), with towering flames leaping unpredictably and sending residents scrambling.</p>

<p>The fire was only five percent contained as of Thursday evening, authorities said, although wind patterns were expected to favor firefighters through the night.</p>

<p>"We've been up all night watching this. I haven't slept," Erica Preciado told one local broadcaster as she drove her family out of the danger zone.</p>

<p>"We're just trying to get a safe place. I didn't even know what to take. I just have everything in my car," she said, gesturing tearfully to her packed vehicle.</p>

<p>Authorities said that based on initial inspections, at least 132 homes had been completely destroyed, with 88 more damaged by the fires.</p>

<p>One man told broadcaster KTLA he and his family had fled their home of 27 years, finding out later that it had been destroyed.</p>

<p>"It's all gone," he said, his voice catching. "It's all gone."</p>

<p>Dawn Deleon described how she had only moments to flee with her six dogs.</p>

<p>"We watched the neighbors' houses burning and figured it was time to get out of there," she said.</p>

<p>"We left and were just gone for five minutes and went back to get my phone, and the house was already on fire and gone."</p>

<p><strong>Winds to abate</strong></p>

<p>Ventura County Fire Department officials said they were throwing resources at the blaze in an area that is home to 30,000 people, but that changing wind patterns meant there was hope the fire could die down in the coming days.</p>

<p>"Winds are subsiding over the lower elevations while remaining still gusty over the higher elevations," said Ariel Cohen of the National Weather Service.</p>

<p>"By the time we get to 11:00 am (on Friday) the winds will further subside across the region, and we are not expecting any red flag warnings to be in effect for the area."</p>

<p>On Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom visited communities impacted by the fire and declared a state of emergency in the worst-affected area of Ventura County.</p>

<p>There, crews on the ground had defended homes with hose lines working alongside bulldozers that were trying to remove fuels.</p>

<p>Helicopter pilots worked throughout the night on Wednesday dropping water, said Ventura County fire captain Trevor Johnson. That was expected to continue on Thursday night.</p>

<p>Hoses ran dry for crews battling the flames at one point late Wednesday, Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said.</p>

<p>He said hundreds of fire trucks had been pumping water all night, putting a strain on resources.</p>

<p>"We have been fighting fire actively now for 26 hours, and we found all of those fire trucks hooked up to all of those hydrants, and we drained water systems down," he told reporters.</p>

<p>That affected supplies higher up hillsides, and forced crews to shuttle water up to the blazes.</p>

<p>He said while it was not a common problem, it is known to happen in major incidents.</p>

<p>"It's normal enough that we plan for it, so it's impactful, but it will be mitigated," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Very dangerous'</strong></p>

<p>At least 400 homes had been evacuated, Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff said, adding that 250 residents had chosen to stay behind.</p>

<p>"I urge everyone to stay out of the areas that are impacted. The fire is still very dangerous," he said.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but meteorologists had raised a Red Flag Warning and a rare Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) warning in the area, indicating dangerous fire conditions.</p>

<p>They said two years of above-average rainfall had sparked abundant growth of vegetation, which was now all bone-dry after a long, hot summer.</p>

<p>Electricity companies had cut power to tens of thousands of customers in the area -- a common strategy in California during high winds in a bid to reduce the risk of new fires from toppled power lines.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As U.S. election exit polls began to point to a second presidency for Donald Trump, many Americans were already looking for another kind of exit: moving abroad.</p>

<p>Google searches for "move to Canada" surged 1,270% in the 24 hours after U.S. East Coast polls closed on Tuesday, company data shows. Similar searches about moving to New Zealand climbed nearly 2,000% while those for Australia jumped 820%.</p>

<p>Late Wednesday evening on the US East Coast, Google searches about emigrating were hitting all-time highs for all three countries, according to a Google official.</p>

<p>The search giant does not provide absolute figures but data from the Immigration New Zealand website showed the site logged some 25,000 new U.S. users on Nov. 7, compared to 1,500 for the same day last year.</p>

<p>Some immigration lawyers are also being inundated with queries.</p>

<p>"Every half hour there is a new email enquiry," said Evan Green, managing partner at Canada's oldest immigration law firm, Green and Spiegel.</p>

<p>The sudden enthusiasm for emigration echoes the interest in moving abroad seen after Trump's 2016 victory. This time, however, the Republican's re-election has followed a particularly divisive campaign in which nearly three-quarters of U.S. voters said they felt American democracy was under threat, according to Edison Research exit polls.</p>

<p>Many Americans are also worried that his presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as race, gender, what and how children are taught, and reproductive rights.</p>

<p>"Trump is obviously the impetus, but it's also societal. The majority of Americans voted for him and some people don't necessarily feel comfortable living in that kind of society anymore. People are afraid they are going to lose freedoms," said Green.</p>

<p>In a Reddit group dedicated to those leaving the U.S., called "r/AmerExit," hundreds shared suggestions about ideal destinations and tips for getting visas and jobs. Some users said they feared for their country, their safety, or both after Trump's election.</p>

<p>Even before the election, those fears were increasingly cited by Americans looking to emigrate to Canada, according to Heather Bell, an immigration consultant at Vancouver law firm Bell Alliance.</p>

<p>Few, however, manage to follow through, said Bell.</p>

<p>"Immigrating to Canada is not easy, especially now with the government reducing the numbers of temporary and permanent migrants coming to Canada," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has positioned itself as a "transition" fuel to replace highly polluting coal. While LNG burns cleaner than coal, its climate impact is darkened by energy-intensive production and frequent leaks from gas fields.</p>

<p><strong>Why is LNG so popular?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Global demand for natural gas is expected to rise by 2.5 percent in 2024 to a record level, mostly driven by LNG.</p>

<p>European nations have been big importers to replace Russian gas while Asian nations need it to fuel their growing economies.</p>

<p>Natural gas needs expensive pipelines to be developed from production sites to distribution networks.</p>

<p>Once it is chilled to -163 degrees Celsius however, it liquifies and its volume shrinks by 600 times.</p>

<p>This makes it feasible to transport by special ships and it can then be turned back into gas and injected into existing distribution networks.</p>

<p><strong>Leaks</strong></p>

<p>The oil and gas industry often points out that gas-fired power stations emit 2.5 times fewer emissions than their coal counterparts.</p>

<p>Scientists and climate activists say that not only smokestack emissions need to be taken into account, but the entire production and distribution chain.</p>

<p>And that involves a lot of energy for LNG.</p>

<p>"You have to expend so much energy to extract the gas from the ground, to liquefy the gas, to transport it," Rystad Energy analyst Patrick King.</p>

<p>Another problem is the industry is notorious for leaks: from the fields, pipelines and processing facilities. And natural gas is mostly methane, which is much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2: 86 times as powerful during the first 20 years it is in the atmosphere and 28 times more powerful a century.</p>

<p>"Why lock yourself into another emitter fuel?" said Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).</p>

<p>"Do the transition directly," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Variable carbon footprints</strong></p>

<p>King said LNG produces more emissions than natural gas transported through pipelines.</p>

<p>Some studies indicate that its climate impact could be worse than coal.</p>

<p>A Cornell University study published last month calculated that LNG produced in the United States had a carbon footprint a third higher than coal when production and transport were included, over a 20-year horizon.</p>

<p>Even over a longer period -- 100 years -- its carbon footprint remained the same or higher than that of coal.</p>

<p>But a study by Rystad Energy published earlier this year concluded the opposite. It found that on average, electricity produced with LNG had a lower carbon footprint than carbon when the entire production chain was taken into account.</p>

<p>It also said that even LNG produced in America and shipped across the Pacific to generate electricity could have a carbon footprint just half of the cleanest coal-fired plant.</p>

<p>However, the report did also note considerable differences between different gas fields in reducing methane leaks, which affects their climate impact.</p>

<p>Jonathan Stern, a researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Study, said it was extremely complicated to determine whether LNG or coal was worse for the climate.</p>

<p>"It's a subject where you need to be confident that you've got data which is independent and verified," he said.</p>

<p>"And mostly we don't have that data."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

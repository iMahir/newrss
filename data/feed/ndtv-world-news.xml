       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nine immigrants from various countries, including Lebanon, Germany, Taiwan, and Mexico, took the oath to become American citizens in a scenic outdoor naturalisation ceremony overlooking Los Angeles, with the iconic Hollywood sign as their backdrop.</p>

<p>As the US presidential election draws near, many of these new citizens are eager to exercise their right to vote, with some already knowing who they'll support.</p>

<p>Chia Hsin Tsai, a 33-year-old marketing manager from Taiwan, is one of them. She's lived in the US for 11 years and applied for citizenship in March. "Becoming a part of the country that I'm living in makes me feel special," she said, though she didn't disclose who she'll vote for.</p>

<p>Floriane Turcat, a 37-year-old French actress, was inspired by American movies and TV shows. She's now registered to vote in California and plans to support Vice President Kamala Harris, citing concerns for women's rights and reproductive rights. She said, “I want to be part of the political movement of this country,” and added, “Even though California is a Democratic state, I want to be able to participate and have a voice and state that it's important for me. I want to stand for my rights.”</p>

<p>Phoenix De Los Angeles Lopez Daal, a 31-year-old set dresser from Venezuela, hopes to vote for former President Donald Trump. He is of the opinion that there should be freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to own and carry arms.</p>

<p>Dennis Beier, a 46-year-old German film producer, wants to vote for Harris to protect democracy, especially after the January 6 US Capitol attack. Beier has always seen the US as a land of freedom and opportunity. “I just want to keep like this whole democracy thing intact,” Beier stated. “And people need to respect when they lose, that's part of it, and if you can't, then you should not be in politics.”</p>

<p>The US presidential election is heating up, with just days to go until November 5th. Harris and Trump are neck and neck in a fiercely contested battle for the White House.&nbsp;These individuals, along with tens of millions of other Americans, will shape the country's future with their votes.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's leadership and allies are bracing for what they would regard as a dreadful outcome of the imminent US presidential election: A return to power of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Opinion polls suggest the Republican Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris remain locked in a close contest. But Iranian leaders and their regional allies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen are concerned that Trump could well triumph on November 5 and this could spell more trouble for them.</p>

<p>Iran's main concern is the potential for Trump to empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, conduct targeted assassinations and reimpose his "maximum pressure policy" through heightened sanctions on their oil industry, according to Iranian, Arab and Western officials.</p>

<p>They anticipate that Trump, who was president in 2017-21, will exert utmost pressure on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to cave in by accepting a nuclear containment deal on terms set by himself and Israel.</p>

<p>This potential change in US leadership could have far-reaching implications for the Middle East balance of power, and might reshape Iran's foreign policy and economic prospects.</p>

<p>Analysts argue that whether the next US administration is led by Harris or Trump, Iran will lack the leverage it once held - largely due to Israel's year-old military campaign aimed at degrading the Islamic Republic's armed proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>However, Trump's stance is perceived as more detrimental to Iran due to his more automatic support for Israel, they added.</p>

<p>"Trump will either put very tough conditions on Iran or let Israel carry out targeted strikes on its nuclear facilities. He is fully endorsing a military action against Iran," Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Center think-tank, said.</p>

<p>"It's Netanyahu's dream day to have Trump back in the White House," he told Reuters.</p>

<p><strong>POISON CHALICE?</strong></p>

<p>A senior Iranian official who declined to be named told Reuters Tehran was "prepared for all scenarios. We have (for decades) consistently found ways to export oil, bypassing harsh US sanctions..., and have strengthened our ties with the rest of the world no matter who was in the White House."</p>

<p>But another Iranian official said a Trump victory would be "a nightmare. He will raise pressure on Iran to please Israel..., make sure oil sanctions are fully enforced. If so, (our) establishment will be economically paralysed."</p>

<p>In an election speech in October, Trump stated his unwillingness to go to war with Iran, but said Israel should "hit the Iranian nuclear first and worry about the rest later", in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1.</p>

<p>Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Iranian military targets, especially missile production sites, on October 26.</p>

<p>Iran's choices are limited going forward, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The reality is: Trump is going to support Netanyahu and give him the green light to do whatever he wants," said Hassan Hassan, an author and researcher on Islamic groups. "Trump is much worse (than Harris) for Iran."</p>

<p>Hassan noted that Washington has delegated a substantial share of responsibility to Israel in the conflict with Iran and its proxies, with Israel leading the way. "The US is involved enough in that it's backing Israel, may be more so than before.</p>

<p>"This time it's just things are really bad for Iran. Iran is seen as a problem by both Republicans and Democrats."</p>

<p>During her campaign, Harris called Iran a "dangerous" and "destabilising" force in the Middle East and said the US was committed to Israel's security. She said the US would work with allies to disrupt Iran's "aggressive behaviour".</p>

<p>But Trump's re-election would be a "poisoned chalice", for Khamenei, according to two regional officials.</p>

<p>If he were to reinstate stringent sanctions, Khamenei may be forced to negotiate and accept a nuclear pact more favourable to US and Israeli term to preserve theocratic rule in Iran, which is facing growing foreign pressure and has been buffeted by bouts of mass protest at home in recent years.</p>

<p>A US-Saudi defence pact tied to Riyadh's establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, now in its final negotiating stages, poses a significant challenge to Khamenei too.</p>

<p>This alliance threatens to shift the regional balance of power by creating a more unified front against Iran, impacting its geopolitical standing and strategy in the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>NEW ARCHITECTURE</strong></p>

<p>Hassan said recent attacks on Iran and its allies have been widely perceived as a significant success for Israel. They offered insights into what a limited strike on Iran might look like, setting a precedent and altering assumptions that military action on Iran would inevitably spark a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>A senior Arab security official said that Tehran could "no longer brandish its influence through its armed proxies" in the wake of Israel's deadly strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.</p>

<p>For its own part, Iran has every reason to fear another Trump term.</p>

<p>It was Trump who in 2018 unilaterally pulled the US out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani, Khamenei's right-hand man and mastermind of overseas attacks on US and allied interests.</p>

<p>Trump also imposed punitive sanctions targeting Iran's oil export revenues and international banking transactions, which led to extreme economic hardship and exacerbated public discontent in the Islamic Republic.</p>

<p>He frequently said during his presidential campaign that President Joe Biden's policy of not rigorously enforcing oil export sanctions has weakened Washington and emboldened Tehran, allowing it to sell oil, accumulate cash and expand its nuclear pursuits and influence through armed militias.</p>

<p>In March, he told Israel's Hayom newspaper in an interview that Iran could have a nuclear weapon in 35 days and that Israel - which deems Iran's nuclear activity an existential threat though is widely thought to have the region's only nuclear arms - was in a "very treacherous and dangerous neighbourhood".</p>

<p>An Arab government adviser noted that Tehran recognises there is a "new architecture in the making", but also that Trump despite his tough rhetoric realises there is no alternative to a deal with Iran given its accelerated uranium enrichment program.</p>

<p>"Trump might aim for a new nuclear agreement, he could say I tore up the 2015 agreement because it was incomplete and replace it with a long-lasting agreement, touting it to 'make America great again' and preserve US interests," the adviser said.</p>

<p>As the 2015 deal has eroded over the years, Iran has escalated the level of fissile purity in enriched uranium, cutting the time it would need to build an atom bomb if it chose to, though it denies wanting to.</p>

<p>Iran Online, a state-run news website, stated that when Trump left office, Iran was capping enrichment at 3.67 percent under the deal, far below the 90 percent of weapons grade.</p>

<p>Now, Iran has "enriched uranium to 60% with IR-6 advanced centrifuges" and could achieve nuclear weapons capability "within a few weeks ... Completing the nuclear deterrence cycle is Iran's greatest trump card against Trump," it said.</p>

<p>Arab and Western officials warn that the more Iran hints it is nearing development of an atom bomb, the more they incite the need for Israel to strike.</p>

<p>"If Trump reassumes power, he will support Israeli plans to strike Iranian nuclear facilities," a Western official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thai YouTuber Natthamon Khongchak, also known as "Nutty," was arrested and extradited to Thailand with her mother, Thaniya, following two years on the run in Indonesia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two years of eluding authorities in Indonesia, Thai YouTuber Natthamon Khongchak, also known as "Nutty," was extradited to Thailand. On October 25, the 31-year-old and her mother, Thaniya, were taken into custody and sent back to Thailand.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2890133/former-youtube-star-back-in-thailand-to-face-fraud-charges"><em>The Bangkok Post,</em></a> Wissanu Chimtrakul, deputy director general of Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), made the arrest in response to claims that Khongchak and her mother planned a scam that defrauded more than 6,000 people out of about 2 billion baht (US$59 million).</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/gidan-badamasi-hit-nigerian-tv-show-raises-awareness-on-family-size-and-population-challenges-in-africa-6921443"><strong>Also Read | Hit Nigerian TV Show Raises Awareness On Population Challenges In Africa&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>Khongchak, who previously gained popularity with over 800,000 YouTube followers, initially built her platform by posting singing and dancing videos, covering well-known K-pop groups such as Blackpink and BTS. She later attempted to become a K-pop idol in South Korea, briefly debuting under the label Dream Cinema, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3284286/thai-con-woman-arrested-unable-sing-indonesian-national-anthem-while-posing-local"><em>South China Morning Post.</em></a></p>

<p>In recent years, Khongchak shifted her focus, portraying herself as a skilled investor and forex trader. She claimed her family was highly affluent, with assets including 14 cars and a team of 22 nannies, as she shared on a Thai television program. However, her bid to pass as a local in Indonesia faltered when she failed to sing the national anthem, ultimately leading to her arrest.</p>

<p>She reportedly attempted to apply for an Indonesian passport to travel overseas, but immigration officials detected her foreign accent and asked her to sing the Indonesian national anthem and recite the country's constitution. When she failed to do so, her true identity was revealed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

</div>

<p>Free and fair elections in democratic societies reveal the spirit of a nation, especially in the United States with its extended election cycles. On the eve of a pivotal vote, what is the public mood in the world's most influential country?</p>

<p>If one were to capture the prevailing sentiment in the U.S. as election day approaches, it would be "blue funk". The atmosphere is saturated with anxiety, division, and a sense of foreboding. With near-total polarisation and rising intolerance fuelled by Donald Trump's militant campaign style, this election is viewed with unprecedented worry, unhappiness, and fear.</p>

<p>Nearly nine in 10 voters believe America will suffer lasting harm if their side loses. Close to 60% of Kamala Harris supporters report feeling "frightened" about a Trump victory; 47% of Trump supporters feel similarly about a Harris win. More than half of voters anticipate potential violence after the election, and 53% expect the country's divisions to deepen regardless of the outcome. Alarmingly, one in five Americans would consider resorting to violence to achieve political ends.</p>

<h2><strong>"People Are Fed Up"</strong></h2>

<p>Scott Evans, 64, an early voter in Atlanta, expressed his disillusionment: "I feel like I live in a country I don't want to be in anymore." Madison Bates, a 21-year-old student, added, "Civil warpeople against the government. I definitely think if Trump doesn't get in, that's what could happen. People are fed up. You see it every day."</p>

<p>This grimness is evident across public opinion metrics. Six in 10 voters feel the country is on the wrong track. Over half say they are worse off than four years ago. In swing states, seven in 10 voters believe the political and economic systems require substantial change or even a complete overhaul, and they perceive the economy as rigged to benefit the wealthy and powerful.</p>

<p>The public's view of politics and politicians is "unrelentingly negative". More than a quarter of respondents (28%) view both major parties unfavourably, and 63% have little or no confidence in the political system's future. It's no surprise a nonpartisan group has labelled the American electorate an "exhausted majority".</p>

<h2><strong>What Americans Think About The Economy</strong></h2>

<p>In politics, perception often becomes reality, especially on the topic of the economyvoters' top concern. Only 5% of Americans rate the current economy as "excellent" or "good", while 51% believe it's in "poor" or "terrible" condition.</p>

<p>Real disposable personal income, essentially take-home pay, has been stagnant for the last four years. With the cost of essentials up 20% during this period, and housing, child care, and health care costs still climbing, affordability is a significant concern, with many blaming the Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p>The impact is particularly severe on the 60% of voters without a college degree. In 1980, blue-collar workers earned almost 10% more than the national average, enabling them to support families, buy homes, take vacations, and send their children to college. Forty years later, their inflation-adjusted income is stagnant, and they now make 10% less than the average worker.</p>

<p>Unionisation rates have historically been highest in the swing states of the MidwestMichigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvaniawhere organised labour once provided a premium on wages. With the decline in unionised manufacturing jobs, incomes have fallen relative to other sectors, leaving many susceptible to the MAGA narrative that they are victims in a zero-sum economy where immigrants and women gain at their expense.</p>

<h2><strong>A Nuanced Reality</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, the reality of the U.S. economy is more nuanced and less grim. While prices rose about 20% from the beginning of the pandemic through 2023, the median worker's hourly wages rose by over 26%. From 2019 to 2023, wages for the lowest-paid decile of workers grew four times faster than those for middle-class earners, and over 10 times faster than for the wealthiest decile. Pay for workers under 25 has also increased twice as fast as for older workers. Meanwhile, the "college wage premium"the pay gap between those with and without a college degreev has fallen to its lowest level in 15 years.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted every three years, shows that from 2019 to 2022, the net worth of the median US household rose by 37%, from about $141,000 to $192,000, adjusted for inflation. This is the largest three-year increase on record since 1989. Every income group saw significant net worth gains, with the largest increases seen among lower-income, middle-class, Black, Latino, and younger households, contributing to a modest decrease in wealth inequality.</p>

<p>The economic picture remains complex, with significant improvements for many alongside persistent affordability challenges for others, shaping a conflicted national mood as voters head to the polls.</p>

<p><i>The Economist</i>&nbsp;offers some telling statistics in its recent cover story on the US economy titled <em>The World's Envy</em>. Average wages in America's poorest state, Mississippi, are higher than the averages in Britain, Canada and Germany. This year, the average American worker will generate about $171,000 in economic output, representing a 70% increase in productivity in the last 25 years. The US accounts for more than half of global private-sector investment in AI. As the paper concluded: "An economy with an unemployment rate of 4% and a per-person GDP&nbsp;of $85,000 does not have to be made great again; it is great."</p>

<h2><strong>Trump's Immigration Gambit</strong></h2>

<p>Trump knows that immigration places the Biden-Harris administration on slippery ground, which is why he has made it his leading campaign issue, sidelining his advisers' calls to prioritise the economy. The administration kept the borders relatively open until this June, when enforcement measures finally tightened. Harris has attempted to shift some blame to Trump, citing his role in blocking a bipartisan bill earlier in 2024 that would have enforced stricter policies sooner. But this strategy has not gained traction.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, net immigration to the US has been the highest globally, with 2.6 million immigrants in 2022 and 3.3 million in 2023. Since Biden took office, nine million immigrants have entered the country, roughly half of them undocumented. Only one in five Americans find these numbers acceptable; 32% believe the US should "slow the influx" of immigrants, and 16% favour "instituting a moratorium on new arrivals". One-third say America should "close the border immediately".</p>

<p>Trump has rallied his base, particularly the MAGA contingent, against undocumented immigrants, inflating their number to between 20-25 million, though the actual figure is likely about half that. He has pledged to undertake mass deportations if elected. Over 60% of Americans, including 53% of Hispanics, say they support a programme to deport undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Immigration has become a flashpoint, underscoring deep cultural divides in the U.S. Studies indicate that immigrants' "different way of life" is often seen as a threat to longstanding communitiesmainly among older, non-college-educated, working-class, predominantly white populations from European backgrounds, as well as religious and rural Americans. These groups feel increasingly alienated from shifting social and moral values, believing the elite is complicit in eroding traditional identities.</p>

<h2><strong>Religion And Politics</strong></h2>

<p>Despite declining religiosity, nearly two-thirds of Americans identify themselves as Christian, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. In the 1980s, white Christians, especially "born-again" evangelicals (who make up 14% of the population), emerged as a key Republican voting bloc. Today, 60% of Protestants, including 8 out of 10 white evangelicals, support Trump. Political scientist Paul Djupe's surveys suggest that 18% of Americans strongly agree that modern-day prophets continue to reveal God's plans for humanity. Among these, three-fifths believe the upcoming election may be the last chance to "rid America of demonic influence", and two-fifths think a civil war might be necessary to "set the country back on the right path".</p>

<p>Gender is another widening societal divide. Men and women's political views are diverging sharply, with a recent poll showing men favouring Trump by four points and women favouring Harris by 10. Nearly seven in 10 Trump supporters believe Harris's policies will worsen men's lives. Whereas in the Obama years, the gap between young men and women identifying as liberals was only five points, this gap has tripled to 15 points under the Trump-Biden years.</p>

<p>Historically, incumbents need nearly a 40% approval rating to secure re-election; the Biden-Harris administration's approval currently hovers around 28%. Yet, with Harris neck-and-neck with Trump in the final days, her viability largely depends on Trump's unfavourable ratings. Trump's net negative rating remains high among American voters. The Harris campaign is counting on a popular vote advantage to offset the Electoral College's Republican tilt.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for next week's final curtain raiser on the US presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump held competing rallies in Wisconsin while trying to outperform each other in the key battleground state as the race for the White House remained razor tight five days ahead of the election day.</p>

<p>The latest CNN polls showed that Harris has a narrow advantage in Michigan and Wisconsin, while she and Trump remain tied in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In Michigan, Harris holds a lead over Trump by 48 per cent to 43 per cent among likely voters, according to the findings.</p>

<p>Harris also leads Trump in Wisconsin, where 51 per cent support her to 45 per cent for Trump, but the race is tied in Pennsylvania, with both having 48 per cent support.</p>

<p>As the race for the White House remained very close, Trump mounted a sharp attack on Harris while using President Joe Biden's comments that appeared to call Trump's supporters "garbage".</p>

<p>Dressed in a garbage vest, Trump arrived at the venue of the rally in Wisconsin's Green Bay area in a dump truck and addressed several thousand of his supporters, arguing that Harris is not fit to become the President.</p>

<p>"My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: You can't lead America if you don't love Americans, it's true. You can't be president if you hate the American people, which I believe they do, and Kamala Harris is not fit to be president of the United States," he said.</p>

<p>"Kamala, you are fired," Trump thundered.</p>

<p>Before the rally, Trump also spoke to reporters.</p>

<p>"How do you like my garbage truck? This truck is in honour of Kamala and Joe Biden," he said.</p>

<p>"For Joe Biden to make that statement -- it's really a disgrace," he said.</p>

<p>Earlier, Harris distanced herself from Biden's "garbage" remarks, saying she strongly disagrees with criticising anyone based on how they vote.</p>

<p>"I am sincere in what I mean: When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me, and address their needs and their desires," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party leader also cautioned people against electing Trump.</p>

<p>"On day one, Donald Trump would walk into office with an enemies list," said Harris.</p>

<p>She also touched upon various policy issues, including how she plans to cut taxes on small businesses and expand healthcare coverage for families.</p>

<p>The US Presidential Election Day is on November 5.</p>

<p>Over 59 million Americans have already cast their votes in early voting.</p>

<p>Of the total number of early votes, 31,018,125 were cast in person and 27,952,363 were cast through mail, according to official details.</p>

<p>To win the race for the White House, the successful candidate will have to secure 270 of the 538 electoral votes up for grabs.</p>

<p>The seven key swing states which are seen to be crucial to determining the election results are Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched more than 2,000 attack drones at civilian and military targets across Ukraine last month, Kyiv's military said on Friday, as Kremlin forces press a grinding offensive on the front line of their February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Moscow has carried out regular air strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities, with the capital Kyiv coming under attack 20 times in October alone, according to city officials.</p>

<p>Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement it had intercepted 1,185 of the 2,023 drones launched last month and that another 738 were "locationally lost".</p>

<p>"In total, since the beginning of 2024, the enemy has launched 6,987 attack UAVs on the territory of Ukraine. Enemy drones mostly targeted civilian and critical infrastructure," it said.</p>

<p>Ukraine said on Friday it had destroyed 31 drones and one missile in Russia's latest overnight strike, which damaged residential buildings in at least two regions and a fire station in the southern Odesa region.</p>

<p>Russia has denied aiming at civilians and said power facilities are legitimate targets when they are part of Ukrainian military infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ukraine is girding for another season of power cuts amid the threat of new Russian attacks on the country's energy system, which had already been weakened by a series of strikes earlier this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>False claims about voter fraud in Pennsylvania have raised concerns that former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may once again seek to overturn the vote there or in other battleground states likely to determine the winner next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Opinion polls, both nationally and in the seven closely divided states, show Trump locked in a tight race with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris with four days to go before Election Day.</p>

<p>Trump continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud in multiple states that Trump lost, while he and his supporters have spread baseless claims about this election in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Similar rhetoric about voter fraud after the 2020 vote led to a violent mob of Trump supporters attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, seeking to halt or sway the congressional count of the electoral votes that determine who becomes president.</p>

<p>"This is sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election result that cuts against Donald Trump," said Kyle Miller, a Pennsylvania policy strategist for the advocacy group Protect Democracy. "We saw it in 2020 and I think the lesson Trump and his allies have learned since is that they have to sow these ideas early."</p>

<p>Trump on Thursday stepped up his unfounded allegations that probes into suspect voter registration forms are proof of voter fraud. Some of his supporters alleged voter suppression when long lines formed this week to receive mail-in ballots.</p>

<p>State officials and democracy advocates said the incidents show a system working as intended. A judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline by three days in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, after the former US president's campaign sued over claims that some voters were turned away before a Tuesday deadline.</p>

<p>Election officials discovered potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and neighboring York counties, prompting investigations by local law enforcement. There is no evidence the applications have led or will lead to illegal votes.</p>

<p>"This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working," Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania's top elections official, told reporters this week.</p>

<p><strong>PREPARING TO BLAME A LOSS ON FRAUD</strong></p>

<p>Trump tells his rallies to expect a big victory on Tuesday, saying he could only envision losing "if it was a corrupt election."</p>

<p>Trump's claims have raised concerns that he is preparing to again blame a potential loss in Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven states likely to decide the result of the election, on voter fraud.</p>

<p>In a social media post on Thursday, he said: "We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania" and demanded criminal prosecutions.</p>

<p>A senior Harris campaign official on Thursday said Trump's claims were an example of the former president trying to "sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he's afraid he can't win."</p>

<p>Should Trump win the vote fairly, all the talk of fraud may dissipate quickly.</p>

<p>But the United States' unique method of choosing a president, rooted in the 1789 Constitution, provides openings for Trump and his supporters to seek to undermine or delay election results at the local, state and national level.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Trump team attempted 60 court cases alleging fraud in multiple states, all without success. But the experience has prepared lawyers from both parties for another attempt, each side sharpening their knowledge of election law.</p>

<p>Should Trump followers overturn or delay any unfavorable state results long enough through the courts or legislative obstruction, they could prevent a duly elected Harris from taking office and tilt the result to Trump.</p>

<p>Some US states are warning county and local officials not to intervene illegally or refuse to certify results.</p>

<p>But the final arbiter in such a case would be the nine-member US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>With six conservative justices, three of them appointed by Trump, the court has already granted the former president a victory in his bid to seek criminal immunity from acts committed as president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The popular Nigerian TV show has stirred discussions on family planning across Africa, highlighting the challenges of raising large families.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Families eagerly assemble every week in Kano, the second-largest city in Nigeria, to watch the hit television program "Gidan Badamasi," a comedy-drama that emphasises the social effects of large families, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></p>

<p>Thursday nights are a time when families gather around their little TVs to witness the fictional story of a rich but careless protagonist who battles to care for his many children. The presentation highlights the difficulties of raising large children in a society that aims to provide education and employment possibilities despite a global shift in birthrates, addressing an issue that is highly relevant throughout Africa, where a sizable young population is expanding quickly.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/africa/africa-nigeria-birthrate-fertility.html"><em>The New York Times </em></a>report, many African women have far more children than women on other continents do: women in Nigeria have an average of over five children, while American and European women have about 1.5, and Chinese women even fewer. And recent progress in reducing child mortality in Africa means more of them survive into adulthood than ever before.</p>

<p>But Africa's birthrate is also gradually dropping. It has fallen by about 38 percent over the past 60 years. That is largely because of education, economics, and shifting attitudes toward family size on display in conversations prompted by shows like “Gidan Badamasi,” one of the biggest hits of recent years on the leading Hausa-language television channel.</p>

<p>“It's a very bad habit, breeding children he can't take care of,” Sani Ibrahim, 53, a school principal and the father of the six siblings, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/africa/africa-nigeria-birthrate-fertility.html"><em>NYT.</em></a></p>

<p>“It's a problem for me,” he said, “that I have this many children.”</p>

<p>Northern and southern Africa have long been going through “fertility transitions"—significant reductions in their birthrates. But in most of the rest of Africa, fertility has mostly stayed high.</p>

<p>“Gidan Badamasi” had a “massive, instant” effect, starting conversations about reducing family size. It succeeded, many viewers told NYT, where many international organisations had failed.</p>

<p>“You can't just come to this part of the world saying that people should not get married, people should not give birth to many children, people should get birth control,” the show's main writer, Nazir Adam Salih, said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump and Kamala Harris hold dueling campaign rallies Friday in Wisconsin's largest city Milwaukee, as both candidates make frantic last-ditch appeals to wavering voters with Election Day just around the corner.</p>

<p>Republican Trump will return to the venue where he was crowned his party's presidential nominee over the summer, his ear bandaged in bright white gauze after he was wounded in an attempted assassination just days earlier, while Democrat Harris will lean on the star power of rapper Cardi B to outshine her rival.</p>

<p>Their race back to the so-called Blue Wall states came after the pair spent Thursday in the US West, with three appearances each.</p>

<p>The highlight for Harris had been a star-studded rally in Las Vegas where she was introduced by pop maven Jennifer Lopez, while Trump spent a comfortable evening basking in mutual affection with right-wing provocateur Tucker Carlson in Glendale, Arizona.</p>

<p>With Tuesday's vote looming, the candidates appear set for a photo finish, despite fierce efforts by the rival campaigns to move the dial and dominate the news cycle in a week so far defined by bitter disputes and gaffes on both sides over issues including race, gender and reproductive rights.</p>

<p>Wisconsin, one of the key battleground states that will swing the November 5 election, was decided by less than one percentage point in 2016 and 2020, and the race for its 10 electoral college votes is just as tight this time around.</p>

<p>Harris -- who has fought to maintain her image as a "joyful warrior" even as Trump hurls insults against her and other Democrats -- was seeking to harness the power of musicians such as GloRilla, the Isley Brothers and Flo Milli at a "When We Vote We Win" rally and concert in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Grammy award-winning rapper Cardi B was due to speak at the event, Harris's campaign said.</p>

<p>Trump was returning to the Fiserv Forum, the venue that hosted perhaps the high-water mark of his campaign, the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>The convention came as the tycoon was riding high in the polls after two major events -- the assassination attempt and a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden which proved disastrous for the Democrat -- but before Biden dropped out of the race and handed the baton to Harris.</p>

<p>Lifted by a surge of enthusiasm, Harris quickly ate away at Trump's lead -- but the polls have remained mostly deadlocked ever since.</p>

<p>With fears growing that Trump could refuse to accept the result if he loses the election, many Americans were bracing for violence and unrest in the days after November 5.</p>

<p>Washington's police chief Pamela Smith told a press briefing this week that no "credible threats" had been identified against the capital, which saw a deadly riot by Trump supporters seeking to overturn Biden's election win on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>Smith said that officials were remaining "vigilant." Police would support peaceful protests, she said, but "we will not tolerate any violence of any kind."</p>

<p>"We will not tolerate any riots, we will not tolerate the destruction of property, we will not tolerate any unlawful behavior," she said.</p>

<p>Some 63.5 million people have cast their ballots early, more than 40 percent of the 2020 total vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brat, the word redefined by singer Charli XCX and adopted by supporters of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, was on Friday named the Collins Word of the Year 2024.</p>

<p>"Brat" was the name of the UK singer's hit sixth album, and the word has now come to represent a "confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude", said Collins, rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.</p>

<p>"Inspired by the Charli XCX album, 'brat' has become one of the most talked about words of 2024," said the UK-based dictionary.</p>

<p>"More than a hugely successful album, 'brat' is a cultural phenomenon that has resonated with people globally, and 'brat summer' established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life," it added.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old pop star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, described the typical brat girl as someone "who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it".</p>

<p>She tweeted in July that "Kamala IS brat", in reference to the US Vice President, prompting the presidential nominee to use her song "365" in one of her TikTok videos.</p>

<p>Her campaign account also re-branded with a lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.</p>

<p>The album hit number one in her native UK and number three in the US.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Severe food crises threaten people in vulnerable areas, including the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali, where populations face or near famine, says a report by the United Nations' food agencies released on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Severe food crises threaten hundreds of thousands of people in vulnerable areas, including the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali, where populations face or near famine, says a report by the United Nations' food agencies released on Thursday.</p>

<p>Conflicts, economic instability, and climate shocks -- combined with reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance -- are driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity, the report warned.</p>

<p>“Immediate, scaled-up intervention is needed to prevent further deterioration in these already vulnerable regions,” it added.</p>

<p>The UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said acute food insecurity is projected to worsen across 16 “hunger hotspots” during the next six months in 14 countries and two regions.</p>

<p>Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories remain at the “highest concern level,” the report said.</p>

<p>Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen are classified as “hotspots of very high concern,” where large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity.</p>

<p>“Conflict and armed violence continue to be the primary drivers of hunger in numerous hotspots, disrupting food systems, displacing populations, and obstructing humanitarian access,” the report warned.</p>

<p>FAO and WFP experts believe that the conflict in Sudan is likely to expand, “driving mass displacement, resulting in famine levels likely to persist and the number of people in catastrophic conditions to increase.”</p>

<p>That will further aggravate the regional humanitarian crisis, resulting in increased cross-border movements to neighbouring countries, primarily Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic.</p>

<p>The UN agencies also stressed that the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian territories has driven “unprecedented needs, with near-total displacement of the population and an increased risk of regional spillover”.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, the ongoing escalation of conflict is significantly increasing the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance and is severely impacting levels of acute food insecurity, they added.</p>

<p>Since the last report in May 2024, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and the Niger have been added to the hunger hotspots list, partly due to the impact of climate extremes.</p>

<p>Beyond conflict, weather extremes and increased climate variability are exacerbating acute food insecurity in many regions, the report said.</p>

<p>La Niña -- a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – is expected to persist through March 2025, with a significant impact on rainfall patterns and temperatures.</p>

<p>“While La Niña may enhance agricultural prospects in some areas, it also increases the risk of flooding in parts of Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe,” the report said.</p>

<p>The UN agencies warned that without “immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action” to address severe constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflicts, further starvation and loss of life are likely in Palestine, the Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali.</p>

<p>“Addressing and preventing famine in these regions will require greater investment in integrated solutions that cut across traditional mandates, targeting the root causes of food insecurity and reducing dependency on emergency aid,” they said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent video capturing an unusual interaction between an Indian man and pop star Selena Gomez has ignited a flurry of reactions online. In the viral clip, the man eagerly snaps a selfie with Ms Gomez before making a surprising request: please chant "<em>Jai Shri Ram</em>."</p>

<p>When Ms Gomez appears puzzled, the man attempts to clarify, adding, "India's best slogan - <em>Jai Shri Ram</em>." However, the 32-year-old Gomez, politely dismissive, responds with a simple, "Aww, thank you, honey."</p>

<p>The video was first shared by Instagram user Pallav Paliwal and has rapidly gained traction across social media platforms. Mr Paliwal captioned it, "One of our followers met Selena Gomez and she said '<em>Jai Shri Ram</em>' on the occasion of Diwali."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Others were less restrained in their criticism. "Most pathetic thing I've seen all year," commented another.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British ban on protesting outside abortion clinics went into effect on Thursday, though it left a question mark over whether anti-abortion demonstrators who pray silently will be breaking the law.</p>

<p>The law, which applies to England and Wales, bars protests within 150 metres of clinics. Scotland and Northern Ireland, which make their own health policies, recently enacted similar bans.</p>

<p>The new rules make it an offense to obstruct someone using abortion services, “intentionally or recklessly” influence their decision, or cause “harassment, alarm or distress.” Offenders face a fine, with no upper limit.</p>

<p>The buffer zone rule was passed 18 months ago as part of the previous Conservative government's Public Order Act, but wrangling over whether it would apply to silent prayer protests, and a change in government in July, have delayed it taking effect.</p>

<p>The Crown Prosecution Service says silent prayer near an abortion clinic “will not necessarily commit a criminal offense,” and police say they will assess each case individually.</p>

<p>Anti-abortion campaigners and religious groups argue that banning silent-prayer protests would be an affront to freedom of religion. But pro-choice campaigners say silent anti-abortion demonstrators are often intimidating to women entering clinics.</p>

<p>“It's difficult to see how anyone choosing to perform their prayers right outside an abortion clinic could argue they aren't attempting to influence people — and there are countless testimonies from women who say this makes them feel distressed,” said Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, one of Britain's biggest abortion providers.</p>

<p>In March 2023, lawmakers rejected a change to the legislation proposed by some conservative legislators that would have explicitly allowed silent prayer within the buffer zones. The final rules are a potentially messy compromise that is likely to be tested in court.</p>

<p>Crime and Policing Minister Diana Johnson said she was “confident that the safeguards we have put in place today will have a genuine impact in helping women feel safer and empowered to access the vital services they need.”</p>

<p>But Bishop John Sherrington of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, said the government had “taken an unnecessary and disproportionate step backwards” on religious freedom.</p>

<p>“Religious freedom includes the right to manifest one's private beliefs in public through witness, prayer and charitable outreach, including outside abortion facilities,” he said.</p>

<p>Abortion is not as divisive an issue in the UK as in the US, where women's access to terminations has been rolled back, and banned in some states, since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe vs Wade ruling in 2022.</p>

<p>Abortion was partly legalised in Britain by the 1967 Abortion Act, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors approve. Later abortions are allowed in some circumstances, including danger to the mother's life.</p>

<p>But women who have abortions after 24 weeks in England and Wales can be prosecuted under the 1861 Offenses Against the Person Act.</p>

<p>Last year a 45-year-old woman in England was sentenced to 28 months in prison for ordering abortion pills online to induce a miscarriage when she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant. After an outcry, her sentence was reduced.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Friday criticised Israel's "expansion" of its attacks on his country, saying they indicated a rejection of efforts to broker a truce after more than a month of war.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy's renewed expansion of the scope of its aggression on Lebanese regions, its repeated threats to the population to evacuate entire cities and villages, and its renewed targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut with destructive raids are all indicators that confirm the Israeli enemy's rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire," Mikati said.</p>

<p>Mikati's statement came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met visiting US officials to discuss a possible deal to end the war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Lebanese premier added that Israel's diplomatic behaviour suggested it was rejecting a ceasefire.</p>

<p>"Israeli statements and diplomatic signals that Lebanon received confirm Israel's stubbornness in rejecting the proposed solutions and insisting on the approach of killing and destruction," Mikati said in a statement.</p>

<p>Since fighting in Lebanon escalated on September 23, the war has killed at least 1,829 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of health ministry figures.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Mikati said US envoy Amos Hochstein had signalled during a phone call that a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war was possible before US elections are held on November 5.</p>

<p>The same day, Hezbollah's new leader said the group would agree to a ceasefire with Israel under acceptable terms, but added that a viable deal has yet to be presented.</p>

<p>During talks on Thursday, Israeli leader Netanyahu told US envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk that any Lebanon deal must guarantee Israel's longer-term security.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive shootout linked to drug trafficking has left a teenager and four others seriously wounded in western France, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Friday, in the latest such gunfight to injure children.</p>

<p>The shootout erupted in front of a restaurant overnight in the western city of Poitiers, Retailleau told BFMTV/RMC radio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What started as a shooting at a restaurant ended up in a fight between rival gangs that involved several hundred people", Retailleau said.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old boy wounded was between life and death, he said.</p>

<p>The minister warned that the country was at a "tipping point" when it came to drug trafficking violence, saying that he was planning to travel later in the day to the northwestern city of Rennes, where a five-year-old child was also between life and death after being shot on Saturday in another fire exchange related to drug trafficking.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In each important speech she makes, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks about one woman first and foremost: her late mother, a trailblazing scientist who came to the United States from India.</p>

<p>The anecdotes serve not just to explain her life story -- they help the vice president, who has not made her identity a central theme of the White House race, to talk about feminism and racism.</p>

<p>"My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall, brown woman with an accent. And as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her," Harris said in August at the Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>In the speech, her first as the party's official presidential nominee, Harris recounted at length the journey of Shyamala Gopalan, who left her homeland at the age of 19 to do a master's degree in California.</p>

<p>Gopalan would go on to become a prominent breast cancer researcher, who contributed to the development of several treatments for the disease.</p>

<p>This week in Washington, as Harris spoke before tens of thousands of supporters in the center of the US capital, the person she mentioned the most -- after her Republican rival Donald Trump -- was her mother.</p>

<p>The vice president talks about her mother's American experience as a woman of color -- a concept she hardly ever discusses as it pertains to her own life.</p>

<p>Harris never mentions the fact that she will become the first woman US president if elected, as well as the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey, says it is a deliberate choice by Harris not to mention these potentially historic milestones.</p>

<p>"She has to convince the people who need to be 'reassured' that a woman can do this job and be strong and tough," Walsh told AFP.</p>

<p>But "there is racism, there is sexism," the researcher notes. "That all exists out there, and she can't act as though that doesn't exist," so talking about her mother is "a way for her to acknowledge it, but not have it focus as much on her."</p>

<h3><strong>'Long hours'</strong></h3>

<p>Gopalan met Jamaican immigrant Donald Harris in the early 1960s at the University of California, Berkeley, where he had come to study economics.</p>

<p>They found each other right in the heat of the civil rights movement, and Kamala Harris -- born in 1964 -- was brought to marches in a stroller.</p>

<p>After her parents divorced when she was five, Harris and her sister Maya were mainly raised by their mother.</p>

<p>"She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it," Harris has said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The early, hectic days of her campaign, which only began in July once President Joe Biden stepped aside, were marked by an unexpected symbol, drawn from one of Gopalan's favorite expressions -- a coconut.</p>

<p>But Harris has since used stories from her childhood to make a more personal connection with voters, and emphasize how she intends to work for middle-class families that reflect her own upbringing.</p>

<p>Harris often talks about how her mother "worked long hours," and then sat late at night drinking tea with "a pile of bills in front of her." Gopalan kept a strict budget, Harris says, and focused on saving for a first home.</p>

<p>The vice president has also talked about caring for her sick mother, preparing meals and choosing clothes that would not irritate her skin. Gopalan died after a battle with colon cancer in 2009.</p>

<h3><strong>Single mothers</strong></h3>

<p>With women's rights at the heart of the White House battle, Harris has put her mother -- a woman who married for love in an "act of self-determination" rather than face an arranged marriage in India -- front and center.</p>

<p>The vice president, who helped raise her husband's two children from his previous marriage, speaks rarely about her father, who is in his 80s and lives in Washington.</p>

<p>Trump has called Donald Harris a "Marxist," but the retired university professor has distanced himself from politics for a long time.</p>

<p>For Walsh, it's neither surprising nor new for a presidential candidate to put their mother -- and not father -- in the limelight.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton and Barack Obama -- who, like Harris, never highlighted that he would make history by becoming America's first Black president -- were both raised by single mothers, and spoke of them often while campaigning, Walsh said.</p>

<p>Those mothers "then become an outsized force in their lives, and in talking about who they are and how they grew up, they would really be center stage, right?" she said.</p>

<p>"I mean, it would be kind of odd to think they wouldn't."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hindu American groups have applauded Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump for promising to protect the human rights of Hindus across the world, including the US and Bangladesh and protect them from the "anti-religion agenda of the radical left."</p>

<p>In his Diwali greetings on Thursday, Trump strongly "condemned the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities in Bangladesh", which he said remains in a “total state of chaos.”</p>

<p>“It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border, but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength,” he said.</p>

<p>“We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi,” Trump had said.</p>

<p>Utsav Sanduja, founder and chairman of Hindus for America First told PTI in an interview that they are very grateful to President Trump.</p>

<p>"I'm very grateful to President Trump, eternally grateful and eternally appreciative. It sucks that Kamala Harris hasn't said anything about this issue. I think that there's going to be a big change in this election coming from this,” Sanduja said.</p>

<p>HinduAction also thanked Trump for his statement.</p>

<p>“As you rightly pointed out, the situation of the Hindus in Bangladesh is precarious. Below is a summary head with regularly updated data on the atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh,” it said.</p>

<p>“Thank you President Trump for showing moral clarity and unequivocally condemning anti-Hindu pogroms in Bangladesh,” said Indian-American Nathan Punwani.</p>

<p>“Trump is a great man and, a great leader, full credit goes to him for wishing all the Hindus, Buddhists, and Jain Sikhs a very blessed Diwali. I think Trump really, really cares about these communities. He really understands what's going on in Bangladesh. He sees the ongoing persecution of Hindus. He is concerned about religious minorities that are suffering right now in that country,” Sanduja said.</p>

<p>“He has done such a great favour to millions of Americans who are concerned about human rights issues. To deliver on Diwali, such an auspicious day, such a magnificent thing. I'd like to say that many of us in the Hindu community played a small part in persuading President Trump's team, talking about this, giving briefings, and putting papers together,” he said.</p>

<p>“We are seeing that 60 per cent of Indian Americans are supporting Kamala Harris. In the last election, I think 68 per cent supported Biden. There's a dip in support for the Democratic presidential candidate. Trump, last time around, had 22 per cent of the Indian American community. Now he's at 32 per cent. This is according to Carnegie Endowment's latest survey on Indian American attitudes,” he said.</p>

<p>“With this statement, it's going to open up the eyes of more Indian Americans, Hindu Americans, and so on. They're going to give President Trump the vote,” Sanduja said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kansai International Airport in Japan can't be held responsible for the less superlative performance of airlines or other stops on a traveller's journey, but it claims its handlers never lose a bag.</p>

<p>In 30 years of operation, the airport serving the region around Osaka and Kyoto says it has never lost a suitcase, a set of golf clubs, a stroller or anything in fact -- a feat its employees humbly shrug off as nothing special.</p>

<p>"We just follow the work processes and rules and do what we have to do," Tsuyoshi Habuta, the supervisor at CKTS, one of the handling companies at Kansai, told AFP.</p>

<p>There is no "special training" but Habuta and his teams handle more than 3,000 pieces of luggage every day with attention to detail.</p>

<p>"We carefully handle suitcases to avoid shocks. Suitcase handles are aligned in a direction that is easy for customers to pick up," Habuta said.</p>

<p>"We hand fragile items, strollers, surfboards and skis directly to passengers," he said.</p>

<p>Luggage is on the carousel inside in the terminal building "within 15 minutes of the aircraft's arrival to minimise stress of customers," he added.</p>

<p>One of Japan's busiest international airports, Kansai was ranked the World's Best Airport for Baggage Delivery by UK-based airport rating organisation SKYTRAX in April.</p>

<p>"Everyone at the Kansai Airport is proud of this," co-CEO of the airport Benoit Rulleau told AFP.</p>

<p>Rulleau acknowledged that it is easier to achieve zero lost bags at an airport such as Kansai, which serves relatively few connecting passengers.</p>

<p>But he said the achievement reflects the "incredible devotion" of the airport's staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The number of lost or delayed bags has sharply decreased globally in the past decade thanks to technology, said Nicole Hogg, baggage portfolio director at SITA, a Geneve-based IT services provider in the air transport industry.</p>

<p>"If you think about the passenger volumes that we have, 6.9 bags being mishandled (per 1,000 passengers) is a very low figure," Hogg told AFP.</p>

<p>"A decade ago, we were in double figures," she said, adding "the industry investing in technology is definitely paying off."</p>

<p>She explained that baggage is rarely mishandled when passengers have no connections.</p>

<p>"The complexity really comes in the transfer process where passengers have short connection times and they're trying to get from one flight to another," she said.</p>

<p>Kansai recently returned to its pre-pandemic level of 25 million international passengers a year.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Osaka Expo 2025 it has gone through a renovation with a new security checkpoint that allows for an even smoother experience.</p>

<p>Rulleau said the airport will be able to accommodate up to 40 million passengers a year -- and probably none of them will lose their bag.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Donald Trump is becoming increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge and is out for unchecked power, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Friday in an unprecedented attack on her Republican rival ahead of next week's election.</p>

<p>In a rally in Las Vegas, Harris, the Democratic leader of Indian heritage said Trump is all about "hate" and more division and that he would bring an "enemies list" to the White House while she would carry a "to-do list" of priorities.</p>

<p>Singer Jennifer Lopez joined the Democratic leader at the rally.</p>

<p>"We all know who Donald Trump is. He is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better. He is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and he is out for unchecked power," Harris said at the rally.</p>

<p>With just four days left for the November 5 vote, the race between Trump and Harris remained very tight in the key battleground states.</p>

<p>"If he (Trump) is re-elected, Donald Trump will walk into the office with an enemies list. If I am elected, I will walk in with a 'to-do list' on behalf of you," Harris said.</p>

<p>"And at the top of my list is bringing down the cost of your living. That will be my focus every single day as the President," she added.</p>

<p>Harris said she would put the country ahead of her party and be a president for all Americans.</p>

<p>"Unlike Donald Trump, I do not believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I want to give them a seat at the table. That's what real leadership look like," she said.</p>

<p>"I pledge to always put country above party, and self and to be a president for all Americans," she added.</p>

<p>Harris said, if elected to the White House, she would make housing more affordable by building more houses.</p>

<p>"We will cut taxes for small business, we will lower health care costs."</p>

<p>"I see the promise of America in everyone here," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic leader also attacked Trump for his comment that he would protect women whether they "like it or not".</p>

<p>The comments showed that Trump "does not understand women's rights to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies," she said.</p>

<p>The remarks by Harris came as the presidential election race remained razor-tight. The latest CNN polls showed that Harris has a narrow advantage in Michigan and Wisconsin, while she and Trump remain tied in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In Michigan, Harris holds a lead over Trump by 48 per cent to 43 per cent among likely voters, according to the findings.</p>

<p>Harris also leads Trump in Wisconsin, where 51 per cent support her to 45 per cent for Trump, but the race is tied in Pennsylvania with both having 48 per cent support.</p>

<p>More than 62 million voters have cast early ballots, according to the University of Florida's Election Lab.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian Ocean island of Mauritius blocked access to social media on Friday, just days ahead of a general election as tensions mounted over a wire-tapping scandal.&nbsp;The shock move was announced by telecoms operator EMTEL, which said it was ordered late Thursday by the Information and Communication Technologies Authority to block access to all social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blockage is due to last until November 11 -- a day after the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EMTEL said the order referred to "illegal postings that may impact national security and public safety".&nbsp;</p>

<p>It follows a scandal that broke out earlier this month when secret recordings of phone calls by politicians, journalists, members of civil society and even foreign diplomats were leaked online.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the government on the social media ban.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's shocking, revolting, and unacceptable. It's a sign of panic," said Paul Berenger, one of the leaders of the opposition Alliance for Change coalition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are dealing with people who are dangerous to the country. Lawyers are working on what can be done legally. We will move very quickly on the legal and political level."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth is seeking re-election as head of the Militant Socialist Movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He inherited the premiership on the death of his father in 2017 and secured a victory for his coalition in polls two years later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is the last desperate act of a regime in disarray," said Nando Bodha, head of opposition grouping Linion Reform.</p>

<p>"It attacks head-on the fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by the constitution, including freedom of expression," he added, calling for an intervention by the Election Commission to ensure the polls are "free and fair".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

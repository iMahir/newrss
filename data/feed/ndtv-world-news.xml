       <description><![CDATA[Major powers such as the United States, China, and India have warned the judges not to go beyond the existing legal framework for combating climate change.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As marathon climate change hearings wrapped up Friday at the world's top court, a representative for vulnerable nations voiced "huge disappointment" at the attitude of top polluters and urged judges to make them legally accountable for historic emissions.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has played host to history over the past 10 days, with a record number of nations and organisations addressing the court.</p>

<p>More than 100 speakers have presented, ranging from diplomats of the world's top economies to representatives of tiny island nations making a debut appearance before the UN's top court.</p>

<p>In what many experts have painted as a "David Vs Goliath" scrap, stark divisions have emerged between top polluters and those suffering most from climate change.</p>

<p>Major powers such as the United States, China, and India have warned the judges not to go beyond the existing legal framework for combating climate change.</p>

<p>But smaller states argue this blueprint, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is insufficient to mitigate the devastating effects of the changing climate.</p>

<p>Representing a group of 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific states, Cristelle Pratt told AFP there was "huge disappointment" at developed countries but that it was "quite unsurprising."</p>

<p>"We cannot just rely on the climate treaties to address this global crisis," said Pratt, from the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States.</p>

<p>"We need to look to the full body of international law. And we do need to do this because of equity and justice. Every human being on this planet has a right to live a worthwhile life," she added.</p>

<p><strong>'Reverberate across the world'</strong></p>

<p>The 15-judge ICJ panel has been tasked with crafting a so-called advisory opinion to answer two questions.</p>

<p>Firstly, what legal obligations do nations have to prevent climate change? Secondly, what are the legal consequences for countries whose emissions have harmed the environment, especially that of developing states?</p>

<p>This second question is where many vulnerable countries hope the ICJ will clarify a legal requirement for historic emitters to stump up for the damage caused.</p>

<p>"We do need to look at historical responsibilities and hold those emitters, mainly colonial powers, to account," said Pratt.</p>

<p>"That certainly is something that we from the global south will be hoping to hear," she added, mentioning that many of her member countries were servicing "unsustainable debt."</p>

<p>The ICJ's advisory opinion is non-binding and will take many months to emerge.</p>

<p>Nikki Reisch, Director of the climate and energy programme at the Center for International Environmental Law, said the ruling would "reverberate across the world."</p>

<p>"This is the world's highest court and their opinion will carry weight.... there is an opportunity for this court to break through the impunity that we've seen for decades and to affirm the basis for accountability," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's not just about paying compensation for the mounting cost of climate change. It's about structural reforms, debt cancellation, ecosystem restoration," she added.</p>

<p><strong>'Life and death'</strong></p>

<p>The countries Pratt represents have a population of 1.3 billion but produce three percent of global emissions, she noted.</p>

<p>After bitterly fought COP29 climate talks, wealthy polluters agreed to find at least $300 billion a year by 2035 to help poorer countries' transition to clean energy and prepare for an increase in extreme weather.</p>

<p>"The pledges are really quite insignificant," said Pratt.</p>

<p>Several top polluters have argued it is impossible to enshrine into international law a responsibility for past emissions and the damage caused.</p>

<p>"We've seen time and again here in these halls that the fossil fuel giants... have urged this court to ignore history, to sweep their historical conduct, the decades of conduct that has brought the world to the brink, under the rug," said Reisch.</p>

<p>The hearings have also been notable for representatives of tiny island states, often in colourful national dress, recounting searing stories of the devastation suffered by their people.</p>

<p>"These hearings have put into stark relief that this is a matter of life and death for so many people," Reisch told AFP.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Healthcare providers have warned that more than 5,000 Syrian doctors work in German medical facilities, often in rural areas, and that they and other staff would be hard to replace.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German hospitals and other employers fear worker shortages if many Syrian refugees return home after the fall of president Bashar al-Assad, a concern backed by a study released Friday.</p>

<p>Health care providers have warned that more than 5,000 Syrian doctors work in German medical facilities, often in rural areas, and that they and other staff would be hard to replace.</p>

<p>Europe's biggest economy has taken in around one million refugees from war-ravaged Syria in an influx that peaked in 2015 under ex-chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>

<p>While they were initially greeted warmly, the mass arrivals sparked a backlash that fuelled the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Assad, conservative and AfD politicians have called for Syrians to return to their homeland despite lingering insecurity there.</p>

<p>Many employers fear this could worsen fast-ageing Germany's labour shortages, a concern backed by a study of the Institute for Employment Research released on Friday.</p>

<p>Large-scale returns "could have noticeable regional and sector-specific effects -- especially in those sectors, fields of activity and regions that are already suffering from a shortage of labour," said institute researcher Yuliya Kosyakova.</p>

<p>It said that 287,000 Syrian nationals are employed in Germany, with many who arrived in recent years still enrolled in language and so-called integration courses.</p>

<p>Syrian men work mostly in transport and logistics, manufacturing, food and hospitality, health and construction, while women were more strongly represented in social and cultural services, it said.</p>

<p>News magazine Der Spiegel reported that 5,758 Syrian medical doctors work in Germany, citing data from the German Medical Association.</p>

<p>"We can understand that many of them want to return to their homeland and are urgently needed there," German Hospital Association chairman Gerald Gass told the magazine.</p>

<p>But he warned that they play an important role, especially in smaller towns, and warned: "If they leave Germany in large numbers, this will undoubtedly be felt in the staffing levels."</p>

<p>With many Syrians also employed as care workers, their departure would be a "serious blow for elderly care", Nursing Employers' Association director Isabell Halletz told news channel NTV.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many as 86 Indians were attacked or murdered abroad in the year 2023, Minister of state for external affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh on Thursday informed Parliament. A steep increase from the previous two years of 29 cases in 2021 and 57 in 2022.</p>

<p>Of these, 12 were in the United States, and 10 each in Canada, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, according to the data shared.</p>

<p>"The safety and security of Indians abroad is one of the foremost priorities for the government of India. Our missions and posts remain vigilant and closely monitor any untoward incident. Such incidents are immediately taken up with the concerned authorities of the host country to ensure that the cases are properly investigated and the perpetrators are punished," said Kirti Vardhan Singh.</p>

<p>These issues have also been brought up during meetings with the government officials of the particular countries involved at the "highest levels".</p>

<p>When asked about the data of Indian citizens who have voluntarily surrendered their citizenships over the last 5 years, state-wise and year-wise data and the reasons for the surrender, he said this in a response, "As per the information available with the Ministry, the number of Indians who gave up their Indian citizenship was 1,44,017 (in 2019); 85,256 (in 2020); 1,63,370 (in 2021); 2,25,620 (in 2022); and 2,16,219 (in 2023). For reference purpose, data was 1,22,819 (in 2011); 1,20,923 (in 2012); 1,31,405 (in 2013); 1,29,328 (in 2014); 1,31,489 (in 2015); 1,41,603 (in 2016); 1,33,049 (in 2017); 1,34,561 (in 2018)".</p>

<p>However, state-wise distribution of people who renounced Indian citizenship for foreign citizenship was not available.</p>

<p>He shared the names of 135 countries including Algeria, Australia, Austria, Greece, Iran, Iraq, China, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, the US, the UK and Ukraine whose citizenship was acquired by Indians.</p>

<p>He also brought to attention that the Centre has established a "24x7 helpline in the Indian Missions/Posts abroad" to assist Indian nationals.</p>

<p>As a separate discussion, the government also informed that 2,16,219 Indians gave up their citizenship which is fewer as compared to 2,25,620 in 2022, as per the data.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Iraq's prime minister on Friday in an unannounced visit as he seeks to coordinate a regional approach to Syria following the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>The top US diplomat flew to Baghdad from the Turkish capital Ankara and headed into talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, an AFP journalist travelling with Blinken said.</p>

<p>Iraq is keen to prevent any spread of chaos from Syria, where on Sunday Islamist-led rebels toppled the five-decade rule of the Assad dynasty following a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>Both Iraq and Syria are still reeling from the insurgency by the ultra-violent Islamic State (IS) jihadist group, which set up a self-proclaimed caliphate a decade ago over vast swathes stretching across their border.</p>

<p>Iraq's government has urged respect for the "free will" of all Syrians and the country's territorial integrity after Assad's fall.</p>

<p>The deposed Syrian leader hailed from a rival faction of the Baath party of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, ousted in a 2003 US-led invasion.</p>

<p>The United States maintains some 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 more in Syria as part of a campaign to prevent IS resurgence.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has agreed with Iraq to end the coalition's military presence by September 2025 but stopped short of a complete withdrawal of the US forces, whose presence has been opposed by Iran-aligned armed groups in Iraq.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month and has long been sceptical of US troop deployments, although it remains unclear whether he would backtrack from Biden's agreement or change tactics in light of developments in Syria.</p>

<p>Blinken has pushed for an "inclusive" political process to bring an accountable government to Syria and avoid sectarian bloodletting of the sort seen in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>Speaking in Jordan on Thursday, Blinken said that all regional players he had spoken to "agreed on the need to have a unified approach to advance many of our shared interests" in Syria.</p>

<p>He also said that he was seeking to ensure "that Syria is not used as a base for terrorism" and that it does not pose "a threat to its neighbours, or ally with groups like ISIS", using an alternative acronym for IS.</p>

<p>Turkey strongly opposes the US alliance with Syrian Kurdish fighters, who assist the United States with the fight against the Islamic State group but whom Ankara links to outlawed Kurdish separatists at home.</p>

<p>Israel in turn has been pounding Syria, decimating military sites across its historic adversary on the heels of a deadly campaign against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, aiming in part to curb the regional influence of Tehran which had allied itself with Assad.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's new drone carrier, 'Shahid Bagheri', was recently spotted offshore the Iranian naval port of Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf. Satellite images accessed by NDTV show the vessel, which was originally a container ship, looks similar to an aircraft carrier but meant for drones.</p>

<p>High-resolution satellite images collected by Maxar show the ship off Bandar Abbas port. 'Shahid Bagheri' has a ski jump similar to a STOBAR aircraft carrier, but the short runway suggests it's meant only for drones and could be used for helicopter operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The military drone carrier is believed to be conducting its first sea trials since leaving the nearby Iran Shipyard and Offshore Industries (ISOICO) shipyard in late November. Iran has no aircraft carrier and has operated fighter jets and helicopters since the 1970s and 80s.</p>

<p>'Shahid Bagheri', 'Shahid Roudaki' and 'Shahid Mahdavi' are the three drone carrier vessels Iran has developed. The overview images taken yesterday by satellites show the three ships in the Persian Gulf.</p>

</div>

<p>The drone carriers will allow the Iranian navy to bring the unmanned aerial vehicles closer to the battlefield. Despite facing years of sanctions from the West, Iran has managed to produce its fleet of armed drones that have proliferated to different battlefields in the region and even to Europe where Russians have reportedly used the Iranian Shahed drones against Ukraine. The Shahed 129 drone, unveiled in 2012, is mass-produced and is based on Israeli drones. The Mohajer 6 is said to have been delivered to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) since 2018. The drones have been used by militant groups like Hezbollah, Houthi and Hamas against Israel, Iran's arch-rival in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The satellite images also captured two additional Iranian naval vessels that were similarly modified from previously being commercial ships, the 'Shahid Mahdavi' and the 'Shahid Roudaki', which were anchored nearby.</p>

<p>The other two vessels do not have a ski-jump ramp, suggesting that it can be used for drones with the capability for vertical take-off and landing, unlike the Shahed and Mohajer drones which require a runway for takeoff.</p>

<p>Shahid Roudaki is a warship capable of carrying drones, helicopters and missile launchers. It was a merchant ship that was repurposed for military use, it's the third vessel modified for such use after Bagheri and Mahdavi. The 'X' on the ship's deck is the landing pad for a helicopter and the vessel can carry fast attack crafts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Iranian media reported that Shahid Mahdavi, which was commissioned in the IRGC Navy in March 2023, is "designed for long-range operations and is outfitted with missiles, air defence systems, and advanced radar technology." It can carry various types of attack helicopters, combat drones and fast attack crafts.</p>

<p>The Maxar satellite images, taken over some time, show the historical imagery views of the construction and modifications to the Shahid Bagheri in the shipyard of Iran Shipbuilding &amp; Offshore Industries Complex (ISOIC).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The images taken by Maxar suggest that the construction and modification for the Shahid Bagheri started at the beginning of 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first image taken on February 26, 2023, shows the vessel's deck being scrapped off and in dry dock at ISOICO shipyard in Iran at Bandar Abbad port near the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>The third image, taken two weeks later on November 30, 2023, shows Shahid Bagheri at the quay of the shipyard. Within 16 days, the ship was moved from the dry dock and anchored off the port. It is still in the early stages of construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The images show how the top of the ships were scraped off, suiting the needs of Iran, which is in direct conflict with Israel and a regional cold war with Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p><strong>The New Jersey Sightings</strong></p>

<p>The Maxar images come at a time when a US lawmaker claimed that Iran might be launching drones over New Jersey from a "mothership" off the East Coast. The Pentagon has debunked the claims saying "There is no truth to that."</p>

<p>"There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States and there's no so-called 'mothership' launching drones towards the United States," Reuters reported quoting Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh.</p>

<p>Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew said he had uncovered what appeared to be an Iranian plot.</p>

<p>"What we've uncovered is alarming - drones flying in from the direction of the ocean, possibly linked to a missing Iranian mothership," he said on X.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said an initial assessment had shown the drones were not from another country and that the US military had not shot them down because they did not pose a threat to any military installations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the Indian nationals in the Russian armed forces have been discharged and only 19 of them are currently deputed there, the government informed the Lok Sabha on Friday.</p>

<p>Minister of State for External Affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh shared the data in a written response to a query about the number of Indian nationals recruited for serving the Russian Army who are yet to be repatriated and the reasons for the delay in their release and repatriation despite assurances from the Russian authorities.</p>

<p>The query also sought to know whether the Indian nationals are deputed on the war front, if the Indian mission is able to contact all of them and the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the government for their early release and repatriation.</p>

<p>"As a result of concerted efforts by the government, most of the Indian nationals in the Russian armed forces have been discharged and several have been repatriated to India," Singh said in his reply.</p>

<p>According to the available information, "currently only 19 Indian nationals remain in the Russian armed forces", he said.</p>

<p>The government has requested the Russian authorities concerned to provide an update on the whereabouts of the remaining Indian nationals in the Russian armed forces and also ensure their safety, well-being and early discharge, the minister said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named Francois Bayrou his fourth prime minister of 2024, tasking the veteran centrist with steering the country out of its second major political crisis in the last six months.</p>

<p>The priority for Bayrou, a close Macron ally, will be passing a special law to roll over the 2024 budget, with a nastier battle over the 2025 legislation looming early next year. Parliamentary pushback over the 2025 bill led to the downfall of former Prime Minister Michel Barnier's government.</p>

<p>Bayrou, 73, is expected to put forward his list of ministers in the coming days, but will likely face the same existential difficulties as Barnier in steering legislation through a hung parliament comprising three warring blocs. His proximity to the deeply unpopular Macron will also prove a vulnerability.</p>

<p>France's festering political malaise has raised doubts about whether Macron will complete his second presidential term, which ends in 2027. It has also lifted French borrowing costs and left a power vacuum in the heart of Europe, just as Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House.</p>

<p>Macron spent the days after Barnier's ouster speaking to leaders from the conservatives to the Communists, seeking to lock in support for Bayrou. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and the hard-left France Unbowed were excluded.</p>

<p>Any involvement of the Socialist Party in a coalition may cost Macron in next year's budget.</p>

<p>"Now we will see how many billions the support of the Socialist Party will cost," a government adviser said on Friday.</p>

<h2><strong>NO LEGISLATIVE ELECTION BEFORE SUMMER</strong></h2>

<p>Macron will hope Bayrou can stave off no-confidence votes until at least July, when France will be able to hold a new parliamentary election, but his own future as president will inevitably be questioned if the government should fall again.</p>

<p>Bayrou, the founder of the Democratic Movement (MoDem) party which has been a part of Macron's ruling alliance since 2017, has himself run for president three times, leaning on his rural roots as the longtime mayor of the south-western town of Pau.</p>

<p>Macron appointed Bayrou as justice minister in 2017 but he resigned only weeks later amid an investigation into his party's alleged fraudulent employment of parliamentary assistants. He was cleared of fraud charges this year.</p>

<p>Bayrou's first real test will come early in the new year when lawmakers need to pass a belt-tightening 2025 budget bill.</p>

<p>However, the fragmented nature of the National Assembly, rendered nigh-on ungovernable after Macron's June snap election, means Bayrou will likely be living day-to-day, at the mercy of the president's opponents, for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Barnier's budget bill, which aimed for 60 billion euros in savings to assuage investors increasingly concerned by France's 6% deficit, was deemed too miserly by the far-right and left, and the government's failure to find a way out of the gridlock has seen French borrowing costs push higher still.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has ordered the military to "prepare to remain" throughout the winter in the UN-patrolled buffer zone that is supposed to separate Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has ordered the military to "prepare to remain" throughout the winter in the UN-patrolled buffer zone that is supposed to separate Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Israel seized the demilitarised zone on the strategic plateau on Sunday, just hours after Syrian rebels swept president Bashar al-Assad from power.</p>

<p>Since then, the Israeli military has launched hundreds of air and naval strikes against Syrian military assets, targeting everything from chemical weapons stores to air defences to prevent them from falling into rebel hands.</p>

<p>The plan to deploy troops in the buffer zone comes at a time when Israeli forces are still withdrawing from southern Lebanon after fighting Hezbollah militants for months and the war in Gaza with Palestinian militants continues.</p>

<p>"Due to the situation in Syria, it is of critical security importance to maintain our presence at the summit of Mount Hermon, and everything must be done to ensure the (army's) readiness on-site to enable the fighters to stay there despite the challenging weather conditions," Katz's spokesman said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>Mount Hermon is Syria's highest peak and has long boasted a UN observation post at the summit.</p>

<p>Israel has said it seized the buffer zone to defend itself.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Thursday that the collapse of Assad's rule had created a "vacuum on Israel's border and in the buffer zone".</p>

<p>"This deployment is temporary until a force that is committed to the 1974 (armistice) agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed."</p>

<p>Israel captured most of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>

<p>It held onto the territory during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and in 1981 annexed the area in a move since recognised only by the United States.</p>

<p><strong>'Temptation to stay long'</strong></p>

<p>Israel's seizure of the buffer zone has triggered widespread international criticism, including from UN chief Antonio Guterres.</p>

<p>Mr Guterres "is deeply concerned by the recent and extensive violations of Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The Secretary-General is particularly concerned over the hundreds of Israeli air strikes on several locations in Syria."</p>

<p>The UN says Israel's seizure of the buffer zone violates the 1974 armistice.</p>

<p>Guterres urges "the parties to the agreement to uphold their obligations under this instrument, including by ending all unauthorised presence in the area of separation and refraining from any action that would undermine the ceasefire and stability in Golan," Dujarric said.</p>

<p>Israel's key military ally the United States has called for the Israeli incursion to be "temporary".</p>

<p>Analysts say Israel is concerned that any remaining stocks of chemical or other strategic weapons that Assad's forces had held onto could fall into the hands of jihadist groups, who might use them against it.</p>

<p>Michael Horowitz, an expert on regional geopolitics, expects Israeli forces to remain in the zone for several months carrying out "surveillance missions".</p>

<p>"The duration of the Israeli operation will depend on the stability and intention of the new Syrian regime," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Although Syria's new rulers have sent conciliatory messages internationally, Israel is not ready to take any risks, he said.</p>

<p>"There is also the specific question of Mount Hermon, a strategic point as it dominates three countries (Lebanon, Syria, and Israel)," Horowitz said.</p>

<p>"In the current chaos, and given the composition of the Israeli government, I believe the temptation will be very strong to stay on the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, even in the longer term."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President-elect Donald Trump could tighten H-1B visa rules after taking office on January 20th next year. In 2020, he tried to prune immigrants coming in by issuing an executive order suspending issuance of H-1B visas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, whose net worth recently spiked to $400 billion, in a historic first, had started his professional journey working illegally in the United States decades ago. And now, his Tesla, depends on H-1B workers. In fact, it became a top-25 employer of H-1B workers as per U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, about 580,000 people were on H-1B visas in 2019.</p>

<p>Regardless, President-elect Donald Trump could tighten H-1B visa rules after taking office on January 20th next year.</p>

<p>In 2020, he tried to prune immigrants coming in by issuing an executive order suspending issuance of H-1B visas and the entry of visa holders in the US, citing that this would protect American jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless, it was shot down as it was not in the president's authority to do the same.</p>

<p>The United States caps H-1B visas at 65,000 every year, with an additional 20,000 visas for US advanced degree holders.</p>

<p>"Trump's stricter immigration stance could lead to changes in visa rules, impacting Indian IT professionals and raising costs for Indian IT companies," the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) Founder, Ajay Srivastava said.</p>

<p>Trump's restrictive immigration policies raise concerns for the future of the H-1B visa program and his first term was fraught with policies that denied visa renewals that made it difficult for skilled foreign workers to be hired.</p>

<p>But with Elon Musk in the picture, co-chair of the newly announced Department of Government Efficiency, who had 1,787 H-1B visas approved for Tesla employees this year, we could see a clash of interests.</p>

<p>The "technoking", as Musk prefers his nickname, had worked illegally on a student visa for a Stanford University graduate program that he did not enrol in to launch his tech career in the US.</p>

<p>David Sacks, another tech executive who will work for the Trump administration might just cause some pushback on the same, as he had said that tech CEOs want more H-1B visas.</p>

<p>In a podcast called "All-In" co-hosted by Sacks, tech investor Jason Calacanis and two other tech entrepreneurs, Calacanis had asked Trump if he would expand H-1B visas for tech workers.</p>

<p>"The more important point, I think, Mr. President, is we need high-skilled workers in this country," Calacanis said. "Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest from around the world to America?"</p>

<p>Trump said, "I do promise, but I happen to agree, that's why I promise. Otherwise, I wouldn't promise."</p>

<p>However, walking back on his promise, his campaign stated that only "the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America" would be able to stay, that too after "the most aggressive vetting process".</p>

<p>But it will be interesting to see how the administration handles this challenge if Musk and Sacks decide to buttress H-1B visas.<br />

</div>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has been named <em>Time </em>magazine's ‘Person of the Year,' underscoring the continuing centrality of his personality in shaping US politics and global discourse. This was the second time he got this recognition. It was inevitable, of course, given the nature of his victory in the November Presidential elections. The liberal media has been one of the most vocal opponents of Trump and his policies, but in the end, it is now forced to acknowledge that it remains out of touch with mainstream America. And Trump will not let them forget this easily.</p>

<p>In the last few days, Trump has been outlining his administration's policy priorities and making it quite clear that he sees no need to go back on most aspects of his campaign promises. Looking back on his win against Vice-President Kamala Harris last month, Trump has asserted that his campaign resonated with the country by focusing on immigration, the economy, and other key issues that he has argued were more in tune with voters' concerns than the Democratic message. “I don't think they [the Democrats] got the feel of the country,” Trump has asserted. According to him, the Republican Party has become the party of “common sense”. Not only did he win the popular mandate this time, but the Republicans will also be in control of both the US House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>

<h2><strong>'Bring It Back'</strong></h2>

<p>Trump feels vindicated of his assessment of the popular mood and in his interviews, therefore, he is making it clear that he intends to take his agenda forward.&nbsp;The tone, however, is softer and gentler in his interviews and he is talking of uniting the country by working to ensure its success. In his words: “I'm really looking to make our country successful. I'm not looking to go back into the past. I'm looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success. If we can make our success—his country successful, that would be my greatest—that would be such a great achievement. Bring it back.”</p>

<p>But he has also talked of the possibility that his former political opponents like Liz Cheney could face jail time. He has also underlined that he believes “a vast majority” of the nearly 1,200 people who have either pleaded guilty or were found guilty at trial for crimes connected to the January 6 attack should not be in jail. He will begin reviewing possible pardons “in the first hour” he assumes office.</p>

<h2><strong>Immigrants Prime Target</strong></h2>

<p>Immigration seems to be his core priority, with illegal immigration being described by him as “an invasion of our country” requiring the use of the National Guard and local law enforcement along with the military in deportation processes, something that can be legally challenging. He is threatening nations not willing to take back immigrants with tariffs, underscoring that “if they don't take them back, we won't do business with those countries, and we will tariff those countries very substantially”. Trump has also reiterated his campaign pledge to abolish birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and hinted that he might try to overturn this right through executive action.</p>

<p>Other domestic issues that have emerged as key for Trump in the early days of his administration are managing high inflation, reviving the US oil industry (“Drill, Baby, Drill”), and the downsizing of the federal Department of Education and transferring most responsibilities to state governments. Trump is calling for a “virtual closure of the Department of Education in Washington,” something that would require Congressional acquiescence.</p>

<h2><b>An 'Agreement' On Ukraine</b></h2>

<p>On the foreign policy front too, he is making the dividing line with his predecessor quite clear. He has underlined his “vehement” disagreement with the Biden administration's policy of allowing Ukraine to use US-provided long-range weapons, called Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, to strike deep into Russian territory, arguing that this policy was “just escalating this war and making it worse”. He continues to suggest that he does not intend to abandon Ukraine. But the way to do this, for Trump, is to reach an agreement, as the war is a “tragedy” with a “staggering” number of people killed on both sides of the conflict.</p>

<p>On the Middle East, he has something new to say. In his last term, he had called for “a realistic two-state solution”, but now he seems to be suggesting that he supports “whatever solution we can do to get peace”, that there are “other ideas other than two-state.” In a striking assessment, he said that he wants “a long-lasting peace, a peace where we don't have an October 7 in another three years. And there are numerous ways you can do it. You can do it two-state, but there are numerous ways it can be done.” This is open to interpretation in several ways, and that's perhaps what Trump intended.</p>

<h2><strong>Keeping It Straight</strong></h2>

<p>And finally, tariffs remain Trump's favourite tools of statecraft. He intends to continue to target three of America's largest trading partners—Mexico, Canada and China—with tariffs, though interestingly, he has also said he “can't guarantee” tariffs won't lead to a spike in prices of goods for Americans.</p>

<p>Trump's priorities are clear and his agenda is beginning to take shape. His nominations are also final. Apart from Matt Gaetz, Trump has stood by most of his nominees despite some murmurs from the Senate. As the year ends, the Trump phenomenon is once again beginning to reshape the US and, with it, the wider world—for good or for bad, only time will tell.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 15-year-old boy in the US suffered severe injuries and had his finger amputated after his vape exploded in his face. According to <em>People</em>, Aiden Dean Adams from California wasn't allowed to vape and his parents had warned him about the health risks associated with vaping. However, the teenager continued to hide his vapes from his parents and would go out for walks around the neighbourhood. One day, when the 15-year-old sneaked out of his house to smoke from his vape, his device unexpectedly exploded, leaving him severely injured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aiden's father, Robert Dean Adams, recalled the horrifying incident. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/vape-explodes-fingers-amputated-teen-8760485" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>People</em></a>, he said that when Aiden's device wasn't working properly, he hit it against the ground and knocked it into place. As he brought it up to his mouth, the vape exploded. "Boom," his father recalled. "A big flash is all (Aiden) remembers," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Mr Adams, when the vape exploded, shrapnel went flying and cut his face and his fingers were left bloody and mangled. The 15-year-old walked out towards the road and waved down a driver who was able to drive him back home. Mr Adams said that both of his son's hands looked "horrible", his shirt was covered in blood and parts of his hair were signed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The palm of his hand was just turned inside out. It's the first time I'd ever seen an explosive injury first-hand," Mr Adams said. "There was a lot of soft tissue damage. Digits were hanging. A lot of tissue exposure. You could see bone, fingers, hand, ligaments. His whole inside left hand was completely exposed," he continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It did almost completely sever his thumb. The very base of the thumb all the way down to where it meets the wrist. That was all hanging off," the father added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aiden's parents then immediately called an ambulance. After arriving at the hospital, the 15-year-old was taken into surgery and doctors spent hours trying to save his fingers. While they were able to save his thumb, part of his middle and index finger had to be amputated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The father expressed his frustration with how popular vaping has become over the years, especially among young children. "This stuff popped up out of nowhere. I don't remember it ever being advertised to people other than seeing kids with it. That's who you see more than anybody are the children. I never trusted these things. I don't like them," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But we've put a device out there that can get into the hands of kids that apparently has a highly explosive possibility. That right there, people need to know about and be educated on. If they were, these things probably wouldn't be here," Mr Adams added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk is planning to develop Starbase as a self-sufficient hub for rocket innovation and beyond.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk on Thursday (Dec 12) formally launched his bid to transform SpaceX's South Texas Starship launch site, known as Starbase, into an incorporated city. Situated in Boca Chica at the edge of Rio Grande Valley, Mr Musk is planning to develop Starbase as a self-sufficient hub for rocket innovation and beyond. The development comes in the backdrop of Mr Musk moving the headquarters of SpaceX and his social media company X from California to Texas, earlier this year.</p>

<p>"SpaceX HQ will now officially be in the city of Starbase, Texas!" wrote Musk on X (formerly Twitter) while quote-posting the letter, addressed to Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino Jr., the county's top elected official.</p>

<p>"To continue growing the workforce necessary to rapidly develop and manufacture Starship, we need the ability to grow Starbase as a community. That is why we are requesting that Cameron County call an election to enable the incorporation of Starbase as the newest city in the Rio Grande Valley," read the letter by Kathryn Lueders, the general manager of Starbase.</p>

<p>The company, responsible for revolutionising the rocket business with reusable vessels, stated that incorporating Starbase will streamline the processes required to build the amenities necessary to make the area a world-class place to live for those already living there as well as for future workers who might arrive to work at Starbase.</p>

<p>"As you know, through agreements with the County, SpaceX currently performs several civil functions around Starbase due to its remote location, including management of the roads, utilities, and the provision of schooling and medical care for the residents. Incorporation would move the management of some of these functions to a more appropriate public body," the letter added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Bashar al-Assad confided in almost no one about his plans to flee Syria as his reign collapsed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bashar al-Assad confided in almost no one about his plans to flee Syria as his reign collapsed. Instead, aides, officials and even relatives were deceived or kept in the dark, more than a dozen people with knowledge of the events told Reuters.</p>

<p>Hours before he escaped for Moscow, Assad assured a meeting of about 30 army and security chiefs at the defence ministry on Saturday that Russian military support was on its way and urged ground forces to hold out, according to a commander who was present and requested anonymity to speak about the briefing.</p>

<p>Civilian staff were none the wiser, too.</p>

<p>Assad told his presidential office manager on Saturday when he finished work he was going home but instead headed to the airport, according to an aide in his inner circle.</p>

<p>He also called his media adviser, Buthaina Shaaban, and asked her to come to his home to write him a speech, the aide said. She arrived to find no one was there.</p>

<p>"Assad didn't even make a last stand. He didn't even rally his own troops," said Nadim Houri, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative regional think-tank. "He let his supporters face their own fate."</p>

<p>Reuters was unable to contact Assad in Moscow, where he has been granted political asylum. Interviews with 14 people familiar with his final days and hours in power paint a picture of a leader casting around for outside help to extend his 24-year rule before leaning on deception and stealth to plot his exit from Syria in the early hours of Sunday.</p>

<p>Most of the sources, who include aides in the former president's inner circle, regional diplomats and security sources and senior Iranian officials, asked for their names to be withheld to freely discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Assad didn't even inform his younger brother, Maher, commander of the Army's elite 4th Armoured Division, about his exit plan, according to three aides. Maher flew a helicopter to Iraq and then to Russia, one of the people said.</p>

<p>Assad's maternal cousins, Ehab and Eyad Makhlouf, were similarly left behind as Damascus fell to the rebels, according to a Syrian aide and Lebanese security official. The pair tried to flee by car to Lebanon but were ambushed on the way by rebels who shot Ehab dead and wounded Eyad, they said. There was no official confirmation of the death and Reuters was unable to independently verify the incident.</p>

<p>Assad himself fled Damascus by plane on Sunday, Dec. 8, flying under the radar with the aircraft's transponder switched off, two regional diplomats said, escaping the clutches of rebels storming the capital. The dramatic exit ended his 24 years of rule and his family's half a century of unbroken power, and brought the 13-year civil war to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>He flew to Russia's Hmeimim airbase in the Syrian coastal city of Latakia, and from there on to Moscow.</p>

<p>Assad's immediate family, wife Asma and their three children, were already waiting for him in the Russian capital, according to three former close aides and a senior regional official.</p>

<p>Videos of Assad's home, taken by rebels and citizens who thronged the presidential complex following his flight and posted on social media, suggest he made a hasty exit, showing cooked food left on the stove and several personal belongings left behind, such as family photo albums.</p>

<p><strong>Russia And Iran: No Military Rescue&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There would be no military rescue from Russia, whose intervention in 2015 had helped turn the tide of the civil war in favour of Assad, or from his other staunch ally Iran.</p>

<p>This had been made clear to the Syrian leader in the days leading up to his exit, when he sought aid from various quarters in a desperate race to cling to power and secure his safety, according to the people interviewed by Reuters.</p>

<p>Assad visited Moscow on Nov. 28, a day after Syrian rebel forces attacked the northern province of Aleppo and lightning drive across the country, but his pleas for military intervention fell on deaf ears in the Kremlin which was unwilling to intervene, three regional diplomats said.</p>

<p>Hadi al-Bahra, the head of Syria's main opposition abroad, said that Assad didn't convey the reality of the situation to aides back home, citing a source within Assad's close circle and a regional official.</p>

<p>"He told his commanders and associates after his Moscow trip that military support was coming," Bahra added. "He was lying to them. The message he received from Moscow was negative."</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Russia had spent a lot of effort in helping stabilise Syria in the past but its priority now was the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Four days after that trip, on Dec. 2, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with Assad in Damascus. By that time, the rebels from the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group had taken control of Syria's second-largest city Aleppo and were sweeping southwards as government forces crumbled.</p>

<p>Assad was visibly distressed during the meeting, and conceded that his army was too weakened to mount an effective resistance, a senior Iranian diplomat told Reuters.</p>

<p>Assad never requested that Tehran deploy forces in Syria though, according to two senior Iranian officials who said he understood that Israel could use any such intervention as a reason to target Iranian forces in Syria or even Iran itself.</p>

<p>The Kremlin and Russian foreign ministry declined to comment for this article, while the Iranian foreign ministry was not immediately available to comment.</p>

<p><strong>Assad Confronts Own Downfall&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>After exhausting his options, Assad finally accepted the inevitability of his downfall and resolved to leave the country, ending his family's dynastic rule which dates back to 1971.</p>

<p>Three members of Assad's inner circle said he initially wanted to seek refuge in the United Arab Emirates, as rebels seized Aleppo and Homs and were advancing towards Damascus.</p>

<p>They said he was rebuffed by the Emiratis who feared an international backlash for harbouring a figure subject to U.S. and European sanctions for allegedly using chemical weapons in a crackdown on insurgents, accusations that Assad has rejected as a fabrication.</p>

<p>The UAE government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Yet Moscow, while unwilling to intervene militarily, was not prepared to abandon Assad, according to a Russian diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, attending the Doha forum in Qatar on Saturday and Sunday, spearheaded the diplomatic effort to secure the safety of Assad, engaging Turkey and Qatar to leverage their connections to HTS to secure Assad's safe exit to Russia, two regional officials said.</p>

<p>One Western security source said that Lavrov did "whatever he could" to secure Assad's safe departure.</p>

<p>Qatar and Turkey made arrangements with HTS to facilitate Assad's exit, three of the sources said, despite official claim by both countries that they had no contacts with HTS, which is designated by the U.S. and the U.N. as a terrorist organisation.</p>

<p>Moscow also coordinated with neighbouring states to ensure that a Russian plane leaving Syrian airspace with Assad on board would not be intercepted or targeted, three of the sources said.</p>

<p>Qatar's foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to queries about Assad's exit, while Reuters was unable to reach HTS for comment.</p>

<p>Assad's last prime minister, Mohammed Jalali, said he spoke to his then-president on the phone on Saturday night at 10.30 pm.</p>

<p>"In our last call, I told him how difficult the situation was and that there was huge displacement (of people) from Homs toward Latakia ... that there was panic and horror in the streets," he told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV this week.</p>

<p>"He replied: 'Tomorrow, we will see'," Jalali added. "'Tomorrow, tomorrow', was the last thing he told me."</p>

<p>Jalali said he tried to call Assad again as dawn broke on Sunday, but there was no response.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[TikTok's heavy reliance on video streaming has made it one of the more energy-intensive platforms, contributing to a substantial carbon footprint.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An astonishing new study has claimed that TikTok's annual carbon footprint is greater than most social media platforms and probably greater than that of Greece. An average user of the short-video app was generating greenhouse gases equivalent to driving an extra 198 kilometres in a gasoline-powered car each year, according to estimates from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://greenly.earth/en-gb/leaf-media/data-stories/the-hidden-environmental-cost-of-social-media" rel="noindex nofollow"><em>Greenly</em></a>, as published by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/12/tiktok-carbon-footprint" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Guardian</em></a>. The ByteDance-owned company has emerged as one of the world's most popular social media platforms in recent years, primarily due to its short video content and highly engaging algorithm.</p>

<p>The platform's heavy reliance on video streaming has made it one of the more energy-intensive platforms, contributing to a substantial environmental footprint. The carbon accounting consultancy, based in Paris, placed TikTok's 2023 emissions in the US, UK and France at about 7.6 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) which is higher than X (formerly Twitter) and Snapchat in the same region.</p>

<p>However, given that the US, UK and France make up just 15 per cent of TikTok's global user base, the overall carbon footprint of the platform is likely around 50 million metric tonnes of CO2e. Comparatively, Greece's annual carbon emissions for 2023 were 51.67m metric tonnes of CO2e.</p>

<p>“Behind every social media post or video is a vast digital infrastructure, powered by data centres and servers that consume significant amounts of electricity. Much of this electricity is still derived from carbon-intensive sources such as coal, oil, and gas, meaning that each digital action contributes to global carbon emissions," the report noted.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tiktok-user-helps-us-cops-arrest-suspect-who-fatally-shot-ex-girlfriend-3-years-ago-7232029" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | TikTok User Helps US Cops Arrest Suspect Who Fatally Shot Ex-Girlfriend 3 Years Ago</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>TikTok's addictiveness</strong></h3>

<p>The reason for TikTok's increased carbon footprint has been linked to its addictiveness with daily users spending an average of 45.8 minutes per day on the platform. The report added that one minute on TikTok burns 2.921 grams of CO2e while one minute on YouTube burns 2.923 grams. One minute on Instagram burns 2.912 grams.</p>

<p>“The whole algorithm is built around the massification of videos. Addictiveness also has consequences in terms of incentivizing people to generate more and more [of a carbon] footprint on an individual basis," said Alexis Normand, the chief executive of Greenly.</p>

<p>TikTok refuted the study's findings with a spokesperson telling <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/2024/12/13/tiktok-carbon-footprint-emissions-doomscrolling-greece-greenly/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Fortune </em></a>that ByteDance's 2023 total carbon emissions, covering all operations beyond TikTok, were less than 20 per cent of the estimated emissions by Greenly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mikhail Shatsky, deputy general designer and head of its software department of the Mars Design Bureau, a Russian company that develops missiles used in Moscow's war with Ukraine, has been killed, according to <em>Kyiv Independent.</em></p>

<p>He was shot dead by an unknown assassin in Kuzminsky Forest Park, at Kotelniki, eight miles southeast of the Kremlin in the Moscow region, according to the Astra Telegram channel and other Russian and Ukrainian sources.</p>

<p>Shatsky was employed by a company that creates and produces onboard guidance systems for the Russian space and military industries. It has been a part of the state corporation Rosatom's department since December 2017.</p>

<p>He was also an associate professor and was working actively on upgrading the Russian Kh-59 cruise missile to the Kh-69 level, which Russian troops use to strike Ukraine.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://kyivindependent.com/shatsky/"><em> Kyiv Independent,</em></a> Shatsky was seen as the main proponent of incorporating AI technology into Russian drones, aircraft, and spacecraft.</p>

<p>Shatsky's death was previously reported by Ukrainian-Russian anti-Kremlin journalist Alexander Nevzorov, who wrote on his Telegram channel that HUR "eliminated a particularly dangerous criminal."</p>

<p>Nevzorov shared photos of a person resembling Shatsky lying dead in the snow. The man was reportedly killed in the Kuzminsky forest park near Kotelniki in Moscow Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.</p>

<p>"Anyone who is involved in the development of the Russian military-industrial complex and support of Russian aggression in Ukraine in one way or another is a legitimate target of the Defence Forces," the source said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Basim Faiz Mawat and Mohammed Hanania visited the Damascus cell that they used to call the 'death dormitory' where their guards never showed mercy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Basim Faiz Mawat stood in the Damascus cell that his fellow prisoners used to call the "death dormitory", struggling to believe that the system that abused him for so long had been overthrown and his suffering had ended.</p>

<p>"I came here today only to see that truly nothing lasts forever," the 48-year-old said as he and another freed prisoner, Mohammed Hanania, visited the detention centre where their guards never showed mercy.</p>

<p>They were among thousands who spilled out of Syria's prison system on Sunday after a lightning rebel advance overthrew President Bashar al-Assad and ended five decades of his family's rule. Many detainees were met by tearful relatives who thought they had been executed years earlier.</p>

<p>"Every day in this room, which used to be called 'Steel 1 - the death dormitory,' one to three people would die inside every day," Hanania, 35, told Reuters.</p>

<p>“The sergeant was — when he didn't lose someone, when someone didn't die from weakness, he would kill him. He took them to the toilets and hit them with the heel of his shoe on their heads."</p>

<p>Hanania walked on past long rows of empty cells. Names of prisoners - Mohammed al-Masry, Ahmed and others - were scratched on walls with dates.</p>

<p>The floors were littered with rubble and discarded clothes. A row of blankets was still set out in one cell where prisoners had slept.</p>

<p>Both men looked up at an image on a wall of Assad, who is accused of torturing and killing thousands, abuses that were also rampant during his father Hafez's reign of terror.</p>

<p>"No one could have believed this would happen," said Mawat.</p>

<p><strong>Mass Executions</strong></p>

<p>In another room, he stood beside a rusty blue ladder and described how he was blindfolded and forced to climb up the steps. Then his torturer would kick away the ladder and he would be suspended by his arms from the ceiling in agony.</p>

<p>"My shoulders were torn, and I couldn't say a single word. No one could bear more than five or 10 minutes," he said.</p>

<p>Rights groups have reported mass executions in Syria's prisons. In 2017, the United States said it had identified a new crematorium at the Sednaya military prison on the outskirts of Damascus to dispose of hanged prisoners.</p>

<p>Syrians have flocked to the prisons looking for their loved ones. Some have been released alive, others have been identified among the dead and thousands more have not yet been found.</p>

<p>Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani - the main commander of the rebels who toppled Assad, has said he will close the prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees.</p>

<p>Assad fled to his ally Russia where he was granted asylum.</p>

<p>"At this stage, if everyone thinks about taking revenge, we have no solution other than to forgive," Hanania said.</p>

<p>"But the criminal who has blood (on their hands) should be held accountable. I will leave my rights to be granted by God."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA has finally revealed why its Ingenuity Helicopter crashed on the Martian surface in January, earlier this year. Engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and AeroVironment conducted the in-depth assessment and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-performs-first-aircraft-accident-investigation-on-another-world/" rel="noindex, nofollow">concluded </a>that the failure of Ingenuity's navigation system to provide accurate data "during the flight likely caused a chain of events that ended the mission". As per the flight data, Ingenuity reached an altitude of 12 metres, clicked the images and returned to the surface after 32 seconds but the communication was severed. After mission command on Earth re-established the communication, it was discovered that Ingenuity had sustained damage to its rotors.</p>

<p>"When running an accident investigation from 100 million miles away, you don't have any black boxes or eyewitnesses," said Ingenuity's first pilot, Havard Grip of JPL, adding: "While multiple scenarios are viable with the available data, we have one we believe is most likely: Lack of surface texture gave the navigation system too little information to work with."</p>

<p>Ingenuity's navigation system was designed to track visual features on the Martian surface using a camera over well-textured (pebbly) but flat terrain. During the fateful flight, Ingenuity was in a region of Jezero Crater that is filled with steep, relatively featureless sand ripples. The topography confused the helicopter and resulted in a hard impact which caused Ingenuity to pitch and roll.</p>

<p>"The rapid attitude change resulted in loads on the fast-rotating rotor blades beyond their design limits, snapping all four of them off at their weakest point - about a third of the way from the tip," the findings stated.</p>

<p>"The damaged blades caused excessive vibration in the rotor system, ripping the remainder of one blade from its root and generating an excessive power demand that resulted in loss of communications," it added.</p>

<h3><strong>Down but not out</strong></h3>

<p>The Perseverance Rover and Ingenuity Helicopter were both part of the Mars 2020 mission that blasted off Earth aboard an Atlas V rocket. While Perseverance continues to work flawlessly, Ingenuity suffered a cruel end but not before it accomplished some major tasks.</p>

<p>Ingenuity was designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over 30 days but managed to operate for almost three years, performing 72 flights and flying 30 times farther than planned. The inaugural Ingenuity flight took place on April 19, 2021, when the 1.8-kilogram flying object took off using its two counter-rotating blades.</p>

<p>Despite being grounded, Ingenuity still beams&nbsp;weather and avionics test data to Perseverance about once a week. NASA believes that the weather information may help future explorers of the Red Planet. The avionics data is already proving useful to engineers working on future designs of aircraft and other vehicles for the Red Planet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence has seamlessly integrated into nearly all back-office operations across professional industries, and in various ways, it has become a part of daily life through AI-enabled devices. From customer care chats to automated phone calls, many sectors already rely on AI-driven solutions. However, AI is now being utilised for a surprising purpose: simulating angry customers to train customer service executives to remain calm and composed while handling irate callers.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/angry-foul-mouthed-monster-robot-34296295"><em>the Daily Star,</em></a> scientists have built a foul-mouthed bad boy robot to help train customer service staff. The robot rotter can get angry, fly into a rage, and fire off volleys of expletive-laden abuse to teach workers how to handle complaints. US developers Furhat Robotics and audEERING say the machine monster is a 'social robot' that uses artificial intelligence to detect vocal expression. That means it can pick up on-and react to-people's moods. It can be programmed to become extremely angry and to curse and swear.</p>

<p>Louis Simeonidis, director of business development at Furhat Robotics, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/angry-foul-mouthed-monster-robot-34296295"><em>the news outlet,</em></a> "If we've done our job right, you should be able to walk up and engage with the robot just like your friend. You should be able to communicate and express with it the same way you would with other people.And it should be able to communicate back to you the way other people would communicate."</p>

<p>audEERING founder Florian Eyben added: "We can understand sarcasm, irony, and we can understand that you're actually maybe not in the best mood, and the way you say things matters here."</p>

<p>A technology expert who tested out the bot at the Voice &amp; AI Conference in Washington, DC, had to calm it down.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fashionable US drinkware brand Stanley on Thursday recalled 2.6 million travel mugs after faulty lids were found to pose a risk of burning users with hot liquid.</p>

<p>The US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued the recall of Stanley's Switchback and Trigger Action models, citing lid threads that shrink due to heat or usage.</p>

<p>The fault can cause the lid "to detach during use, posing a burn hazard," the commission said, adding Stanley had received 91 complaints worldwide, resulting in 38 burn injuries.</p>

<p>Stanley cups and mugs -- insulated, colorful and in all sizes -- have surged in popularity in recent years, starring in multiple TikTok clips and lifestyle memes.</p>

<p>New releases of limited edition cups have caused long queues outside stores and even tussles among desperate customers.</p>

<p>A woman was arrested in California earlier this year for allegedly stealing 65 Stanleys worth almost $2,500 from a sporting goods store.</p>

<p>The recalled items cost between $20 and $50.</p>

<p>Seattle-based Stanley said in a statement to US media that it was "committed to constant improvement and are focused on creating quality products that are built for life."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

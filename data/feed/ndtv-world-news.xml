       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stars of the screen are mourning the death of James Earl Jones, the voice of "Star Wars" villain Darth Vader, on Monday at the age of 93.</p>

<p>Jones, who also voiced King Mufasa in Disney's animated feature "The Lion King," had a prolific and varied career.</p>

<p>Over six decades he worked with some of the greatest figures in cinema and theater, including Stanley Kubrick in his 1964 Cold War satire "Dr Strangelove."</p>

<p>He also had roles in the Arnold Schwarzenegger film "Conan The Barbarian" and the 1989 Kevin Costner movie "Field of Dreams."</p>

<p>But it was for his role as one of cinema's most famous villains that he became most widely known.</p>

<p>While Darth Vader's immense physicality was the result of the towering British actor David Prowse, the sinister voice that appeared to emanate from inside the reconstructed man-in-a-mask was that of Jones.</p>

<p>And it was Jones who gave the "Star Wars" franchise some of its most memorable lines, including when he reveals to Luke Skywalker –- played by a young Mark Hamill -– "I am your father."</p>

<p>Hamill took to social media on Monday to share news of Jones' death, writing simply: "#RIP dad" with a broken heart emoji.</p>

<p>"Rustin" star Coleman Domingo wrote on social media that Jones was "a master of our craft."</p>

<p>"We stand on your shoulders. Rest now. You gave us your best."</p>

<p>Lydia Cornell, whose 1982 debut "Bloodtide," was opposite Jones, said: "Oh no!! I can't believe it!! I thought he was going to live forever."</p>

<p>"Adored working with him. Such a generous spirit, and so humble. Taught me the power of stillness and using my voice."</p>

<p>"Selma" Director Ava DuVernay posted images of Jones, accompanied by a heartfelt message.</p>

<p>"Thank you for showing us ourselves. Our complicated selves, our dignified selves, our smiles, our pain. A job well done. A gift beautifully shared. Bless you as you journey on."</p>

<p>Alongside a clip of Jones' 1974 film, "Claudine," she urged fans to seek it out if they have never seen it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones crying in a scene of this film is one of the most exquisite cinematic images of a Black man I've ever seen. Don't miss it. He gave us so much," she wrote.</p>

<p>"The Help" star Octavia Spencer posted a black and white photograph of Jones, alongside a tribute that nodded to his indelible role in "Star Wars."</p>

<p>"Legendary doesn't even begin to describe his iconic roles and impact on cinema forever," she wrote.</p>

<p>"His voice and talent will be remembered always. Sending love to his family, friends and countless fans in all the galaxies, far, far away."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said early Tuesday that a strike on the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone in the Palestinian territory's main southern city of Khan Yunis killed 40 people and wounded 60 others, with the Israeli army saying it had hit a Hamas command centre in the area.</p>

<p>Civil defence official Mohammed Al-Mughair told AFP that "40 martyrs and 60 injured were recovered and transferred" to nearby hospitals following the strike.</p>

<p>"Our crews are still working to recover 15 missing people as a result of targeting the tents of the displaced in Mawasi, Khan Yunis," Mughair added.</p>

<p>Civil defence sources said separately that the strike had left behind large craters.</p>

<p>"Entire families disappeared in the Mawasi Khan Yunis massacre, under the sand, in deep holes," said civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement early Tuesday that its aircraft had "struck significant Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control center embedded inside the Humanitarian Area in Khan Yunis".</p>

<p>"The terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip continue to systematically abuse civilian and humanitarian infrastructure, including the designated Humanitarian Area, to carry out terrorist activity against the State of Israel and IDF troops," it added.</p>

<p>Hamas said in a statement on Tuesday that claims its fighters were present at the scene of the strike were "a blatant lie".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani has said that diplomatic opportunities still exist to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.</p>

<p>Kanaani stated on Monday that the path to an agreement remains open if other involved parties show a practical commitment to fulfilling their obligations, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"We believe that the diplomatic opportunity still exists for all parties, especially those that refrained from implementing the agreement," Kanaani told reporters in Tehran.</p>

<p>He noted that Iran's Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi recently had a "good phone conversation" with the European Union (EU)'s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, expressing optimism about potential talks between Iran and the EU.</p>

<p>Iran signed the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with several major countries in 2015. The agreement imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>

<p>However, the US government under former President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in May 2018, reinstating sanctions and prompting Iran to scale back some of its nuclear commitments.</p>

<p>Efforts to revive the JCPOA began in April 2021 in Vienna, but no significant progress has been reported since the latest round of talks in August 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia, said that they will legislate a minimum age for social media to keep children safe.</p>

<p>Albanese said that it's about supporting parents and keeping kids safe.</p>

<p>In a post on X, he said, "We'll legislate a minimum age for social media to keep children safe."</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>He added, "Parents tell me they're worried about what age their kids should be on social media. We'll introduce legislation in this term of Parliament to enforce a minimum age for social media and other digital platforms. It's about supporting parents and keeping kids safe."</p>

<p></p>

<p>On August 21 last year, the University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health, more than half of parents rank mental health issues as the top health concern for their children and teens.</p>

<p>Overall, mental health and technology use topped this year's top ten list of parent worries about health-related issues for children in the United States, surpassing childhood obesity, which parents ranked as the top children's health issue a decade ago.</p>

<p>"Parents still view problems directly impacting physical health, including unhealthy eating and obesity, as important children's health issues. But these have been overtaken by concerns about mental health, social media and screen time," said Mott Poll co-director and Mott pediatrician Susan Woolford, MD, MPH.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of parents are worried about children's increased time on devices, including overall screen time and use of social media, taking the No.1 and No.2 spots on the list of children's health concerns this year, according to the nationally representative poll.</p>

<p>"Children are using digital devices and social media at younger ages, and parents may struggle with how to appropriately monitor use to prevent negative impacts on safety, self-esteem, social connections and habits that may interfere with sleep and other areas of health," Woolford said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple on Monday unveiled an artificial intelligence focused-iPhone 16 lineup, a sleeker Apple Watch, AirPods 4, and said new AI features will be added to its devices next month.</p>

<p>Here are some products tech behemoth Apple launched at the event:</p>

<p>NEW IPHONE LINEUP</p>

<p>The iPhone 16, starting at $799, comes in two sizes -- 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. The phones are powered by the new A18 chips, which feature a 16-core neural engine designed for generative AI-linked tasks and Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>The phones also come with a customizable action button, allowing users to perform a variety of functions such as recording voice memo, identifying songs, and translating phrases.</p>

<p>APPLE WATCH UPGRADES</p>

<p>Apple unveiled its latest Watch Series 10 starting at $399, which the company claims is its thinnest and fastest charging watch ever.</p>

<p>The Series 10 will be powered by Apple's new S10 chip, which includes a four-core neural engine that will allow machine learning activities and power features such as double tapping on device, Siri dictation, along with crash and fall detection.</p>

<p>Apple also highlighted the health-linked features of its watch, such as sleep apnea detection. The watch will monitor a new metric during sleep called breathing disturbances and will notify users if they display signs of sleep apnea.</p>

<p>AIRPOD MODELS</p>

<p>Apple's AirPods 4, powered by a new custom H2 chip, start at $129 and come with improved audio quality and personalized spatial audio.</p>

<p>Users can also interact with Siri while using the AirPods by nodding "yes" or shaking their head to say "no" in response to Siri announcements. The charging case has USB-C ports.</p>

<p>The company also said that its AirPods Pro 2 can now be "transformed" into a personalized hearing aid via an upcoming software update, boosting the specific sounds in real time, like parts of speech or elements within a user's environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple on Monday announced a new iPhone built for generative artificial intelligence as it seeks to boost sales and show it is keeping up in the technology race.</p>

<p>The tech giant has a lot riding on what would be the iPhone 16 and will hope that customers are enticed to buy the latest models, attracted by new AI powers.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to introduce the first iPhones designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence and its breakthrough capabilities," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said at an event at the iPhone-maker's Silicon Valley headquarters.</p>

<p>With $39 billion in sales last quarter, the iPhone counts for roughly 60 percent of Apple's revenue, and remains the main entryway to the company's services, such as the App Store or Apple TV, which are becoming a growing part of its business.</p>

<p>Apple is only just coming out of a long sales slump as users increasingly stick with older models longer.</p>

<p>"This iPhone 16 release is all about Apple Intelligence and the unleashing of the consumer AI Revolution through Cupertino," Wedbust analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, referring to Apple's home city.</p>

<p>"In essence Cupertino will be the gatekeeper of the consumer AI Revolution."</p>

<p>"Apple Intelligence" is a new suite of software features for all devices that was announced in June at the company's annual developers conference, where it also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.</p>

<p>"For years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been essential in delivering so many of the features and experiences you love," Cook said.</p>

<p>"In June, we launched Apple Intelligence, our powerful new personal intelligence system, which will have an incredible impact."</p>

<p>In the short-term, these include AI-infused image editing, translation, and small, creative touches in messaging, but not more ambitious breakthroughs promised by other AI players, such as OpenAI or Google.</p>

<p>Ives expects software makers to begin cranking out apps and services tuned with generative AI capabilities, fueling sales of iPhones.</p>

<p>Apple is expected to tailor new AirPod ear buds and smart watches to take advantage of AI capabilities and Siri digital assistant.</p>

<p>The company announced new models of Apple Watch and AirPods at the event.</p>

<p>By adding AI capabilities, Apple is looking to "shake that expectation" that iPhone launches are "just steady improvements in hardware and software," said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart.</p>

<p>Longer term, Apple could dramatically change the iPhone experience with a "super-powered Siri" working across all the apps, Greengart said.</p>

<p><strong>Pixel power</strong></p>

<p>Apple's announcement closely follows Google, which last month unveiled AI-infused Pixel 9 smartphones, its challenge to the iPhone.</p>

<p>Pixels account for a tiny sliver of the global smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple, but Google argued its new line is a chance to answer what -- after all the hype -- AI can actually do for customers.</p>

<p>"There have been so many promises, so many 'coming soons,' and not enough real world helpfulness when it comes to AI -- which is why today we're getting real," Google senior vice president of devices Rick Osterloh said at the Pixel 9 launch.</p>

<p>Samsung has also showcased AI across a range of its consumer electronic products as it looks to extend its leadership in global smartphone sales.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard was sentenced to 11 years in prison on Monday after being convicted of four counts of sexual assault in attacks on women in his Toronto office building that in some cases date back for decades.</p>

<p>The 11-year sentence is reduced to take into account time he has already spent behind bars. Nygard has about 6.7 years left to serve and will be eligible for full parole after one-third of that.</p>

<p>Nygard, 83, was found guilty by a Toronto jury on four counts of sexual assault last November. He was acquitted of a fifth count of sexual assault and one count of forcible confinement.</p>

<p>During the six-week trial, the Ontario Superior Court heard testimony from five complainants who said during a period between the late 1980s to around 2005 Nygard had attacked them in a private bedroom suite on the top floor of the building.</p>

<p>Canadian police arrested Nygard in late 2020 at the request of the United States, where he was accused of using his businesses to lure women and girls to sexually gratify himself and his associates.</p>

<p>Toronto police laid their own charges against him about a year later. Nygard also faces charges of sexual assault and forcible confinement in Manitoba and Quebec.</p>

<p>He is fighting extradition to the U.S. where he faces federal charges in New York for nine offences including conspiracy to commit racketeering, transportation of a minor for purpose of prostitution, and sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion.</p>

<p>Born in Finland, Nygard grew up in the Canadian province of Manitoba, eventually running his namesake clothing company and becoming one of the wealthiest people in the country.</p>

<p>"Peter Nygard is a sexual predator. He is also a Canadian success story gone very wrong," Justice Robert Goldstein said Monday.</p>

<p>"He used his wealth and his power to commit four sexual assaults."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kate, Britain's Princess of Wales, said on Monday she had finished her course of preventative chemotherapy for cancer and would be carrying out a handful of public engagements later this year, but said her path to full recovery would be long.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate, Britain's Princess of Wales, said on Monday she had finished her course of preventative chemotherapy for cancer, saying the treatment had given her a new perspective and made her grateful for "simply loving and being loved".</p>

<p>Kate, 42, wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince William, underwent major abdominal surgery in January which revealed the presence of cancer and has been undergoing treatment since then.</p>

<p>In a personal message accompanying a unique video of her with her husband and their three young children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, Kate said she would be carrying out a handful of public engagements later this year, but said her path to full recovery would be long.</p>

<p>"As the summer comes to an end, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have finally completed my chemotherapy treatment," she said in her message.</p>

<p>"The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family. Life as you know it can change in an instant and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown."</p>

<p>Kate made her first public appearance since her health issues emerged in June at the annual military parade to mark the official birthday of King Charles. In July, she appeared at the Wimbledon tennis championships.</p>

<p>Her office, Kensington Palace, has declined to give any further details about the type of cancer or other specifics about her treatment, other than to say the preventative chemotherapy began in February.</p>

<p><strong>'SCARY'</strong></p>

<p>"The cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you," she said.</p>

<p>"With humility, it also brings you face to face with your own vulnerabilities in a way you have never considered before, and with that, a new perspective on everything.</p>

<p>"This time has above all reminded William and me to reflect and be grateful for the simple yet important things in life, which so many of us often take for granted. Of simply loving and being loved."</p>

<p>In the video, which was filmed in Norfolk, eastern England last month, the princess looked well and healthy.</p>

<p>The film showed the family walking through woods, carrying a cricket bat and ball, and Kate lying on a beach next to William. In other footage she was shown pushing Louis on a swing and being joined by her parents as they played a board game.</p>

<p>She and William were grateful for the global messages of support, she said, adding she was looking forward to returning to public duties when she was able, although her programme for the remainder of the year will remain light.</p>

<p>"Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes," said the princess, often referred to by her maiden name Kate Middleton.</p>

<p>"Despite all that has gone before, I enter this new phase of recovery with a renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life ... To all those who are continuing their own cancer journey - I remain with you, side by side, hand in hand. Out of darkness, can come light, so let that light shine bright."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi today visited Rajghat in New Delhi to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and planted a tree sapling, making him the third generation leader from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to plant a sapling at Rajghat.</p>

<p>He planted an Amaltas (Cassia Fistula) sapling as part of a unique tradition which previous leaders from the UAE have also followed.</p>

<p>In 1992, Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founding father of the UAE, had also planted an Amaltas sapling during his visit to India.</p>

<p>In 2016, his son, Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the current President of UAE, continued this tradition by planting a Molshri (Mimusops Elengi) sapling.</p>

<p>This marks the first time in the history of Rajghat that three generations of leaders from a single nation have planted trees honouring the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, signifying the deep-rooted and growing relationship between India and the UAE.</p>

<p>Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan arrived in New Delhi on Monday on his first official visit to India.</p>

<p>He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi today at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi. The two leaders signed multiple pacts on nuclear energy, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), oil, and food.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince later called on President Droupadi Murmu at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. "The President expressed satisfaction that during the Crown Prince's visit, India and UAE have further expanded the historic yet forward looking partnership through several agreements in new areas of cooperation," the President of India wrote on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The new school year in the Palestinian territories officially began on Monday, with all schools in Gaza shut after 11 months of war and no sign of a ceasefire.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new school year in the Palestinian territories officially began on Monday, with all schools in Gaza shut after 11 months of war and no sign of a ceasefire.</p>

<p>As fighting continued, Israel announced new orders to residents of the north Gaza Strip to leave their homes, in response to rockets fired into Israel.</p>

<p>Umm Zaki's son Moataz, 15, was supposed to begin 10th grade. Instead he woke up in their tent in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and was sent to fetch a container of water from more than a kilometre away.</p>

<p>"Usually, such a day would be a day of celebration, seeing the children in the new uniform, going to school, and dreaming of becoming doctors and engineers. Today all we hope is that the war ends before we lose any of them," the mother of five told Reuters by text message.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Education Ministry said all Gaza schools were shut and 90% of them had been destroyed or damaged in Israel's assault on the territory, launched after Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli towns in October last year.</p>

<p>The U.N. Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, which runs around half of Gaza's schools, has turned as many of them as it can into emergency shelters housing thousands of displaced families.</p>

<p>"The longer the children stay out of school the more difficult it is for them to catch up on their lost learning and the more prone they are to becoming a lost generation, falling prey to exploitation including child marriage, child labour, and recruitment into armed groups," UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma told Reuters.</p>

<p>In addition to the 625,000 Gazans already registered for school who would be missing classes, another 58,000 six-year-olds should have registered to start first grade this year, the education ministry said.</p>

<p>Last month, UNRWA launched a back-to-learning programme in 45 of its shelters, with teachers setting up games, drama, arts, music and sports activities to help with children's mental health.</p>

<p><strong>'THE SPECIFIED AREA HAS BEEN WARNED'</strong></p>

<p>Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been forced from their homes at least once, and some have had to flee as many as 10 times.</p>

<p>In the latest evacuation order, Israel told residents of an area in the northern Gaza Strip they must leave their homes, following the firing of rockets into southern Israel the previous day.</p>

<p>"To all those in the specified area. Terrorist organisations are once again firing rockets at the State of Israel and carrying out terrorist acts from this area. The specified area has been warned many times in the past. The specified area is considered a dangerous combat zone," an Israeli military spokesperson said in Arabic on X.</p>

<p>The United Nations urged Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip to attend medical facilities to get children under the age of 10 years old vaccinated against polio. Limited pauses in fighting have been held to allow the vaccination campaign, which aims to reach 640,000 children in Gaza after the territory's first polio case in around 25 years.</p>

<p>U.N. officials said the campaign in the southern and central Gaza Strip had so far reached more than half of the children there needing the drops. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first.</p>

<p>Later on Monday, Touma said 450,000 of the children targeted with the campaign were vaccinated.</p>

<p>"Tuesday is the hardest part when we roll out the campaign in the north. Hopefully, that will work so we complete the first stage of the campaign The second and final stage is planned for the end of the month when we have to do all of this all over again," said Touma.</p>

<p>Health officials said on Monday two separate Israeli airstrikes had killed seven people in central Gaza, while another strike killed one man in Khan Younis further south.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said they fought against Israeli forces in several areas across the Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar fire.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said forces continued to dismantle military infrastructure and killed dozens of militants in the past days, including senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad commanders.</p>

<p>The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when the Hamas group that ran Gaza attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 40,900 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry.</p>

<p>The two warring sides each blame the other for the failure so far to reach a ceasefire that would end the fighting and see the release of hostages.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The lawsuit filed by Chad Condit, claims that he was subjected to unwanted sexual advances and harassment while working as the senator's chief of staff.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawsuit has been filed against California State Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil, accusing her of keeping her married male chief of staff as a sex slave. The lawsuit filed by Chad Condit, claims that he was subjected to unwanted sexual advances and harassment while working as the senator's chief of staff, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/us-news/female-california-state-senator-allegedly-forced-male-staffer-to-perform-sex-acts-lawsuit/">New York Post</a></em> reported. Mr Condit revealed that he felt pressured to engage in sexual acts with his employer over several years to maintain his job security. He claimed that Alvarado-Gil had a proclivity for oral sex and that she treated it as a perk of power. He is now seeking monetary damages for the allegations including lost wages, loss of earning capacity, employee benefits and damages for emotional distress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scribd.com/document/766673247/Marie-Alvarado-Gil-Lawsuit">lawsuit</a>, filed in the Sacramento County Superior Court, claims that for much of 2023, state Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil (R-Jackson) ''engaged in erratic, controlling, sexually dominating abuse of authority and power'' against her chief of staff, Chad Condit.</p>

<p>It alleges that the Senator frequently demanded oral sex from her chief of staff, including in a vehicle, one of which led to a back injury. As a result, Mr Condit claimed he suffered three herniated discs in his back and a collapsed hip. He revealed that he&nbsp;began using his back injury as a reason to decline the Senator's advances in August last year. However, she responded by issuing a disciplinary letter accusing him of inappropriate behaviour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''This was a sex-based quid pro quo relationship of unwelcome advances and sexual behaviours coupled with punishment and flexing of power,'' according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Notably, Alvarado-Gil, who was elected in 2022, hired Chad Condit as her chief of staff. The lawsuit claims that shortly after taking office, the Senator began sharing personal and intimate details with him, including aspects of her dating life, divorces, and marital infidelity. According to the complaint, she also openly discussed her struggles and habits, including substance use and recreational activities.</p>

<p>However, she terminated his employment in December 2023 after he refused&nbsp;to wear a Santa Claus costume, which he claims was not required of other staff members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attorneys for Alvarado-Gil have denied the allegations, calling the claims ''bogus'' and ''financially motivated.''</p>

<p>''A disgruntled former employee has fabricated an outlandish story, presented without evidence, to get a payday. We expect that the Senator will be fully cleared of any wrongdoing of these bogus, financially motivated claims,'' attorney Ognian Gavrilov said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Senator also recently made headlines when she switched parties from Democrat to Republican, citing concerns that her former party's leadership and policies had changed in ways that no longer aligned with her values.</p>

<p>Alvardo-Gil is married and has six children.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A group of 10 retired top US military officials endorsed US Vice President Kamala Harris in a letter made public on Monday, saying she is the only presidential candidate fit to serve as the nation's commander in chief.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of 10 retired top US military officials endorsed US Vice President Kamala Harris in a letter made public on Monday, saying she is the only presidential candidate fit to serve as the nation's commander in chief and calling her Republican rival Donald Trump "a danger to our national security and democracy."</p>

<p>The letter, signed by Retired General Larry Ellis and Retired Rear Admiral Michael Smith, among others, cited Trump's comments disparaging members of the military and his own "chaotic approach" to Afghanistan ahead of the US withdrawal, including negotiating a deal with the Taliban that allowed 5,000 of the group's fighters to return to the battlefield.</p>

<p>In contrast, they wrote, Kamala Harris "has demonstrated her ability to take on the most difficult national security challenges in the Situation Room and on the international stage," from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to tensions with China in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>"Harris is the best - and only - presidential candidate in this race who is fit to serve as our commander in chief," they wrote in the letter posted on X by Kamala Harris' campaign.</p>

<p>The Democratic vice president and Trump, who is running for the third time after serving from 2017 to early 2021, face a tight race before the Nov. 5 election in an unprecedented contest in which the future of American democracy looms large.</p>

<p>The letter coincided with a new Kamala Harris campaign ad released before the two candidates' Tuesday night debate featuring former Trump officials warning that a second Trump presidency would pose major risks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In 2016 Donald Trump said he would choose only the best people to work in his White House. Now, those people have a warning for America. Trump is not fit to be president again, fears his vice president," the ad says. It featured videos from Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, former Defense Secretary Mike Esper, former national security adviser John Bolton, and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The letter also comes a day before House Speaker Mike Johnson hosts a congressional gold medal ceremony honoring the 13 service members killed in the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal in August 2021. Trump and his fellow Republicans have tried to blame Kamala Harris for the Afghanistan pullout, with those in Congress issuing a report on Monday.</p>

<p>The retired military officials, in their letter, blamed Trump for "failing to take responsibility for his own role in putting service members in harm's way," noting his deal to free Taliban fighters without involving the Afghan government and for not leaving a withdrawal plan after he left office following his 2020 election loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Monday that it would not grant an interview with President Vladimir Putin to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was released by Russia this summer in a prisoner swap.</p>

<p>Gershkovich made a hand-written request to interview Putin while filling out a form requesting a presidential pardon ahead of the prisoner exchange, the Journal reported.</p>

<p>"So far we are not interested in such an interview. For there to be an interview with foreign media and some specific one, we need to have an occasion," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>"So far we don't see such an occasion," he said.</p>

<p>Gershkovich was one of 16 people freed by Russia in August's landmark prisoner swap with the West.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old spent more than 16 months in Russian detention on espionage charges that he, his employer and the White House denounced as false.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has repeatedly rebuffed calls for a Western journalist to question Putin, granting only one such interview, to the controversial US talk show host Tucker Carlson in February.</p>

<p>Gershkovich, a respected Moscow correspondent, was arrested on a reporting trip in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, his company, 99 Speed Mart Retail Holdings Bhd, made a triumphant debut on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, raising $531 million in Malaysia's largest initial public offering (IPO) in seven years. As the stock soared up to 15% on its first day, Mr Wah's net worth skyrocketed to $2.8 billion, according to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/lee-thiam-wah/" rel="nofollow, noindex">Forbes</a></em>. His company's listing not only solidifies his position as one of Malaysia's wealthiest individuals but also represents a landmark moment for the country's capital markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''It comes at a crucial moment for both Malaysia's IPO landscape and Southeast Asia's capital markets. This could boost market sentiment and position Malaysia as a key player in regional listings,'' said Mohit Mirpuri, a senior partner and fund manager at Singapore-based SGMC Capital Pte Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Lee Thiam Wah's&nbsp;extraordinary journey:</strong></h2>

<p>Lee, one of 11 children, was born in 1964 to a humble family in Klang, Malaysia's largest port. His parents, a construction worker and a hawker, could only afford to send him to school for six years. After contracting polio, which left him unable to use his legs, Lee faced significant challenges in finding employment. Undeterred, he began selling snacks from a roadside stall, eventually saving enough to open his first grocery store in 1987, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3277705/malaysian-roadside-snack-seller-billionaire-inside-lee-thiam-wahs-meteoric-rise" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have to help myself. Nobody would hire me due to my physical limitation," Mr Wah told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0315/entrepreneurs-malaysia-speedsmart-handicaps-king-of-mini-marts.html" target="_blank">Forbes</a></em>&nbsp;in 2010.</p>

<p>Through hard work, he expanded his business into the country's largest mini-market chain, 99 Speed Mart, with nearly 2,600 stores nationwide. He also became a significant shareholder in Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd. and invested in the Malaysian franchise of Burger King. Following the company's IPO, he aims to increase the store count to approximately 3,000 over the next three years, as stated in the prospectus.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese scientists, employing cutting-edge radar, have detected simultaneous plasma bubbles above the Egyptian pyramids and Midway Islands, sparking fascination. The radar, known as the Low Latitude Long Range Ionospheric Radar (LARID),&nbsp;was developed by the Institute of Geology and Geophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was installed last year, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3277286/chinas-super-radar-detects-plasma-bubble-over-pyramids-giza">South China Morning Post </a></em>reported. The LARID radar can detect plasma bubbles, an unusual weather phenomenon that disrupts satellite communications and GPS by interfering with the ionosphere's charged particles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On August 27, China's Institute of Geology and Geophysics announced the largest radar detection of plasma bubbles to date, triggered by a solar storm last November. The radar signals, detectable from North Africa to the central Pacific, allowed scientists to observe the formation and movement of plasma bubbles in unprecedented detail.</p>

<p>The LARID radar, located on Hainan Island, has a 9,600km range, covering Hawaii to Libya. Unlike conventional radars, LARID uses high-power electromagnetic waves that bounce between the ionosphere and ground, detecting targets beyond the horizon. Its radar system, operating at 8-22MHz, uses 48 transceiver antennas to detect plasma bubbles, while its fully digital phased array system enables real-time adjustments.</p>

<p>Initially, LARID's detection range was 3,000km.&nbsp;The radar's detection range has tripled to 9,600km in less than half a year, thanks to operational experience and advancements like novel signal coding and geophysical simulation models.</p>

<p>The development of such radars is important to detect plasma bubbles as they pose a significant threat to modern warfare. However, the scarcity of large-scale, long-term observation facilities over oceans has hindered our understanding and early warning capabilities. To address this, Chinese scientists have proposed establishing a network of three to four LARID-like over-the-horizon radars in low-latitude regions worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China's military has also deployed over-the-horizon radars similar to LARID, which have detected targets like F-22 stealth fighters, suggesting more advanced variants with higher resolution for military use.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple Inc.'s most important event of the year takes place Monday, when the company will roll out its latest iPhones and set the stage for a new artificial intelligence platform.</p>

<p>The event kicks off from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. local time. Apple doesn't typically hold this event on a Monday, but the earlier timing lets the company get out ahead of an eventful Tuesday: There's a US presidential debate that day, and the European Commission is slated to announce a decision on whether Apple has to pay $14 billion in taxes stemming from a longstanding agreement with Ireland.</p>

<p>The most significant product announcement will be the iPhone 16 line, but the company is also preparing major updates to both the Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Intelligence - a new suite of AI tools that includes an updated Siri digital assistant - also will feature prominently. The theme of the event, "It's Glowtime," is a reference to Siri's new interface.</p>

<p>The stakes are high for Apple, which looks to prove to both consumers and Wall Street that it's now a major player in generative artificial intelligence. But the company's AI technology is still a work in progress. Apple Intelligence has faced numerous delays, and many key features won't arrive until next year. For now, the technology is focused on summarizing messages and notifications, rather than matching the dazzling interactivity of rival systems.</p>

<p>Even so, Monday's updates will breathe new life into products that sit at the heart of the Apple device lineup and generate roughly 60% of the company's annual revenue. They also drive consumer spending on services, an increasingly vital source of sales. Apple's finances could use the boost. The company has only just begun to emerge from its longest sales slump in decades.</p>

<p><strong>Here's everything that's expected to be announced at Monday's presentation:</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Apple's iPhone 15 Pro.(Photographer: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/9eb18i6o_apple-iphone-bloomberg_625x300_06_September_24.jpg" title="Apple's iPhone 15 Pro.(Photographer: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)" /></div>

</div>

<p><strong>iPHONE</strong></p>

<p>In line with the past several years, Apple will introduce four new iPhone models: the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.</p>

<p>Like in 2023, the changes to the non-Pro iPhones will be minor. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will look like last year's versions, including 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen sizes and aluminum cases. They'll gain faster processors and include a total of 8 gigabytes of memory (up from 6). That memory will help support Apple Intelligence and other features.</p>

<p>Those lower-end phones will get the same Action button currently featured on the Pro models, as well as vertically stacked rear cameras that support spatial video recording - the 3D clips that can be viewed with Apple's Vision Pro headsets.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, meanwhile, will retain the iPhone 15 Pro line design save for one noticeable change: the displays. The screen sizes are increasing to 6.3 inches on the smaller model (up from from 6.1 inches) and going to 6.9 inches from 6.7 inches on the Max version. While the changes represent an increase of less than 5% on both models, the shift will come with bezels that are now about a third slimmer. That should make for a sleeker overall look.</p>

<p>Like the iPhone 15 Pro line, the 16 Pro models will support Apple Intelligence with the inclusion of 8 gigabytes of memory. They'll also get speedier chips with an enhanced neural engine that Apple will say is optimized for AI.</p>

<p>Both of the iPhone 16 Pro models will get camera upgrades as well, including a move to a 48-megapixel lens from a 12-megapixel one for the ultrawide-angle camera. That will match the megapixels of the standard, wide-angle camera on last year's model. The smaller iPhone 16 Pro will also gain 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, up from 3x, to match the Max version.</p>

<p>The most significant camera enhancement coming to both models: a dedicated, touch-sensitive button on the right side of the phone for taking photos and video. This button will be the biggest selling point for the new iPhones, other than AI. It will work similarly to a shutter button on a DSLR camera, allowing a user to lightly press it to focus on a subject and then press harder to take a picture. It will also be capacitive, allowing a user to swipe across it to move between still and video modes and zoom in and out.</p>

<p>While the phones will all look mostly the same as last year, Apple is shaking up its color palette. The Pro models will now come in a gold titanium to replace blue titanium, while the black, white and natural options will still be available. The non-Pro versions will trade in yellow for white and get new shades of green, pink and blue.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>AIRPODS</strong></p>

<p>Apple is preparing two new AirPods models to replace the entry-level, second-generation earbuds and mid-tier, third-generation model. Both new versions will look similar to the AirPods Pro and include a new case, USB-C charging and improved audio quality.</p>

<p>Apple will distinguish the two models by giving the new mid-tier version a higher-end case with a speaker - making it easier to locate with Apple's Find My feature - as well as noise cancellation to match the AirPods Pro.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Apple discovered a bug in the upcoming AirPods that made the earbuds quickly drain battery life. This issue was determined to be software-related and resolved prior to factories shipping out the products.</p>

<p>One major new feature is a bigger push into hearing health. Apple has been working to turn the AirPods into a replacement for hearing aids as well as a device for conducting hearing tests. The company is preparing to announce the enhancements - codenamed Yodel - but they've suffered some delays and may not be available until later.</p>

<p>A new version of the AirPods Pro remains in the works, including an upgraded design and improved noise cancellation. It's due as early as next year.</p>

<p>And Apple has been working on updated AirPods Max headphones that will come in new colors and switch the Lightning connector to USB-C to comply with the latest laws from the European Union. But there's still plenty of current AirPods Max inventory on hand, suggesting that the update could be coming later.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2. (Photographer: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/v974p7o4_apple-watch-ultra-2-bloomberg_625x300_06_September_24.jpg" title="The Apple Watch Ultra 2. (Photographer: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)" /></div>

</div>

<p><strong>APPLE WATCH</strong></p>

<p>For the first time in two years, the company is preparing to update all of its Apple Watch models at once. There will be a new low-end Apple Watch SE, a mid-level Series 10 model and an Ultra 3.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch Ultra will only get minor tweaks, focusing on internal upgrades rather than outside changes.</p>

<p>The biggest upgrade to the Apple Watch line will be with the Series 10 model, which marks the decade anniversary of the product's introduction in 2014. For the first time since the Series 7, the flagship Apple Watch model will get an updated look.</p>

<p>The overall design will be similar to the Apple Watch Series 9, but the company will now offer slightly larger screen-size options and the watch case itself will be noticeably thinner.</p>

<p>Though new AI features are coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac, don't expect the watches to get major Apple Intelligence capabilities. Any AI technology will probably be tied specifically to a future health coach service.</p>

<p>At the start of the year, Apple was forced to remove blood-oxygen sensing from new watches due to a lawsuit with Masimo Corp. over patents. There's been no evidence that the feature is returning in time for the latest models, and that may affect whether users want to upgrade their existing watches to versions that won't have the function.</p>

<p>A major new health feature is coming, though: sleep apnea detection, which will build on the existing sleep tracking. This feature will attempt to determine if a wearer has sleep apnea and then suggest further testing with a medical professional. While Apple has been preparing to announce it, the enhancement may not be available on day one of the new model going on sale.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while Apple aimed to bring hypertension - or high blood pressure - detection to the Apple Watch this year, signs point to that feature being delayed and no longer in the cards for an immediate release.</p>

<p><strong>OTHER PRODUCTS</strong></p>

<p>Apple is working on transitioning its entire Mac line to M4 chips, starting with the MacBook Pro, Mac mini and iMac. But any Mac upgrades are likely to come at a follow-up launch - no earlier than October - rather than at the September event.</p>

<p>While the company has been working on an update to the Apple TV set-top box for as early as this year, no new model has come to fruition and stable inventory of the device suggests a new version isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>

<p>A new iPhone SE with an OLED display, edge-to-edge screen and no home button is in advanced testing, but a release isn't planned until next year. A fresh AirTag is also in development, though Apple isn't planning a release until next year either.</p>

<p>There are also new iPads in the works, including an upgraded mini version. They're on deck for Apple's October event alongside the M4 Macs.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have discovered an antibody that could counter all known variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and also distantly related ones that infect other animals.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19, uses its spike protein to invade and infect another individual, or the host. Antibodies, produced by the host in response, bind to the spike protein to block its action and prevent infection.</p>

<p>The researchers, led by those at The University of Texas in Austin, US, isolated the antibody 'SC27' from the plasma donated by four patients. These patients had breakthrough infections, which occur when a vaccinated individual gets infected.</p>

<p>The research has been published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine.</p>

<p>Over the more than four years since the first case of COVID-19 emerged, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to acquire certain characteristics which make the virus resistant to vaccines and treatments.</p>

<p>The authors said the 'SC27' antibody recognised all these various characteristics of the spike proteins across COVID-19 variants.</p>

<p>"One goal of this research, and vaccinology in general, is to work toward a universal vaccine that can generate antibodies and create an immune response with broad protection to a rapidly mutating virus," said one of the lead authors William Voss, a PhD graduate in cell and molecular biology at The University of Texas.</p>

<p>However, the authors also acknowledged that "the small number of individuals analysed may limit the interpretation of the data and leave it unclear how common the SC27-like antibody might be in human populations." The researchers used the technology IgG proteomics, or 'Ig-Seq', to study hybrid immunity, which is one's antibody response to both infection and vaccination.</p>

<p>"The discovery of SC27, and other antibodies like it in the future, will help us better protect the population against current and future COVID-19 variants," study author Jason Lavinder from The University of Texas.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that hybrid immunity offered an increased protection against the disease, compared with infection or vaccination alone.</p>

<p>Giani Singh (name changed), 45, drives a yellow taxi in New York. David Brooks, 63, a New Yorker at heart, is among the most cerebral columnists of <em>The New York Times</em>. They may find little in common should they meet currently but will find themselves agreeing on the most vexatious question in the US today: who will win the Presidential election in November.</p>

<p>Gianni wants Trump to win. Originally from Ludhiana, he came to the US as a teenager and did all he needed to survive, including two local marriages. He finally landed a US citizenship three years ago. Today, he owns six taxis, drives one himself for a bare six hours a day, and owns a house in Queens.</p>

<h2><strong>"Immigrants Commit Crimes"</strong></h2>

<p>He voted Trump in 2020 and will do so again. Trump, he says, kept prices down. "Today, with 8% interest, I don't know how people live," he told us last week. Trump will be hard on immigration (he threatens to deport an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants). "I know I am one and I have my own stories but, Sirjee, these immigrants commit lots of crimes. We see it daily in New York. " And, finally, "Trump will be good for India".</p>

<p>Brooks, a Republican, does not want Trump to win. But in a recent column, he clinically listed the "five turbines of Trumpism" which told his head differently. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One, Americans favour dynamism over compassion. The fastest growing US states - Texas, Florida, Montana - are ruled by Republicans; the slowest and the stagnant by Democrats. "The red model gives you low housing costs, lower taxes and business vitality. The blue model gives you high housing costs, high taxes and high inequality." Democrats want to expand the welfare state like in Europe. But voters tell pollsters that the economy and immigration are their top concerns and Republicans score better on handling those.</p>

<h2><strong>Democrats, The 'Elite' Clique</strong></h2>

<p>Two, in a reversal from recent history, Democrats have become the party of the college graduate elite and Republicans of the working class. "The biggest divide in the US today is the diploma divide," Brooks has often written. One of his most perceptive recent columns was on how the educated elite in the US unwittingly conveys its contempt for the majority not with a college degree ("Deplorables," Hillary Clinton infamously described Trump supporters in 2016). And the "deplorable" deeply resent that the Democrats are the party of the ruling class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three, the less educated are in a funk because of growing social and moral immorality. As Brooks wrote: "The things that derail their lives are broken relationships, infidelity, out-of-wedlock births, addictions, family conflict and crime. When Republicans talk about immigration, crime, faith, family and the flag, they are talking about ways to preserve the social and moral order. Democrats are great at talking about economic solidarity, but not moral and cultural solidarity."</p>

<p>Four, the general mood in the US is of distrust and dissatisfaction. According to Gallup and other pollsters, only 25% Americans are satisfied with the direction of the country; 60% feel the country is in decline and the "system is broken"; 69% agree that the "political and economic elite don't care about hard-working people", and 63% agree that "experts in this country don't understand the lives of people like me".</p>

<h2><strong>Trump Knows How To Harness Unhappiness</strong></h2>

<p>In this mood, people are disinclined to believe the Kamala Harris promise of a better life based on a more caring state. They believe that irrespective of the promises the elite make, in the end, it only adds to their growing power. And Trump knows better than any other populist how to harness this general dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Five, Harris has been unlike Clinton and Obama, both of whom won two terms by sticking rigidly to the centrist median on major issues. They made sure they were never seen as a representative of the progressives in the Democratic party. Kamala Harris let her progressive side lean on the critical decision of the choice of the Vice-Presidential candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is likely to be the most critical swing state in this election. Harris could have chosen its popular governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her election mate, but Shapiro was seen as a moderate and Harris showed "over-confidence", says Brooks, in choosing a governor (Tim Walz) of a state she was winning anyway, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is, of course, prime time for election punditry in the US, and one of the reigning gurus in this field is Nate Silver, poker player extraordinaire, baseball-statistician-turned-poll-predictor best known for predicting Obama's scale of victory in 2012 (332 electoral college votes out of 538) when it was widely seen as a close race and for naming the victor in all 50 US states. Silver too is leaning towards a Trump victory at this time, because of the electoral college advantage of the Republicans, which effectively gives the smaller of the seven swing states (like Wisconsin) disproportionate weightage in shaping the final verdict, even negating the popular vote.</p>

<h2><strong>What Harris Will Really Need</strong></h2>

<p>Hillary Clinton polled 65 million votes to Trump's 62 million in 2016 but lost the electoral college vote by 227-304. This November too, it is not unlikely that the same fate visits Harris. According to Silver's latest prediction, Harris would need to lead Trump in the popular vote by more than 3% to have a statistical chance of getting 270 electoral college votes. Harris had a dream five-week run between Biden opting out on July 21 and the Democratic National Convention but the bounce has slowed down. According to the latest Real Clear Politics Nationwide Polling Average, Harris is only 1.8% ahead of Trump in the popular vote. More importantly, she has only a 0.8 lead over Trump in the seven swing states.</p>

<p>Repeated polling has shown that the two most important issues for the electorate are the economy and immigration and Trump continues to lead Harris on those issues, despite ground realities. Bipartisan economists have proved that Trump's plan to erect tariff walls on imports, with steep ones for Chinese imports, will raise prices and harm the poor. Trump stonewalled a bipartisan tough immigration in the Congress because it would have impaired his election rhetoric of deporting illegal immigrants, a plan that is logistically impossible and would wreck the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>'Unserious' Trump</strong></h2>

<p>Trump is, as Harris famously labelled him, "unserious"; labelling him a narcissist is doing disservice to that word; he is a misogynist who has little support among young women;, everybody knows he does not have any values and beliefs except the most convenient ones, and the media knows he plays them because he craves publicity, positive or negative. And yet, because he is who he is, he can affirm contradictory beliefs and yet not lose any support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abortion is one issue on which Harris has him on the run. The Supreme Court that overturned the constitutional right to abortion was put together by Trump. He has often crowed about the verdict, which has led to anti-abortion statutes in 22 states. One out of seven voters rate abortion as the third most important electoral issue. Seeing Harris' growing lead on the issue which looms larger each day he has flip-flopped. One day he weighed against a Florida initiative to dramatically shorten the period for a legal abortion but seeing the pro-lifers' blowback, promptly affirmed support for the initiative the next day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Media in the US has been replete recently with revelations that should have made MAGA followers wince. &nbsp;A writer in <em>The Atlantic </em>profiled a key associate of Trump's presidency, Kashyap (Kash) Patel, who jeopardised the life of US Seals on a rescue mission in Nigeria by faking a go-ahead by Nigerian authorities for USAF planes to enter Nigerian air space. When exposed, Patel shrugged off his breathtaking lie with "Nobody got injured so how does it matter?" Trump acknowledges Kash is somewhat crazy, but says, "You need crazies".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Nothing Matters For Trump Loyalists</strong></h2>

<p>The <em>NYT </em>carried a column on how the Federal Election Commission has little oversight on how the hundreds of millions of dollars ostensibly raised for Trump's election campaign are actually used. The monies are sat over by Trump's family, and it is a reasonable inference from the money trails that significant sums are diverted toward fighting his many legal cases. But for Trump <em>bhakts</em>, nothing matters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allan Lichtman is a historian who has correctly called all recent elections, including 2016 and 2020, on a proprietary 13-point scale, weighted towards serious issues (like how the economy has done in the period between the two elections and how the US is perceived internationally), in which the character of the candidate matters only for two of the points. On that template, which also totally ignores election polls and surveys, Harris wins by scoring seven points.</p>

<h2><strong>'Prosecutor' Harris vs 'Bully' Trump</strong></h2>

<p>It would be fair to say that with less than 60 days to go, the election is too close to call. Much will depend on the debate on Tuesday evening (Wednesday morning in India). This may sound unbelievable, but Trump and Harris have never formally met. Never. Ever. Their first face-to-face promises to be gladiatorial. Will Prosecutor Harris put Convicted Felon and Bully Trump in the dock?&nbsp;</p>

<p>White men, 40% of the electorate, favour Trump overwhelmingly. Should Harris stand up to Trump, or dominate him, she could give the lie to Trump's taunt that Putin and the like will chew up Harris. That could nudge the critical white male vote in not only Wisconsin (10 electoral college votes) but, perhaps, more importantly in Pennsylvania with 20 electoral college votes.&nbsp;</p>

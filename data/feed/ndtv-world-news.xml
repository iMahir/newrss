       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, released a video on Saturday of an Israeli hostage held in the Gaza Strip since the Hamas attack of October 2023.</p>

<p>In the undated, three-and-half-minute video that AFP has not been able to verify, Matan Zangauker says in Hebrew that he has been in captivity for more than 420 days and calls for public pressure on the Israeli government to secure the release of all captives held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Zangauker, who was 24 at the time, was taken from Nir Oz kibbutz along with his partner, Ilana Gritzewsky. She was released during a truce last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His mother, Einav Zangauker, has been one of the most prominent figures in Israel calling for the government to negotiate a hostage release deal that would end the war.</p>

<p>Addressing herself to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, she said: "That Matan is still alive today does not mean he will survive the winter or the continuing military pressure. The only way to bring Matan back is with a deal."</p>

<p>She added: "I demand the following from you, Netanyahu: give full mandate to the negotiating team to bring a comprehensive deal that will bring everyone back. A comprehensive deal that will bring everyone back, even if it means ending the war. No tricks, no excuses."</p>

<p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group for relatives of those abducted to Gaza, said the video was evidence that hostages remained alive and that "the critical need" to secure their release "becomes more urgent with each passing hour".</p>

<p>"These hostages' lives hang by a thread," the group said.</p>

<p>Critics have accused Netanyahu of stalling truce negotiations and prolonging the war to appease his far-right coalition partners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been large and frequent protests in Israel since the early days of the war calling for the government to negotiate a hostage release deal with Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday night there were again major protests in Tel Aviv, which Einav Zangauker attended, as well as other Israeli cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palestinian militants kidnapped 251 people during their surprise attack, of whom 96 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Qatar said "momentum is coming back" for the talks, while a source close to the Hamas delegation told AFP that a new round of negotiations will "most likely" begin in the coming week.</p>

<p>With Cairo and Washington, Doha has been mediating negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal for more than a year without success.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Pichai also responded to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's earlier comment that Google should have been the "default winner" in the AI race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the company's search engine will transform significantly in 2025. At the New York Times DealBook Summit, Mr Pichai said, "I think we are going to be able to tackle more complex questions than ever before." He added, "You'll be surprised, even early in 2025, at the kind of new capabilities Search will offer compared to today."</p>

<p>Mr Pichai also responded to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's earlier comment that Google should have been the "default winner" in the AI race. In a pointed reply, Mr Pichai proposed a "side-by-side comparison" of Google and Microsoft's AI models, emphasizing that Microsoft relies on "someone else's models," referencing its partnership with OpenAI, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314245/sundar-pichai-google-search-change-profoundly-2025" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Verge</em></a>.</p>

<p>Highlighting the rapid evolution of AI technology, Pichai remarked, "We are in the earliest stages of a profound shift. There's so much innovation ahead, and we are committed to staying at the forefront of this field."</p>

<p>Google has already begun an AI-driven overhaul of its search platform, incorporating features like AI-generated summaries and an enhanced Lens tool that enables video-based searches. The company is also gearing up to release a major update to its Gemini AI model, aiming to compete with Microsoft, OpenAI, and the AI search engine Perplexity.</p>

<p>Earlier, Mr&nbsp;Pichai revealed why the company invests so heavily in its famous free meal policy. Contrary to popular belief, Mr Pichai explained these meals were not just perks, adding they served a deeper purpose.</p>

<p>"I can recall several times, when I was working at Google early on, being in cafes, meeting someone else, talking and getting excited about something. So, it sparks creativity," Mr Pichai shared in an interview on Bloomberg's The David Rubenstein Show.</p>

<p>Sundar Pichai, who started working at Google as a Product Manager in 2004, said that some of the most brilliant ideas emerge during these communal meals.</p>

<p>The CEO added that this collaborative environment, where employees gather over food, helps foster innovation. "The benefit that comes out of it dwarfs the cost," Mr Pichai remarked, saying the free meals weren't a financial burden but a long-term investment in creativity and community building.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has left Damascus for an unknown destination as rebels announced that they were entering the capital, according to reports.&nbsp;The President boarded a plane and left for an unknown destination, two senior army officers told news agency Reuters. AFP reported that according to a war monitor, the Army and security forces had abandoned Damascus International Airport. A source close to Hezbollah told AFP that fighters of a key Assad ally had left their positions around the Syrian capital.</p>

<p>The Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group said its forces were moving into Damascus. Soon after, they announced an "end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya" as the rebels broke into the jail that has become a byword for the darkest abuses of the Syrian regime, AFP reported.</p>

<p>Earlier, the rebel group had said they had captured the strategic city of Homs, on the way to the capital. But the Syrian defence ministry had denied this and said the situation in Homs was "safe and stable".</p>

<p>The Hezbollah, which backed the Assad regime for years, has asked its forces to withdraw. Hezbollah "has instructed its fighters in recent hours to withdraw from the Homs area, with some heading to Latakia (in Syria) and others to the Hermel area in Lebanon", a source told AFP.</p>

<p>The Syrian defence ministry had earlier said "there is no truth to news claiming our armed forces... have withdrawn" from positions near Damascus. It also said it was reinforcing positions in the south, and operations against the rebels had started in the Hama, Homs and Daraa areas.</p>

<p>Residents of Damascus have told AFP that there was panic as traffic jams clogged the streets, people sought supplies and queued to withdraw money from ATMs. "The situation was not like this when I left my house this morning... suddenly everyone was scared," said one woman, Rania.</p>

<p>In a Damascus suburb, witnesses said protesters had toppled a statue of Assad's father, the late leader Hafez al-Assad.</p>

<p>The president's office had, however, denied reports that Assad had left Damascus and said he was working "from the capital".</p>

<p>An Iraqi security source has told AFP that Baghdad has allowed in hundreds of Syrian soldiers, who "fled the front lines". A second source put the figure at 2,000 troops, including officers.</p>

<p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Tagged as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has tried to soften its image and told minority groups that they have no cause to worry.</p>

<p>The United Nations said the violence had displaced 370,000 people. UN special envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, called for "urgent political talks" to implement a 2015 Security Council resolution laying a roadmap for a negotiated settlement.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the United States should "not get involved", after outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Friday for a "political solution to the conflict", in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it was "inadmissible" to allow a "terrorist group to take control" of Syrian territory. Moscow and Tehran have supported Assad's government and army during the war.</p>

<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government backs some armed groups in northern Syria, said Saturday that Syria "is tired of war, blood and tears".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Danielle Carr-Gomm, 71, died after she stopped taking her insulin medication at Hongchi Xiao's insistence.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in the UK has been sentenced to 10 years in jail, plus a five-year extended licence period after advocating 'slapping therapy' which led to the death of a woman at one of his healing camps. The man, identified as Hongchi Xiao, 61, was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter of 71-year-old Danielle Carr-Gomm who visited his week-long retreat at Cleeve House in Seend, Wiltshire, in October 2016. While handing out the sentence, Justice Robert Bright at the Winchester Crown Court held Mr Xiao responsible for Ms Carr-Gomm's "untimely death" which was a "tragedy for her and all of those who loved her".</p>

<p>“You failed to summon emergency medical care when you of all people knew she was likely to die without insulin," said Mr Bright, adding: "I consider you dangerous even though you do not share the characteristics of most other dangerous offenders."</p>

<p>Ms Carr-Gomm was a diabetes patient since 1998 and had sought alternatives to her insulin medication due to her fear of needles. Mr Xiao promoted&nbsp;<em>paida lajin </em>(meaning "slapping and stretching") therapy in which patients slapped themselves repeatedly to release "poisonous waste" from the body. The technique finds mention in Chinese medicine but doctors say it has no scientific basis and often leaves the patients bruised, bleeding or in some cases, dead.</p>

<p>As Ms Carr-Gomm stopped taking insulin at Mr Xiao's insistence, her health deteriorated. By day three, she was "vomiting, tired and howling in pain", according to the prosecutors. Despite her condition, Mr Xiao did not summon an emergency medical team.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hongchi-xiao-man-pleads-not-guilty-after-woman-dies-at-slapping-therapy-workshop-in-united-kingdom-4794274" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Man Pleads Not Guilty After Woman Dies At "Slapping Therapy" Workshop In UK</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>'Complex investigation'</strong></p>

<p>Detective Chief Inspector Phil Walker of the Major Crime Investigation Team said he was glad that the case had come to an end after a long-drawn eight-year legal battle.</p>

<p>“This has been an extremely complex investigation, with nearly eight years having passed since Danielle's sad death. This passage of time, which has been out of our control, has of course added further challenges and complications to the investigation, but I am pleased that a custodial sentence has now been given to Xiao," Mr Walker told reporters outside the court.</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Xiao was extradited for trial from Australia where he had been prosecuted for the death of a six-year-old boy who also succumbed after his parents withdrew his insulin medication, based on the defendant's workshop in Sydney. Throughout the trial, Mr Xiao pleaded not guilty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Syria War Live Updates: </strong>As the fighting between the forces led by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the anti-government rebels raged on, the rebels on Sunday announced full control of Homs, the third main city in the nation, and are on their way toward Damascus. The rebel alliance, led by Islamist leader Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, launched its offensive on November 27. Since then, Aleppo - the second largest city, and Hamas fell to them.</p>

<p>Syria's civil war, which began with Assad's crackdown on democracy protests, has killed more than 5,00,000 people and forced more than half the population to flee their homes. According to the United Nations, the violence has displaced 3.7 lakh people.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump reacted to the raging conflict in Syria, saying that the US should "not get involved" in the situation. "Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, and the United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved," he said on his Truth Social platform.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian rebel forces claim to have made inroads, bringing them closer to the heart of the capital Damascus, the seat of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-war-live-updates-syrian-rebels-advance-on-damascus-homs-hezbollah-withdraws-forces-president-bashar-al-assad-7198116" target="_blank">President Bashar al-Assad</a>'s power. The swift advance has plunged Assad's regime into its most precarious position since the brutal civil war which erupted in 2011 after a civil uprising.&nbsp;According to Reuters citing two army officers, Assad boarded a plane and left for an unknown destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison," Syrian rebels said, as quoted by news agency Reuters.</p>

<p>The Islamist faction <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/all-about-hayat-tahrir-al-sham-the-rebels-seizing-control-of-large-parts-of-aleppo-7146787" target="_blank">Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a> (HTS) announced last night that its forces had entered Homs, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-bashar-al-assad-aleppo-explained-whats-happening-in-syria-how-it-could-affect-middle-east-7139248" target="_blank">Syria's third-largest city</a> after the Syrian army reportedly began retreating to its outskirts. The city, a critical junction between Damascus and Assad's strongholds along the Mediterranean coast, now seems poised to fall into rebel hands. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani declared that his forces were "on the threshold of Homs and Damascus, and the toppling of the criminal regime is close."</p>

<p>The rapid advance by HTS and other factions has created a coordinated pincer movement on Damascus. From the south, newly unified rebel factions under the Southern Operations Room have seized control of the Daraa province, the cradle of the 2011 uprising, and have declared their intent to march on the capital. Videos emerging from the area showed a statue of Assad's father and predecessor, Hafez al-Assad, being torn down.</p>

<p>In a coordinated offensive, opposition factions have also taken control of Sweida, a southwestern city with a predominantly Druze population, and Quneitra near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The Syrian army's withdrawal from Homs has effectively severed Damascus from the coastal provinces of Tartus and Latakia, historically strongholds of support for Assad's regime.</p>

<h2><strong>Region In Flux</strong></h2>

<p>Iran, one of Assad's staunchest allies, has reportedly begun evacuating military commanders and diplomatic staff from Syria. For decades, Tehran invested heavily in Syria as a conduit for arming its regional proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, Iran now appears unable or unwilling to reinforce Assad, facing its own domestic challenges and the toll of ongoing conflicts in the region.</p>

<p>According to news agency AFP, Hezbollah is pulling its forces from the outskirts of Damascus and the Homs area.</p>

<p>The potential collapse of Assad's government would reshape the Middle East. For Israel, a rebel victory would mean an enemy replacing another enemy. With its own resources stretched, thanks to a multi-frontal war with Iran featuring Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel faces a new headache in Syrian rebels.</p>

<p>Russia, another critical ally of Assad, has also been notably absent in this crisis. Russian forces, heavily committed in Ukraine, appear unable to offer the air support that proved decisive in earlier phases of the Syrian war. This shift leaves Assad increasingly isolated, with few external resources to rely on.</p>

<h2><strong>Civilian Impact And Warnings</strong></h2>

<p>The deteriorating security situation has had devastating consequences for civilians. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that over 370,000 people have been displaced in just a week of intensified fighting. The US Embassy in Syria issued a warning to its citizens, urging immediate evacuation as "commercial options remain available."</p>

<p>Turkey, a key backer of some rebel factions, has expressed concerns over the safety of civilians, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling for an end to the bloodshed.</p>

<p>India issued a notification to its citizens, warning against travelling to Syria in light of the unrest.</p>

<h2><strong>Assad's Waning Grip</strong></h2>

<p>While Syrian state media insists that Assad remains in Damascus, reports of defections and retreats by government forces suggest that the regime's control is rapidly unravelling. In the southern town of Moadamiya, roughly four kilometres from the Presidential Palace in Damascus, rebel commanders reportedly persuaded Syrian troops to surrender without a fight.</p>

<p>Similar scenes have played out in other recently captured areas, where residents have toppled symbols of the regime and freed political prisoners.</p>

<p>Videos circulating online show Syrian police officers discarding their uniforms and attempting to blend in with civilians. In Homs, thousands celebrated the departure of government forces, chanting slogans against Assad and in favour of a free Syria.</p>

<h2><strong>Chemical Weapons Fears</strong></h2>

<p>US intelligence agencies are monitoring suspected chemical weapons storage sites, concerned that Assad might deploy such weapons as a last resort to defend Damascus. The Assad regime has been accused of using chemical weapons against citizens since civil war broke out in 2011.</p>

<p>The Ghouta chemical attack of 2013, which killed over an estimated 300 civilians, and the Khan Shaykhun attack of 2017 which reportedly killed over 100, are some of the many instances where the use of Sarin Gas by regime forces on civilians was reported. Multiple United Nations fact-finding missions have presented "clear evidence" of the use of chemical weapons over the years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York's mayor said Saturday "the net is tightening" on the man suspected of gunning down a top health insurance executive before fleeing the city.</p>

<p>Mayor Eric Adams also said detectives knew the name of the fresh-faced suspect, an image of whom was released by investigators Thursday and who has now been on the run for almost four days.</p>

<p>Adams praised "the manner in which (investigators) were able to follow his footsteps to recover evidence -- some of it is known, some of it is unknown -- but the net is tightening and we're going to bring this person to justice," he said, the New York Post reported.</p>

<p>The masked assailant was caught on camera entering a bus station in a northern neighborhood of Manhattan in the wake of Wednesday's slaying, but he could not be identified exiting the facility on foot, a police spokesman confirmed to AFP.</p>

<p>"They believe he's not in New York City," the spokesman added.</p>

<p>The image of the smiling suspect was obtained from a youth hostel where the gunman apparently stayed before the hit, detectives said, with media reporting he lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist.</p>

<p>The FBI, which said it was assisting the New York police, offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his capture.</p>

<h3><strong>Delay and deny</strong></h3>

<p>The gunman on Wednesday sprayed Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare -- one of the country's largest medical insurers -- with bullets in front of bystanders, in an audacious attack captured by a surveillance camera and now seen by millions.</p>

<p>Thompson was attending an investor conference in the Midtown business district.</p>

<p>Police have yet to suggest a motive and would not confirm media reports that the words "delay" and "deny" -- often used by insurance companies to reject claims -- were written on shell casings found at the scene.</p>

<p>Video footage shows Thompson on the sidewalk outside the New York Hilton Midtown when a man in a hooded top, his lower face covered, approaches from behind, then fires several shots at his 50-year-old victim, who crumples to the ground.</p>

<p>Camera footage showed the suspect fleeing on foot, before getting on a bicycle, with police revealing he headed to Central Park.</p>

<p>Officers have confirmed that a cell phone as well as DNA from a coffee cup were recovered from near the murder scene.</p>

<p>In the absence of an arrest, speculation has been rife that the gunman may have sought to take revenge for adverse medical coverage decisions made by the insurer.</p>

<p>UnitedHealthcare is a major player in the lucrative American health care market, and the parent group had revenues of $100.8 billion in the third quarter of the year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun has been arrested over his role in a martial law declaration that plunged the country into turmoil, local media reported Sunday.</p>

<p>Kim had already resigned after the brief imposition of martial law late Tuesday by President Yoon Suk Yeol, which saw soldiers and helicopters sent to parliament.</p>

<p>Yoon was forced to rescind the order hours later and parliament voted down his decree.</p>

<p>Kim had already been slapped with a travel ban.</p>

<p>Police have launched an investigation into Yoon and others for alleged insurrection.</p>

<p>The prosecutors' office was not immediately available for comment on Kim's arrest, reported by the Yonhap news agency and other local media outlets Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Late Saturday Yoon survived an impeachment motion in parliament despite huge street protests outside.</p>

<p>Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure.</p>

<p>The PPP said after the vote that it had blocked the impeachment to avoid "severe division and chaos", adding that it would "resolve this crisis in a more orderly and responsible manner".</p>

<p>Party leader Han Dong-hoon said that the party had "effectively obtained" Yoon's promise to step down, and said until this happened he would "be effectively excluded from his duties", leaving the prime minister and party to manage state affairs.</p>

<p>The impeachment outcome disappointed the huge crowds -- numbering 150,000 according to police, one million according to organisers -- demonstrating outside parliament for Yoon's ouster.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A section of anti-Israeli students at Columbia University are being criticised after they distributed a hateful newspaper, "The Columbia Intifada" on the campus, according to a report in the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/us-news/students-at-columbia-university-launch-anti-israel-columbia-intifada-newspaper-outrageous/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em> NY Post</em></a>. The Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) group printed 1,000 copies of the broadsheet and handed it out to students on the campus of the Ivy League Institute. It contains at least half a dozen articles with titles including "Zionist Peace Means Palestinian Blood," "The Myth of the Two-State Solution" and a handy "Guide to Wheatpasting" - a method of vandalising public surfaces with propaganda fliers or other messaging.</p>

<p>Columbia University Apartheid Divest, another anti-Israel group, took to Instagram to share pictures of the newspaper and urged students to pick up one of the copies.</p>

<p>"Hot off the press! Columbia SJP's first ever print paper 'The Columbia Intifada' is available at today's READ-IN at BUTLER LIBRARY 301!" read the post caption.</p>

<p>"We're distributing 1,000 copies - get them while you can! From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free," it added.</p>

<p>The newspaper had no bylines or information connecting the articles to their respective authors.</p>

<p>Quizzed about the college's name being used to publish such a newspaper, Columbia University distanced itself from the issue.</p>

<p>"Using the Columbia name for a publication that glorifies violence and makes individuals in our community feel targeted in any way is a breach of our values," a school representative was quoted as saying by the outlet.</p>

<p>"As we have said repeatedly, discrimination and promoting violence or terror is not acceptable and antithetical to what our community stands for. We are investigating this incident through our applicable offices and policies."</p>

<p>Republican New York Congressman Mike Lawler took to X9 formerly Twitter) and criticised the university for allowing the newspaper to be published and distributed.</p>

<p>"This is outrageous. If @Columbia cannot protect Jewish students on their campus, they should lose federal funding and have their tax-exempt status revoked," Mr Lawler wrote.</p>

<p>"And for those students here on a visa engaged in an "intifada" against American students of the Jewish faith? Deport them," he added.</p>

<p>Since the October 7 Hamas attacks and the subsequent response by Israel, Columbia University has been the epicentre for disruptive protests -- often targeting Israel and Jews in particular.</p>

<h3><strong>What is intifada?</strong></h3>

<p>Chants of intifada have been heard during several protests at the US college campuses in the last year. Intifada in layman's terms means an uprising or rebellion with the Palestinian side referring to it as a peaceful call to resist Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. However, Jews regard chants like "globalise the intifada" as calls for violence against them and the state of Israel.</p>

<p>There have been two intifadas in the Israel-Palestine conflict so far. Both the first intifada (1987-1993) and the second intifada (2000-2005) involved violence, bloodshed, terrorist attacks and loss of ordinary lives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of Donald Trump's closest allies, made a surprise appearance Saturday at the ceremony marking the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.</p>

<p>The boss of Tesla, SpaceX and social media network X landed during the afternoon at Le Bourget airport north of Paris, which is frequently used by private jets, an airport source told AFP, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>Musk was then present inside the cathedral for the ceremony on Saturday evening to mark its re-opening after the 2019 fire. His attendance had not previously been announced.</p>

<p>He took a picture of the cathedral's immense doors before entering and also had an exchange inside with Trump who was sitting in the front row.</p>

<p>"Magnificat Cathedrale," he posted on X with a video of the cathedral's vaulted roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk has taken an influential and highly visible role at Trump's side since the Republican won re-election in the United States on November 5.</p>

<p>He spent at least $270 million funding Trump's campaign and he moved into the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after election day while the next White House team was assembled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two men have watched an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout in New York, as well as the launch of one of Musk's SpaceX rockets.</p>

<p>Trump has selected the South African-born tycoon and fellow ally Vivek Ramaswamy to head the so-called "Department of Government Efficiency", a commission that will recommend ways of slashing billions of dollars in federal spending.</p>

<p>Given that Musk's businesses are regulated by and receive contracts from the US government, his role has raised concerns about conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Trump accepted French President Emmanuel Macron's invitation to attend the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral, more than five years after it was devastated by a fire.</p>

<p>He met Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Saturday, renewing a relationship that was often tense during Trump's first term in office.</p>

<p>The president-elect has nominated several people close to Musk for roles in his new administration, including investor David Sacks as the so-called "AI and crypto czar".</p>

<p>Billionaire astronaut Jared Isaacman, who has collaborated with Musk's SpaceX, was named the head of US space agency NASA.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The archbishop of Paris re-opened Notre Dame cathedral on Saturday by symbolically knocking on the doors and entering the 12th-century landmark which has been restored after a devastating fire in 2019.</p>

<p>Wearing new designer vestments and carrying a staff cut from one of the roof beams that survived the inferno, Laurent Ulrich joined hundreds of VIPs inside the Gothic masterpiece for a two-hour ceremony.</p>

<p>Ulrich commanded the cathedral to "open your doors" and he entered the magnificently-restored edifice.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump sat on the front row as guest of honour next to French President Emmanuel Macron, with invitees marvelling at the freshly cleaned walls, new furniture and state-of-the-art lightening installed as part of the cathedral's overhaul.</p>

<p>Outside, small crowds of Parisians and tourists braved wet weather and high winds to witness the renaissance of a beloved monument which came close to being totally destroyed by the inferno that toppled its roof and spire.</p>

<p>"I find it really beautiful, even more so now that the spire has been restored," Marie Jean, a 27-year-old dentist from southwest France, told AFP outside.</p>

<p>The reconstruction effort has cost around 700 million euros ($750 million), financed from donations, with the re-opening achieved within a five-year deadline set by Macron despite predictions it could take decades.</p>

<p>Workers had to overcome problems with lead pollution, the Covid-19 epidemic, and the army general overseeing the project falling to his death while hiking in the Pyrenees last year.</p>

<p>It is "a cathedral like we have never seen before," Philippe Jost, who took over as project manager last year, told Franceinfo radio, adding that he was proud to "show the whole world" a "great collective success and a source of pride for all of France".</p>

<p>Saturday's service will feature prayer, organ music and hymns from the cathedral's choir.</p>

<p>A public concert planned in front of the cathedral featuring Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang and possibly US singer and fashion designer Pharrell Williams had to be pre-recorded on Friday night because of the stormy weather.</p>

<p>- 'Do the impossible' -</p>

<p>Held up as an example of French creativity and resilience by Macron, Notre Dame's renaissance so soon after the fire comes at a difficult time for the country.</p>

<p>The sense of national accomplishment in restoring a symbol of Paris has been undercut by political turmoil that has left France without a proper government since last week when prime minister Michel Barnier lost a confidence vote.</p>

<p>Macron is hoping the re-opening might provide a fleeting sense of national pride and unity -- as the Paris Olympics did in July and August.</p>

<p>The scale of the immense security operation also recalls the Olympics -- with some 6,000 police officers and gendarmes mobilised.</p>

<p>The re-opening "is the proof that we know how to do grand things, we know how to do the impossible" Macron said Thursday in a televised address to the country.</p>

<p>He is set to address the congregation during Saturday's ceremony.</p>

<p><strong>Trump show?</strong></p>

<p>Macron has scored a major coup by attracting incoming US president Donald Trump for his first foreign trip since his re-election.</p>

<p>Another 40 heads of state and government are also present, including Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, who was given a round of applause as he entered Notre Dame, as well as British heir to the throne, Prince William.</p>

<p>Macron hosted three-way talks with Zelensky and Trump at the presidential palace shortly before the ceremony, with future US military support for Ukraine's war effort against Russia's invasion expected to have been discussed.</p>

<p>Trump has vowed to force an end to the nearly three-year Ukraine war when he takes office, sparking fears in Kyiv that he will force Ukraine to make territorial concessions to Russia which Zelensky is resisting.</p>

<p>"It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that," Trump told reporters as he prepared to sit down for talks with Macron.</p>

<p>One surprising absentee on Saturday was Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>He sent a message addressed to the French people which is set to be read out.</p>

<p>The exact cause of the 2019 blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the first mass with 170 bishops and more than 100 Paris priests will take place at 10:30 am (0930 GMT), followed by a second service in the evening at 6:30 pm which will be open to the public.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Rebels on a lightning advance through Syria said they were nearing the capital Damascus on Saturday, although the Bashar al-Assad government denied the army had withdrawn from areas around the city. The rebels claimed they had encircled the city.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">"Our forces have begun the final phase of encircling the capital," said rebel commander Hassan Abdel Ghani, with the Islamist-led alliance that launched the offensive, news agency AFP reported.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group which has headed the assault, told fighters to prepare to take the seat of Assad's government, just over a week into a renewed offensive in the long dormant conflict.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">"Damascus awaits you," said HTS's Ahmed al-Sharaa in a statement on Telegram, using his real name instead of his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Syria's defence ministry said army forces were "present in all areas of the Damascus countryside". "There is no truth to news claiming our armed forces... have withdrawn" from positions near Damascus, it said. Syria's presidency denied reports that Assad had left Damascus, saying he was "following up on his work and national and constitutional duties from the capital".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years. As the Islamist rebels seize more territory, they have sought to reassure minority groups living in areas now under their control. "We ask that all sects be reassured... for the era of sectarianism and tyranny has gone away forever," said Abdel Ghani.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Since the offensive began last week, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed. The United Nations said the violence has displaced 3.7 lakh people.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Syria must not be allowed to fall into the hands of "terrorist" rebels fighting the forces of Moscow's ally President Bashar al-Assad. "It's inadmissible to allow the terrorist group to take control of the lands in violation of agreements which exist, starting with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 which strongly reiterated sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Syrian Arab Republic," Mr Lavrov said at an event in Qatar, referring to a 2015 UN resolution for a political settlement in Syria.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for a "political solution to the conflict", his spokesperson said on Friday, in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">US President-elect Donald Trump, however, on Saturday said the US should "not get involved" in the situation in Syria. "Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, and the United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">There has been no public signal that the Biden administration is contemplating such an intervention. Trump has long taken an isolationist approach, and during this year's presidential campaign he often said he could end the Ukraine and Gaza wars "quickly."</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 22 terrorists were eliminated while six soldiers were killed during three separate operations over two days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwestern Pakistan, media wing of the army said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The intelligence-based operations (IBO) took place in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa's Tank, North Waziristan, and Thall districts from December 6 to 7, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.</p>

<p>In Tank district, the troops effectively engaged the terrorists' location in Gul Imam area on the reported presence of terrorists resulting in the death of nine terrorists while six were injured.</p>

<p>At least 10 terrorists were successfully neutralised in North Waziristan while in the third encounter, as per the ISPR, the security forces thwarted terrorists' attempt to attack a check post in Thall district during which three terrorists were killed.</p>

<p>However, six soldiers were also killed during the intense exchange of fire, the ISPR said adding, sanitisation operations have been launched in the area.</p>

<p>Province's Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, paid tributes to the six security personnel and extended heartfelt sympathies to their families.</p>

<p>There has been an uptick in terrorism incidents by operators and separatist groups in Pakistan in recent months as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other operator outfits have intensified actions against security forces. It has prompted the security forces and the local police to intensify operations against the terrorists.</p>

<p>The third quarter (July-September) of 2024 saw a sharp increase in fatalities of terrorist violence and counter-terrorism campaigns, with a 90 per cent surge in violence, according to a report issued by think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS).</p>

<p>A total of 722 people, including civilians, security personnel, and outlaws, were killed while 615 others wounded in as many as 328 incidents recorded during the period under review.</p>

<p>Nearly 97 per cent of these fatalities occurred in KP and Balochistan - marking the highest percentage in a decade, and over 92 per cent of these incidents of terror attacks and security forces' operations were recorded in the same provinces.</p>

<p>The total fatalities from three quarters of this year have now surpassed the total fatalities recorded for the entire 2023; with the number of fatalities rising to at least 1,534 in the first three quarters compared to 1,523 in 2023.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, terrorist groups continue to reorganise and beef up their ranks. Most of the terror attacks remained unclaimed by terrorist or insurgent groups, likely for tactical reasons, as per the report.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday hosted three-way talks with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump, discussing what the American president-elect termed a world that was a "little crazy".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday hosted three-way talks with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump, discussing what the American president-elect termed a world that was a "little crazy".</p>

<p>Zelensky's meeting with Trump just before the three men headed to Notre Dame for the re-opening ceremony of the great Paris cathedral was his first face-to-face meeting with tycoon-turned-politician since his election victory.</p>

<p>The meeting was of huge importance to Zelensky given the fears in Kyiv that Trump, who once boasted he could end Russia's war on Ukraine in 24 hours, may urge Ukraine to make concessions to Moscow.</p>

<p>It offered a unique chance for Macron to gain insights into how a second Trump presidency will shape out when he takes office in January, with the trip to Paris his first international visit since the election win.</p>

<p>Trump and Macron embraced and shook hands several times on the steps of the French presidential palace, with Trump given a full guard of honour despite not yet being in office.</p>

<p>"It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that," Trump told reporters as he prepared to sit down for the talks with Macron.</p>

<p>Despite tensions between the two men during his first term, Trump hailed his ties with the centrist French leader, saying: "We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot."</p>

<p><strong>'Remember the solidarity'</strong></p>

<p>Macron told Trump it was "a great honour for French people to welcome you" for the re-opening ceremony at Notre Dame, which was devastated by a blaze in 2019 during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>"You were president at that time and I remember the solidarity and the immediate reaction," Macron added, speaking in English.</p>

<p>When he first took office in 2017, Trump's ties with Macron -- then also a fresh face on the world stage -- began warmly despite their obvious political differences.</p>

<p>Their long and muscular handshakes -- which saw each man seek to assert his superiority -- became a light-hearted focus of attention before ties cooled, then soured, following disputes about climate change, trade and defence.</p>

<p>They were expected to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade.</p>

<p>Trump earlier wrote on his Truth Social platform that the United States should "not get involved" in the situation in Syria, where fast-moving rebel forces say they have begun to encircle the capital Damascus.</p>

<p>The Republican's return to power has rung alarms in Paris and many European capitals after his promises on the campaign trail to force an end to fighting in Ukraine which could see US military assistance to Kyiv withheld.</p>

<p>Zelensky joined the talks around half an hour later, hurrying up the steps of the Elysee and posing for a photo with the two other men.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian president, writing on social media, called the three-way meeting "good and productive".</p>

<p>"We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way," he added.</p>

<p>In his own reaction to the discussions, Macron wrote on social media: "Let us continue our joint efforts for peace and security."</p>

<p>Zelensky's spokesman Sergiy Nykyforov told journalists the meeting lasted approximately 35 minutes, with only the three leaders present.</p>

<p>Trump has scoffed at the billions of dollars in US military assistance to Ukraine and has spoken of forcing a quick settlement.</p>

<p>European allies have largely enjoyed a close working relationship with outgoing President Joe Biden on the crisis in the Middle East, but Trump is likely to distance himself and ally the United States even more closely with Israel.</p>

<p>In a sign of the importance of Trump's one-day trip to Paris, he was accompanied by his pick for White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, as well as his Near East and Middle East advisors, Steve Witkoff and Massad Boulos, according to a guest list issued by the Elysee Palace.</p>

<p>Tesla tycoon and Trump advisor Elon Musk also flew into the French capital and is expected at Notre Dame later, French sources told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 13 years since Bashar al-Assad's security forces opened fire on protesters demanding democratic reforms, the Syrian president's grip on power may finally be weakening.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old son and heir of late dictator Hafez al-Assad has faced several setbacks during the long civil war triggered by his brutal crackdown in March 2011, but has so far managed to cling on to power.</p>

<p>Now, with his Lebanese ally Hezbollah reeling from an Israeli onslaught and his great power backer Russia distracted by its invasion of Ukraine, Assad is running short of friends on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Key cities in the north, including Aleppo and Hama have fallen to opposition fighters in just a matter of days.</p>

<p>And on Saturday the rebels said they are now encircling the capital where Assad has ruled since the death of his father in 2000.</p>

<p>Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed the rebel advance; Israel is reinforcing its forces in the occupied Golan; and Syria's southern neighbour Jordan is organising an evacuation of its citizens.</p>

<p>In a further sign of Assad's isolation, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group, which controls much of northeast Syria, said it was ready to speak to its foes among the Turkish-backed rebels.</p>

<p>But international observers have repeatedly predicted the isolated former ophthalmologist's fall since the earliest months of the uprising, and they have repeatedly been incorrect.</p>

<p>The 2011 protests against Assad's rule began after a teenager was arrested for allegedly scrawling anti-government graffiti in the southern town of Daraa.</p>

<p>Stunning advance</p>

<p>Now, for Assad's rule, the "writing is on the wall", Joshua Landis, of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told AFP. "Things are folding very quickly."</p>

<p>The rebel advance has been stunning.</p>

<p>After Aleppo and Hama fell in quick succession, the rebels and government forces were clashing Saturday near the major city of Homs.</p>

<p>Its capture would effectively cut Assad's capital off from his support base in the Alawite minority community in the coastal highlands.</p>

<p>"The Alawite minority has lost faith in Assad," Landis said. "There are serious questions about whether the Syrian army has any fight left."</p>

<p>But some caution is merited. After all, haven't world leaders underestimated Assad before?</p>

<p>As early as November 2011, Turkey's Erdogan urged Assad to hold free elections and warned that his "office is only temporary".</p>

<p>In October 2012, during a re-election campaign debate, US president Barack Obama also warned Assad that his "days are numbered".</p>

<p>The next month, Nabil Elaraby, then the head of the Arab League, declared "everyone knows that the regime in Syria will not remain for long".</p>

<p>The Syrian strongman defied them all, even as international lawyers drew up arrest warrants for war crimes and rights groups denounced Syria's use of chemical weapons and aerial bombardment in civilian areas.</p>

<p>As the civil war spiralled into overlapping regional conflicts -- government versus rebels, Turkey versus Kurdish fighters, US-backed militias against Islamic State group jihadists -- Assad retained his grip.</p>

<p>At first he was ostracised by many fellow Arab leaders, leaning instead on Iranian and Russian support, but as it became clear he was not leaving the stage diplomatic ties quietly resumed.</p>

<p><strong>Rebel victories</strong></p>

<p>And meanwhile, Russia and Iran had Assad's back. Lebanon's pro-Iran Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters, backed by Iranian advisers, to bolster Syrian government forces. Russia carried out air strikes.</p>

<p>But the speed of this week's rebel victories seems to suggest that without his powerful foreign friends, Assad's Syrian army is a hollow shell.</p>

<p>Russia has such little confidence in its ally that its embassy has acknowledged a "difficult military and political situation".</p>

<p>Before the recent ceasefire in its conflict with Israel, Hezbollah lost thousands of fighters and weapons and its long-standing chief Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>It appears to be in no position to help, despite a Hezbollah source saying Saturday it had sent 2,000 fighters into Syria's Qusayr area "to defend its positions".</p>

<p>"The Assad government is in its most precarious position since the summer of 2012," Nick Heras, an analyst at the New Lines Institute, told AFP.</p>

<p>"There is a real risk that the Assad government could lose power in Damascus, either through battles or through a negotiated retreat.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, the Assad government's ability to survive will depend on the extent to which Iran and Russia see Assad as useful to their strategies in the region."</p>

<p>Heras said that Russia, which has a naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus, would be loath to withdraw its military personnel and assets from the country, and Iran would be similarly reluctant to abandon Assad.</p>

<p>"If either or both of those allies decide they can advance their interests without Assad, then his days in power are numbered," Heras said.</p>

<p>The winners would be Assad's main regional opponents: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkey's Erdogan, who both faced periods of intense domestic criticism only to emerge victorious in war.</p>

<p>Turkey-backed rebels are now spearheading the opposition advance on Homs, and Israeli air strikes against Hezbollah and Iranian targets in Syria have effectively neutralised Assad's most potent backer.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday gave a stern reply to the 'criticism' on India's purchase of Russian oil, while strongly asserting that the world is realising the need to be at the negotiating table to resolve the nearly three-year long Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Being asked about getting 'cheap oil' from Russia, Mr Jaishankar in a stern reply said, "I get oil, yes. It is not necessarily cheap. Do you have a better deal?"</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar was speaking at the 22nd edition of the Doha Forum panel on 'Conflict Resolution in a New Era' where Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and Norway Foreign Minister, Espen Barth Eide were also present.</p>

<p>"Pleased to participate @DohaForumpanel today on the topic "Conflict Resolution in a New Era" in Doha today along with PM &amp; FM@MBA_Al Thani_of Qatar and FM @EspenBarthEide of Norway. As the conflicts around us increase, the need of the hour is more diplomacy, not less," he stated in a post on X.</p>

Speaking on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Mr Jaishankar reiterated India's stance that the situation can only be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, and not on the battlefield.</p>

<p>"We've always held to the view that this war is not going to be solved on the battlefield. At the end of the day, people are going to return to some kind of negotiating table, the sooner the better. Our effort has been to facilitate that to the extent possible. That has not been the most popular thing, at least in some parts of the world," Mr Jaishankar said at the discussion.</p>

<p>The Foreign Minister further emphasised that the world is accepting the reality of negotiation rather than continuing the war. He further pointed out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia and Ukraine, with the aim to encourage a resolution to the conflict.</p>

<p>"I do think today, the needle is moving more towards the reality of the negotiation than the continuation of the war...We are going to Moscow, talking to President Putin, going to Kyiv, engaging President Zelensky, meeting them in other places, trying to see if we can encourage find common threads that can be picked up at some point in time when the circumstances are right to be developed," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, however, also clarified that India does not have a 'peace plan' to resolve the conflict, but holds "honest and transparent" conversations between both parties.</p>

<p>"We're not attempting a peace plan, we're not doing a mediation in that sense. We're doing multiple conversations and are very transparent about telling each party that the end of conversation that this is what we'll tell the other party. We think that at this point of time, the most useful...diplomatically," he said.</p>

<p>He further added that he believed that it was important to bring the Global South's perspective on how they are impacted by the war.</p>

<p>"We also believe in this that we articulate the sentiments and the interests of the global South, 125 other countries who found their fuel costs, food costs, inflation, their fertilizer cost impacted by this war," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar is on an official visit to Qatar and Bahrain from December 6-9.</p>

<p>In Bahrain, he will co-chair the 4th India-Bahrain High Joint Commission (HJC) with the Foreign Minister of Bahrain, Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani. EAM will also participate in the 20th edition of IISS Manama Dialogue in Bahrain on December 8.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, S Jaishankar met Qatari Minister of Commerce and Industry Sheikh Faisal bin Thani bin Faisal Al Thani and Minister of State, Ahmed Al Sayed on the sidelines of the Doha Forum.<br />
The leaders were seen shaking hands and holding talks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawyer in the United States allegedly shot his 20-year-old son, burnt his body and then called the cops to tell them what he claimed was a "horrible accident". According to the <em>People</em>, 68-year-old Michael Howard from Houston, Texas,&nbsp;was arrested on Monday and charged with murder and tampering with evidence. His son, Mark Howard, was diagnosed with Down syndrome and held a job. The father allegedly told the cops that he had "mistaken" his son "for an intruder at his property" and shot him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sabine County investigator JP MacDonough said that the 68-year-old showed officers around his property when they arrived at the scene, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/lawyer-kills-son-burns-body-before-claiming-accident-say-police-8757525" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. He provided them with the shotgun he allegedly used to shoot his son before leading them to the wood pile where the 20-year-old's burned body was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michael Howard "had taken the body of the deceased, placed it in the front loading bucket of a backhoe tractor, and carried it to a remote area on his property and placed the body on a pile of wood and other burnable material, which had been previously set up and then, his words, 'cremated' his son in accordance with what he felt his son would have wanted," the investigator said, adding that the crime scene appeared to have been "washed" with a "water hose".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Howard says the "whole thing was a horrible accident," JP MacDonough alleged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is a bizarre crime. Mr Howard committed this act and then in the furtherance of that, burned the body and then cleaned the crime scene, which as an investigator I would take as indicative of nefarious purposes," MacDonough said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The victim's mother and his two siblings were not at the home at the time of the incident, police said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, the district attorney said that his office is looking into possible additional charges including the desecration and mishandling of a corpse as well as other charges related to tampering with the scene of a crime.</p>

<p>Currently, the 68-year-old is in custody. His bond is set at $10 million per charge.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday the US should not be involved in the conflict in Syria, where rebel forces are threatening the government of President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>"Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.</p>

<p>Trump said because Russia, an Assad ally, is tied up fighting a war with Ukraine it "seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years."</p>

<p>If Russia were forced out of Syria, it "may actually be the best thing that can happen to them" because "there was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump's comments appeared to reflect his opposition to the presence of some 900 US troops in Syria, mostly of them in the northeast, where they have backed a Syrian Kurd-led alliance in preventing a resurgence of Islamic State militants.<br />
Trump announced in 2018 during his first term that he wanted to withdraw the US troops because he said Islamic State was near defeat.</p>

<p>But he held off as advisers warned that a pullout would leave a void that would be filled by Iran and Russia.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protesters brought down the statue of the late father of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a main square in Jermana suburb, nearly ten kilometers from the centre of Damascus, a witness and activists told Reuters.</p>

<p>The protesters in the mainly Druze inhabited suburb, who called for the downfall of Assad, also headed to government buildings in the heavily policed area of the capital where several security branches are located, they said.</p>

<p>The protesters headed to security offices to demand they evacuate from their area, activist Ryan Marouf, editor of Suwayda 24, a website that covers the province, told Reuters.</p>

<p>The authorities have tolerated most protests by the country's Druze minority, unlike in other government-held areas where demonstrators are fired on by security forces.</p>

<p>In a rare act of defiance in areas under Assad's rule, protesters also tore down posters of Assad, where the party has promoted a personality cult around him and his late father, former president Hafez al-Assad.</p>

<p>Last night saw clashes in the predominately Druze city of Suweida that led to at least five people being killed when local Druze militias raided the city's main police station, overran security offices and freed prisoners from the main prison</p>

<p>In Deraa city to the west of Suweida city, where former rebels and dissidents took control after the army pulled out its troops, a statue of Assad was brought down last night, residents said, as people fired gunshots in celebration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A prolific "catfish" offender whose cruel campaign of global online blackmail targeted thousands of young victims and drove a 12-year-old US girl to suicide was on Friday jailed for life.</p>

<p>Alexander McCartney, 26, posed online as a teenage girl to befriend young females across the world on the social media app Snapchat, forcing them to send him explicit pictures, then threatening to make them public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He admitted 185 charges involving 70 children and was told he would spend at least 20 years behind bars.</p>

<p>Detective Chief Superintendent Eamonn Corrigan, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said McCartney was a "disgusting child predator" whose offending had been on an "industrial scale".</p>

<p>"Sitting in his childhood bedroom in Newry (in Northern Ireland), he began his offending as a late teenager and built what can only be described as a paedophile enterprise," he told reporters outside court.</p>

<p>"McCartney is a dangerous, relentless, cruel paedophile," he added.</p>

<p>Cimarron Thomas from West Virginia in the United States took her own life in May 2018 after McCartney demanded that she involve her younger sister in sex acts he had coerced her into.</p>

<p>Eighteen months later, her distraught father Ben Thomas also died by suicide.</p>

<p>Belfast Crown Court heard earlier other victims had been in the United States as well as in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<h3><strong>'Sexual deviant'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sentencing McCartney, judge John O'Hara said he was unaware of any other case in which an offender had used social media to "inflict such terrible and catastrophic damage on young girls up to and including the death of a 12-year-old girl".</p>

<p>"It is truly difficult to think of a sexual deviant who poses a greater risk than this defendant," he added.</p>

<p>O'Hara said McCartney had been "remorseless" in his offending, ignoring "multiple pleas for mercy".</p>

<p>Even after his third arrest, he said, the former computer science student kept offending in "an even more sinister, dramatic and appalling manner".</p>

<p>McCartney previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter relating to Cimarron's death.</p>

<p>Corrigan told reporters McCartney had even started a countdown when Cimarron threatened to kill herself with a legally owned firearm and told her: "I don't care."</p>

<p>"He may as well have pulled the trigger himself," he added. "There's only one place for him, that's behind bars."</p>

<p>McCartney also admitted 59 counts of blackmail, dozens of charges related to making and distributing indecent photographs and scores more of inciting children to engage in sexual activity.</p>

<h3><strong>'Horrific'</strong></h3>

<p>Police in Northern Ireland worked with other forces internationally to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Derek Gordon, the US special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations based in Washington DC, praised the investigation and prosecution of McCartney by Northern Irish counterparts as "nothing short of brilliant".</p>

<p>"Alexander McCartney committed some horrific and disturbing crimes and deserves every minute he serves in prison," he said.</p>

<p>Catherine Kierans, from the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service, said McCartney was estimated to have targeted 3,500 girls, some as young as 10.</p>

<p>Despite exhaustive efforts, however, many of his victims may never be identified.</p>

<p>She urged any child or young person to seek help if they were being threatened by someone demanding sexual images or videos.</p>

<p>"This is a crime. You are not to blame. Please talk to a trusted adult," she said, praising the bravery of the victims who had helped to convict McCartney.</p>

<p>And she called on parents and carers to talk to their children to keep them safe online.</p>

<p>"It is by bringing these issues out into the open that we can break the cycle of secrecy abusers rely on," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With less than two weeks left for the presidential polls, the race seems extremely tight with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump tied at 48 per cent in the popular vote, according to the final national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College.</p>

<p>The results of the poll are not encouraging for Harris as it comes just less than two weeks ahead of the elections and as millions of people across the US have already cast votes, according to the New York Times.</p>

<p>The elections in the US are set to be held on November 5, with former US President Donald Trump running for a second term and Vice President Kamala Harris aiming to create history by becoming the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>In recent elections, Democrats have had an edge in the popular vote while they have lost the Electoral College and thus the White House. They have been looking to Harris to build a strong national lead as an indication that she would perform well in such critical swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as reported by the New York Times.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump remain tied even after three months of the most tumultuous months in the recent political history of the US.</p>

<p>In the past few months, the presidential nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties have participated in high-profile debates, two assassination attempts on Trump have been made and the two leaders have held dozens of rallies across the seven battlefield states. In the past few months, hundreds of millions spent on advertisements have seemingly done little to change the trajectory of the race.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' position, might have declined among likely voters since the last Times/Siena College poll, conducted in early October, the report added.</p>

<p>At the time, Kamala Harris had a narrow lead over Donald Trump, 49 per cent to 46 per cent. The change is within the margin of error. However, the Times's national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Although the latest Times/Siena College poll has given a glimpse into national sentiment, ever, the presidential election will be decided in the seven battleground states where Trump and Harris have spent a lot of their resources and time.</p>

<p>Most polls in those states -- Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan -- indicate the contest is equally close.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A NASA astronaut who just returned from the International Space Station has been hospitalized for an unspecified medical condition but remains stable, the US space agency said Friday.</p>

<p>The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital laboratory.</p>

<p>On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was without incident, NASA said in a blog post.</p>

<p>But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an "additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an abundance of caution," it added, without elaborating.</p>

<p>NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenki were all flown to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola.</p>

<p>Three were subsequently released, while one of the NASA astronauts remains at the hospital "under observation as a precautionary measure."</p>

<p>NASA said it would not disclose specific medical information to protect the crew member's privacy but would provide updates as available.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Francis, who was the oldest living person in the United States, has died at the age of 115. Ms Francis died peacefully on Tuesday while surrounded by her family, granddaughter Ethel Harrison, who was also her primary caregiver told <em>ABC News</em>. At the time of her death, Ms Francis was the oldest living person in the US and the third-oldest person in the world, according to LongeviQuest, a global database of the world's oldest individuals. She lived most of her life in Houston, Texas, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/elizabeth-francis-oldest-living-person-us-dies-115/story?id=115087261">ABC News</a>,</em> Ms Harrison described Ms Francis as a "person who loved people". "She loved the Lord. Her faith was extremely strong. She was always, you know, jolly, you know, 'how you doing? You're doing okay?' That was just her personality. And she would always say, treat people like you want to be treated. And that was her motto," Ms Harrison added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, in a statement, LongeviQuest spokesperson, Ben Meyers, called Ms Francis "America's Grandmother". "She lived a life of faith and love, always crediting the Good Lord for her longevity. She was beloved by her family and community," Mr Meyers said.</p>

<p>"They are in our prayers, especially her daughter Ms. Dorothy Williams, whom she lived with until the end, and her granddaughter Ms. Ethel Harrison whose joyful dedication made it possible for her grandmother to live at home even at age 115," he added.</p>

<p>Ms Francis was born in Louisiana on July 25, 1909. She lived through everything from World War I to the sinking of the Titanic. She raised her daughter as a single mother, ran a coffee shop in Houston and preferred walking over driving. The 115-year-old was alive during the Great Depression, the first aeroplane flight across the Atlantic and 20 presidents from William Howard Taft to Joe Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, on her 115th birthday, Ms Francis also offered a single tip on how to live a long and happy life. "Speak your mind and don't hold your tongue," she said.</p>

<p>Notably, Ms Francis was crowned the country's oldest person in February earlier this year after the previous longevity record holder, Edie Ceccarelli, died a few weeks after her 116th birthday in California. In April, she was then awarded a plaque recognising her as the oldest person in the US from LongeviQuest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, America's oldest living person is Naomi Whitehead, who was born on September 26, 1910, according to LongeviQuest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel has launched targeted strikes against Iran, with its military saying the strikes are in response to the October 1 missile attack, during which Iran fired approximately 200 ballistic missiles at Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sp_only-ul-ol sp_only-ul-ol-2">
<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;"In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel, the IDF is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-live-updates-israel-begins-strikes-on-military-targets-in-iran-6875837"> Israeli officials</a> have clarified that these attacks are justified as measures of self-defence. IDF's spokesperson Daniel Hagari also urged Israeli citizens to "remain alert and vigilant."</li>
	<li>The United States confirmed it was informed of the impending strike, although no US personnel or assets were involved in the operation. Sean Savett, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, termed Israel's actions as "an exercise of self-defence and in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel."&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Iranian state TV reported "strong explosions" around Tehran on Saturday morning, without specifying their cause. The semi-official Tasnim News Agency noted that no rockets or aircraft were reported in the skies over Tehran at the time of the explosions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Iranian state TV claimed that the blasts heard around Tehran were due to the "activation of the air defence system." "The loud blasts heard around Tehran were related to the activation of the air defence system against the actions of Zionist regime which attacked three locations outside of Tehran city," state TV reported</li>
	<li>Iranian authorities suggested the noises could be related to defensive measures, hinting at the possibility that Iran's air defence systems had been activated.</li>
	<li>In addition to Tehran, residents in the nearby city of Karaj reported hearing blasts. Iranian authorities say that operations at critical sites such as the Imam Khomeini International Airport, Mehrabad Airport, and a prominent oil refinery south of Tehran were "normal" and unaffected by the strikes. However, several military bases near Tehran were reportedly targeted by Israeli forces, according to Iran's Fars News Agency.</li>
	<li>Reports of explosions from Syria's state news agency SANA noted that Syrian air defences were activated in response to "hostile targets" near the capital, Damascus. While there was no official statement connecting the Syrian incidents directly to the Israeli strikes in Iran, explosions were heard in Damascus and central regions.</li>
	<li>In recent weeks, Israel has intensified operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - both allies of Iran - following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>This brutal assault, labelled the deadliest attack in Israel's history, has triggered relentless Israeli offensives across Gaza and heightened security measures along Israel's northern border with Lebanon to counter Hezbollah's influence.</li>
	<li>Israel's defence minister warned earlier this week that any attempt to harm Israel would result in a "heavy price". The United States, while voicing its support for Israel's right to defend itself, has been diplomatically active, pushing to prevent a chain reaction that could destabilise the entire region.</li>

<p>According to Fox News, the White House was notified shortly before Israel carried out air strikes on Iran.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel hit back at Iran early on Saturday, with its military saying it was conducting strikes against military targets in response to Tehran's attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>The Middle East has been on edge in anticipation of Israeli retaliation for a ballistic-missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, in which around 200 ballistic missiles were fired at Israel, Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months.</p>

<p>"In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israel says it has the right and duty to respond to attacks from Tehran and its proxies, which have included missile strikes launched from Iranian soil.</p>

<p>"Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized," it added.</p>

<p>The scope of the attack was not immediately clear.</p>

<p>Iran's state TV said several strong explosions were heard around the capital Tehran. Semi-official Iranian media said explosions were also heard in the nearby city of Karaj.</p>

<p>The Tasnim news agency said that "nothing has been reported about hearing the sound of rockets or airplanes in the sky of Tehran so far".</p>

<p>State TV cited unnamed Iranian intelligence officials as saying that the origin of the loud explosions "could be from the activation of Iran's air defense system."</p>

<p>Iranian authorities have repeatedly warned Israel against launching an attack, saying any strike on Iran would be met with a stronger retaliation.</p>

<p>The United States was notified by Israel ahead of its strikes on targets in Iran but was not involved in the operation, a U.S. official told Reuters.</p>

<p>"We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st," said White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.</p>

<p>Washington is seeking to head off further widening of the conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that Israel's retaliation should not lead to greater escalation.</p>

<p>Syrian state TV said explosions were also heard in the Damascus countryside and central region.</p>

<p>Israel's defense minister said this week that enemies would "pay a heavy price" for trying to harm Israel.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks Israel has intensified its offensive against Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza and its Iran-backed ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. The war was triggered a year ago by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CEO William Lewis said this was a return "to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."</p>

<p>However, the Post editorial board has endorsed candidates for much of the last four decades -- all of them Democrats -- before deciding to stay on the sidelines in one of the most polarizing elections in US history.</p>

<p>Newspaper editorials have little of their once-powerful political heft. But the Post -- whose slogan is "Democracy dies in darkness" -- is one traditional media outlet that retains influence among Washington's elite.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign quickly pounced, crowing that "Harris is so bad, The Washington Post decided to never endorse another presidential candidate again."</p>

<p>The Washington Post Guild, which represents unionized staff at the newspaper, said it was "deeply concerned."</p>

<p>"We are already seeing cancellations from once loyal readers," a statement said.</p>

<p>US media reported that a senior Post figure, editor at large Robert Kagan, had resigned in protest.</p>

<p><strong>- Billionaire owners -</strong></p>

<p>The Post's decision follows a similar move by another of the big remaining US newspapers, the Los Angeles Times.</p>

<p>The billionaire owner of the Times blocked the editorial board from issuing an endorsement for Harris, according to editorial editor Mariel Garza, who resigned in response on Wednesday.</p>

<p>According to a report by The Washington Post on its website, Bezos likewise intervened to block the board from publishing its editorial in favor of Harris. However, a source close to the Post's leadership told AFP that this "is inaccurate."</p>

<p>By contrast, The New York Times endorsed Harris in September, calling her "the only patriotic choice for president" and warning that "it is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States" than Trump.</p>

<p>On Friday, Harris also scored the backing of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the biggest newspaper in swing state Pennsylvania, which declared that "voters face an easy but tectonic choice."</p>

<p>The Republican got his own boost Friday from the New York Post, the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, which declared that "America is ready for today's heroic Donald Trump to reclaim the presidency."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Cowardice'? -</strong></p>

<p>In a statement, The Washington Post's Lewis wrote that the paper would not make presidential endorsements again.</p>

<p>"Our job at The Washington Post is to provide through the newsroom non-partisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds," he said.</p>

<p>The Post has been endorsing Democratic candidates consistently as far back as the 1980s, always making clear that the editorial board works separately to the newsgathering operation -- as is typical in US news organizations.</p>

<p>The Post's former executive editor, Marty Baron, lashed out at the daily's "cowardice, with democracy as its casualty."</p>

<p>Baron said that Trump would see the decision "as an invitation to further intimidate" Bezos.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, US media reported Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, US media reported Friday.</p>

<p>The New York Times, quoting people familiar with the matter, said the hacking attempt appeared to be part of a wide-ranging intelligence collection effort by Chinese hackers.</p>

<p>The newspaper said it involved the infiltration of Verizon phone systems and investigators were seeking to determine whether any communications data was taken.</p>

<p>A person familiar with the matter said the campaign of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz was also targeted.</p>

<p>Rich Young, a spokesman for Verizon, told AFP: "We are aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several US telecommunications providers to gather intelligence."</p>

<p>The Times said the Trump campaign was informed this week that the former president and Vance were among a number of people inside and outside government whose phone numbers had been targeted.</p>

<p>Western cybersecurity experts believe the hacking was carried out by a Chinese group known as "Salt Typhoon," the newspaper said.</p>

<p>The Washington Post said the hacking campaign is believed to have compromised the phones of two staffers on the Trump-Vance campaign.</p>

<p>The FBI declined to comment on the reports that Trump's and Vance's phones had been targeted.</p>

<p>But the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a joint statement that the "US government is investigating the unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China."</p>

<p>"After the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims," they said.</p>

<p>"Agencies across the US Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector," they added.</p>

<p>The United States charged three Iranians last month with involvement in a hacking effort targeting the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Joe Biden formally apologized on Friday for the U.S. government's role in running abusive Native American boarding schools for more than 150 years, and was heckled at the event over his support for Israel's war in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;President Joe Biden formally apologized on Friday for the U.S. government's role in running abusive Native American boarding schools for more than 150 years, and was heckled at the event over his support for Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"This to me is one of the most consequential things I've ever had an opportunity to do in my whole career," Biden said in his apology at an outdoor football and track field in Laveen Village, Arizona, near Phoenix.</p>

<p>"It's a sin on our soul. ... I formally apologize."</p>

<p>Several hundred people attended, many of them in traditional tribal dress. They cheered as Biden apologized for the generational trauma faced by the Native American community due to the boarding schools across the country.</p>

<p>Biden faced a brief interruption when a pro-Palestinian protester shouted: "How can you apologize for a genocide while committing a genocide in Palestine?"</p>

<p>The president replied, "There is a lot of innocent people being killed and it has to stop."</p>

<p>U.S. support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel has led to months of demonstrations across the United States. Rights advocates have demanded an arms embargo against Israel as tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in the region, and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have grappled with hunger and disease.</p>

<p>Israel and Washington deny genocide allegations brought against Israel at the World Court in relation to Gaza, and Washington has maintained its support for its ally.</p>

<p>Friday's trip marked Biden's first time visiting Indian Country while in office and is part of his effort to cement his legacy in his final months in the White House.</p>

<p>Arizona is also one of the seven battleground states in a tight race for the Nov. 5 U.S. election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris faces Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to be a cabinet secretary, had launched an investigation to recognize the troubled legacy of federal Native American boarding school policies.</p>

<p>An Interior Department investigative report released in July found that at least 973 children died in these schools. Haaland's family members were among the children forced into the boarding schools.</p>

<p>From 1819 through the 1970s, the United States implemented policies establishing and supporting hundreds of American Indian boarding schools across the U.S. Their purpose was to culturally assimilate Native Americans by forcibly removing them from their families, communities, religions and cultural beliefs.</p>

<p>Like the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have in recent years reviewed past abuse toward Indigenous communities, including children in schools.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said Friday that a strike that killed three journalists in south Lebanon was "under review", maintaining that it had targeted Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>"Earlier today, following intelligence information, the IDF (army) struck a Hezbollah military structure in Hasbaya in southern Lebanon," the military said in a statement to AFP.</p>

<p>"The strike was carried out while the terrorists were located inside the structure," it added.</p>

<p>"Several hours after the strike, reports were received that journalists had been hit during the strike. The incident is under review."</p>

<p>Lebanese television channel Al Mayadeen said a cameraman and broadcast engineer were killed in the strike in Hasbaya, which according to the Pro-Iran network targeted a journalists' residence.</p>

<p>Another TV outlet, Al-Manar, run by Hezbollah, said one of its video journalists was also killed.</p>

<p>After the strike, a car bearing a "press" marking was crushed under debris.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused Israel of intentionally targeting the journalists in what he called a "war crime" that "aims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction".</p>

<p>Israel expanded its focus to Lebanon last month, after nearly a year of war in Gaza sparked by Hamas's attack, launching a massive bombing campaign targeting mainly Hezbollah strongholds across the country and sending in ground troops on September 30.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recalled Indian High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma on Friday shared a terrifying moment when Khalistani 'goons' came very close to bodily harm him and attacked him with a 'sharp object' - most likely a 'kirpan' - in Alberta.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recalled Indian High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma on Friday shared a terrifying moment when Khalistani 'goons' came very close to bodily harm him and attacked him with a 'sharp object' - most likely a 'kirpan' - in Alberta that could potentially harm him.</p>

<p>In a podcast with ANI, Sanjay Verma shared his experience of threats and intimidation from the Khalistanis.</p>

<p>Sanjay Verma said, "All these attempts to harm me bodily, that was in the presence of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the local police and the local police on the ground took immediate action, pushed him away because there was a sharp weapon and the RCMP then whisked me from the side door to the venue."</p>

<p>"It was in Alberta. I am not an expert on Canadian law about open carrying so I will not be able to say that. But most likely they would have said that it was 'kirpan' which is a small blade whereas they had swords in their hand. They could come very, very close to me," said Mr Verma.</p>

<p>When asked if the incident was reported, Sanjay Verma said, "It was all reported and we were told that investigations are on."</p>

<p>Speaking of intimidation from the Khalistanis, Sanjay Verma said that the intimidation came through banned organisations associated with the Khalistani extremists.</p>

<p>"Some came through emails during the so-called protests, which I call hooliganism when they gathered in front of the two consulates or the High Commission. They would shout slogans to intimidate us. Whenever we were attending public events, again, they would shout slogans to intimidate us," he said.</p>

<p>Sharing an incident, Sanjay Verma said, "In one instance, close to Diwali, they created 10 heads for me, called me Ravan. And then my effigy was burnt as Ravan. Is that not hate speech? Then they created another poster of mine. And they riddled it with bullets. Is that not hate speech? Then what is it?"</p>

<p>"I reported this to the foreign ministry. The response was that we forwarded it to the relevant authorities, which is correct. We also do the same. But the report never came back. Okay. So we presume that nothing happened. So we presume that it went into a black box. Not to come out," he stated.</p>

<p>When asked if he, at any point, felt threatened physically,&nbsp;Sanjay Verma replied, "Threatened, yes. But did I become threatened? No. In most of my public events, there will be these hooligans outside shouting slogans against India, but also against me. Some of them are very burly-looking tall guys who would also gesture to physically harm me, but just the gestures, except for a few incidents. And so they tried."</p>

<p>"They came close to me. They tried to intimidate me through such, slogans shouting, and abusing me verbally. That was reported," he stated.</p>

<p>Speaking about his security, Sanjay Verma said, "I had Canadian security, both federal and local."</p>

<p>Asked about whether he, at any time, doubted their ability to protect him, he replied, "No, that I won't say. They were very professional, well-trained, and very respectful. So as far as the police officers who were protecting us and now protecting my colleagues there, very, very professional, never had an iota of doubt on their professionalism."</p>

<p>He added, "But unfortunately, the statement which we saw in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police press briefing, where even the investigation has not been concluded, that was a sad thing to see."</p>

<p>Mr Verma said that he was there to serve India's national interest and was committed to doing so.</p>

<p>"So diplomacy for most of us would be, you know, being nice, nice cities. But then the final objective of diplomacy happens to be to safeguard your national interest. National interest could be improving relationships. National interest could be raising awareness against these Khalistani goons. All these are national interests," he said.</p>

<p>"So we work for the national interests. It so happened that my national interest was a bit different than the national interest of most other ambassadors in other countries," said Sanjay Verma.</p>

<p>Mr Verma was recalled from Canada after the country said he was a person of interest in the case of the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He denied all charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada soured after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged in the Canadian Parliament last year that he had "credible allegations" of India's hand in the killing of Nijjar.<br />
India has denied all the allegations, calling them "absurd" and "motivated" and has accused Canada of giving space to extremist and anti-India elements in their country.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed outside a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ship management firm Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean, owner of the ship with 22 Indian crew members that collided with a US bridge in March, have reached an "agreement" with the US government on cost payment, while rejecting liability for the incident]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ship management firm Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean, owner of the Singapore-flagged cargo ship with 22 Indian crew members that collided with a US bridge in March, have reached an "agreement" with the US government on cost payment, while rejecting liability for the incident.</p>

<p>Container ship 'DALI', with an all-Indian crew of 22 members onboard, had collided with one of the pillars of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore in March this year. The crew had issued a mayday call before the collision that led to the collapse of bridge, prompting authorities to limit traffic movement.</p>

<p>"We confirm that Grace Ocean and Synergy have reached an agreement with the United States regarding the payment of those costs, which are fully insured," Synergy Marine Group said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>"The settlement strictly covers costs related to clearing the channel, which we would have been responsible for in any case, and is not indicative of any liability, which we expressly reject for the incident that led to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge," it stated.</p>

<p>According to the statement, Grace Ocean and Synergy are prepared to vigorously defend themselves in the limitation of liability proceedings pending before the Federal Court in Baltimore and to establish that they were not responsible for the incident.</p>

<p>Synergy Marine Group also said "no punitive damages have been imposed as part of the settlement".</p>

<p>"In accordance with the settlement, the United States has dismissed its claim," it said.</p>

<p>In the incident, the cargo ship outbound from Baltimore to Colombo, rammed into one of the pillars of the bridge, while under pilotage with two pilots onboard. Shortly after the collision, the bridge collapsed, crashing on the cargo ship.</p>

<p>Following the disembarkation of crew members from the vessel, Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean have put measures in place to support their well-being, the company said and added the 11 crew members who disembarked in Baltimore and Norfolk in June 2024 are accommodated in serviced apartments in Baltimore.</p>

<p>One crew member was granted approval by the US government to return to India for a family ceremony. The US government further granted an extension to this crew member, who is expected to return to the US in mid-November, to further assist with the ongoing investigation, Synergy Marine said.</p>

<p>Besides, two other crew members who were granted approvals by the US government to return to India for family reasons have joined their colleagues in the US, the company said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after India announced that a patrolling arrangement had been reached with China, NDTV has accessed the first satellite images of disengagement taking place on the ground in Depsang and Demchok in Eastern Ladakh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The agreement was announced on Monday and a satellite image from the Depsang plains taken on October 11 shows four vehicles and two tents.</p>

<p>Another image taken on Friday shows that the tents have been removed and the vehicles are moving away. The land on which the tents stood has also been restored.</p>

<p>The high-resolution images have been provided by Maxar.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>The images from Depsang are from near the 'Y Junction' from where Indian soldiers were prevented from travelling east to India's patrolling points. The patrolling points, or PPs, mark the extent of the Line of Actual Control that India claims in these areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a similar satellite image from Demchok from October 9, semi-permanent Chinese structures can be seen.</p>

</div>

<p>The same structures are missing in an image from the disputed site on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-china-to-complete-disengagement-process-by-end-of-this-month-sources-6871293">Army sources had said</a> earlier in the day that the process of disengagement would be completed in the two contentious areas by Tuesday, October 29, &nbsp;and the troops would return to the positions that existed before the stand-off between the two countries began in 2020. The process includes the dismantling of structures and restoring the land on which they stood to their original condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sources said both India and China will continue to have surveillance options in Depsang and Demchok, and troops will inform the other side before stepping out on patrol "to avoid any miscommunication".</p>

<p>The stand-off began in May 2020 and a clash took place in Ladakh's Galwan the next month in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action and the Chinese side also suffered losses, with the exact number remaining unconfirmed.</p>

<p>A troop buildup followed on both sides and military-level talks began taking place to resolve the stand-off. In September 2022, Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from the contentious Gogra-Hot Springs area in Ladakh and returned to the pre-April-2020 position.</p>

<p>After <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-china-agree-on-patrolling-agreement-along-lac-leads-to-disengagement-6838489">the announcement</a> by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/we-will-be-able-to-go-back-to-2020-patrolling-s-jaishankar-on-lac-border-row-6839082">confirmed it</a> at the NDTV World Summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We reached an agreement on patrolling, and we have gone back to the 2020 position. With that, we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course," Mr Jaishankar said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are areas which, for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020," he added.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russia-Ukraine conflict was discussed in "considerable detail" during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday, with New Delhi reiterating that it is "not neutral" in this conflict and remains on the "side of peace", Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said.</p>

<p>The meeting between the two leaders took place days after PM Modi attended the BRICS Summit in Russia's Kazan and in his address at the forum renewed his call for dialogue and diplomacy as being the only way forward to resolve conflicts, in an unambiguous message to press for the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war through peaceful negotiations.</p>

<p>Mr Misri, during a media briefing, was asked how much the Russia-Ukraine conflict and West Asia conflict figured in the Modi-Scholz talks.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can confirm that both issues did come up, and they did come up in considerable details. Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) shared with the Chancellor his impressions of his meetings and interactions in the recent months, with the leaders of both Russia and Ukraine, and peace efforts that we are making in pursuing conversation on all sides," he said.</p>

<p>"Some of the ideas that different actors have been talking about, and how India remains on the side of peace. We are not neutral in this conflict, we are on the side of peace. And, we stand ready to assist any initiative towards peace, benefiting or leveraging the ability that we have of being able to engage with all sides in this conflict," the foreign secretary added.</p>

<p>India supports dialogue and diplomacy and not war, PM Modi had said at the BRICS Summit.</p>

<p>In July, PM Modi had visited Russia, marking his first visit since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>In August he undertook a visit to Ukraine at the invitation of Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>In his meeting with Chancellor Scholz on Friday, PM Modi echoed his words spoken during his historic visit to Kyiv under the shadow of the prolonged conflict.</p>

<p>"We (India) are not neutral. From the very beginning, we have taken sides. And we have chosen the side of peace. We have come from the land of Buddha where there is no place for war," PM Modi had said in his opening remarks during the talks.</p>

<p>"We have come from the land of Mahatma Gandhi who had given a message of peace to the entire world," he had said.</p>

<p>Mr Misri said on the conflict in West Asia, "both sides expressed concern" over the developments there, expressed hope that "already serious conflict" which has caused a lot of damage and casualties and destruction, "doesn't expand further and doesn't bring more actors into its ambit, and that parties concerned can find path back through dialogue and diplomacy, an reach an agreement on the issues".</p>

<p>PM Modi on Friday said the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of concern and India is ready to make every possible contribution for restoration of peace.</p>

<p>His remarks came after talks with Chancellor Scholz, who called upon India to contribute to find a political solution to the conflict in Ukraine that has been raging for a long time.<br />

<p>He said that his $70,000 salary was insufficient to support him in Los Angeles and that his comments about the department head and the institution had put him on leave.</p>

<p>"UCLA has placed me on administrative leave; they've taken all of my courses that I am teaching this fall away from me without my permission," McKeown said in a TikTok post on October 19.</p>

<p>"Chair Stuart Brown has retaliated against me for making my story public about how I wasn't paid enough to afford to work at UCLA," McKeown said.</p>

<p>"It's because Brown has not approved an accommodation that I received from my doctor saying that I should be allowed to teach online indefinitely," the lecturer said. "His offer was that I have to immediately teach in person starting (October 21), of which I am unable to because I was made homeless as a result of low pay."</p>

<p>McKeown, who started working at the California university in September 2023, first went public with his financial and housing problems in September.</p>

<p>"I was paid so poorly last year and currently that I was forced to move all my belongings into a public storage unit, and I can no longer live in my one-bedroom apartment in Westwood," McKeown said in the TikTok viewed over 1.6 million times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif left for London on Friday for medical treatments, according to his party.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo's visit to the UK comes a year after he returned to Pakistan from London following a four-year-old self-imposed exile.</p>

<p>The 74-year-old three-time former premier reached the Lahore Airport from his Jati Umra residence under high security and left for London via Dubai on a foreign airline, according to the PML-N.</p>

<p>"He will stay in Dubai for one day and continue his journey to London. He may also go to the United States later," the party said.</p>

<p>Nawaz&nbsp;Sharif will spend time with his sons in London and undergo medical treatment, it said. According to Samaa TV, he is also expected to hold important meetings there.</p>

<p>His daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, will also likely travel to London in the first week of next month.</p>

<p>Nawaz returned to the country in October 2023 after a four-year self-imposed exile in the UK.</p>

<p>He was tipped to be the prime minister of Pakistan for the fourth consecutive time after the February 2024 general election, but the powerful military establishment put its weight behind his younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif, who has a better equation with it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia's stock market value briefly touched $3.53 trillion, while that of Apple was $3.52 trillion, according to data from LSEG.</p>

<p>In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company, before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months. Microsoft's market value stood at $3.20 trillion.</p>

<p>Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion. Nvidia provides chips used to train so-called foundation models such as OpenAI's GPT-4.</p>

<p>"More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p>

<p>"It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia."</p>

<p>Nvidia's shares hit a record high on Tuesday, building on a rally from last week when TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a forecast-beating 54% jump in quarterly profit driven by soaring demand for chips used in AI.</p>

<p>The next big test will be when Nvidia reports third-quarter results in November. Nvidia in August forecast third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with the current average analyst expectation of $32.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note dated Oct. 10 that he remains "very bullish" about the company longer term, but the recent rally "raises the bar for earnings somewhat".</p>

<p>After a meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, Moore noted the ramp up in production of its next-generation Blackwell chips appeared to be "quite strong" and are booked out for 12 months. The stock came under pressure in August after Nvidia confirmed reports that the production of Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Shares of Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft have an outsized influence on the richly valued technology sector as well as the broader U.S. stock market, with the trio accounting for about a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index's weightage.</p>

<p>Frenzy around the prospects of AI, expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will considerably bring down interest rates, and most recently, an upbeat start to the earnings season, have pushed the benchmark S&amp;P 500 to an all-time high last week.</p>

<p>Nvidia's massive gains have helped boost the stock's appeal for option traders and the company's options are among the most traded on any given day in recent months, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert.</p>

<p>The stock has surged nearly 190% so far this year as a boom in generative AI prompted the company to issue a series of blowout forecasts.</p>

<p>"The question is whether the revenue stream will last for a long time and will be driven by the emotion of investors rather than by any ability to prove or disprove the thesis that AI is overdone," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.</p>

<p>"I think Nvidia knows that near term, their numbers are likely to be quite remarkable."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet's self-driving unit, Waymo, said on Friday it had closed a $5.6 billion funding round led by the Google parent, as it looks to expand its autonomous ride-hailing service.</p>

<p>Automakers and technology companies are investing in autonomous ride-hailing services to capitalize on the technology to drive commercial success, even as it faces widespread skepticism and tight regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p>The investment round also saw participation from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price, Waymo said.</p>

<p>"With this latest investment, we will continue to welcome more riders into our Waymo One ride-hailing service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and in Austin and Atlanta through our expanded partnership with Uber," the company said.</p>

<p>Alphabet had planned a $5 billion investment in Waymo over a multi-year period, finance chief Ruth Porat said in July.</p>

<p>Waymo, which offers paid rides in autonomous vehicles in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, as well as in Phoenix, Arizona, spent years logging millions of miles of testing before it received its first permit in 2022 from the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates ride-hailing services.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the electric vehicle maker will roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year.</p>

<p>General Motors' Cruise is testing cars with human safety drivers after an accident last year led it to pull all vehicles from the road. Meanwhile, Amazon's Zoox is expanding testing for its vehicles built without steering wheels and pedals.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that it was Russia's business whether or not it decided to use North Korean troops and said that if Ukraine wanted to join NATO then Moscow could do what it wanted to ensure its own security.</p>

<p>The United States said on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that the West is casting as a significant escalation of the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Ukraine's military intelligence service said that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces took a chunk of Russian land in August.</p>

<p>"When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it," Putin told Russian state television. "This is our business."</p>

<p>Putin said that the West repeatedly said that it was up to Ukraine how it ensured its security - "with or without NATO."</p>

<p>"The sooner they realise the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves," Putin said.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement during Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.</p>

<p>Article 4 of the agreement says: "If one of the Parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, the other party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal."</p>

<p>Putin on Thursday did not deny U.S. claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia but said on Thursday it is up to Moscow how to run its mutual defence clause with Pyongyang and accused the West of escalating the Ukraine war.<br />

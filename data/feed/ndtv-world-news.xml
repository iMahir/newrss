       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Nobel Laureate economist Muhammad Yunus is expected to return to Bangladesh on Thursday, Bangladesh-based Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>Yunus will arrive at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on an Emirates flight from Dubai at 2.10 pm, subject to the flight being on time, Dhaka Tribune reported, quoting a statement from Yunus Centre.</p>

<p>Yunus' return comes as he is set to take on a significant role as head of the interim government, following a meeting with President Mohammed Shahabuddin.</p>

<p>Nahid Islam, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, said that the oath-taking ceremony for Yunus, proposed as head of the interim government during a meeting with President Mohammed Shahabuddin, will take place the following day, Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>In a statement issued on Wednesday, Yunus Centre congratulated the students who played a key role in achieving the Second Victory Day and urged the public to avoid violence.</p>

<p>"I congratulate the brave students who took the lead in making our Second Victory Day possible and to the people for giving your total support to them. Let us make the best use of our new victory. Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes. I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence. I appeal to all students, members of all political parties and non-political people to stay calm," the statement read.</p>

<p>The statement highlighted the country's potential and urged the population to focus on building a better future. "This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities. We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations," Yunus Centre added in its statement.</p>

<p>Yunus Centre further said that violence is their enemy.</p>

<p>"Our youth is ready to give this leadership in creating a new world. Let us not miss the chance by going into any senseless violence. Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country. If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed. Please stay calm. Help those around you to stay calm," it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tunisian President Kais Saied sacked his Prime Minister Ahmed Hachani without explanation on Wednesday and replaced him with social affairs minister Kamel Madouri, his office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hachani had taken office on August 1 last year, replacing Najla Bouden, who was also dismissed without an official reason by Saied.</p>

<p>The president was democratically elected in 2019 but orchestrated a sweeping power grab in 2021 and is now seeking another term in office in elections on October 6.</p>

<p>The constitution was rewritten in 2022 to create a presidential regime whose parliament has extremely limited powers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hachani had earlier on Wednesday published a statement about government meetings to address difficulties affecting public transport.</p>

<p>Madouri had only taken on the social affairs portfolio in May.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Wednesday urged Israel to investigate and implement accountability after a video appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner.</p>

<p>A leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Israel's Channel 12, appeared to show soldiers picking out a prisoner at the Sde Teiman base, where Israel has been holding Palestinians detained during the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The Israeli soldiers seem to be performing sexual acts on the prisoner behind shields, with at least one of the troops with his hand on his own groin.</p>

<p>"We have seen the video and reports of sexual abuse of detainees are horrific," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>Freed Palestinian prisoners have made regular allegations of torture, rape and other abuses in custody that Israeli authorities have denied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week, UN experts warned of the "escalating use of torture" by Israel against Palestinian prisoners since the war in Gaza began and called for efforts to prevent crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>"Prisoners' human rights need to be respected in all cases, and when there are alleged violations, the government of Israel needs to take steps to investigate those who are alleged to have committed abuses and, if appropriate, hold them accountable," Miller said.</p>

<p>An Israeli military spokesperson contacted by AFP said the army was looking into the reports.</p>

<p>Miller said that the Israeli military investigation "ought to proceed swiftly."</p>

<p>The military late last month said it was opening an investigation into "suspected abuse" of a detainee at Sde Teiman after accounts by international media, United Nations agencies and human rights groups.</p>

<p>Nine soldiers were taken in for questioning, prompting far-right Israeli activists, some close to the government, to rush to Sde Teiman to show support for the accused, with several managing to break into the facility.</p>

<p>The United States has been a critical ally of Israel in the war but has repeatedly voiced alarm over the toll on civilians.</p>

<p>Hamas launched the deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7, leading to the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 who the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory response has killed 39,677 people in Gaza, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>The campaign has also reduced much of the Palestinian territory to rubble, including residential areas, schools and other critical infrastructure.&nbsp;<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Top Muslim diplomats on Wednesday said Israel was "fully responsible" for the "heinous" killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and warned it could destabilise the region.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top Muslim diplomats on Wednesday said Israel was "fully responsible" for the "heinous" killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and warned it could destabilise the region.</p>

<p>The declaration came at the end of an extraordinary meeting of the Saudi-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) called in part by Iran, which has vowed to retaliate for the attack on Haniyeh, setting the Middle East on edge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on the death of Haniyeh, who lived in Qatar and was a major player in talks to end the war in the Gaza Strip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After foreign ministers gathered at the OIC's headquarters in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah, the bloc issued a statement saying it "holds Israel, the illegal occupying power, fully responsible for this heinous attack", which it described as "a serious infringement" of Iran's sovereignty.</p>

<p>The deputy foreign minister for Saudi Arabia, which until Wednesday had not commented on the attack, described it in similar terms, according to a Saudi government statement.</p>

<p>During the opening ceremony, Mamadou Tangara, foreign minister for current OIC chair The Gambia, said Haniyeh's death risked deepening and widening the ongoing bloodshed in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"This heinous act serves only to escalate the existing tensions potentially leading to a wider conflict that could involve the entire region," Tangara said.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's killing "will not quell the Palestinian cause but rather it amplifies it, underscoring the urgency for justice and human rights for the Palestinian people," he said.</p>

<p>"The sovereignty and territorial integrity of nation states are fundamental principles underpinning the international order.</p>

<p>"Respecting these principles has profound implications and their violation equally carries significant consequences."</p>

<p><strong>- Escalation fears -</strong><br />
Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, reiterated Tehran's view that it needs to respond.</p>

<p>"Currently, in the absence of any appropriate action by the (United Nations) Security Council against the aggressions and violations of the Israeli regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to use its inherent right to legitimate defence against the aggressions of this regime," he said.</p>

<p>US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller voiced hope on Wednesday that "all parties that have a relationship with Iran impress upon Iran, the same way we've been impressing upon the government of Israel, that they shouldn't take any steps to escalate the conflict".</p>

<p>Miller said the United States had been in touch with a number of nations attending the OIC meeting and believed there was a "broad consensus" that "escalation would only exacerbate the problems facing the region".</p>

<p>Hamas's Lebanese ally Hezbollah has also pledged to retaliate for Haniyeh's killing and that of its military commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike in Beirut hours earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- 'Condemnation and denunciation' -&nbsp;</strong><br />
Wednesday's meeting was far from the first time the bloc has weighed in on the war, which began with Hamas's October 7 attacks on southern Israel.</p>

<p>That operation resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>In addition to issuing regular statements condemning civilian deaths in Gaza, OIC leaders gathered with their counterparts from the Arab League in November for a summit that condemned Israeli forces' "barbaric" actions in Gaza.</p>

<p>The strong statement masked divisions within the assembled group, as some countries proposed threatening to disrupt oil supplies to Israel and its allies as well as severing any economic and diplomatic ties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Diplomats said at the time that countries that have formal diplomatic ties with Israel, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, came out against the idea.</p>

<p>Saudi political analyst Mohammed bin Saleh al-Harbi told AFP that, for Wednesday's OIC meeting, "we cannot expect more than condemnation and denunciation."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Wednesday said it is ready to work with the interim government of Bangladesh as the country charts a democratic future for its people.</p>

<p>"We continue to monitor developments in Bangladesh, and we obviously have seen the appointment of Muhammad Yunus as the leader of an interim government," State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>

<p>"We think the interim government will play a vital role in establishing long-term peace and political stability in Bangladesh," Miller said responding to questions on the fast-moving development in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>A State Department spokesperson, meanwhile, told PTI, "All decisions regarding the interim government should respect democratic principles, rule of law, and the will of the Bangladeshi people." "We understand Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus has agreed to lead Bangladesh's interim government. We stand ready to work with the interim government, as it charts a democratic future for the people of Bangladesh," the spokesperson said in response to a question.</p>

<p>Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus is set to take oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday, as he made a fervent appeal to everyone to stay calm and "refrain from all kinds of violence" to make the best use of "our new victory".</p>

<p>As authorities scrambled to bring the law and order situation under control, Army chief Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman on Wednesday announced that the interim government will take oath around 8 pm on Thursday. He said the advisory council may have 15 members.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Vienna leg of a tour by American mega-star Taylor Swift has been cancelled after Austria arrested a man in connection with an Islamist attack plot, the organisers said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Authorities had earlier confirmed the arrest of a 19-year-old Islamic State (IS) group sympathiser for allegedly planning an Islamist attack in the Vienna region, warning he had a "focus" on Swift's three upcoming shows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety," Barracuda Music said on Instagram.</p>

<p>The organisers added that all would-be concert-goers would have their tickets refunded. About 65,000 spectators were expected at each show scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>The man, who had pledged his allegiance to IS "in recent weeks", was detained in Lower Austria about an hour from the capital early on Wednesday, Austria's top security chief Franz Ruf told a press conference.</p>

<p>"We have established corresponding preparatory acts and also that there is a focus of the 19-year-old perpetrator on the Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna," Ruf said.</p>

<p>He said that chemical substances had been seized at the suspect's home.</p>

<p>A second person believed to have been in contact with the suspect was arrested in Vienna.</p>

<p>According to initial investigation findings, both suspects radicalised themselves on the internet.</p>

<p>In November 2020, a convicted IS sympathiser went on a shooting rampage in downtown Vienna, killing four and wounding 23 others before police shot him dead.</p>

<p>It marked the Alpine nation's first deadly jihadist attack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA said on Wednesday that astronauts delivered to the International Space Station by Boeing's Starliner could return on SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to return to Earth.</p>

<p>Starliner spacecraft launched in June carrying two astronauts to the ISS in a high-stakes test mission required before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut flights.</p>

<p>But the mission, initially expected to last about eight days, has been drawn out far longer by an array of problems with the craft's propulsion system that Boeing and NASA have been scrambling to fix.</p>

<p>Those problems have called into question Starliner's ability to safely return to Earth its crew, veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. NASA has been examining whether a Crew Dragon capsule will have to bring them home instead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Garment factories in Bangladesh, forecast to account for 90% of the country's exports, reopened on Wednesday hoping to swiftly resume full operations after production was disrupted by violent protests that ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after around 300 people were killed and thousands injured in a crackdown on student-led protests since July.</p>

<p>Garment and textile factories which supply major western brands such as H&amp;M, Zara and Carrefour had been forced to shut under curfews.</p>

<p>"We lost a total of four days, it is too early to make an estimate of the loss. There was little physical damage to factories," Miran Ali, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), told Reuters.</p>

<p>"I am hopeful that in the next few days, we will see complete normalisation," he said. "I'm confident our buyers will stand by our side."</p>

<p>He added that H&amp;M, which buys from about 1,000 factories in Bangladesh, had already said it would not seek discounts due to the delays. The world's second largest fashion retailer told Reuters on Wednesday its suppliers' factories were gradually reopening and it welcomed steps taken for greater stability in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>At a factory belonging to apparel maker Urmi Garments in Dhaka, the mainly female employees were back operating sewing machines.</p>

<p>"We are poor people depending on daily wages and overtime. If we sit back home, how can we run our families?" 38-year old Razia Begum, an employee at the factory, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Factory manager Emdadul Haq said the factory had lost 228,000 pieces of production worth $107,000. In all, Urmi, which counts H&amp;M, Japan's Uniqlo and Britain's Marks and Spencer among its clients, had lost about $2.2 million across three units, he said.</p>

<p>Though factories were reopening, there could be some damage to trade. Hula Global, an Indian apparel producer that serves Western clients, said on Monday it would redirect production for the rest of this year from Bangladesh to India to avert risk.</p>

<p>Pankaj Tuteja, Mumbai-based head of operations at Dragon Sourcing, which helps firms find suppliers, told Reuters that while it expected big brands such as Zara and H&amp;M to stick with Bangladesh, some firms that looked elsewhere could stay away.</p>

<p>"Once the client, then the factories, have invested so much time and money they will not just immediately run back, even when there's political stability. That can have a long-term impact for Bangladesh," Tuteja said.</p>

<p>But Bangladesh would remain attractive because of costs that are 15-25% lower than elsewhere, and 0% tariffs, Tuteja added.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund expects the ready-made garments industry will account for 90% of Bangladesh's $55 billion annual exports in the financial year 2024.</p>

<p>Bangladesh was the third-largest exporter of clothing in the world last year, according to the World Trade Organization.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel vowed to "eliminate" new Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, the alleged mastermind of the October 7 attack, whose appointment further inflamed regional tensions as the Gaza war entered its 11th month on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The naming of Sinwar to lead the Palestinian group came as Israel braced for potential Iranian retaliation over the killing of his predecessor Ismael Haniyeh last week in Tehran.</p>

<p>Speaking at a military base on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was "determined" to defend itself.</p>

<p>"We are prepared both defensively and offensively," he told new recruits.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said late Tuesday that Sinwar's promotion was "yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organisation off the face of the earth".</p>

<p>Sinwar -- Hamas's leader in Gaza since 2017 -- has not been seen since the October 7 attack, which was the deadliest in Israel's history.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP that the selection of Sinwar sent a message that the organisation "continues its path of resistance".</p>

<p>Hamas's Lebanese ally Hezbollah congratulated Sinwar and said the appointment affirms "the enemy... has failed to achieve its objectives" by killing Hamas leaders and officials.</p>

<p>Analysts believe Sinwar has been both more reluctant to agree to a Gaza ceasefire and closer to Tehran than Haniyeh, who lived in Qatar.</p>

<p>"If a ceasefire deal seemed unlikely upon Haniyeh's death, it is even less likely under Sinwar," according to Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group.</p>

<p>"The group will only lean further into its hardline militant strategy of recent years," she added.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that it was up to Sinwar to help achieve a ceasefire, saying he "has been and remains the primary decider".</p>

<p>Civilians in both Israel and Gaza met Sinwar's appointment with unease.</p>

<p>Mohammad al-Sharif, a displaced Gazan, told AFP: "He is a fighter. How will negotiations take place?"</p>

<p>In Tel Aviv, logistics company manger Hanan, who did not want to give his second name, said Sinwar's appointment meant Hamas "did not see fit to look for someone less militant, someone with a less murderous approach".</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah vows response</strong></p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah has also pledged to avenge the deaths of Haniyeh and its own military commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike in Beirut hours earlier.</p>

<p>In a televised address to mark one week since Shukr's death, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Tuesday his group would retaliate "alone or in the context of a unified response from all the axis" of Iran-backed groups in the region.</p>

<p>The United States, which has sent extra warships and jets to the region, urged both Iran and Israel to avoid an escalation.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden had calls with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"No one should escalate this conflict. We've been engaged in intense diplomacy with allies and partners, communicating that message directly to Iran. We communicated that message directly to Israel," Blinken told reporters.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in a telephone call that the West "should immediately stop selling arms and supporting" Israel if it wants to prevent war, his office said.</p>

<p>The Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation met on Wednesday to discuss the situation in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Gambian Foreign Minister Mamadou Tangara, whose country currently chairs the bloc, said the "heinous" killing of Haniyeh risked "leading to a wider conflict that could involve the entire region".</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's killing but confirmed it had carried out the strike on Shukr.</p>

<p>It held the Hezbollah commander responsible for a rocket attack in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights that killed 12 children.</p>

<p><strong>Flights cancelled</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli troops throughout the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The group said Tuesday that six of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on south Lebanon and that it had launched "dozens of Katyusha rockets" at a military base in the Golan Heights in retaliation.</p>

<p>Numerous airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon or limited them to daylight hours.</p>

<p>The Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by the Palestinian group's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, has already drawn in Iran-backed militants in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian Hamas operatives seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,677 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>The toll included two dozen deaths in the past 24 hours, according to ministry figures.</p>

<p>Israel said that its air force had "struck dozens of terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip" over the past day.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential candidate Kamala Harris's choice of Tim Walz as her running mate has raised eyebrows, and plenty of questions, in China, which he first visited in 1989, the year the military crushed pro-democracy protests.</p>

<p>Demonstrators spent weeks on Beijing's Tiananmen Square demanding democracy before the military conducted a deadly crackdown on June 4, 1989.</p>

<p>Mr Walz was married on the fifth anniversary of that politically sensitive date.</p>

<p>Discussion of the events at Tiananmen is strictly censored in China but many social media users made veiled references Wednesday to the timing of Mr Walz's stint in the country.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old Minnesota governor and former schoolteacher has visited China dozens of times, including on summer trips with student groups for sightseeing and cultural exchange.</p>

<p>He first travelled there in 1989, moving to Foshan, a city in China's southern Guangdong province, for a year of teaching English at a local high school, according to media reports at the time.</p>

<p>Mr Walz married his wife Gwen on June 4, 1994, an article in a local US newspaper said.</p>

<p>"He wanted to have a date he'll always remember," his wife was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, social media users in China questioned the timing of Mr Walz's 1989 arrival in the country and suggested ulterior motives.</p>

<p>"He came to China at a time of turmoil, clearly with a special mission," one user commented on the platform Weibo.</p>

<p>"Is he from the CIA?" another wrote.</p>

<p>"Look at the year and you can't help but be sceptical," chimed in a third.</p>

<p><strong>'Definite influence'</strong></p>

<p>Mr Walz has pushed back against the assertion that the United States and China are necessary adversaries, a view widespread in Washington in recent years as trade and geopolitical disagreements with Beijing mount.</p>

<p>"I lived in China and as I said I've been there about 30 times," he told farming news website Agri-Pulse in a 2016 interview.</p>

<p>"But if someone tells you they're an expert on China they're probably not telling you the truth because it's a complex country," he said.</p>

<p>But despite his positive comments on Chinese people and culture, Mr Walz has also been critical of its government, telling local US media in 1990 that with "proper leadership" the country could achieve great success.</p>

<p>In 2016, while representing Minnesota in the US House of Representatives, he met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader denounced by Beijing as a dangerous separatist.</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry told AFP Wednesday that it would not comment on Ms Harris's choice of Mr Walz as a running mate, calling the election an internal affair of the United States.</p>

<p>"We hope the US side can work with the Chinese side to move in the same direction," the statement said.</p>

<p>Social media users wondered what Mr Walz's personal connection to their country might mean if elected.</p>

<p>"If Harris is elected President, Vice President Walz will have a definite influence on her China policy," one user wrote.</p>

<p>And under one post featuring Mr Walz's comments from a 2016 interview in which he pointed out that the United States and China had potential for cooperation, other users waxed sceptical.</p>

<p>"2016 was a previous era," one wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Don't negligently assign a persona to your opponent."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladeshi court on Wednesday overturned a conviction against Mohammed Yunus, a day before the Nobel winner is set to return to lead a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"Professor Muhammad Yunus and three of his colleagues have been acquitted of labour charges," one of his lawyers, Khaja Tanvir Ahmed, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The court earlier this year sentenced them to six months in prison."</p>

<p>He was sentenced in January for the labour charge, but immediately bailed pending appeal and later travelled abroad.</p>

<p>All four had denied the charges and, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by ousted leader Sheikh Hasina's government, the case was criticised as politically motivated by watchdogs including Amnesty International.</p>

<p>"The labour court granted an appeal, and acquitted them," Ahmed said.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old Muhammad Yunus, known as the "banker to the poorest of the poor", was awarded the Peace Prize in 2006 for his work loaning small cash sums to rural women, allowing them to invest in farm tools or business equipment and boost their earnings.</p>

<p>But his public profile in Bangladesh earned him the hostility of Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases, but the labour trial was the only conviction.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina was ousted on Monday after weeks of mass protests and fled to India.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces on Wednesday issued new evacuation orders to Palestinians in areas of north Gaza that were among the first to be hit at the start of the war with Hamas in October, after Hamas operatives fired a fresh volley of rockets into Israel.</p>

<p>Army spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted the evacuation orders for several districts in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, two now largely destroyed towns into which Israeli tanks swept at the outset of Israel's ground invasion.</p>

<p>"Hamas and terrorist organisations are firing rockets from your area towards the State of Israel. The IDF will act forcefully and immediately against them," Adraee said in the message sent by text and social media to Palestinian residents.</p>

<p>"For your own safety, evacuate immediately to the known shelters in the center of Gaza City," the army spokesman said.</p>

<p>In a nearby Gaza City neighbourhood, Al-Tuffah, an Israeli airstrike on a house killed three Palestinians, medics said.</p>

<p>Later on Wednesday, 10 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli strikes in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Medics said one strike killed three people on a motorcycle west of Khan Younis, while seven others were killed in tank shelling that hit a tent encampment in Abassan town, east of the city.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Fronts</strong></p>

<p>Fighting has continued in the Gaza Strip even as Israel braces for an expected assault in its north from Iran and its close Lebanese ally Hezbollah after the July 31 assassination in the Iranian capital Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says it has killed dozens of Hamas operatives in recent days and on Wednesday said troops had hit weapons-making facilities in the teeming district of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting have taken shelter.</p>

<p>In other central areas, Israeli tanks shelled Nuseirat and Bureij, two of Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps. Israel says Hamas operatives use civilian infrastructure for cover and to conceal operations posts and arms caches; Hamas denies this.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives say they continue to carry out ambush attacks on Israeli troops and armoured vehicles with explosive devices, and are still able to launch limited rocket salvoes into Israel.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Islamic Jihad, a close Hamas ally, said it fired rockets into Israel in response to what it called Israeli "massacres of civilians".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that over the past week Hamas had fired rockets from launchers embedded near two international humanitarian aid and distribution warehouses, including the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israeli forces struck those sites, it added.</p>

<p>Hamas-led operatives set off the Gaza war on Oct. 7 with a cross-border rampage into Israeli communities, killing 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has pursued a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins, killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded over 91,500, according to Gaza health ministry figures.</p>

<p>The Hamas-led ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death lists.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 27-year-old son of Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit was arrested at the weekend on suspicion of assaulting a woman, police said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mette-Marit's son Marius Borg Hoiby was born in 1997 from a relationship prior to her 2001 marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, the heir apparent to the Norwegian throne.</p>

<p>Police said they were called to an Oslo address early Sunday after an overnight altercation in an apartment.</p>

<p>A man in his 20s was arrested over the incident and released from custody the following day, police said in a statement.</p>

<p>"As it has been made known in several media that this (person) is Marius Borg Hoiby, the police confirm that it is Hoiby who is a suspect in the case."</p>

<p>Police said he was suspected of causing "bodily harm and damage". They did not identify the woman, saying only there was "relationship between the accused and the victim".</p>

<p>Police said they had "no information that the victim suffered serious injuries".</p>

<p>Crown Prince Haakon, currently in Paris for the Olympics, on Wednesday told Norwegian media in the French capital it was a "serious" matter.</p>

<p>"It's a serious matter when police are involved like this," TV2 quoted him as saying on its website.</p>

<p>"At the same time, it would not be right for me to comment on it at this time."</p>

<p>While Hoiby was raised by Mette-Marit and Haakon together with his step-siblings, 20-year-old Princess Ingrid Alexandra and 18-year-old Prince Sverre Magnus, unlike them he has no official public role.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheikh Hasina ousted, all eyes in Bangladesh are on the main opposition party - the Bangladesh National party or BNP, whose top leader -- former Prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia – has been released from house arrest.</p>

<p>Her son Tareue Rehman is returning to Bangladesh. Another top BNP leader who is expected to return is Salahuddin Ahmed, who has been living in India since 2015.</p>

<p>Ahmed has served a one-year jail term for illegally entering India, but even after being released has chosen to stay on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The leader, who has been camping out in Shillong, has claimed that Khaleda Zia will need advanced medical treatment.</p>

<p>"BNP wants all charges against her to be dropped. She would need advanced treatment and has to go abroad for it," Salahuddin Ahmed said.Bangladesh President Khaleda Zia has already received her her renewed passport.</p>

<p>"People of Bangladesh strongly believe that Sheikh Hasina left after being forced. Others were not lucky enough to survive. Luckily I am still alive. I have been ready to return since the first day," Salahuddin said.</p>

<p>Salahuddin, who landed in Shillong in 2015, faced trial for illegal entry. He was&nbsp; acquitted in 2018 and has since been free to go.</p>

<p>The process, however, was delayed following an appeal by the authorities against his release. On February 28, a court in Shillong upheld the 2018 order of acquittal.</p>

<p>The BNP leader has claimed that Begum Khaleda Zia needs advanced medical treatment abroad thus BNP would demand all charges against her be dropped. The BNP will also call for a neutral general election.</p>

<p>"What happened to Hasina was her fate as she resorted to misrule for three consecutive terms with flawed elections and there was absence of rule of law. It was complete tyranny. The situation prevailing in Bangladesh is something like the mass revolution led by students," Salahuddin said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seen from the sky, with its turquoise waters stretching out into the desert expanses in the shape of a crescent, you can see why they call Lake Balkhash the "pearl of Kazakhstan".</p>

<p>But pollution, climate change and its overuse are threatening the existence of one of the most unique stretches of water in the world.</p>

<p>One side of the Balkhash -- the biggest lake in Central Asia after the Caspian Sea -- has salt water, but on the other it is fresh. In such a strange environment, rare species have abounded. Until now.</p>

<p>"All the miseries of the Balkhash are right under my eyes," fisherman Alexei Grebennikov told AFP from the deck of his boat on the northern shores, which sometimes has salty water, sometimes fresh.</p>

<p>"There are fewer and fewer fish, it's catastrophic, the lake is silting up," warned the 50-year-old.</p>

<p>A dredger to clear the little harbour lay anchored, rusting and unused, off the industrial town of Balkhack, itself seemingly stuck in a Soviet timewarp.</p>

<p>"We used to take tourists underwater fishing. Now the place has become a swamp," said Grebennikov.</p>

<p>In town, scientist Olga Sharipova was studying the changes.</p>

<p>"The Balkhash is the country's largest fishery. But the quantity of fish goes down when the water level drops, because the conditions for reproduction are disrupted," she told AFP.</p>

<p>And its level is now only a metre from the critical threshold where it could tilt towards disaster.</p>

<p>There was an unexpected respite this spring when unprecedented floods allowed the Kazakh authorities to divert 3.3 million cubic metres of water to the Balkhash.</p>

<p>The Caspian also got a six-billion-cubic-metre fill-up.</p>

<p><strong>China 'overusing' water</strong></p>

<p>But the few extra centimetres has not changed the longterm trend.</p>

<p>"The level of the Balkhash has been falling everywhere since 2019, mainly due to a decrease in the flow of the Ili River" from neighbouring China, said Sharipova.</p>

<p>All the great lakes of Central Asia, also known as enclosed seas, share a similar worrying fate.</p>

<p>The Aral Sea has almost disappeared, the situation is alarming for the Caspian Sea and Lake Issyk-Kul in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan.</p>

<p>Located on dry lands isolated from the ocean, they are particularly vulnerable to disturbances "exacerbated by global warming and human activities", according to leading scientific journal Nature.</p>

<p>Rising temperatures accelerate evaporation, as water resources dwindle due to the melting of surrounding glaciers.</p>

<p>These issues are compounded by the economic importance of the Balkhash, which is on the path of China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project also known as the New Silk Road.</p>

<p>A 2021 study by Oxford University scientists published in the journal "Water" concluded the lake's decline resulted from China's overuse of the Ili River which feeds it for its agriculture, including cotton.</p>

<p>"If the hydro-climatic regime of the Ili for 2020-2060 remains unchanged compared to the past 50 years and agriculture continues to expand in China, future water supplies will become increasingly strained," the study said.</p>

<p>Beijing is a key economic partner for Kazakhstan but it is less keen to collaborate on water issues.</p>

<p>"The drafting and signing of an agreement with China on the sharing of water in transborder rivers is a key issue," the Kazakh Ministry of Water Resources told AFP.</p>

<p>"The main objective is to supply the volumes of water needed to preserve the Balkhash," it said.</p>

<p><strong>Heavy pollution</strong></p>

<p>The water being syphoned away adds to "pollution from heavy metals, pesticides and other harmful substances", authorities said, without citing culprits.</p>

<p>The town of Balkhash was founded around Kazakhstan's largest copper producer, Kazakhmys.</p>

<p>Holidaymakers bathing on Balkhash's municipal beach have a view of the smoking chimneys of its metal plant.</p>

<p>Lung cancer rates here are almost 10 times the regional average, which is already among the highest in the country, health authorities said.</p>

<p>Despite being sanctioned for breaking environmental standards, Kazakhmys denies it is the main polluter of the lake and has vowed to to reduce pollution by renewing its equipment.</p>

<p>"Kazakhmys is carrying out protective work to prevent environmental disasters in the Balkhash," Sherkhan Rustemov, the company's ecological engineer, told AFP.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the plant continues to discharge industrial waste into another huge body of water, right next to the lake.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>War-weary Gazans voiced concern on Wednesday after Hamas appointed <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/who-is-yahya-sinwar-new-leader-of-hamas-21965">Yahya Sinwar</a> as its new supremo, fearing his past as the movement's military commander might hamper efforts for the ceasefire they yearn for.</p>

<p>"We don't know how Hamas is thinking or what led them to choose Yahya Sinwar as their chief, especially when his whereabouts are unknown", 29-year-old Mohammad al-Sharif told AFP in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>"He is a fighter. How will negotiations take place?", asked the displaced man originally from Gaza City, adding: "We want nothing but the end of the war".</p>

<p>Late on Tuesday, Hamas announced it had chosen Sinwar, 61, the man Israel says masterminded the October 7 attack that sparked the Gaza war, to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran on July 31.</p>

<p>Sinwar has not been seen since the attack on Israel, with many reports claiming he is operating from one of several underground tunnels in Gaza.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Abu Daqa, 35, echoed Sharif's disappointment over the choice of Sinwar to succeed Haniyeh, who was regarded by some as a pragmatist.</p>

<p>"In my opinion, appointing Yahya Sinwar as the head of Hamas was inappropriate at this critical stage", he told AFP.</p>

<p>Also displaced in Deir el-Balah, and originally from the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Abu Daqa said that the decision "may lead to negative results on multiple levels, including halting negotiations or failing to make progress in them, especially since Israel is seeking him for assassination".</p>

<p>"The occupation killed the negotiator Ismail Haniyeh. What will happen with the fighter Yahya Sinwar?" he asked.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP that the selection of Sinwar sent a message that the operative group "continues its path of resistance".</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has already called for Sinwar's killing.</p>

<p>Bashir Qarqaz voiced fears that Israel's determination to kill Sinwar would make his appointment an obstacle to peace.</p>

<p>"The war will not end in the near future because Israel rejects Sinwar," he said, adding that "they want a political figure to concede to them, and Sinwar is a stubborn man who may not concede".</p>

<p>Hani al-Qano was more hopeful. He underlined that unlike Haniyeh, who lived in self-exile in Qatar, Sinwar had lived in Gaza throughout the conflict and was more familiar with the daily reality of the war.</p>

<p>"He may have a positive impact on the negotiations and may be a challenge to Israel, given that Sinwar is living inside the Gaza Strip among the people under siege", he said.</p>

<p>"He is different from Haniyeh, who lived abroad."</p>

<h3 id="-enthusiasm-in-west-bank-"><strong>Enthusiasm in West Bank</strong></h3>

<p>Various Palestinian political factions in the occupied West Bank congratulated Hamas on its choice of Sinwar.</p>

<p>These included the leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which "wished Sinwar success" in a statement published by Hamas.</p>

<p>Palestinian residents of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Hamas has been more popular than the ruling Fatah movement since the October 7 attack, showed more enthusiasm for the new Hamas supremo.</p>

<p>"Choosing Sinwar to lead the Hamas movement was an excellent decision because Sinwar lives in the heart of the battle, and therefore he knows exactly what he is negotiating," said Farah Qassem, a coffee shop owner in Ramallah, the seat of the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p>"His decisions will come from the suffering experienced by the people in Gaza", the 54-year-old added.</p>

<p>Emad Abu Fokheidah, a school administrator in a nearby village, echoed the sentiment.</p>

<p>"Choosing Sinwar was a wise decision and a message to the (Israeli) occupation that the political solution, which Israel rejected by assassinating Haniyeh, will only come from the barrel of a gun", Abu Fokheidah, 57, said.</p>

<p>"All wars end with negotiations, and today the negotiator will be the one leading the battle."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[On Friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Ohio father read from the Bible, told his children he loved them, and made a cryptic call to his own father-saying his eldest boy would be "the hardest one"-before brutally murdering his three young sons at their family home, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/chad-doerman-ohio-dad-murder-bible-b2591995.html"><em>Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chad Doerman, 33, shot and killed his sons Clayton, 7, Hunter, 4, and Chase, 3, in Monroe Township, about 75 miles west of Columbus, on June 15, 2023. On Friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.</p>

<p>Disturbing new details have emerged about Doerman's actions leading up to the murders and the final hours of the three young boys' lives.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-man-lined-up-and-shot-3-sons-police-say-attack-planned-over-several-months-4129120">Also Read|&nbsp;US Man Lined Up And Shot 3 Sons, Police Say Attack Planned Over Several Months</a></p>

<p>In a press briefing on Monday, Clermont County Prosecuting Attorney Mark Tekulve revealed that on the day of the shooting spree, Doerman had lunch with his wife Laura and told her, "This will be my last good meal."</p>

<p>Despite this ominous statement, Laura did not feel the need to "do something to protect the family," and Doerman spent the afternoon doing yard work and playing with the children.</p>

<p>Around 3:30 to 3:45 p.m., Doerman began reading the Bible to Hunter, Tekulve said. "He was walking around the house with the Bible, mumbling 'Chad knows what's right. Chad knows what's right,'" he said.</p>

<p>Just before 4 p.m., Doerman asked his family to join him for a nap in the master bedroom. His wife and three sons entered the room with him while his 12-year-old stepdaughter watched television in another room.</p>

<p>When Doerman opened the gun safe, his wife grew alarmed and told him, "You're scaring me."</p>

<p>What followed were events so harrowing that they brought experienced officers to tears, Tekulve told reporters in a separate press briefing on Friday.</p>

<p>Doerman told his family he loved them and called his sons the "best boys ever." Then he jumped up from the bed, grabbed a .22 rifle from the safe, and his family initially worried for his safety rather than their own, fearing he would kill himself.</p>

<p>"Laura is screaming, the boys are screaming, Laura is frightened that he's about to kill himself," said Tekulve. "They're all trying to discourage him, telling him that they love him and begging him not to kill himself."</p>

<p>According to a press release from the Clermont County Sheriff's Office, the mother of the boys was also shot in the hand. She was sent to University Hospital in Cincinnati for non-life-threatening injuries after being discovered outside the house. The prosecutors added that she was trying to take the gun away from Mr Doerman and was shot during the same. She was sent to a hospital to be treated for her injuries. However, the age and the extent of the daughter's injuries are still unknown.</p>

<p>After the incident, the father was found sitting on a porch outside his residence and admitted to lining the boys up in the yard and firing at them during a subsequent interview with the authorities. He said that he had been planning the killings for several months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The interim government in Bangladesh led by Nobel-laureate Muhammad Yunus will take oath today, the nation's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said today. General Waker told reporters the interim government is likely to take oath at 8 pm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The army chief said the advisory council to be led by Mr Yunus may have 15 members. Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Tuesday appointed Mr Yunus, 84, to head the interim government after the violent ouster of former pro-India Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</li>
	<li>Mr Yunus will lead Bangladesh through a "democratic process" when he arrives in the country to helm the interim government, General Waker said.</li>
	<li>"He is very eager to do this," the General said in a televised address to the nation. "I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process and that we will benefit from this," he said.</li>
	<li>Mr Yunus also said today he was looking forward to helping the country overcome its current turbulence. "I'm looking forward to going back home, see what's happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in," he told reporters before boarding a flight at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport bound for Dubai, where he will take a connecting plane for Dhaka.</li>
	<li>The Nobel-winning microfinance pioneer has asked for calm after weeks of violence in which at least 455 people were killed. "If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed," he added.</li>
	<li>The appointment came quickly after student leaders called on Mr Yunus -- credited with lifting millions out of poverty in Bangladesh -- to lead. The decision was made in a meeting with President Mohammed Shahabuddin, the heads of the army, navy and air force, and student leaders.</li>
	<li>Mr Yunus will have the title of chief adviser, according to Nahid Islam, one of the leaders of Students Against Discrimination who participated in the meeting.</li>
	<li>A Bangladesh court today acquitted Mr Yunus of a labour conviction on appeal, his lawyer Khaja Tanvir Ahmed told news agency AFP. Mr Yunus had travelled abroad earlier this year after he was sentenced to six months in jail for the labour charge -- but was immediately bailed pending appeal. The case was criticised as politically motivated by rights watchdogs including Amnesty International.</li>
	<li>Ms Hasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, resigned on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka demanding she stand down. Monday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.</li>
	<li>Ms Hasina, who was accused of rigging January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests. Hundreds of people were killed in the crackdown, but the military turned against Ms Hasina on the weekend and she was forced to flee in a helicopter to neighbouring India.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With much of Gaza reduced to rubble by 10 months of war, counting the dead has become a challenge for the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, as the death count nears 40,000.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly questioned the credibility of the daily figures put out by the ministry and US President Joe Biden did so too in the early stages of the war.</p>

<p>But several United Nations agencies that operate in Gaza have said the figures are credible and they are frequently cited by international organisations.</p>

<p><strong>Data collection</strong></p>

<p>Two AFP correspondents witnessed health facilities enter deaths in the ministry's database.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials first identify the bodies of the dead, by the visual recognition of a relative or friend, or by the recovery of personal items.</p>

<p>The dead person's information is then entered in the health ministry's digital database, usually including name, gender, birth date and ID number.</p>

<p>When bodies cannot be identified because they are unrecognisable or when no one claims them, staff record the death under a number, alongside all the information they were able to gather.</p>

<p>Any distinguishing marks that may help with later identification, whether personal items or a birthmark, are collected and photographed.</p>

<p><strong>Central registry</strong></p>

<p>Gaza's health ministry has issued several statements setting out its procedures for compiling the death count.</p>

<p>In public hospitals under the direct supervision of the territory's Hamas government, the "personal information and identity number" of every Palestinian killed during the war are entered in the hospital's database as soon as they are pronounced dead.</p>

<p>The data is then sent to the health ministry's central registry on a daily basis.</p>

<p>For those who die in private hospitals and clinics, their information is taken down on a form that must be sent to the ministry within 24 hours to be added to the central registry, a ministry statement said.</p>

<p>The ministry's "information centre" then verifies the data entries to "ensure they do not contain any duplicates or mistakes", before saving them in the database, the statement added.</p>

<p>Gaza residents are also encouraged by Palestinian authorities to report any deaths in their families on a designated government website. The data is used for the ministry's verifications.</p>

<p>The ministry is staffed with civil servants that answer to the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority as well as to the Hamas-led government in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>'High correlation'</strong></p>

<p>An investigation conducted by Airwars, an NGO focused on the impact of war on civilians, analysed the data entries for 3,000 of the dead and found "a high correlation" between the ministry's data and what Palestinian civilians reported online, with 75 percent of publicly reported names also appearing on the ministry's list.</p>

<p>The study found that the ministry's figures had become "less accurate" as the war dragged on, a development it attributed to the heavy damage to health infrastructure resulting from the war.</p>

<p>For instance, at southern Gaza's Nasser Hospital, one of the few still at least partly functioning, only 50 out of 400 computers still work, its director Atef al-Hout told AFP.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities frequently criticise the ministry's figures for failing to distinguish between combatants and civilians. But neither the army nor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deny the scale of the overall count.</p>

<p>The press office of Gaza's Hamas government estimates that nearly 70 percent of the roughly 40,000 dead are women (about 11,000) or children (at least 16,300).</p>

<p>Several UN agencies, including the agency in charge of Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), have said the ministry's figures are credible.</p>

<p>"In the past -- the five, six cycles of conflict in the Gaza Strip -- these figures were considered as credible and no one ever really challenged these figures," the agency's chief Philippe Lazzarini said in October.</p>

<p>A study by British medical review The Lancet estimated that 186,000 deaths can be attributed to the war in Gaza, directly or indirectly as a result of the humanitarian crisis it has triggered.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 7 attack by Hamas, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

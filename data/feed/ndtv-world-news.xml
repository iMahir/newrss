       <description><![CDATA["I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza," Emmanuel Macron told French broadcaster France Inter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called Saturday for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza, provoking a sharp response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Macron also criticised Netanyahu's decision to send troops into ground operations in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza," Macron told French broadcaster France Inter.</p>

<p>"France is not delivering any," he added during the interview, which was recorded Tuesday.</p>

<p>Macron reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza that is continuing despite repeated calls for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>"I think we are not being heard," he said. "I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel," he said, adding that the war was leading to "hatred".</p>

<p>His comments brought a swift response from Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side," Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>"Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them."</p>

<p>Israel was fighting a war on several fronts against groups backed by arch-foe Iran, the statement added.</p>

<p>Macron' office responded with a statement of its own later Saturday.</p>

<p>France is a "steadfast friend of Israel", it said, describing Netanyahu's reaction as "excessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel".</p>

<p>Qatar, a key mediator in Gaza ceasefire talks, said Macron's statement was "an important and appreciated step towards stopping the war".</p>

<p>Jordan welcomed the French leader's remarks and stressed "the importance of imposing a complete ban on the export of weapons to Israel" and "real consequences" for the country's actions.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasefire call</strong></p>

<p>In his interview, Macron also said avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a "priority."</p>

<p>"Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza," he added.</p>

<p>And he returned to the subject Saturday in a speech to a conference of French-speaking nations in Paris.</p>

<p>While both Paris and Washington had called for a ceasefire, said Macron, "I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil."</p>

<p>The 88 members of the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), including France and Canada, have called for an "immediate and lasting" ceasefire in Lebanon, he added.</p>

<p>But Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence and said that on Monday he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel marks the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the Gaza war and has now engulfed neighbouring Lebanon, creating a perilous regional crisis.</p>

<p>The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity. Israel's retaliatory offensive on Gaza has so far killed at least 41,825 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. The UN has said those figures are reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN secretary-general denounced Hamas and called for an immediate end to the "shocking violence and bloodshed" in Gaza and Lebanon in a statement Saturday ahead of the anniversary of the Palestinian group's October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Monday marks one year since the devastating assault on Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza, with Lebanon now also pulled into the fray and world leaders warning of a potential all-out regional crisis.</p>

<p>"This is a day for the global community to repeat in the loudest voice our utter condemnation of the abhorrent acts of Hamas, including the taking of hostages," UN chief Antonio Guterres said in an anniversary message released Saturday evening.</p>

<p>While demanding the hostages' "immediate and unconditional release," Guterres also implored Hamas to allow the hostages to be visited by Red Cross personnel.</p>

<p>Hamas militants abducted 251 people on October 7, 97 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>Guterres additionally voiced concern over the conflict spreading to Lebanon, where Israel in recent days has pounded the Hamas-allied group Hezbollah, killing over a thousand people and forcing more than a million to flee their homes.</p>

<p>"The war that has followed the terrible attacks of one year ago continues to shatter lives and inflict profound human suffering for Palestinians in Gaza, and now the people of Lebanon," Guterres said.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive on Gaza has so far killed at least 41,825 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. The UN has said those figures are reliable.</p>

<p>"Since October 7th, a wave of shocking violence and bloodshed has erupted," said Guterres.</p>

<p>"It is time for the release of the hostages," he said. "Time to silence the guns. Time to stop the suffering that has engulfed the region. Time for peace, international law and justice."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday returned to the venue of a campaign rally where he was nearly assassinated in July, calling his would-be assassin a "vicious monster". He also invited billionaire <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musks-x-pays-5-2-million-brazil-fines-but-to-wrong-account-6719495" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> on stage in Pennsylvania's Butler, saying that he is an "incredible guy".</p>

<p>"As I was saying," Trump said as he started speaking behind bulletproof glass, pretending he was resuming the speech that was interrupted when he was grazed in the ear by a bullet on July 13.</p>

<p>"Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me," he told thousands of his supporters.</p>

He was subsequently shot and killed by a Secret Service agent.</p>

<p>As blood dripped down his face, Trump raised a fist and shouted "fight, fight, fight" to his supporters, an image that had gone viral on social media.</p>

<p>During the Saturday rally, Musk praised Trump and took a dig at US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who is fist pumping after getting shot," he said.</p>

<p>It was the first time Musk, the owner of social media platform X, attended a Trump poll rally since he endorsed him on July 13.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of protesters marched in cities around the world on Saturday calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon as the war in the Palestinian territory neared the one-year mark.</p>

<p>Kicking off a planned wave of demonstrations worldwide, pro-Palestinian supporters gathered in cities in Europe, Africa and the Americas to demand an end to the conflict, which has killed nearly 42,000 people in Gaza.</p>

<p>Dozens of protests and commemorations are set to take place ahead of the anniversary Monday of Hamas's attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,825 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the territory's health ministry and described as reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>With Israel now mounting a ground operation in Lebanon and vowing to respond to a barrage of missiles fired by Iran this week, there are fears the conflict could spiral into a wider war.</p>

<p>Underlining international polarisation over events in the Middle East, demonstrations in support of both Israel and the Palestinians are planned worldwide -- sometimes with rival events scheduled in the same city.</p>

<p><strong>'Worse and worse'</strong></p>

<p>A pro-Palestinian protest in Rome that drew thousands of people turned violent, as dozens of young demonstrators threw bottles and firecrackers at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannon.</p>

<p>At least one policeman was wounded and two protestors detained, AFP journalists said.</p>

<p>"Israel is a criminal state!" the demonstrators shouted.</p>

<p>In Berlin, police said they had detained 26 people who shouted insults at a pro-Israeli commemoration attended by around 650 people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a pro-Palestinian demonstration drew just over 1,000 protestors in the German capital, police said.</p>

<p>At the "National March for Palestine" in London, chants of "stop bombing civilians" were joined by shouts of "hands off Lebanon".</p>

<p>Zackerea Bakir, 28, said he has attended dozens of marches around the United Kingdom. Large numbers continue to turn up because "everyone wants a change", he told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's continuing to just get worse and worse, and yet nothing seems to be changing," said Bakir, joined at the rally by his mother and brother.</p>

<p>While the rally in London was largely peaceful, at least 15 people were arrested, including three on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and one on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organisation.</p>

<p>In Dublin, several hundred people took to the streets, waving Palestinian flags and chanting: "Ceasefire now!".</p>

<p>In France, thousands of people marched in Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Strasbourg to express solidarity with Palestinians, AFP journalists said.</p>

<p>Around 5,000 people joined a pro-Palestinian protest in Madrid, brandishing signs with messages such as "Boycott Israel".</p>

<p>A pro-Palestinian demonstration in the Swiss city of Basel drew several thousand people, the Keystone-ATS news agency reported.</p>

<p>Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators also marched on the Israeli embassy in Athens, which was heavily guarded by riot police.</p>

<p><strong>Soaring tension</strong></p>

<p>In Cape Town in South Africa, hundreds walked to parliament, chanting: "Israel is a racist state" and "We are all Palestinian."</p>

<p>Pro-Gaza marches were also planned Saturday in Johannesburg and Durban.</p>

<p>In Caracas, hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators protested outside the United Nations's headquarters for Venezuela, carrying a giant Palestinian flag.</p>

<p>They delivered a petition to the UN calling for an end to the "genocide" of the Palestinians.</p>

<p>"Where are the UN peacekeepers? Why haven't they intervened?" university professor Jesus Reyes, 53, told AFP.</p>

<p>Other pro-Palestinian protests were planned over the weekend and on Monday in cities including New York, Sydney, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Manila, and Karachi.</p>

<p>Commemorations for victims of the October 7 attack are also scheduled internationally, including ceremonies in London, Washington, Paris and Geneva.</p>

<p>Pope Francis has called for a day of "prayer and fasting for peace" on the anniversary of the attack, amid soaring tension in the Middle East.</p>

<p>An official anniversary ceremony will be held in Jerusalem on Monday.</p>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog will lead a memorial service at Sderot, one of the cities hardest hit during the onslaught by Palestinian militants.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A group of highly skilled Chinese hackers linked to the Chinese government successfully infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms in the last few months, CNN reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of highly skilled Chinese hackers linked to the Chinese government successfully infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms in the last few months, CNN <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/politics/chinese-hackers-us-telecoms/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=whatsappCNN&amp;utm_content=2024-10-05T23:51:39" title="n">reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to CNN, US investigators believe the hackers may have gained access to wiretap warrant requests, although the extent of the damage and what exact information was compromised remains under investigation. The hackers targeted major broadband and internet providers, including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen, all critical players in the US telecom industry.</p>

<p>This newly discovered cyber-espionage campaign has prompted grave concerns among US officials about the potential national security risks posed by the hackers' success. The breach represents yet another sophisticated attack attributed to Chinese cyber operatives, coinciding with heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over cyber espionage and broader security issues.</p>

<p>The US telecommunications industry forms the backbone of the country's internet and phone communications, making it a prime target for any state-sponsored hackers. Telecom firms possess vast amounts of caller and user data, and law enforcement agencies often seek access to specific portions of this data as part of national security investigations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both AT&amp;T and Lumen declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, while Verizon did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for a statement. US agencies involved in the investigation, such as the Department of Justice and the FBI, have also remained tight-lipped, refusing to provide any official comment.</p>

<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington DC denied any involvement by Beijing-backed hackers in the breach. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy, labelled the accusations as a "distortion of the fact" and accused the US of politicising cybersecurity issues to "smear China."</p>

<p>The US Congress has been briefed on the severity of the situation, CNN reported, with both the House and Senate intelligence committees receiving updates on the hacking campaign. Major cybersecurity players, such as Microsoft and Mandiant, have also been brought in to assist in probing the attacks. Sources close to the investigation have highlighted the persistence and sophistication of the hacking group, known in cybersecurity circles as Salt Typhoon.</p>

<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray has even remarked that Chinese government-backed hackers vastly outnumber FBI cyber personnel by a staggering 50 to 1.</p>

<p>One such Chinese hacking group has allegedly been lurking in US transportation and communication networks, ready to disrupt any US response in the event of a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another notable Chinese hacking operation occurred last year when hackers breached the unclassified email accounts of senior US diplomats just before Secretary of State Antony Blinken's high-profile visit to China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel placed its forces on alert Saturday ahead of the anniversary of Hamas's October 7 attack, after a military official said the country was preparing its retaliation for Iran's missile attack.</p>

<p>The alert came with Israel engaged in an intensifying war with the Lebanese Hezbollah group, which army chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said would be hit "without concession or respite".</p>

<p>Ahead of Monday's grim anniversary, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a televised briefing: "We are prepared with increased forces in anticipation for this day", when there could be "attacks on the home front".</p>

<p>The unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian group resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>One year later, although the war in Gaza continues at a lower tempo, Israel has turned its focus north to Lebanon, where it is now at war with Hezbollah, and is focused on the movement's backer Iran.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had killed around 440 Hezbollah fighters "from the ground and from the air" since Monday when troops began "targeted" ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel says it aims to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by almost a year of Hezbollah rocket fire into northern Israel to return home.</p>

<p>Israel's President Isaac Herzog called Iran an "ongoing threat" after Tehran, which backs armed groups across the Middle East, on Tuesday launched around 200 missiles at Israel in revenge for Israeli killings of top militant leaders.</p>

<p><strong>'Duty' to respond</strong></p>

<p>The missile attack killed one person in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and damaged an Israeli air base, according to satellite images.</p>

<p>It the same day Israeli ground forces began their raids into Lebanon after days of intense strikes on Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon.</p>

<p>One Israeli military official, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to discuss the issue publicly, said the army "is preparing a response" to Iran's attack.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, noted Iran had twice launched "hundreds of missiles" at Israeli territory since April.</p>

<p>"Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and to respond to these attacks and that is what we will do," said Netanyahu. His critics accuse him of obstructing efforts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and deal to free hostages still held by Hamas.</p>

<p>A senior Hezbollah source said Saturday the group had lost contact with Hashem Safieddine, widely tipped to be the next Hezbollah leader, after air strikes this week in Beirut.</p>

<p>The movement is yet to name a new chief after Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah late last month in a massive strike in the Lebanese capital.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday said that "the resistance in the region will not back down".</p>

<p><strong>Fresh strikes on Hamas</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters were confronting Israeli troops in Lebanon's southern border region, and early Sunday claimed to have repelled an attempted Israeli incursion into a border village.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Saturday it had struck militants inside a mosque in Bint Jbeil. It also reported frequent rocket fire from Lebanon while Hezbollah claimed a rocket attack on northern Israel's Ramat David air base, and on a "military industries company" near Israel's coastal city of Acre.</p>

<p>Hamas said Israeli strikes had killed two of its operatives in north and east Lebanon Saturday, as Israel's military confirmed the killing of two Hamas figures.</p>

<p>Hamas said one of them was hit near Tripoli, the first such strike in the northern area.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Israel had "destroyed a large part" of Hezbollah's arsenal and "changed the course of the war".</p>

<p>In a March report, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said estimates of Hezbollah's rockets and missiles varied from 120,000-200,000.</p>

<p><strong>'Never-ending'</strong></p>

<p>On central Beirut's busy Hamra Street, Salma Salman said she had been camping out with her seven-year-old twin daughters for nearly two weeks.</p>

<p>"We're living a terrifying, never-ending nightmare," she said.</p>

<p>Late Saturday Israel issued a new appeal for residents of southern Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold, to evacuate.</p>

<p>A little later, official Lebanese media said five Israeli strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts, four of them "very violent".</p>

<p>AFP correspondents in Beirut heard several explosions and saw smoke rising south of Beirut.</p>

<p>Across Lebanon, the wave of strikes on Hezbollah strongholds has killed more than 1,110 people since September 23, according to a tally based on official figures.</p>

<p>The head of the UN's refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, said in Lebanon that the country "faces a terrible crisis" and warned "hundreds of thousands of people are left destitute or displaced by Israeli air strikes".</p>

<p>Israeli bombardment has put at least four hospitals in Lebanon out of service, the facilities said.</p>

<p>British foreign minister David Lammy described reports of the strikes "deeply disturbing" in a post on X.</p>

<p>The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said it rejected a request by the Israeli military to "relocate some of our positions" in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Ireland's President Michael Higgins, whose country has peacekeepers in the mission, said Israel was "demanding that the entire UNIFIL... walk away", which he called "an insult to the most important global institution".</p>

<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, visiting Damascus on Saturday after a stop in Beirut, renewed his call for ceasefires in both Gaza and Lebanon, while threatening Israel with an "even stronger" reaction to any attack on Iran.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time "that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza," adding that France was not providing any.</p>

<p>He also criticised Israel's decision to send ground troops into Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>Unhealed wounds</strong></p>

<p>US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators tried unsuccessfully for months to reach a Gaza truce and secure the release of 97 hostages still held in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>Medics and rescuers said Israeli fire early Saturday killed at least 12 people across Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,825 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the territory's health ministry and described as reliable by the UN.</p>

<p>Ahead of the October 7 anniversary, thousands joined pro-Palestinian rallies in London, Paris, Cape Town and other cities.</p>

<p>Herzog, the Israeli president, said his country's October 7 "wounds still cannot fully heal".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tehran's top diplomat in Damascus on Saturday threatened an "even stronger" reaction to any aggression, as Israel readied its response to an Iranian missile attack earlier this week.</p>

<p>"Our reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters in the Syrian capital, where he met top officials including Tehran's ally President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>"For every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger," he said.</p>

<p>He spoke after an Israeli military official told AFP on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to discuss the issue publicly, the army was "preparing a response to the unprecedented and unlawful Iranian attack".</p>

<p>In Damascus earlier, Araghchi renewed his call for ceasefires in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Araghchi's visit, his first since he took office in August, comes almost a year after Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, triggering the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The conflict has also drawn in Iran's Lebanese ally Hezbollah, and on September 23 Israel sharply intensified its campaign against the militant group.</p>

<p>"The most important issue today is the ceasefire, especially in Lebanon and in Gaza," Araghchi said.</p>

<p>"There are initiatives in this regard. There have been consultations that we hope will be successful."</p>

<p>His meetings in Damascus follow a visit to Beirut on Friday during which he voiced support for a truce in Lebanon acceptable to Hezbollah, "simultaneously with a ceasefire in Gaza".</p>

<p>He travelled to Syria's capital by air after Lebanon said an Israeli air strike on Friday severed the main international highway linking the two countries.</p>

<p>Israel said the strike aimed to prevent the flow of weapons to Hezbollah from neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>Iran has been a staunch ally of Assad throughout the civil war that erupted in 2011 following the suppression of anti-government protests.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Assad's office quoted him as saying Iran's missile attack on Israel was "a strong response and taught the Zionist entity a lesson".</p>

<p>The attack came just days after an Israeli air strike in southern Beirut killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sydney has been named the world's best city in a survey conducted by <em>Conde Nast Traveller</em>. The top-10 global cities rankings are part of the publication's annual Readers' Choice Awards for 2024, which launched on October 1 in the UK. Sydney, which ranked no. 1 with a score of 92.26, was praised by the Conde Nast Traveller UK for its "unique, indoor-outdoor way of life". Sydney beat out tourism hotspots spanning five continents, including Valencia in Spain (92.78), Singapore (92.47), Hong Kong (91.72) and Stockholm, Sweden (91.11), which ranked second to fifth place respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/world-news/sydney-ranked-as-best-city-in-the-world-second-behind-singapore-in-friendliest-in-new-list/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>, Sydney was also named the world's second-most friendly city, with a score of 93.85, behind Singapore, with 94.84 points, while Sydney hotel The Fullerton was crowned the best hotel in Australasia.</p>

<p>Conde Nast Traveler US also unveiled its Readers' Choice Awards this week, with Sydney placing third in the US awards list of the best cities in the world, describing it as "an ideal getaway no matter the season". Australian hotel Ritz-Carlton Melbourne was named the best hotel in Australia and New Zealand for 2024.</p>

<p>The UK and US Readers' Choice Awards winners were chosen based on the votes of more than half a million survey respondents, the <em>Post </em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If you've experienced a snippet of life Down Under, you've probably fallen hard for the unique, indoor-outdoor way of life the Aussies embrace so well," Traveller said about Sydney.</p>

<p>Moreover, the publication also had readers vote on their favourite airlines with Air New Zealand coming first, followed by Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways, Emirates and British Airways.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in September, Sydney was also named Oceania's Leading City Destination in the World Travel Awards 2024.</p>

<p>With results like that, you'd think Sydney was in the midst of an international tourism boom. However, according to the Post, the reality is somewhat different. According to the most recent International Visitor Survey data from Tourism Research Australia, Sydney welcomed only 3,446,000 foreign visitors in June, a figure still 16 per cent below the same period in 2019.</p>

<p>But John O'Sullivan, chief executive of Experience Co and former Tourism Australia managing director, told the Sydney Morning Herald, that the stellar awards results could go a long way to putting Sydney on the radar of high-value international travellers - that is, those likely to spend more, stay longer and travel further within Australia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg was among dozens of protesters detained Saturday for blocking a road in the Belgian capital at a demonstration against fossil fuel subsidies.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist saw the iconic Swede -- who has previously been detained for civil disobedience at protests in various countries -- carried away by police after refusing to leave a sit-in.</p>

<p>Thunberg, 21, was part of a smaller group of demonstrators who broke away from a march organised by the United for Climate Justice movement that began outside the European Parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rally was calling for the European Union -- headquartered in Brussels -- to end subsidies for fossil fuels to achieve its ambitious goal of making the continent carbon neutral by 2050.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This will not happen without an immediate phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies," climate activists, scientists and economists wrote in an open letter to EU leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Until these necessary changes occur, people will continue to take to the streets to make our voices heard and hold you accountable."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The potential successor to slain Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been out of contact since Friday, a Lebanese security source said on Saturday, after an Israeli airstrike that is reported to have targeted him.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The potential successor to Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been out of contact since Friday, a Lebanese security source told Reuters on Saturday, after an Israeli airstrike that is reported to have targeted him.</p>

<p>In its campaign against the Iran-backed Lebanese group, Israel carried out a large strike on Beirut's southern suburbs late on Thursday that Axios cited three Israeli officials as saying targeted Hashem Safieddine in an underground bunker.</p>

<p>The Lebanese security source and two other Lebanese security sources said that ongoing Israeli strikes on Beirut's southern suburb - known as Dahiyeh - since Friday have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of the attack.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has made no comment so far on Safieddine since the attack.</p>

<p>Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said on Friday the military was still assessing the Thursday night airstrikes, which he said targeted Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters.</p>

<p>The loss of Nasrallah's rumoured successor would be yet another blow to Hezbollah and its patron Iran. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have decimated Hezbollah's leadership.</p>

<p>Israel expanded its conflict in Lebanon on Saturday with its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli, a Lebanese security official said, after more bombs hit Beirut suburbs and Israeli troops launched raids in the south.</p>

<p>Israel has begun an intense bombing campaign in Lebanon and sent troops across the border in recent weeks after nearly a year of exchanging fire with Hezbollah. Fighting had previously been mostly limited to the Israel-Lebanon border area, taking place in parallel to Israel's year-old war in Gaza against Palestinian group Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel says it aims to allow the safe return of tens of thousands of citizens to their homes in northern Israel, bombarded by Hezbollah since Oct.8 last year.</p>

<p>The Israeli attacks have eliminated much of Hezbollah's senior military leadership, including Secretary General Nasrallah in an air attack on Sept. 27.</p>

<p>The Israeli assault has also killed hundreds of ordinary Lebanese, including rescue workers, Lebanese officials say, and forced 1.2 million people - almost a quarter of the population - to flee their homes.</p>

<p>The Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday's strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group also said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing.</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike on Tripoli, a Sunni Muslim-majority port city that its warplanes also targeted during a 2006 war with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israel has meanwhile staged nightly bombardment of Dahiyeh, once a bustling and densely populated area of Beirut and a stronghold for Hezbollah.</p>

<p>On Saturday, smoke billowed over Dahiyeh, large parts of which have been reduced to rubble sending residents fleeing to other parts of Beirut or of Lebanon.</p>

<p>In northern Israel, air raid sirens sent people running for their shelters amid rocket fire from Lebanon.</p>

<p>ISRAEL WEIGHS OPTIONS FOR IRAN</p>

<p>The violence comes as the anniversary approaches of Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people and in which about 250 were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and displaced nearly all of the enclave's population of 2.3 million.</p>

<p>Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, and which has lost key commanders of its elite Revolutionary Guards Corps to Israeli air strikes in Syria this year, launched a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. The strikes did little damage.</p>

<p>Israel has been weighing options in its response to Iran's attack.</p>

<p>Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an attack on Iran's oil facilities as Israel pursues its goals of pushing back Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and eliminating their Hamas allies in Gaza.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel to consider alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields, adding that he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran.</p>

<p>Israeli news website Ynet reported that the top U.S. general for the Middle East, Army General Michael Kurilla, is headed for Israel in the coming day. Israeli and U.S. officials were not immediately reachable for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meetings with the top leaders of Russia and Ukraine were "beginnings of a communication process" between two countries engaged in a serious conflict that has had enormous consequences, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday.</p>

<p>In an interactive session at The Conclave 2024 organised by news channel Pratidin Time, Mr Jaishankar said Prime Minister Modi was one of the very few world leaders who has the "ability" to speak to both the leaders, who "trust" him.</p>

<p>"What are we trying to do? You don't necessarily have to mediate... sometimes you have to communicate. We are actually, simultaneously talking to two countries who are having a conflict," he said to a question on India's role in "mediation" in the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said Prime Minister Modi has had at least three meetings with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>He said National Security Adviser Ajit Doval also met Putin in September to brief him about PM Modi's discussions with Zelensky.</p>

<p>"Obviously that talk is centered around what the conflict is all about. It was necessary for NSA Doval to go to Russia so that the Russians know what the Prime Minister spoke to Zelensky," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>He said the Russia-Ukraine conflict has entered the third year and has had enormous human cost and huge economic consequences across the world.</p>

<p>"You can either watch this conflict and say none of us could do anything about it and say it will end when it ends. Or you can say I am one of the few countries or in our case one of the few prime ministers who has the ability to speak there and both parties trust him and see whether out of these conversations something moves," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>"I think these are the beginnings of a communication process. Where it will lead, I have not quite reached that point," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said the world leaders were supportive of what India was doing.</p>

<p>"People are very happy today. They say you have a person like PM Modi who has the ability to go to both capitals and have that kind of communication," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate protesters have become a daily sight on London's streets, undeterred by the honking horns of irate motorists, personal insults and even arrests. This time, Ocean Rebellion campaigners pretended to drown themselves in oil and gas in a protest outside a United Nations agency in London. The climate change activists staged the frightening demonstration on the steps of the International Maritime Organisation, the UN agency responsible for regulating maritime transport. "A drowning ocean goddess symbolizes the dire threat LNG poses to our oceans," the group wrote on X while sharing pictures of the stunt show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The images show, one activist, dressed as an "ocean goddess", donning a fishbowl on her head filled with black liquid as though she was drowning. She could be seen screaming as the liquid engulfed her face before it quickly drained from the bowl. Other protesters around her were seen wearing gas masks and brandishing petrol pumps with flames spouting out of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) is not a "green" solution. Methane leaks from LNG ships are 80x more damaging than CO2. The IMO must wake up to this reality before it's too late," Ocean Rebellion wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

The protesters accused the agency of manipulating the fossil fuel industry and failing to protect the ocean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The IMO is failing to protect our oceans. LNG is a dirty fuel disguised as clean. We demand transparency and accountability. Stop listening to fossil fuel lobbyists, start protecting our planet!" the group wrote on the microblogging site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, climate change activists have been in the news with their high-profile direct-action protests, such as disrupting Premier League Football matches, and sporting events, to publicise their cause. They have thrown tomato soup on famous paintings and glued themselves to picture frames in galleries. They want the government to end all new oil and gas exploration and have promised not to let up in its protests until it does so.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, three activists from Just Stop Oil threw soup at two of Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" paintings at London's National Gallery. This incident occurred just hours after two other members of the protest group were sentenced to prison for a similar act in 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dubai's Emirates Airlines has banned passengers from carrying pagers and walkie-talkies on its flights, following last month's attacks on Lebanese group Hezbollah involving communication devices that exploded.</p>

<p>"All passengers traveling to, from, or via Dubai are prohibited from transporting pagers and walkie-talkies in checked or cabin baggage," the airline said in a statement on its website on Friday. It added that any prohibited items found will be confiscated by Dubai Police as part of heightened security measures.</p>

<p>In the deadly September attacks, thousands of booby-trapped Hezbollah pagers and hundreds of radios exploded - attacks that were widely blamed on Israel but which it has not claimed.</p>

<p>The Middle East's largest airline also announced that flights to Iraq and Iran will remain suspended until Tuesday, while services to Jordan will resume on Sunday.</p>

<p>Flights to Lebanon will remain suspended until Oct. 15 due to escalating Israeli attacks against Iran-backed Hezbollah, including strikes near Beirut's airport.</p>

<p>Several other airlines have also suspended flights to Beirut and other regional airports amid heightened tensions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple in the United States defrauded the government of nearly $500,000 (approximately Rs 4.2 Crore) to take dozens of lavish vacations to Walt Disney World while claiming they were travelling for work. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, 61-year-old Thomas Bouchard, who is an Army contractor, used his government connections to get his girlfriend, 53-year-old Cantelle Boyd, hired for a "no-show" job as his assistant so they could take numerous vacations, including 31 trips to Walt Disney World in Flordia. Their elaborate scheme cost the Department of Defence more than $490,000, prosecutors said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Citing the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/04/us-news/couple-took-31-trips-to-disney-after-stealing-500k-from-government-feds/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Post </em></a>reported that the couple claimed that they were travelling for work. Mr Bouchard, who was in charge of the US Army Natick Contracting Division in Massachusetts, reportedly used his "long-standing relationship with government contractor Evolution Enterprise Inc., to have Ms Boyd hired as an assistant to support him. She was paid a government salary of $487,658 and performed "little if any useful function" from 2014 to 2018, costing the government an extra $75,583 in travel expenses, prosecutors said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple reportedly booked vacations ranging from two to 15 days, and their travels - which were done during business hours - included staying a hotels, lounging by the pool and visiting Disney parks. In addition to this, the couple also travelled to Virginia and other Florida locations. Prosecutors said that the 61-year-old concealed the nature of their trips and sought reimbursement by falsifying and then approving expense records.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Federal authorities arrested the couple in July 2020. They each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and 10 counts of theft of government funds and false declarations. The 61-year-old was sentenced in August to one year and one day in prison and is required to pay $487,658 in restitution.</p>

<p>"Those of us who are privileged to work in public service owe a duty to the taxpayers to act with integrity at all times," said Acting US Attorney Joshua S. Levy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This defendant clearly failed in adhering to this solemn oath and abused his position of trust to line his own pockets, hire a friend into a phantom position and enjoy junkets all on the taxpayer's dime. He will now pay the price for his inexcusable conduct," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ms Boyd was sentenced to six months of home confinement on October 2. Prosecutors said she is required to pay restitution "at a later date".&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's capital was locked down on Saturday, swarmed by security forces with mobile internet cut as supporters of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan attempted to seize the streets in protest.</p>

<p>Khan was barred from standing in the February elections that were marred by allegations of rigging, and sidelined by dozens of legal cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a crackdown to needle the government with regular demonstrations.</p>

<p>PTI activists began driving to Islamabad on Friday from his powerbase in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province but were met with shipping container roadblocks and volleys of tear gas.</p>

<p>On Saturday, small and scattered convoys pressed in on Islamabad in defiance of the government which approved troops for deployment on the streets -- citing the need to guarantee security ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit due to open on October 15.</p>

<p>"I am so proud of all our people," said a message from Khan posted on social media site X on Saturday afternoon. "You showed unfaltering resilience and courage as you came out yesterday and overcame unbelievable obstacles."</p>

<p>Protests were also due Saturday in Lahore, however the main motorway linking the eastern megacity to the capital was blocked.</p>

<p>Amnesty International said the communications cuts and road blockades "infringe on people's right to freedom of expression, access to information, peaceful assembly and movement".</p>

<p>"These restrictions are part of a worrying clampdown on the right to protest in Pakistan," the rights group said.</p>

<p>The social media site X -- formerly Twitter -- has also been blocked across Pakistan since after the election, when mobile internet was likewise cut on polling day and PTI allege widespread vote tampering took place.</p>

<p>The 72-year-old Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote after falling out with the powerful military establishment considered Pakistan's political kingmakers.</p>

<p>As opposition leader he led an unprecedented campaign of defiance before becoming tangled in slews of court cases he claims have been orchestrated to prevent his return to power.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Helene in the United States this week, a new storm emerged on social media - false rumours about how disaster funds have been used, and even claims that officials control the weather.</p>

<p>Local and national government officials say they are trying to combat the rumours, including one spread by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>One of the more far-fetched rumours is that Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits. Others accuse the administration of President Joe Biden of using federal disaster funds to help migrants in the country illegally or suggest officials are deliberately abandoning bodies in the cleanup.</p>

<p>Republican Congress member Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X Thursday night: "Yes they can control the weather. It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done."</p>

<p>The conspiracy theories are pivotal for rescue and recovery efforts following the storm, one of the deadliest U.S. hurricanes this century. And the presidential election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is just over a month away.</p>

<p>Republicans and Democrats alike say the rumours are causing problems.</p>

<p>"I just talked to one Senator that has had 15 calls TODAY about why we don't stop ........ 'fill in the blank,'" said Kevin Corbin, a Republican in the North Carolina Senate - a state that is one of the hardest hit by Helene. "98% chance it's not true and if it is a problem, somebody is aware and on it," he wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>"I'm growing weary of intentional distractions," he added.</p>

<p>White House officials on Friday accused some Republican leaders and conservative media of intentionally peddling rumours to divide Americans in a way that could harm disaster relief efforts.</p>

<p>"Disinformation of this kind can discourage people from seeking critical assistance when needed most," a White House memo said. "It is paramount that every leader, whatever their political beliefs, stops spreading this poison."</p>

<p>The memo highlighted a claim by Trump during a rally this week that Biden and Harris had used federal emergency funds "on people that should not be in our country."</p>

<p>"This is FALSE," the memo said. "No disaster relief funding at all was used to support migrants housing and services. None. At. All."</p>

<p>In response to a request for comment for this article, the Trump campaign repeated accusations that FEMA funds had been spent on housing migrants in the country illegally.</p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has the funds for immediate response and recovery efforts for Helene, the White House memo said, and has provided millions of dollars in relief to those recovering.</p>

<p>FEMA has been the target of so many falsehoods it has set up a rumour response page on its website to try to tamp them down.</p>

<p>Helene slammed into Florida a week ago, killed over 200 people and devastated a half dozen states in the U.S. Southeast.</p>

<p>Some officials are trying to combat the disinformation themselves on social media. Katie Keaotamai, who works at FEMA but said she was speaking on social media in a personal capacity, explained FEMA's disaster response processes in several TikTok posts with thousands of views.</p>

<p>Disaster events are often politicized, said Kate Starbird, co-founder of the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington, adding that social media rewards "sensationalism and outrage with attention."</p>

<p>"Manipulating the sensemaking process (e.g. spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation) and politicizing the event will both make it harder to respond and recover now - and to make informed decisions about how to prepare for and mitigate the next one," Starbird said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite the ongoing military campaign against Hezbollah, the observers assert that they continue to be sidelined. Many believe this is partly due to an ingrained culture of misogyny within the IDF.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over a year, a dedicated group of young women in Israel's military has been on high alert, observing movements along the border with Lebanon. This female-only unit, known as field observers, has played a critical role in identifying threats from Hezbollah, diligently tracking the group's activities from their posts. These soldiers, aged between 18 and 20, are responsible for monitoring drone activity, mortar rounds, and rockets that have plagued northern Israel since last October. Yet, even as tensions escalated, they feel their warnings and contributions have been largely ignored.</p>

<p>"We are unprotected, which is a problem for us, but it is also dangerous for our work, which is very important," an observer near the border with Lebanon told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/04/israel-female-field-observers-october-7-attacks-hamas-gaza/" rel="NoFollowNoIndex">The Washington Post</a>. "Our superiors only want to shut us up, to not come to them with complaints, so they're ignoring us even more," she added.</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing military campaign against Hezbollah, the observers assert that they continue to be sidelined. Many believe this is partly due to an ingrained culture of misogyny within the IDF.</p>

<p>"It is a male army, where the 'girls' are seen as hysterical, where the commanders regularly say, 'If you continue to send these alarms, you will be put in jail,'" said Gili Yuval, a former field observer who served during the early 2000s when Israel withdrew its forces and dismantled its settlements in Gaza.</p>

<p>Since October 7, she has led a loosely organized network of current and former observers, supplying essentials like food and clothing to victims of the attack.</p>

<p>The IDF has declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding these claims.</p>

<p>Gili Shrvit, 20, an observer stationed at another location along the Gaza border in Kissufim, recounted that on the morning of October 7, she was at her workstation, trembling and in tears as she reported the unfolding devastation: Hundreds of Hamas gunmen had breached their fence, shot out their cameras, and invaded their base.</p>

<p>"We were calling our superiors, telling them we are about to die," she recalled. "They said they have no one for us."</p>

<p>They took cover under their workstations, with no weapons to defend themselves, Shrvit recalled. Their commanders, located 20 miles away, informed them that combat soldiers were trapped in ambushes and could not assist.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump on Friday promoted an endorsement from JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jamie Dimon has firmly denied former US president Donald Trump's recent claim that the CEO of JPMorgan Chase has endorsed him for the US presidency. This clarification came shortly after Trump claimed he had Dimon's support. A spokesperson for Dimon, Joe Evangelisti, refuted the endorsement, telling <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/trump-jamie-dimon-endorsement-jpmorgan.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNBC</a>, “Jamie Dimon has not endorsed anyone. He has not endorsed a candidate.”<br />
<br />
According to the CNBC report, Trump on his social media platform, Truth Social, shared a screenshot falsely claiming that Dimon was backing his presidential bid. The post read, “New: Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has endorsed Trump for President.”<br />
<br />
The claim seems to have first surfaced on X (formerly Twitter) on October 4 and was quickly circulated by several pro-Trump accounts. It gained further traction when Trump himself shared it before JPMorgan Chase issued a denial.<br />
<br />
However, when NBC questioned Trump about the post on October 4, the former president claimed ignorance of its origin, distancing himself from responsibility. He told NBC, “Somebody put it up. I don't know.” Even hours after the remark, the post was still accessible on Trump's official social media account. CNBC's attempts to contact the Trump campaign for further comment went unanswered.<br />
<br />
Earlier in September, Dimon made his political stance clear during an interview at the JPMorgan Investor Summit in Mumbai. At the time, he emphasised his neutrality, stating, “I'm not endorsing anyone at this time.”<br />
<br />
Although Dimon has occasionally praised Trump, he also criticised the former president. Their relationship has seen its share of public disputes. During the Republican primaries, Dimon voiced support for former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, urging business leaders to back her instead of Trump.<br />
<br />
Trump, in response, lashed out at Dimon for endorsing Haley, recalling their interactions during his presidency. He said, “I've never been a big Jamie Dimon fan, but had to live with this guy when he came begging to the White House,” adding fuel to their already tense rapport.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Vincent Van Gogh aficionado in Bosnia has turned a plot of land into a giant, living reproduction of the painter's masterpiece, "Starry Night", composed of thousands of plants.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Vincent Van Gogh aficionado in Bosnia has turned a plot of land into a giant, living reproduction of the painter's masterpiece, "Starry Night", composed of thousands of plants.</p>

<p>"Vincent Van Gogh belongs to us too. It's our heritage and this is a way of paying tribute to him," Halim Zukic told AFP.</p>

<p>Behind him, tens of thousands of lavender bushes, grasses and other plants form swirls and spirals across a dozen hectares that -- seen from the air -- unmistakably resemble the celestial configuration painted by the Dutch post-Impressionist master in 1889.</p>

<p>"It wasn't possible to simply reproduce a flat image on a three-dimensional space," Zukic said.</p>

<p>"Inspired by the painting, we tried to stick to the shapes and proportions, so that it looks like the painting as much as possible.</p>

<p>"And I think we succeeded."</p>

<p>The 56-year-old entrepreneur first noticed the land 20 years ago when he was returning from a day out picking mushrooms nearby, in the woods surrounding the village of Luznica in central Bosnia.</p>

<p>He bought the first plot with the idea of building a hut and creating a small, rounded garden.</p>

<p>At the time, he wasn't even thinking about "Starry Night", one of the favourite landscapes in New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).</p>

<p>But the idea just clicked in 2018 when Zukic noticed the tracks left on the lawn by a tractor.</p>

<p>"To my eyes, these tracks looked like spirals from "Starry Night" and it was an immediate decision."</p>

<p><strong>130,000 lavender plants</strong></p>

<p>The former insurance company owner, who now works in tourism, bought more land and started working it, helped daily by up to 20-30 gardeners.</p>

<p>He declined to say what it cost to complete his labour of love, which took six years to acquire its final shape.</p>

<p>"We planted around 130,000 lavender bushes, tens of thousands of aromatic and medicinal plants, several thousand trees," he said.</p>

<p>"There isn't a single straight line in the park -- just like in nature."</p>

<p>At the same time, Zukic became interested in Van Gogh, about whom he knew very little at the time.</p>

<p>Today, Zukic talks animatedly about the painter, his "love of nature" and the "passion with which he did his work".</p>

<p>In 2023, he travelled to France to visit the places where Van Gogh spent some of his most prolific years -- Arles and Saint-Remy-en-Provence.</p>

<p>The artist painted "Starry Night" in June 1889 while he was in a Saint Remy psychiatric hospital.</p>

<p>A year later, he committed suicide, aged 37.</p>

<p>For the time being, only a handful of visitors have had the chance to appreciate Zukic's park.</p>

<p>The plants and trees still need time to flourish so the public will need a few more months of patience, he said. "Having money is not enough. You need time for a park," he said. "I'd say we've created a good foundation. The park will be more beautiful every year."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel hasn't clarified its intention of targeting Iran's nuclear facilities in retaliation for the Iranian ballistic missile strikes earlier this week on Tuesday. It is as ambiguous as it could be. It is "really hard to tell" if Israel will use the anniversary of Hamas' October 7 attacks to retaliate, a top US State Department official told CNN on Friday.</p>

<p>"We hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength, but as you guys know, no guarantees," the official said when asked by CNN if Israel has assured the US that Iran's nuclear sites are off the table.</p>

<p>"I think in some ways they would want to avoid the seventh, so in my estimation, if there is anything it would likely be before or after," the senior State Department official said.</p>

<p>Iran launched a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday night, triggering nationwide air raid sirens and forcing nearly 10 million Israelis into bomb shelters. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the missile assault, targeting three Israeli military bases near Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Although a majority of missiles were intercepted, there were scattered reports of damage and injuries. In Tel Aviv, two civilians were lightly injured by shrapnel, while in the West Bank city of Jericho, a Palestinian civilian was killed by debris from one of the missiles, news agency AFP reported. The Israeli military quickly announced that the immediate threat had passed, and civilians were allowed to leave bomb shelters after an hour.</p>

<p>US officials have voiced support for Israel and its response to Iran's missile attack earlier this week. "Israel has a right to defend itself, as any nation does. In terms of what Israel's response will be, of course, there must be consequences for Iran for this attack. We've made clear that there must be consequences," said Matthew Miller, Spokesperson, US Department of State, during a press briefing.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden opposed Israel's idea of targeting Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

<p>"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields," Biden said at a press briefing Friday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

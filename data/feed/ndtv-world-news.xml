       <description><![CDATA[Hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon today, killing eight people and wounding Tehran's ambassador in Beirut in blasts the Iran-backed militant group blamed on Israel. There was no comment from the Israeli military.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Hezbollah has been using a private, fixed-line telecommunications network dating back to the early 2000s, news agency Reuters reported on July 9.</li>
	<li>The use of pagers appears to be an extension of this method of keeping communications to the most basic to avoid being intercepted and tracked.</li>
	<li>It is not yet fully known how exactly the pagers were made to explode. Some experts on social media said they suspect Israeli intelligence operatives may have intercepted a large order of pagers by the Hezbollah, and either rigged them with small plastic explosives or replaced the pagers with similar looking models but which are actually mini bombs.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had previously warned the group's members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes.</li>
	<li>Israel's electronic eavesdropping - including hacking into cell phones and computers - is also widely regarded as among the world's most sophisticated.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hot on the heels of still-dominant diesel cars, electric vehicles now outnumber petrol models for the first time in oil-rich Norway, a world first that puts the country on track to taking fossil fuel vehicles off the road.</p>

<p>Of the 2.8 million private cars registered in Norway, 754,303 are all-electric, compared to 753,905 that run on petrol, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV), an industry organisation, said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Diesel models remain most numerous at just under one million, but their sales are falling sharply.</p>

<p>"This is historic. A milestone few saw coming 10 years ago," OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The electrification of the fleet of passenger cars is going quickly, and Norway is thereby rapidly moving towards becoming the first country in the world with a passenger car fleet dominated by electric cars," Thorsen said.</p>

<p>The speed at which Norway's car fleet is being renewed "suggests that in 2026 we will have more electric cars than diesel cars," he said.</p>

<p>"As far as I know, no other country in the world is in the same situation" with EVs outnumbering petrol cars, he told AFP.</p>

<p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electric vehicles made up just 3.2 percent of the global car fleet in 2023 -- 4.1 percent in France, 7.6 percent in China, 18 percent in Iceland -- with this data including rechargeable hybrid cars, unlike the Norwegian data.</p>

<p>Norway, paradoxically a major oil and gas producer, has set a target to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2025, 10 years ahead of the European Union's goal. Norway is not an EU member.</p>

<p>Boosted by sales of the Tesla Model Y, all-electric vehicles made up a record 94.3 percent of new car registrations in August in Norway, a sharp contrast to EV struggles seen elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<p>"We're almost there," said Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association.</p>

<p>"Now the government just has to make a little extra effort in the 2025 budget bill (to be presented to parliament on October 7) and resist the temptation to raise taxes on EVs while continuing to increase those on fuel cars," she told AFP.</p>

<p>In a bid to electrify road transport to help meet Norway's climate commitments, authorities have offered generous tax rebates on EVs, making them competitively priced compared to highly-taxed fuel and diesel cars, as well as hybrid vehicles.</p>

<p>Several other EV incentives -- including exemptions on inner city tolls, free parking and use of collective transport lanes -- have also played a role in Norway's success, even though those have gradually been rolled back over the years.</p>

<p><strong>Sharp contrast with Europe</strong></p>

<p>Norway has come a long way in 20 years: in September 2004, the country's car fleet counted 1.6 million petrol cars, around 230,000 diesel cars and just 1,000 EVs, OFV noted.</p>

<p>The transition to EVs has played a big role in Norway's efforts to meet its climate commitments, which include a 55-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 from 1990 levels.</p>

<p>But it is not enough.</p>

<p>In 2023, emissions shrank by 4.7 percent from the previous year, according to official statistics, but the decline compared to 1990 was just 9.1 percent.</p>

<p>Electric cars are considered even more climate-friendly in Norway, where almost all electricity is generated by hydro power.</p>

<p>This success story contrasts sharply with the situation in the rest of Europe, where sales of EVs are slumping as hybrid models prove more popular.</p>

<p>Electric car sales began falling at the end of 2023, and account for just 12.5 percent of new cars sold on the continent since the start of the year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).</p>

<p>Their share of the market is expected to increase sharply in 2025, to between 20 and 24 percent of new car registrations, according to think tank Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E).</p>

<p>Some doubt the EU's ability to completely ban fuel and diesel cars by 2035.</p>

<p>In Norway's neighbour and EU member Sweden, sales of new EVs have decreased this year for the first time, according to industry group Mobility Sweden, likely the result of a government decision to remove a rebate on EV purchases.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A recent two-page memo outlines strict appearance requirements for interviews, training, and career advancement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delta Air Lines has issued a stern reminder to potential flight attendants: wear underwear. A recent <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://view.pagetiger.com/FAInvitations/fa-hiring-process-and-faqs/DeltaAirLinesFlightAttendantHiringCandidateAppearanceRequirements-2024.pdf">two-page memo</a> outlines strict appearance requirements for interviews, training, and career advancement. The guidelines cover grooming, hair, jewellery, and clothing, with a notable emphasis on undergarments. According to the memo, "proper undergarments" are mandatory, but they must remain invisible. The airline stressed professionalism and neat appearance and ordered current and aspiring flight attendants to adhere to these standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Delta Flight Attendants spend the most time with our customers and are the face of our airline. They must be passionate about enhancing each customer's experience while embodying the Delta brand. A Delta Flight Attendant is expected to deliver a Welcoming, Elevated and Caring experience while creating moments that matter to our customers. The customer service experience begins the moment a Flight Attendant puts on their uniform. &nbsp;The Delta uniform represents always putting safety first, pride in the Delta culture and demonstrates a genuine graciousness that will be remembered by our customers,'' the memo read.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>To maintain a professional image, Delta outlined specific guidelines:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Hair must be naturally coloured, without bold highlights or artificial shades.</li>
	<li>For longer hair, it must be pulled back and secured above the shoulders. If it extends past the mid-back, it needs to be pinned up.</li>
	<li>Eyelashes should look natural</li>
	<li>When it comes to nails, they must be simple and subtle - no neon colours, multi-colour, glitter, or hand-painted designs are allowed</li>
	<li>Tattoos must be covered, but bandages aren't an acceptable solution</li>
	<li>Only a single nose piercing is permitted, and the allowed studs include gold, silver, white pearl, or clear diamond/diamond-like&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In terms of other piercings, only two earrings per ear are allowed, and they must be smaller than a dime and not hoops</li>
	<li>Body piercings, other than the nose, are not allowed to be visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to clothing, Delta emphasised professionalism and fit. The memo mandated that dresses and skirts should fall at or below knee length, and athletic shoes are not permitted. Instead, flight attendants need to opt for closed-toe flats, heels, or sling-back shoes. For those wearing the male uniform, a tie is required with button-collared dress shirts.</p>

<p>During the interview day, Delta maintains a strict no-tolerance policy for profanity, chewing gum, and phone or earbud use.</p>

<p>''We will work with you to accommodate a specific manner of dress or physical appearance in<br />
keeping with religious beliefs or practices unless it causes a safety hazard or other undue burden<br />
on the company,” the memo concluded.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms is rolling out enhanced privacy and parental controls for&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;accounts of users under 18 in a significant overhaul aimed at addressing growing concerns around the negative effects of social media.</p>

<p>Meta will port all designated&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;accounts automatically to "Teen Accounts", which will be private accounts by default, the company said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Users of such accounts can only be messaged and tagged by accounts they follow or are already connected to, while sensitive content settings will be dialed to the most restrictive available.</p>

<p>Users under 16 can change the default settings only with a parent's permission. Parents will also get a suite of settings to monitor who their children are engaging with and limit their use of the app.</p>

<p>Several studies have linked social media use to higher levels of depression, anxiety and learning disabilities, particularly in young users.</p>

<p>Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's GOOGL.O YouTube already face hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of children and school districts about the addictive nature of social media. Last year, 33 U.S. states including California and New York sued the company for misleading the public about the dangers of its platforms.</p>

<p>Top platforms, including Facebook,&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and TikTok, allow users who are 13 years of age and above to sign up.</p>

<p>Meta's move comes three years after it abandoned development on a version of the&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;app meant for teenagers, after lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the company to drop it, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>In July, the U.S. Senate advanced two online safety bills - The Kids Online Safety Act and The Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act - that would force social media companies to take responsibility for how their platforms affect children and teens.</p>

<p>As part of the update, the under-18&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;users will be notified to close the app after 60 minutes each day. The accounts will also come with a default sleep mode that will silence notifications overnight.</p>

<p>Meta said it will place the identified users into teen accounts within 60 days in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, and in the European Union later this year. Teens around the world will start to get teen accounts in January.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Arab nations have, for the first time ever, agreed to recognise Israel as a country, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is being "frustrating" as he has not accepted a ceasefire deal that would ensure the return of peace in Gaza, Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera has said.</p>

<p>"Benjamin Netanyahu is standing in the way of the ceasefire deal," Congressman Bera said in an exclusive interview to NDTV.</p>

<p>Speaking about the lengthy process of securing a ceasefire deal, Congressman Bera said, "I am frustrated as well. You need both Hamas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to the table. And I am frustrated with PM Netanyahu. He should accept the ceasefire deal and we should get the hostages released."</p>

<p>He highlighted the fact that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations are willing to change relations with Israel and recognise it as a country, calling it a "remarkable" development. However, he said that it will all only begin with a ceasefire deal and starting a discussion about the two-state solution. "Prime Minister Netanyahu is the one standing in the way of that," Mr Bera said.</p>

<p>Ami Bera, who is in his sixth consecutive term, is the senior-most and the longest serving Indian-American Congressman in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>He is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>

<p>The Congressman also outlined Vice President Kamala Harris' stance on the Gaza crisis and what steps she could take if elected president in the November elections. "Vice President Harris has talked about the tragedy on October 7 but also the tragic loss of civilian lives after October 7. She, along with President Biden, understands the importance of getting a ceasefire and getting the hostages home."</p>

<p>She has iterated the importance of both Jewish people living safely in Israel and Palestinian people living with dignity and peace, Mr Bera said.</p>

<p>The nearly year-long war in Gaza has seen the loss of more than 40,000 lives. Meanwhile, months of negotiations mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States have failed to stop the conflict between Hamas and Israel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight people have died and more than 2,750 injured, many grievously so, in Lebanon in a synchronised detonation of pagers targeting US-designated terror group Hezbollah. Iran's state media reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon,&nbsp;Mojtaba Amani, has also been wounded in the incident. The explosions happened at around 3:30 pm local time in Lebanon (6 pm IST).</p>

<p>Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed that eight people were killed and some 2,750 wounded in the incident.</p>

<p>The minister, in a televised press conference, said the blasts "killed eight people, including a girl", adding that "About 2,750 people were injured and more than 200 of them critically". The injuries were mostly on the face, hands and stomach, he further said.</p>

<p>An independent war monitor has said that fourteen people have also been injured in pager blasts in Syria, reported news agency AFP.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which is banned both by the United States and the European Union is the political and military establishment in Lebanon and is backed by Iran. Hezbollah backs Hamas, which has been at war with Israel in Gaza since October 2023.</p>

<p>According to a report by Saudi news channel Al Hadath, the pager attacks have killed a son of Ali Ammar, the Hezbollah representative in the Lebanese Parliament.</p>

<p>While some reports claim that the explosions were caused due to the overheating of lithium batteries caused by an electronic signal breach (quite like a cyber attack), some other reports allege that a thin lining of explosives were placed inside the pagers before being supplied. <strong>NDTV cannot independently verify either of these claims at the moment</strong>.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack and has claimed that this is the "biggest security breach" it has faced yet. All the pagers exploded nearly the same time, the Hezbollah has claimed, saying that this is an "Israeli breach" of its communications network.</p>

</div>

<p>Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon have been hit by the "Israeli breach". This is the first such major incident since the group began trading fire with Israel almost every day in its support for Hamas which is at war with Israel in Gaza since the October 7 "terror attack" targeting Israeli nationals.</p>

<p>The explosions happened outside Lebanon too, as four people were injured in Syria as at least one pager blew up in a vehicle in Damascus.</p>

<p>"Dozens of Hezbollah members have been wounded in the south and in Beirut's southern suburbs after their pagers exploded," a source close to Hezbollah told news agency AFP, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency called it "an unprecedented enemy security incident" with "handheld pagers detonating" at nearly the same time across Lebanon.</p>

<p>According to AFP, Hezbollah communicates through its own telecommunications system and has asked its members to avoid using mobile phones since the Gaza war began almost a year ago. The diktat was issued to avoid Israeli breaches of the technology.</p>

<h2><strong>HEZBOLLAH BLAMES ISRAEL IN STATEMENT</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah put out a statement shortly after the pager explosions saying that at "Around 3:30 pm (local time) on Tuesday, several pager devices used by Hezbollah members and officials of various institutions exploded."</p>

<p>"Israel is fully responsible for the pager blasts," Hezbollah said.</p>

<p>The statement further read, "A girl and her two brothers" were killed in the incident, while many others were injured.</p>

<p>"The relevant authorities in Hezbollah are currently conducting extensive security and scientific investigations to find the reasons for these simultaneous explosions," it added.</p>

<p>The statement urged people to be "cautious of rumors and misinformation spread by certain parties, as this may serve the psychological warfare" by Israel.</p>

<p>Israel has not yet responded to these claims made by Hezbollah or Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS A PAGER? HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h3>

<p>A pager is an electronic telecommunications device which were mostly used in the 1990s and early 2000s to send text and alpha-numeric messages. Pagers usually beep, vibrate, or flash short text notifications to alert or update the end user.</p>

<p>Pagers, also known as beepers or bleepers, is a wireless communications device that receives and displays alphanumeric and in some cases, voice messages.</p>

<p>There are various types of pagers - A one-way pager can only receive messages, while a two-way or 'response' pagers can also respond. The response also is an alpha-numeric text which acknowledges or replies to the original message using an internal transmitter.</p>

<p>Two-way pagers, also known as response pagers typically work using ReFLEX protocol, which was developed in the mid-1990s by Motorola Corp. FLEX provides one-way communication only (from the provider to the pager device), but a related protocol called ReFLEX provides two-way messaging.</p>

<p>Modern paging systems typically use multiple base transmitters to modulate the same signal on the same RF or Radio Frequency channel, a design approach called simulcast.</p>

<p>Data transmitted over FLEX and ReFLEX is not encrypted and is hence vulnerable to breaches. There are codes used to improve the integrity of the data, but these are not cryptographically secure.</p>

<p>What encryption methods were being used by the Hezbollah is not known.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Beijing landlord's decision to evict a cancer-stricken tenant has sparked outrage on social media. Wang, who rented the apartment for its proximity to hospital care, was told to leave due to concerns that her death would decrease the property's value,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3278580/china-landlord-tries-evict-terminal-cancer-tenant-fearing-death-could-reduce-property-value">South China Morning Post</a>&nbsp;</em>reported.&nbsp;The landlord, Zhang, explained that he had rented out the flat below market value, charging 5,500 yuan (around US$770) per month, as he was in the process of trying to sell the property.</p>

<p>As per their lease agreement, Wang and her husband facilitated property viewings for potential buyers, with their contract set to expire in mid-November. However, on September 4, Zhang abruptly posted a notice demanding their eviction within a week.</p>

<p>Zhang claimed his decision was prompted by noticing Wang's baldness during a viewing, leading him to inquire about her health. Upon learning of her terminal cancer diagnosis, Zhang cited concerns that her death on the property would stigmatise it as a "haunted house," potentially decreasing its value by 500,000 to one million yuan (US$70,000 to US$140,000).</p>

<p>He then requested the couple sign an agreement to compensate him for any resulting market value decrease. However, Wang and her husband refused, insisting they wouldn't vacate without compensation for terminating the lease, a request that Zhang declined.&nbsp;As of now, the dispute remains unresolved, with Zhang and the couple holding fast to their respective positions.</p>

<p>The landlord's insensitive act has left people on social media outraged, with many condemning his prioritisation of property value over human life. One user wrote, ''It is too much for the landlord to behave like this. He is inhumane.''</p>

<p>However, some also empathised with the landlord. Another user reasoned, ''I understand the landlord's frustration. Selling a property plagued by issues is challenging, but he should provide compensation for breaching the leasing contract.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raffaele Fitto, a member of Italy's hard-right ruling party, was named to a top post in the next European Commission today, in a controversial move that has riled centrist and leftist groups.</p>

<p>EU chief Ursula von der Leyen put Fitto forward as one of six executive vice presidents who will serve as her key lieutenants in the European Union's executive body.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old will be in charge of "cohesion and reforms" she said, adding the choice reflected Italy's importance within the 27-country bloc.</p>

<p>"He will be responsible for the portfolio dealing with cohesion policy, regional development and cities," von der Leyen told a press conference in Strasbourg. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Seen as a nod to gains made by far-right parties in the June European elections, the appointment was hailed by Rome as proof of its influence within the EU. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"(It's) an important recognition that confirms the newfound central role of our nation in the EU. Italy is finally back as a protagonist in Europe," Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni wrote on X. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently Italy's European affairs minister, Fitto knows Brussels well and is widely considered one of the more moderate faces of Meloni's government.</p>

<p>But as a member of her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party -- which once called for Rome to leave the eurozone -- his selection for such a powerful post has ruffled feathers among EU lawmakers.</p>

<p>David Cormand of the Greens said it represented the "normalisation of the extreme right in European institutions".</p>

<p>And Iratxe Garcia Perez, the head of the Socialists and Democrats group, said Fitto will have to prove his commitment to European values during what is likely to be a stormy confirmation hearing before parliament.</p>

<p>The French centrist Valerie Hayer had called the prospect of Fitto's appointment "untenable" -- though she struck a more pragmatic tone on Tuesday, vowing to be "extremely vigilant" on his commitment to European values.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen was re-elected for a second term with votes from the centre and the left, as well as her centre-right European People's Party, the largest group in the EU parliament.</p>

<p>But she was snubbed by Meloni's hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists group.</p>

<p>"Italy is a very important country and one of our founding members, and this has to reflect in the choice," von der Leyen said of Fitto's nomination.</p>

<p>Fitto was elected three times to the European Parliament before joining Meloni's administration in 2022, charged with managing Italy's share of the EU's vast post-Covid recovery plan.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The centuries-old temples of Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat played host to a parade of Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and Lamborghinis today, although drivers were banned from revving their supercharged engines.</p>

<p>The event was intended to promote the environmentally sensitive UNESCO-listed World Heritage site, where the ruins of the Khmer empire's greatest monuments are surrounded by lush forests and giant trees. Angkor Wat is the world's largest temple complex.</p>

<p>Tourism is vital to the Southeast Asian country and received around 6.6 million visitors a year before the Covid-19 pandemic, when numbers nosedived to below 200,000 in 2021.</p>

<p>Visitors rebounded to nearly 5.5 million last year, netting more than $3 billion in revenue, but remained below pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>Asked about the apparently incongruous nature of the occasion, Cambodia's tourism minister Sok Soken told AFP that strict guidelines had been imposed, with engine-revving banned "in terms of disrespect to our heritage here".</p>

<p>He spoke a few metres away from a Bugatti Chiron, some models of which reportedly have list prices of more than $3 million.</p>

<p>"The display of cars is an art of technology, an inclusion of technology and a modern way of travelling," he said, adding Cambodia "will be ready to provide hospitality to all forms of travellers".</p>

<p>An attempt by organisers Gumball 3000, a British lifestyle brand, to set a record for the number of supercars and hypercars at a World Heritage site fell short.</p>

<p>However, the vehicles saw high traffic from locals and tourists taking pictures and selfies.</p>

<p>"This is the first time I have seen such modern cars at Angkor Wat," said university student Kuy Tola, 19. "It is amazing."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A public hearing has started to investigate the Titan submersible's catastrophic failure during its Titanic wreck expedition, which claimed five lives. The Titan Marine Board of Investigation is hearing testimonies from 24 witnesses, including 10 former Oceangate employees. At the South Carolina hearing, an animated recreation of the Titan's ill-fated journey was presented, revealing the crew's final messages, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/titan-sub-submersible-last-message-bodies-implosion-hearing-b2614007.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Independent</a></em> reported. A chilling 3-word text, "all good here," appeared on screen, sent just moments before the submersible's catastrophic implosion.</p>

<p>The recreation showed the Titan crew's communication with the support vessel, Polar Prince, which had requested improved communication after a brief loss of contact. The Polar Prince then asked the Titan crew if they could still see the support vessel on their onboard display. The crew responded with reassurance: "yes" and, "all good here'' – their last transmission.</p>

<p>At the hearing, The US Coast Guard also presented a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/rawsalerts/status/1835799379132694670/photo/1">haunting image of the OceanGate Titan</a> submersible's tail cone, lying intact yet abandoned on the ocean floor at 12,500 feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the hearing, Tony Nissen, ex-engineering director at OceanGate, also testified that he had raised safety concerns about the submersible during his tenure. Mr Nissen claimed that he refused to approve a 2019 dive into the Titanic wreck due to hull concerns, which led to his termination later that year.&nbsp;He noted that the Titan was struck by lightning during a test mission in 2018, and that might have compromised its hull. When questioned about internal pressure to deploy the Titan, his response was "100%."</p>

<p>According to investigators, the Titan submersible was plagued by numerous problems during previous expeditions, including 70 equipment issues reported in 2021 and 48 more in 2022.</p>

<p>The Titan submersible tragedy on June 18, 2023, claimed the lives of five individuals, including renowned British adventurer Hamish Harding, father-son duo Shahzada and Suleman Dawood, French national Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and Stockton Rush, CEO of OceanGate Expeditions.</p>

<p>The two-week hearing into the catastrophe will feature evidence as to what went wrong and whether physical or design failure contributed to the accident, which garnered worldwide attention, as per AFP.</p>

<p>''There are no words to ease the loss endured by the families impacted by this tragic incident.&nbsp;But we hope that this hearing will help shed light on the cause of the tragedy and prevent anything like this from happening again,''&nbsp;said Jason Neubauer of the Coast Guard Office of Investigations, who led the hearing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>17-year-old Emily Gold, a talented dancer and cheerleader from California, who competed with her Los Osos High School dance team on the latest season of '<em>America's Got Talent'</em>,&nbsp;died by suicide. Her body was found under an overpass in Rancho Cucamonga around midnight on Friday.&nbsp;The high school dancer and cheerleader died by suicide on September 13 at 11.52 pm, the San Bernardino Coroner's Office confirmed to&nbsp;<em><a data-link-type="article-inline" href="https://people.com/americas-got-talent-contestant-emily-gold-dies-from-suicide-after-standing-ovation-8713499" rel="noopener" target="_blank">People.</a></em></p>

<p>California Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Rodrigo Jimenez said: "When the officers arrived, they located a female, 17 year old, who was struck by at least one other vehicle in the carpool lane on eastbound 210.''</p>

<p>Her untimely death comes just one month after Ms Gold and her dance team had captivated the audience on America's Got Talent, advancing to the quarterfinals.

<p>Her sudden death has sparked an outpouring of support and condolences from fans, fellow performers, and loved ones.</p>

<p>“It is with such heavy heart that we share the passing of our beautiful, kind and loving Emily Gold, Senior and Varsity Dance Captain.

<p>The situation around the Ukraine conflict is becoming more complicated. The US is in an election mode, and that means that any step that might disadvantage the Democratic presidential candidate cannot be taken. After supporting a proxy war in Ukraine against Russia all this while, any step to de-escalate or open the doors to negotiation would be almost impossible politically.</p>

<p>The choice is between escalating or avoiding any serious new escalatory step. It is here that the discussion over allowing Zelenskyy to use NATO-supplied long-range missiles to strike deep into Russian territory comes in. Ukraine is already striking deep into Russia with drones and has also launched a land invasion of Russia in Kursk. But for Russia, it will mean a major escalation by NATO if the UK-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles were used against Russia itself, although they have been used against Ukrainian territories that Russia has annexed. Russia has in practice accepted that distinction and not raised the stakes as President Vladimir Putin has now done.</p>

<h2><strong>UK Determined To Escalate</strong></h2>

<p>The Russian president has warned that such a move will mean NATO entering into a direct conflict with Russia as these missiles cannot be launched without guidance by US satellites and, indeed, by NATO crews on the ground in Ukraine, as the Ukrainian military would not know how to prime them technically for targeting. Putin has declared that Russia will take appropriate steps to counter this escalation. What this could mean is a matter of speculation as Russia could have options below the nuclear threshold.</p>

<p>The UK, as usual, is determined to escalate the conflict. Five of its ex-Defence Secretaries want Ukraine to be given permission to use long-range weapons even without the US's approval. The UK's deep-seated hostility towards Russia seems almost compulsive. Its excessive warmongering could also be to both push the US to escalate while also acting as a willing front for the US to make the latter look more "responsible". The US, which is ultimately responsible for managing the consequences of escalation, and not Europe, seems hesitant to allow the use of its long-range missiles to strike deep into Russia but seems prepared to clear the use of British and French missiles. The fiction would be that the US would not be directly involved, though when Putin refers to NATO being involved - as these missiles need NATO technical support for launching them - he is implicating the US too.</p>

<h2><strong>The Western Narrative On Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>Zelenskyy's strategy seems to be to drag NATO more and more into the conflict, no matter what the eventual cost is for Ukraine or for Europe, as the survival of his own regime is involved. The Western narrative on Ukraine is simple: Russia has violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a smaller European country; the attack is unprovoked and violates the international order; if Russia were to succeed it would next threaten Western Europe; Russia cannot be allowed to win, and therefore Ukraine has to be supported. Zelenskyy has exploited this simplistic narrative to seek more and more arms from the West, claiming that it is not merely a Ukrainian fight but a European one. He is now intending to go to the US to discuss his "victory plan" with Biden.</p>

<p>The US and Europe openly seek to use this conflict to impose a strategic defeat on Russia, and if that looks increasingly unlikely despite imposing draconian sanctions, then to, at least, continue to bleed and weaken Russia by prolonging the proxy war against it. This was the sense of the joint Op-Ed in Financial Times by the US and UK intelligence chiefs, which stressed it was vital to continue supporting Ukraine, with the CIA chief also seeing virtue in Ukraine's land attack against Russia in Kursk. The US Secretary of State and the UK Foreign Secretary also jointly visited Kyiv very recently and announced more financial aid to Ukraine.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Options</strong></h2>

<p>It is in this background that India is seeking to play some role to nudge the two sides towards a negotiated solution to the conflict. India has not been deterred from taking this initiative despite the complexity of the issue, the seemingly irreconcilable position of the two sides on some fundamental points, and the fact that any peace effort with Russia and Ukraine cannot move forward without the US. We have not announced contact with the US on this subject.</p>

<p>Actually, Europe will have to be involved too if India wants to play a substantive role.</p>

<p>That Modi will discuss India's initiative with Biden when he goes to the US this month is likely, now that he knows Putin's mind after his own talks with him and the feedback he has got from National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. But Biden can hardly modify its position in favour of dialogue and diplomacy with the US presidential election in the offing when all along the choice has been to wage a proxy war against Russia for larger geopolitical reasons that go beyond Ukraine.</p>

<p>The rhetoric against Russia has gone up, with accusations against the Russian spread of disinformation in the US and globally, and the effort to seek a worldwide ban on <em>RT</em> and related Russian media for intelligence activities, etc. With German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting India shortly, Modi will have a chance to discuss his peace initiative with him too.</p>

<h2><strong>Doval's Visit</strong></h2>

<p>India has raised its peacemaking profile by Modi sending Doval to St Petersburg to personally brief Putin on the talk the Prime Minister had with Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Despite the controversial comments made by Zelenskyy to the Indian press on India's purchase of Russian oil, calling on India to join the communiqu&amp;#233; issued after the first summit in Switzerland if it wanted to hold a peace summit, and differing perspectives on the agenda of the next peace summit that came out in External Affairs Minister Jaishankar's press briefing in Kyiv, enough of substance seems to have emerged from the private talks with Zelenskyy to warrant a personal briefing to Putin. Is it that the Ukrainian position in private is less rigid on substantive issues than its public enunciation? By accepting to receive Doval in an unprecedented gesture, Putin is endorsing India's peace efforts, though it is difficult to imagine that he would resign from his core position on territory and NATO membership of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Judging from what the Ukrainian ambassador to India said subsequently to the press here on India's peace efforts, it appears that Ukraine continues to aggressively define its position. The ambassador was out of line in asking India to convince Moscow to join peace talks, linking the legitimacy of India's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council to taking a position of its own on global issues and not simply conveying messages from one side to the other and being a courier or messenger or a post box. He reiterated Zelenskyy's position that the condition for India to hold the next peace summit would be to join the Burgenstock communique</p>

<p>All in all, it is difficult to judge the dynamics of the peace initiative India has taken as the hurdles to peace are all too apparent at present.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"I am a rapist," a 71-year-old Frenchman accused of drugging his wife so he and scores of strangers could assault her told a court Tuesday, returning to the dock after being ill for around a week.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot used a cane as he slowly entered the courtroom in the southern city of Avignon, before sitting on a blue armchair to give him enough comfort to take part in the hearings.</p>

<p>"I am a rapist, like the others in this room," Pelicot said, referring to the 50 other defendants in the mass trial -- men he allegedly recruited online to rape his then-wife Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>"They all knew" that he was inviting them to rape her, he said.</p>

<p>But he added: "She did not deserve this."</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot is accused of administering anti-anxiety drugs to Gisele over a period of almost a decade, from 2011 to 2020.</p>

<p>While she was unconscious, he would rape her and recruit dozens of other men he met online to do the same.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot has admitted the charges, but Tuesday is the first time he has spoken at any length since the trial began on September 2.</p>

<p>The court may also hear more from Gisele Pelicot, who was present in the courtroom alongside Dominique's brother Joel.</p>

<p>Beatrice Zavarro, the defendant's lawyer, told AFP on Monday that he was suffering from "a clot in the bladder" and the beginning of a kidney infection.</p>

<p>But a medical exam ordered by the presiding judge found that he was in a fit state to appear in court, avoiding a delay of weeks or even months to the hearings.</p>

<p>Adjustments would be made to the "sequencing of the hearings" and Dominique Pelicot would get "regular rest", Zavarro said, adding that the health complaints were not an attempt by her client to escape justice.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot's testimony will be decisive for the 50 other men aged 26 to 74 on trial, four of whose cases are set to be heard in the coming days.</p>

<p>Some of the accused have admitted that he told them he was drugging his then-wife, while others claim they believed they were participating in a swinger couple's fantasy.</p>

<p>The case has prompted outrage across France, with thousands demonstrating in cities at the weekend to demand an end to rape and support Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>She requested that the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>"Thanks to you I have the strength to see this fight through to the end," Gisele told demonstrators Monday.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump hits the campaign trail again on Tuesday, travelling to Michigan two days after an apparent assassination attempt against him was foiled at his golf course in Florida.</p>

<p>His Democratic rival Kamala Harris will also be campaigning, as she heads to the key battleground state of Pennsylvania for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ).</p>

<p>That event and another interview with Hispanic media, recorded Monday and set to air Tuesday, will be the first time Harris will have an opportunity to react in person to the apparent bid on Trump's life.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee and ex-president was whisked away by the Secret Service after a gunman was discovered on his golf course in Florida on Sunday, in the second such close call for Trump in as many months.</p>

<p>As security officials said they believed the suspect acted alone, Trump sought to blame Harris and President Joe Biden for the scare, citing what he called their rhetoric about him endangering democracy.</p>

<p>Trump's politicization of the incident -- even as he, on the campaign trail, paints Harris as an "evil" radical turning America into a "failing nation" -- has further stoked tensions ahead of the presidential election in seven weeks.</p>

<p>Both Biden and Harris have issued statements denouncing the apparent assassination bid, with Harris saying "violence has no place in America."</p>

<p>But Trump has claimed that rhetoric from Biden and Harris "is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country."</p>

<h3><strong>'Turned Black'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The duelling visits of Trump in Michigan and Harris in Pennsylvania come as both candidates focus on the half-dozen swing states most important to win in the country's Electoral College system.</p>

<p>A new poll from Suffolk University and USA Today shows Harris with a slight edge over Trump in Pennsylvania -- 49 per cent to 46 per cent -- thanks in large part to major support from women voters.</p>

<p>Still, her advantage in that poll remains within the margin of error -- and the election at-large remains close.</p>

<p>This year's particularly bitter presidential campaign has seen not just the two assassination attempts against Trump but also bomb threats against an Ohio town's immigrant community and a fringe party urging Harris's murder.</p>

<p>Trump previously had a close call with a would-be assassin when he was slightly wounded in an attack during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>When Harris arrives for her interview with the NABJ, however, another Trump moment is also likely to come up.</p>

<p>It was when Trump spoke with the professional association in July that he said Harris, who has an Indian mother and Jamaican father, "happened to turn Black," in remarks claiming that she opted to highlight one of her dual racial identities for political gain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to our experience of the internet, “the times, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin%27_(song)">they are a-changin'</a>”, as Bob Dylan would say. You can't quite recall how, but the internet certainly feels different these days.</p>

<p>To some, it is “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/16/1224878097/everyday-users-are-complaining-that-the-internet-is-more-chaotic-than-ever">less fun and less informative</a>” than it used to be. To others, online searches are made up of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization?src=longreads">cookie cutter</a>” pages that drown out useful information and are saturated with scams, spam and content generated by artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>Your social media feeds are full of eye-catching, provocative, hyper-targeted, or anger-inducing content, from <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-dead-internet-theory-makes-eerie-claims-about-an-ai-run-web-the-truth-is-more-sinister-229609">bizarre AI-generated imagery</a> to robot-like comments. You're lucky if your video feeds are not solely made up of exhortations to “subscribe”.</p>

<p>How did we get here? And can we claw our way back?</p>

<h3><strong>Commercial interests rule</strong></h3>

<p>One major factor contributing to the current state of the internet is its over-commercialisation: financial motives drive much of the content. This has arguably led to the prevalence of sensationalism, prioritising virality over information quality.</p>

<p>Covert and deceptive advertising is widespread, blurring the line between commercial and non-commercial content to attract more attention and engagement.</p>

<p>Another driving force is the dominance of tech giants like Google, Meta and Amazon. They reach billions worldwide and wield immense power over the content we consume.</p>

<p>Their platforms use advanced tracking technologies and opaque algorithms to generate hyper-targeted media content, powered by extensive user data. This creates <a href="https://www.campaignasia.com/article/the-echo-chamber-effect-how-algorithms-shape-our-worldview/491762">filter bubbles</a>, where users are exposed to limited content that reinforces their existing beliefs and biases, and <a href="https://philarchive.org/archive/NGUECA">echo chambers</a> where other viewpoints are actively discredited.</p>

<p>Bad actors like <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ai-fuel-financial-scams-online-industry-experts/story?id=103732051">cyber criminals and scammers</a> have been an enduring problem online. However, evolving technology like generative AI has further empowered them, enabling them to create highly realistic fake images, deepfake videos and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/the-terrifying-ai-scam-that-uses-your-loved-ones-voice">voice cloning</a>.</p>

<p>AI's ability to automate content creation has also flooded the internet with low-quality, misleading and harmful material at an unprecedented scale.</p>

<p>In sum, the accelerated commercialisation of the internet, the dominance of media tech giants and the presence of bad actors have infiltrated content on the internet. The rise of AI further intensifies this, making the internet more chaotic than ever.</p>

<h3><strong>Some of the ‘good' internet remains</strong></h3>

<p>So, what was the “good internet” some of us long for with nostalgia?</p>

<p>At the outset, the internet was meant to be a free egalitarian space where people were meant to “surf” and “browse”. Knowledge was meant to be shared: sites such as Wikipedia and The Internet Archive are continuing bastions of knowledge.</p>

<p>Before the advent of filter bubbles, the internet was a creative playground where people explored different ideas, discussed varying perspectives, and collaborated with individuals from “outgroups” – those outside their social circles who may hold opposing views.</p>

<p>Early social media platforms were built on the ethos of reconnecting with long-lost classmates and family members. Many of us have community groups, acquaintances and family we reach out to via the internet. The “connection” aspect of the internet remains as important as ever – as we all saw during the COVID pandemic.</p>

<p>What else do we want to preserve? Privacy. A New Yorker cartoon joke in 1993 stated that “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051029045942/http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html">on the internet, nobody knows you're a dog</a>”. Now everyone – especially advertisers – wants to know who you are. To quote the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-privacy">Office of the Australian Information Commissioner</a>, one of the tenets of privacy is “to be able to control who can see or use information about you”.</p>

<p>At the very least, we want to control what big tech knows about us, especially if they could stand to profit from it.</p>

<h3><strong>Can we ever go back?</strong></h3>

<p>We can't control “a-changin'” times, but we can keep as much of the good parts as we can.</p>

<p>For starters, we can vote with our feet. Users can enact change and bring awareness to problems on existing platforms. In recent times, we have seen this with the <a href="https://theconversation.com/thinking-of-breaking-up-with-twitter-heres-the-right-way-to-do-it-195002">exodus of users</a> from X (formerly Twitter) to other platforms, and the <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/26/why-reddit-users-are-protesting-against-the-sites-leadership">platform-wide protest against Reddit</a> for changing its third-party data access policies.</p>

<p>However, voting with our feet is only possible when there's competition. In the case of X, various other platforms – from Mastodon to Threads to Bluesky – enable users to pick one that aligns with their preferences, values and social circles. Search engines have alternatives, too, such as DuckDuckGo or Ecosia.</p>

<p>However, competition can only be created by moving to decentralised systems and removing monopolies. This actually happened in the early days of the internet during the 1990s “<a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/browser-wars/">browser wars</a>”, when Microsoft was eventually accused of illegally monopolising the web browser market in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">a landmark court case</a>.</p>

<p>As users of technology, all of us must remain vigilant about threats to our privacy and knowledge. With cheap and ubiquitous generative AI, misleading content and scams are more realistic than ever.</p>

<p>We must exercise a healthy scepticism and ensure those most at risk from online threats – such as children and older people – are educated about potential harms.</p>

<p>Remember, the internet is not optimised for your best interests. It's up to you to decide how much power you give to the tech giants who are fuelling theirs.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 11-year-old boy in the US who allegedly bragged about his massive cache of weapons and plans to execute a "kill list" at two different schools has been arrested. In a Facebook post on Monday, Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said that deputies seized a bunch of airsoft rifles, pistols and fake ammunition along with knives, swords and other weapons after the 11-year-old, identified as Carlo "Kingston" Dorelli, showed a video of his armoury to classmates and threatened violence. "He had written a list of names and targets. He says it was all a joke," Mr Chitwood wrote.</p>

<p>For his actions, the sheriff slapped the 11-year-old with a felony charge for a written threat of mass shooting. The sheriff's department shared a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1680665272501726">video </a>of officers leading the boy into the jailhouse with handcuffs on his wrists and ankles. It also shared his mugshot along with a photo of replica rifles, samurai swords and throwing stars displayed on a table, drug-bust style.</p>

<p>"I can and will release the names and photos of juveniles who are committing these felonies, threatening our students, disrupting our schools and consuming law enforcement resources," Mr Chitwood wrote on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Take a look at the post below:</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/us-news/florida-boy-11-had-school-shooting-kill-list-and-arsenal-sheriff-says/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>, Dorelli's arrest comes days after the Sheriff vowed to "perp-walk" kids who make prank threats amid a flood of bogus tips in the wake of the deadly shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia that left four dead.</p>

<p>"Every time we make an arrest, your kid's photo is going to be put out there...We're gonna come and get you. We're going to put you out for public embarrassment." Mr Chitwood said in a press conference last week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, a 14-year-old boy has been charged with shooting four people dead at Apalachee High School in the southern state of Georgia earlier this month. This incident prompted US President Joe Biden to call for a complete ban on assault weapons.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event, Mr Biden said, "I'd like to say a few words about the school shooting yesterday. As a nation, we cannot continue to accept the carnage of gun violence. I'm a gun owner. I believe strongly in the amendment. We need more than thoughts and prayers," <em>CNN </em>quoted the president as saying.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[There is a long-standing belief that downing water after a night of heavy drinking can save you from a hangover. However, new research suggests that this popular remedy doesn't quite live up to its hype.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">There is a long-standing belief that downing water after a night of heavy drinking can save you from a hangover. However, new research suggests that this popular remedy doesn't quite live up to its hype.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Researchers from Utrecht University in the Netherlands analysed data from three studies and found that dehydration is only part of the hangover story, and drinking water has minimal effect on symptoms like nausea, headaches and fatigue.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741832924001009?via%3Dihub ">The research</a> sought to better understand the relationship between dehydration and the symptoms of a hangover. Participants were divided into two groups: those who drank water before going to sleep after drinking, and those who did not. Surprisingly, both groups experienced similar levels of pain, nausea and exhaustion the next morning. While those who hydrated reported feeling less thirsty, they still suffered from the same degree of hangover misery.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr Joris Verster, lead author of the study, explained that dehydration is not the primary cause of hangover symptoms. “The more you drink, the more likely you are to get a hangover. Drinking water may help against thirst and a dry mouth, but it will not take away the misery, the headache and the nausea,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The findings indicate that consuming water, whether during or after drinking, does little to prevent or alleviate the effects of a hangover. Once the hangover has set in, gulping down water doesn't reduce its intensity.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the research, dehydration from alcohol consumption occurs because alcohol activates the hormone system responsible for regulating blood pressure, fluid, and electrolyte balance. This hormonal activation leads to the loss of water and electrolytes, which causes the common symptom of thirst the next day.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, studies show that thirst and dehydration are relatively short-lived in comparison to the other hallmark hangover symptoms caused by "oxidative stress" and the body's inflammatory response to alcohol.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The body's inflammatory reaction to alcohol causes significant discomfort, while oxidative stress – an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants – contributes to headaches and other symptoms. As a result, simply drinking water won't combat these underlying causes of hangovers.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Evidence and scientific studies also agree that hangovers tend to get worse with age. As we age, our liver function declines, reducing its efficiency in metabolising alcohol, research reveals. At the same time, the body's water content decreases, and we lose muscle mass, which leads to a higher concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The study underlined that there is currently no scientifically proven, commercially available treatment for hangovers. For those looking for relief, the only sure fire way to avoid a hangover is to drink less or abstain from alcohol entirely.</p>]]></content:encoded>

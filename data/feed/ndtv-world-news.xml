       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris questioned Donald Trump's fitness for office Friday as the oldest major-party White House candidate in history faced speculation that he is "exhausted" after backing out of a spate of interviews.</p>

<p>While he has been appearing on friendly TV networks, the 78-year-old Republican has cancelled sitdowns with media outlets including NBC, CNBC and CBS. He has also refused a second debate with Harris, after being soundly bested in the first.</p>

<p>Politico reported that a Trump aide had told producers at a website negotiating an interview that the ex-president was "exhausted" and refusing some appearances -- a claim described by his campaign as "detached from reality."</p>

<p>But Harris, who turns 60 this weekend, hammered Trump over his health and resilience.</p>

<p>"If you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether you are fit for the toughest job in the world," Harris told supporters during a day of multiple stops across the swing state of Michigan.</p>

<p>The former president has hardly been idle, pursuing a busy schedule of appearances with new and traditional media, but most have been on outlets where he is rarely challenged.</p>

<p>Trump reacted angrily to Harris's jab, telling reporters that he had canceled nothing and calling his Democratic opponent a "loser" who "doesn't have the energy of a rabbit."</p>

<p><strong>Dueling rallies</strong></p>

<p>He also claimed to be "killing" her in the polls and that she did not pass the bar exam.</p>

<p>Harris -- a former California attorney general who passed the bar exam in 1990 -- has a narrow lead in national polling averages, while numerous October surveys in Michigan show them neck and neck.</p>

<p>Trump has surprised analysts with a program that mixes swing state stops with appearances in regions he has no chance of winning, but where he is guaranteed big crowds.</p>

<p>He was in the liberal stronghold of New York for a Catholic charity dinner on Thursday, where he mocked Harris in an occasionally mean-spirited speech that earned gasps for its off-color remarks and profanity.</p>

<p>But he was back on home turf Friday morning for a soft Fox News interview, before heading to Michigan for counterprogramming against Harris.</p>

<p>Both candidates are spending their final campaign days in pivotal battleground states where early voting is already underway.</p>

<p>With less than three weeks to go, Harris has seen encouraging signs in her push for supporters to vote as soon as possible, as a bulwark against the traditional Republican edge among Election Day voters.</p>

<p>Almost 12 million votes had been cast by Friday evening -- around a third of them in the seven swing states expected to decide the election -- according to data tracked by the University of Florida Election Lab.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Early voting surge</strong></p>

<p>Georgia has been smashing records, while North Carolina reported a first day of voting Thursday that beat 2020, when there was a pandemic-linked surge of early ballots.</p>

<p>Where party breakdowns were available, registered Democrats accounted for roughly half of the total, while Republicans -- who have spent much of the Trump era casting aspersions over drop boxes and mailed ballots -- were responsible for around a third.</p>

<p>After her event in Grand Rapids, Harris targeted blue-collar voters with remarks at a union hall in Lansing, giving a more manufacturing-focused speech in which she argued that the future of the labor movement was "on the line" in November's election.</p>

<p>She was set to hold an evening rally in Oakland County before returning to Detroit on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Democrat has found herself on eggshells as she upholds President Joe Biden's support for key ally Israel, while Muslim and Arab American voters -- particularly in Michigan -- have voiced outrage over the death toll in Gaza.</p>

<p>The killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar drew optimism from Harris for a Gaza ceasefire, but Israel quickly said his death is not the end of the campaign launched in response to the militant group's October 7, 2023 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to journalists ahead of a speech in Detroit, Trump said Sinwar's death had increased the likelihood of a peaceful solution to the war in Gaza -- while warning Biden not to try to restrain Israel.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beaches in Sydney re-opened on Saturday for swimmers after authorities cleared thousands of black pollution balls washed ashore, which testing found to be formed from chemicals similar to those in cosmetics and cleaning products.</p>

<p>Around 2,000 of the mystery black balls, some golf ball-sized, had washed onto beaches across Sydney since Tuesday, forcing the closure of eight beaches, including the iconic Bondi Beach, and a massive clean-up operation, amid fears they were highly toxic.</p>

<p>"Based on advice from the Environment Protection Authority, we can now confirm the balls are made up of fatty acids, chemicals consistent with those found in cleaning and cosmetic products, mixed with some fuel oil," said New South Wales Maritime Executive Director Mark Hutchings in a statement.</p>

<p>He added the balls, which continued to appear on Friday in fewer numbers, are not harmful to health when left on the sand, but should not be touched.</p>

<p>The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority said laboratory testing was continuing, to try to determine where the balls came from.</p>

<p>"It is still somewhat of a mystery and may take a few more days to determine origin," said EPA Executive Director Stephen Beaman.</p>

<p>Sydney's ocean beaches, famed for golden sand and clean water, draw tourists from around the globe.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine exporter, set a new record last year for production of the drug and cultivation of the coca leaf it is made from, a United Nations report said Friday.</p>

<p>Coca leaf cultivation was 10 percent higher last year than in 2022, while cocaine production rose 53 percent from 1,738 tonnes to 2,600, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p>

<p>These were the highest numbers since the UN started monitoring in 2001. Most Colombian cocaine is destined for the United States and Europe.</p>

<p>Coca leaf production now spreads over 253,000 hectares (625,100 acres) in the country.</p>

<p>The trend has been upward since 2014 despite a US-based war on drugs worth millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The areas of Colombia with the biggest increase in 2023 were the Cauca and Narino departments, both bastions of dissidents groups of the FARC guerrilla army that disbanded in 2017.</p>

<p>Some 20 percent of the total area under coca cultivation in Colombia is on land belonging to communities of African descent, 10 percent on Indigenous reserves and 18 percent in protected forest areas.</p>

<p>The Colombian city of Cali will host the COP16 global summit on biodiversity for two weeks starting Monday.</p>

<p>Colombia's first-ever leftist President Gustavo Petro has accused US anti-drug policies of causing a "genocide" of Latin Americans for focusing on "repression" rather than prevention and public health.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[China's government has been going ahead with its religious persecution without impunity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's government has been going ahead with its religious persecution without impunity. In its latest salvo, they have clamped down on all churches - Catholic and Protestant - in the country by ordering the pulling out of images of Jesus and his replacement with images of President Xi Jinping, according to a US government report on anti-religious activities in China.</p>

<p>In the continuing saga of 'Sinicization', China has pushed to align all religions or shape all religions to adapt to the doctrines of the CCP (Communist Party of China) and the customs of the majority Han Chinese population.</p>

<p>Since President Xi Jinping came to power in March 2013, authorities have insisted on adhering to Communist Party values like speaking only in Mandarin Chinese and rejecting all foreign influence that may endanger China's unity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Sinicization?</strong></p>

<p>Sinicization is the procedure in which non-Chinese groups or societies are integrated into Chinese culture. The process includes the adoption of Chinese language, culture, ethnic identity and societal norms.</p>

<p>Sinicization is also a part of the Chinese government's policy of subordinating religious groups to the Communist Party of China's (CCP) political agenda. The policy of Sinicization has been started under the leadership of Xi Jinping and has transformed China's religious landscape. Some of the government-introduced actions include:</p>

<p>1)Placing CCP supporters as religious leaders</p>

<p>2)Changing the designs of religious places like mosques, churches etc with CCP-approved architecture</p>

<p>3) Mixing CCP publicity into religious doctrines</p>

<p>4) Outlawing non-CCP-backed religious activities</p>

<p>China is officially an atheist country but it recognises five religions: Buddhism, Catholicism, Daoism, Islam, and Protestantism. The practice of any other faith is formally prohibited.</p>

<p>While the Chinese constitution (Article 36) mentions that citizens 'enjoy the freedom of religious belief' and bars discrimination based on religion, the law controls religion by preventing state organs, public organisations etc. It dissuades citizens from following any faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The anti-religion campaign initiated by President Xi has the backing of all state-controlled religious organisations.</p>

<p>There is also a feeling that homegrown religions like Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism do not challenge the CCP's rule but others do.</p>

<p><strong>Why does China fear Buddhists and Christians?</strong></p>

<p>The Tibetan Buddhists staying in China's Tibetan region have faced high levels of religious persecution. Chinese authorities keep a firm eye on the daily operations of their major monasteries. Despite China's strict vigilance, reports of detainments and torture of monks and nuns for refusing to denounce the Dalai Lama often surface. Followers of the Dalai Lama too have been ordered to replace his photos with those of the Chinese leaders. China fears 'outside influence' from the exiled Dalai Lama.</p>

<p>As per the US government report made public recently, "The government has ordered the removal of crosses from churches, replaced images of Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary with pictures of President Xi, required the display of CCP slogans at the entrances of churches, censored religious texts, imposed CCP-approved religious materials, and instructed clergy to preach CCP ideology."</p>

<p>The Vatican can't take up the issue of repression of Catholics estimated to be around 10 to 12 million, since it does not have diplomatic ties with China.</p>

<p>The Vatican's recognition of Taiwan and a dispute over the bishop appointment process in China have been the reasons for the dispute. Of late, both countries have come to a sort of agreement whereby the Pope has recognised several Chinese state-appointed bishops.</p>

<p>As of now, Christians have rejected the government-controlled churches completely and instead are worshipping independently.</p>

<p><strong>How China targeted Muslims? &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Muslims form around 1 to 1.5% of China's population. Reports of China's genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang have been circulated for years now.</p>

<p>According to China's 2020 census, there are more than 11 million Uyghurs in this region. The Uyghurs were brutalised because they spoke their language, similar to Turkish, and considered themselves culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian countries.</p>

<p>More than one million Uyghurs have been held captive over the past few years in a large network of what China calls its 're-education camps', and sentenced hundreds of thousands to prison terms. There has been mass sterilisation to control the Uyghur population and thousands have been enlisted to work as forced labourers in farms and factories put up by China. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Authorities have banned their religious practices in the region and made mosques and tombs non-operational. Despite the hue and cry from human rights groups and the world at large, China's atrocities on Uyghurs didn't cease.</p>

<p>Till very late, Hui Muslims had been lucky to avoid the tight control of the Chinese government as the latter's focus remained on the Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region.</p>

<p>In 2020-21, China targeted the Hui Muslim community by removing the domes and minarets from thousands of mosques across the country. The Chinese authorities then, like now, felt that the domes are signs of foreign Saudi and Arabic religious influence. They demolished domes as they were symbolic of Islamic architecture - and were not Chinese in origin. This was part of an ongoing push to Sinicize Muslims to make them traditionally Chinese. As part of the process, mosques were closed and the mosque properties were acquired by the government, and imams were arrested.</p>

<p><strong>Reactions from the world</strong></p>

<p>Of course, China has repeatedly denied all allegations and continues to rubbish charges that it is carrying out oppression of the Uyghur population and other minorities. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The US and Western nations have called out China several times. They presented a draft resolution to request a discussion in the UN Human Rights Council about the Xinjiang report in October 2022. The draft resolution failed by a slim margin of two votes. But many countries have been silent on the issue.</p>

<p>India and ten other nations abstained from voting in the UN against China over the human rights situation in the Xinjiang region.</p>

<p>However, officially India took a stand that the community's human rights should be "respected". Amidst border issues, India has been treading cautiously on geo-political issues with China on international forums.</p>

<p>The response of many countries on the Uyghur issue has been based on political calculations on how they have aligned with China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in an armour-infantry assault in southern Gaza's Rafah. Israel's 828th Brigade conducted "intelligence-based targeted raids and operations," the Israel Defence Forces said, giving details of the damage assessment, where they found assault rifles and snipers in the hideout and Sinwar's body.</p>

<p>The IDF also shared a video of a tank firing at the Hamas leader's hideout in Rafah. The drone footage shows a building - circled in red - is the target. IDF claims that it is the building in which Yahya Sinwar barricaded himself.</p>

<p>The tank fires a round, destroying the structure, which was already in ruins. The troops then moved in for damage assessment and found AK assault rifles, an SVD Dragunov sniper rifle, magazines, and live ammunition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another video, the ground troops are seen operating in the area where Yahya Sinwar was eliminated. After the "success" of the operation MG Yaron Finkelman, Commanding Officer of the Southern Command, Israel Army, addressed the troops and said, "The perseverance, patience and terrain analysis...and the initiation of contact and you fired at them...is a matter that is very significant."</p>

<p>The Israeli troops found a body resembling Yahya Sinwar's, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-hamas-lebanon-sinwar-gaza-iran-10-18-24-intl-hnk#cm2f17my500053b6q9qqm93ef" rel="no follow, no index">CNN reported</a>. They cut his finger off for a DNA confirmation with a profile the troops had when Sinwar was in Israeli prison for two decades until his release in 2011 in a prisoner-swap deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Videos of Israeli troops searching the hideout surfaced on social media. One of the videos, assessed by NDTV, shows two Israeli soldiers standing next to a body (claimed to be Yahya Sinwar's) with the index finger of the left hand being chopped off. Meanwhile, CNN in its report said they analysed videos which showed his left hand with all five fingers, and then later with one finger missing.</p>

<p>He told CNN that the Hamas leader suffered other injuries, including from a tank shell, but he was confident a bullet to the head was what had killed the Hamas leader.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-in-head-finger-cut-off-chilling-details-of-yahya-sinwars-autopsy-6822817">IDF claims that the tank</a> round fired at the building eliminated the Hamas leader. The video assessed by NDTV showed the body's skull being ruptured, with injuries to the face, corroborating claims made by the chief pathologist in the CNN report.</p>

<p>Yahya Sinwar was the mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in which over 1,200 people were killed, resulting in a year-long Israeli operation in Gaza, killing over 40,000 including children.</p>

<p>Israel vowed to uproot Hamas from Gaza and has so far eliminated most of its top leadership, including its previous chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in July.</p>

<p>After Sinwar's death, Israel now hopes the hostages still stuck in Gaza would be returned. Sinwar's deputy Khalil Al-Hayya, who is viewed as a potential successor, struck a defiant note, saying hostages would not be returned until Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza and the war ended.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Liam Payne's death has been deemed suspicious and under the possible influence of drug abuse by authorities investigating the circumstances leading to it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British popstar and former One Direction member Liam Payne used powerful hallucinogenic drugs before falling to his death from a hotel in Argentina on October 16, a report said. Payne, 31, was found dead after falling from a third-floor balcony at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Police indicated that Mr Payne was using a dangerous substance known as "Cristal," which is notorious for causing extreme highs and lows in users, often leading to aggressive behaviour. Test results on the narcotics and medications recovered from his room, confirming the same, are being awaited.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/18/entertainment/liam-payne-was-using-powerful-hallucinogenic-drug-when-he-plunged-to-death-at-argentina-hotel-report/">reports</a>, he may have been under the influence of multiple substances at the time of his fall. Emergency services were called to the hotel after staff frantically described him as "an aggressive man overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol." The police statement to AP further said that he "had jumped" from the balcony of his hotel room.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Upon entering Mr Payne's hotel suite, authorities discovered a chaotic scene, with broken items and various drugs scattered throughout. Among the substances found were packs of clonazepam, a central nervous system depressant, along with energy supplements and over-the-counter medications.</p>

<p>Forensic teams also recovered a whiskey bottle, lighter, and cell phone from the courtyard where his body was located. Investigators noted that the absence of defensive injuries suggested he may have been in a state of semi-consciousness or complete unconsciousness when he fell.</p>

<p>As reported by<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/18/entertainment/liam-payne-was-using-powerful-hallucinogenic-drug-when-he-plunged-to-death-at-argentina-hotel-report/" rel="No Link, No Follow"> </a>The New York Post, Mr Payne said during a 2021 appearance on the "The Diary of a CEO" podcast, "I was worried how far my rock bottom was going to be. Where's rock bottom for me? And you would never have seen it. I'm very good at hiding it. No one would ever have seen it."</p>

<p>Mr Payne had previously entered rehab multiple times and also had expressed suicidal thoughts during his career. Despite claims of sobriety earlier this year, sources indicate he was battling significant drug addiction leading up to his death. The investigation into the circumstances surrounding his passing is ongoing.</p>

<p>As the investigation continues, fans gathered outside the hotel to pay tribute to Payne, leaving flowers and candles in his memory.

       <description><![CDATA[A Belgian court has opened an investigation into allegations of war crimes by an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldier in the ongoing conflict in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Belgian court has opened an investigation into allegations of war crimes by an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldier in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office launched a probe into a dual Belgian-Israeli national serving in the IDF, who is in his early twenties. The soldier was born and raised in a suburb of Brussels, and serves in the IDF's elite Multidimensional "Ghost" (Refaim) sniper unit, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-825183" rel="nofollow,noindex">report</a> said.</p>

<p>The investigation centres around accusations that the soldier targeted unarmed civilians in the Gaza Strip. The complaints suggest that uninvolved civilians were deliberately shot, violating international laws protecting non-combatants.</p>

<p>The Belgian-Palestinian Association (ABP) filed the complaint that triggered the investigation. Belgian law allows the prosecution of its citizens for crimes committed abroad.</p>

<p>The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office confirmed the investigation on Friday, stating that it aims to verify whether the alleged war crimes were committed by the sniper.</p>

<p>This case follows a report by Palestinian journalist <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/ytirawi/status/1842242729436201158" rel="nofollow,noindex">Younis Tirawi</a>, who accused the Refaim sniper unit of deliberately targeting unarmed civilians. According to Tirawi, his findings were corroborated by a senior American officer serving within the unit. The officer allegedly shared evidence and recounted instances where the unit fired on civilians, even when there was no threat to IDF forces.</p>

<p>The Refaim Unit, to which the accused soldier belongs, has reportedly been active in Gaza since October 2023. This elite Israeli military unit, consisting of 21 soldiers, includes members from various nationalities. In addition to the Belgian under investigation, the unit comprises three Americans, two French citizens, one German, and one Italian, among others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case against the Belgian sniper draws heavily on interviews conducted by Tirawi. According to the journalist, the senior American officer provided chilling testimony, likening Gaza to the biblical city of Sodom, which was destroyed due to its sins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The officer allegedly referred to Gaza's residents as "Amalekites," a term from the Old Testament often used in historical contexts to describe enemies of the Israelites.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A woman in central China sparked outrage after placing her two young children on an air conditioning unit outside their 23rd-floor apartment during an argument with her husband.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a fight with her husband, a woman in central China allegedly disturbed him by placing her two small children on an air conditioner outside their 23rd-floor apartment, according to <em>the South China Morning Post.</em></p>

<p>On October 10, neighbours in Luoyang, Henan province, heard the children's cries and recorded the event for posterity in a viral video. The children were not wearing any safety gear; therefore, the mother prevented the father from getting to them. The daughter was crying, while her brother seemed more composed. It's unknown what caused the couple's fight. A nearby resident reported the incident to the police.</p>

<p>"The firefighting vehicle came and the children were rescued," an official at the local Women and Children's Federation said, adding that they were looking into the case.</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3282333/china-mother-sits-children-23rd-floor-outdoor-air-con-unit-annoy-husband-during-row">SCMP</a>, </em>the police are also investigating the incident. It was not disclosed whether the mother would receive punishment. The video clip, viewed 55 million times on Weibo alone, received a huge response in China.</p>

<p>"A mother should protect her children. But she put her children in dire danger. She is not fit to be a mother," one online observer said.</p>

<p>"If an accident happens, she will regret it more than anyone else. Why adopt such an extreme measure? Calm down. If you cannot live with him any longer, just divorce him," another person wrote.</p>

<p>"This woman is insane and horrible! She should receive serious judicial punishment," said another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said Friday that it had swapped 95 Ukrainian soldiers held captive for an equal number of Russian troops in an exchange deal brokered by the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>"As a result of the negotiation process, 95 Russian servicemen were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime," the Russian defence ministry said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In return, 95 Ukrainian army prisoners of war were handed over," it said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kyiv has not confirmed the exchange but the human rights centre Zmina said a prominent Ukrainian rights activist, Maksym Butkevych, was freed in the swap, citing his father.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Butkevych, co-founder of the independent Hromadske radio station and also a Ukraine serviceman, was serving a 13-year sentence on charges of wounding two civilians while firing an anti-tank grenade launcher in the eastern city of Severodonetsk.</p>

<p>He joined the Ukrainian army in March 2022, was detained in June and convicted of war crimes by a court in Lugansk in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine in March 2023.</p>

<p>Despite ongoing hostilities, Russia and Ukraine have swapped hundreds of prisoners since the launch of Moscow's offensive in 2022, often in deals brokered by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia or Turkey.</p>

<p>The last reported swap was in September, when 206 POWs were exchanged, in a deal also mediated by the UAE.</p>

<p>Earlier Friday, Kyiv said it had received the bodies of 501 soldiers killed fighting Russian forces, mainly in eastern Ukraine, as a result of repatriation measures.</p>

<p>Russian lawmaker Shamsail Saraliyev told the RBK media outlet that Russia received 89 bodies of its soldiers in return.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A global coral bleaching event that began last year has quickly grown to the largest on record, according to a US agency, with the impacted reef area continuing to grow.</p>

<p>From the beginning of 2023 through October 10, 2024, "roughly 77 percent of the world's reef area has experienced bleaching-level heat stress," Derek Manzello of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) told AFP on Friday.</p>

<p>He said the ongoing bleaching event -- the fourth since 1998 -- had surpassed the previous record of 65.7 percent in half the time, and "is still increasing in size."</p>

<p>Coral are marine invertebrates made up of individual animals called polyps.</p>

<p>They have a symbiotic relationship with the algae that live inside their tissue and provide their primary source of food, as well as their captivating colors.</p>

<p>When the water is too warm -- such as during heat waves which have hit areas from Florida to Australia in the past year -- coral expel their algae and turn white, an effect called "bleaching" that leaves them exposed to disease and at risk of dying off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last record had been set during the third global bleaching event, which lasted from 2014 to 2017 and followed previous events in 1998 and 2010.</p>

<p>NOAA's heat-stress monitoring is based on satellite measurements from 1985 to the present day.</p>

<p>Manzello said NOAA had confirmed reports of mass coral bleaching from 74 countries or territories since February 2023.</p>

<p>"This includes locations in the northern and southern hemisphere of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans," he told AFP by email.</p>

<p>Roughly 850 million people worldwide rely on coral reefs for food, jobs and to protect coastlines from storms and erosion, according to the nonprofit WWF.</p>

<p>The ecosystems provide a haven for ocean life, with over a quarter of marine species calling them home.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cuba was plunged into a nationwide blackout on Friday after the island's biggest power plant failed, the energy ministry said, coming on the heels of weeks of extended outages across the economically devastated country.</p>

<p>"The system was left without power nationwide" after the unexpected shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras power plant, Lazaro Guerra, director general of electricity at the Ministry of Energy and Mines, told state television.</p>

<p>When the power plant shut down, "the system collapsed," he said, adding that the government was working to restore service as soon as possible to the island's 11 million people.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero declared an "energy emergency" after weeks of disruptions, which saw some provinces without power for up to 20 hours a day.</p>

<p>He suspended all non-essential public sector activities in order to prioritize electricity supply to homes.</p>

<p>President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Friday on social media platform X that the government would "not rest" until the lights were back on and the energy crisis resolved.</p>

<p><strong>Worst crisis in 30 years</strong></p>

<p>He blamed the situation on Cuba's difficulties in acquiring fuel for its power plants, which he attributed to the tightening of a six-decade-long US trade embargo under former president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Cuba is in the throes of its worst economic crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, marked by sky-high inflation and shortages of food, medicine, fuel and even water.</p>

<p>While the authorities chiefly blame the US embargo, the island is also still feeling the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit tourism hard.</p>

<p>The island's electricity is generated by eight aging thermal power plants, some of which have broken down or are under maintenance, as well as seven floating plants leased from Turkish companies and a raft of generators.</p>

<p>In 2022, the island suffered months of daily hours-long power outages, culminating in a nationwide blackout on September 27 that year, caused by Hurricane Ian.</p>

<p>The situation eased in 2023 but in March this year, maintenance work on the Antonio Guiteras plant, which is located about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the capital, again caused rolling power cuts.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ryuta Watanabe, a 36-year-old citizen of the northern prefecture of Hokkaido, Japan, hasn't had a job in the last ten years. Watanabe, who has been unemployed for ten years, has a distinct career aspiration: he wants to become the "God of Marriage."</p>

<p>Watanabe, who currently has four wives and two girlfriends, relies entirely on their incomes to support his lifestyle. To top it all off, he has stated that he wants to father 54 children. This is an unusual family setup.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3282332/japan-man-4-wives-2-girlfriends-aims-father-54-children-become-god-marriage"><em>South China Morning Post,</em></a> his wives are common-law in nature, recognised as partners in a marriage-like relationship without formal registration, based on long-term cohabitation and shared responsibilities. Watanabe is already the father of 10 children and lives with two of them and three of his wives, Japan's Shueisha Online reported. He takes on the role of a househusband, cooking, doing housework, and taking care of the children.</p>

<p>The household expenses, which are almost 914,000 yen (Rs 5 lakh) a month, are split between his wives and girlfriends. Watanabe also has a fourth wife, who is 24 years old, but they are estranged. In addition, he met two girlfriends via social media platforms, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3282332/japan-man-4-wives-2-girlfriends-aims-father-54-children-become-god-marriage"><em>SCMP.</em></a></p>

<p>His girlfriend dumped a depressed Watanabe six years ago. He claimed that this is what motivated him to begin using dating apps to connect with other ladies.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, on the Japanese TV show Abema Prime, Watanabe said, "I just love women. As long as we love each other equally, there won't be any problems."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar was killed in an intelligence-based ground raid in southern Gaza. Sinwar was the politburo chief of the Palestinian group, Hamas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar was killed in an intelligence-based ground raid in southern Gaza. Sinwar was the politburo chief of the Palestinian group, Hamas. The 828 Brigade of the Israel Ground Forces (IDF) was operating in the Tel al-Sultan area of Rafah, where during scans they found the Hamas chief's body. CNN reported that Israeli troops cut off his fingers to confirm his death.</p>

<p>The report says that Israeli troops entered the hideout and found a body resembling Yahya Sinwar's. They cut his finger off for a DNA confirmation with a profile the troops had when Sinwar was in Israeli prison for two decades until his release in 2011 in a prisoner-swap deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-hamas-lebanon-sinwar-gaza-iran-10-18-24-intl-hnk#cm2f17my500053b6q9qqm93ef" rel="no follow, no index">CNN quoted</a> Chen Kugel, chief pathologist at Israel National Center of Forensic Medicine, as saying, "After the laboratory made the profile, we compared it with the profile that Sinwar had in the term that he was serving here as a prisoner, so then we could finally identify him by his DNA."</p>

<p>Kugel told CNN that the troops first tried to identify him with his teeth but that wasn't "certified enough".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Videos of Israeli troops searching the hideout surfaced on social media. In one of the videos, two Israeli soldiers are standing next to a body (claimed to be Yahya Sinwar's) with the index finger of the left hand being chopped off. Meanwhile, CNN in its report said they analysed videos which showed his left hand with all five fingers, and then later with one finger missing.</p>

<p>The chief pathologist who autopsied the body of Yahya Sinwar told CNN that Sinwar was killed by a gunshot wound to the head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He told CNN that the Hamas leader suffered other injuries, including from a tank shell, but he was confident a bullet to the head was what had killed the Hamas leader. A video assessed by NDTV on social media showed injuries to Yahya's face and part of his skull blown off,&nbsp;corroborating with claims made by the chief pathologist in the CNN report</p>

<p>Israeli troops fired a tank round on the hideout before conducting a ground raid for damage assessment and search for any survivors.</p>

<p><strong>Hamas Looking For A New Leader</strong></p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-searching-for-yahya-sinwars-replacement-outside-gaza-report-6821136">Hamas is looking for a new political leader</a> based outside Gaza. At the same time, his brother - Mohammad Sinwar - is expected to assume a bigger role in directing the war against Israel in the region.</p>

<p>Yahya Sinwar was the mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in which over 1,200 people were killed, resulting in a year-long Israeli operation in Gaza, killing over 40,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel vowed to uproot Hamas from Gaza and has so far eliminated most of its top leadership, including its previous chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in July.</p>

<p>Hamas has a history of quickly and efficiently replacing its fallen leaders, with its top decision-making body, the Shura Council, tasked with naming a new head.</p>

<p>While Hamas had a separate military and political wing, after Sinwar took over as the politburo chief following Haniyeh's death, he fused the two wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Sinwar's death, Israel now hopes the hostages still stuck in Gaza would be returned. Sinwar's deputy Khalil Al-Hayya, who is viewed as a potential successor, struck a defiant note, saying hostages would not be returned until Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza and the war ended.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli soldier involved in the operation that killed Hamas leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/israel-gaza-war">Yahya Sinwar</a>, detailed the minutes he spent alone with Sinwar's body after the mission. Lt Col Itamar Eitam recounted how he found <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar">Sinwar</a>, lying in a dilapidated chair, describing him as "a small, ugly, and broken figure."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I just left Rafah. Not long ago, I looked him - Sinwar &nbsp;- in the eyes. I had a few minutes alone with him, and I looked at him - a small, ugly, and broken figure, lying on a shattered couch," Lt Col Eitam wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So much pain this man caused," he wrote. "I looked at the ruined city, and I even felt pain for them, but more than anything, I felt insulted-insulted on behalf of God. Because he, too, was once a baby and a child, and he had a choice, and he chose evil. He chose wickedness. What an insult that he was also a person created in Your image. How distorted. How much better the world is now. We won't be confused, and we won't give up. Together we will win. Happy holiday," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The killing of Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, is a significant blow to Hamas. Israeli military officials confirmed that Sinwar was found and killed during a routine patrol in Rafah, southern Gaza, without prior intelligence of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>According to Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari, the patrol stumbled upon three militants, including Sinwar, as they moved through Rafah. Sinwar, after splitting from his group, took cover in a building, only to be tracked by drones. Video footage showed him attempting a final act of defiance, throwing a stick at the drone moments before Israeli forces neutralized him.</p>

<p>Forensic analysis confirmed Sinwar's identity, with an autopsy revealing a gunshot wound to the head. No hostages were found near him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/war-can-end-tomorrow-if-hamas-returns-hostages-says-netanyahu-after-killing-of-yahya-sinwar-6815491#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> called Sinwar's death the potential "beginning of the end" of the war. However, families of hostages remain concerned, urging Israel to secure their release before any further escalation.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, Hamas acknowledged Sinwar's death but vowed to continue its resistance, with the militant group stating his killing would only strengthen their resolve.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 33 Palestinians were killed on Friday evening by an Israeli airstrike on the Jabalia camp in the northern Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said.</p>

<p>Among the killed were 21 women, and total fatalities may reach 50 due to many victims trapped under rubble and buildings. The bombing injured over 85 people, some of whom sustained serious injuries, Xinhua news agency reported, citing a statement issued by the media office.</p>

<p>The Israeli army bombed several homes in Jabalia camp, it added.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has not yet commented on the incident.</p>

<p>Israel has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on October 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage.</p>

<p>The Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip has risen to 42,500, Gaza-based health authorities said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>"I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I'm sorry to do this, I'm going to tax you, at 150% to 200%," Trump was quoted as saying in the WSJ interview published on Friday evening.</p>

<p>Trump, asked if he would use military force against a blockade on Taiwan by China, said it would not come to that because Chinese President Xi Jinping respected him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump barreled through the battleground state of Michigan on Friday, where opinion polls show the U.S. presidential candidates are essentially tied just 18 days before the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Former President Trump visited a campaign office in Hamtramck, where he heard praise from the Detroit suburb's first Muslim mayor, Amer Ghalib. Trump was seeking support from Arab Americans in Michigan disenchanted with Democrats, Vice President Harris and President Joe Biden over U.S. support for Israel in the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>"We all ultimately want one thing. We want peace in the Middle East. We're going to get peace in the Middle East. It's going to happen very fast. It can happen with the right leadership in Washington," Trump said, without elaborating.</p>

<p>Later Trump was to speak in Auburn Hills, a city in Oakland County, north of Detroit, which Biden won by a comfortable margin in 2020. Trump will also return to Detroit - Michigan's largest city - for a rally around 7 p.m. (2300 GMT), after saying on Oct. 10 that the rest of the U.S. would turn into Detroit if Harris won.</p>

<p>Harris will speak in Grand Rapids, the heart of more conservative western Michigan, before heading east to Lansing and then Oakland County on Friday night.</p>

<p>The Midwestern state has about 8.4 million voters and would bring the winner 15 Electoral College votes out of the 270 needed to win, which in several scenarios would be a decisive number. Harris and Trump are battling fiercely for the state's Arab American, senior, union and working-class voters.</p>

<p>Both have sharpened their attacks in recent days.</p>

<p>On Friday, Trump falsely told the "Fox &amp; Friends" program that Harris is Marxist and renewed his attacks on her intelligence.</p>

<p>"I don't think she knows where she is. She's a low-IQ person. She's not smart," he said. Harris on Friday said reports that Trump was skipping interviews and another presidential debate because he was exhausted raised questions about his fitness for office.</p>

<p>"It should be a concern. If he can't handle the rigors of the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?" she told reporters before a rally in Grand Rapids. "That's a legitimate question."</p>

<h2><strong>'I'M NOT EVEN TIRED'</strong></h2>

<p>Trump, talking to reporters as he arrived in Detroit, rejected such talk.</p>

<p>"I've gone 48 days now without a rest," Trump said.</p>

<p>"I'm not even tired. I'm really exhilarated. You know why? We're killing her in the polls, because the American people don't want her."</p>

<p>On Thursday, Harris said Trump was "gaslighting" the American public about the deadly attack by his loyalists on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump recently called the assault a "day of love."</p>

<p>In Michigan and other crucial battleground states, either Harris or Trump holds a razor-thin margin over the other , according to public and internal campaign polls. That's worrying Democrats.</p>

<p>Trump won Michigan by 11,000 votes in 2016. In 2020, Biden beat Trump by 155,000 votes.</p>

<p>Harris is shifting the strategy of her whirlwind campaign to win over more Republicans and men of all races. She's also enlisting popular former first lady Michelle Obama, who will campaign for the vice president in Michigan on Oct. 26.</p>

<p>Nationally, Harris' edge has narrowed from a late September lead of 7 percentage points over Trump to just 3 points, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with high food and rent prices still worrying Americans and Trump amplifying fears related to migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border with increasingly extreme rhetoric.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Pledges from Israel and enemies Hamas and Hezbollah to keep fighting in Gaza and Lebanon dashed hopes on Friday that the death of Palestinian militant leader Yahya Sinwar might hasten an end to more than a year of escalating war in the Middle East.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pledges from Israel and its enemies Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah to keep fighting in Gaza and Lebanon dashed hopes on Friday that the death of Palestinian militant leader Yahya Sinwar might hasten an end to more than a year of escalating war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Israel's arch-foe and the militants' main backer Iran also said Sinwar's death would only fuel "the spirit of resistance".</p>

<p>Hamas leader Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Video showed him tossing a stick at a drone as he sat dying.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called his killing a milestone but vowed to keep up the war, which in recent weeks expanded from fighting Hamas in Gaza into an invasion and pursuit of Hezbollah of Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The war, my dear ones, is not yet over," Netanyahu told Israelis late on Thursday, saying fighting would continue until hostages held by Hamas are released.</p>

<p>"We have before us a great opportunity to stop the axis of evil," he added, referring to Iran and its militant allies across the region, also in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Hamas said hostages would only be released with a halt of hostilities in Gaza, an Israeli withdrawal and the release of its prisoners.</p>

<p>"The martyrdom of our brother, the leader Yahya Sinwar ... will only increase the strength and resolve of Hamas and our resistance," it said, confirming his death.</p>

<p>That rhetoric from the warring parties contrasted with Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, who said Sinwar's death offered a chance for negotiations. Sinwar had been refusing talks, Washington said.</p>

<p>Israel's government has rejected several attempts by the United States, its main ally, at brokering ceasefires in both Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>One senior diplomat working in Lebanon told Reuters that hopes Sinwar's death would end the war appeared misplaced.</p>

<p>"We had hoped, really throughout this, that getting rid of Sinwar would be the turning point where the wars would end ... where everyone would be ready to put their weapons down. It appears we were once again mistaken," the diplomat said.</p>

<p>Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said he feared the war was only going to get worse.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, we are on the verge of a comprehensive regional war," he told state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV channel. "There are parties keen on escalation."</p>

<p>He said international mediators - which included Egypt - had been close to reaching a ceasefire in Gaza but Israel lacked the political will.</p>

<p>Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was an achievement, it would not be complete while captives were still in Gaza.</p>

<p>The conflict has caused direct Iranian-Israeli confrontations, including missile attacks on Israel in April and on Oct. 1.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has vowed to respond to the October attack, though Washington has pressed it not to strike Iranian energy facilities or nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Biden, on a visit to Berlin on Friday, said there was a possibility of working towards a ceasefire in Lebanon but it would be harder in Gaza. He also told reporters he had an understanding of how and when Israel would respond to the missile attacks by Iran. He declined to elaborate.</p>

<h2><strong>TRACKED AND KILLED</strong></h2>

<p>Sinwar, Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza.</p>

<p>He was killed during a gun battle on Wednesday by Israeli troops initially unaware they had caught their number one enemy, Israeli officials said.</p>

<p>The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building. He was tracked by the drone as he lay dying, the video showed, desperately throwing a stick.</p>

<p>The Oct. 7, 2023 attacks he masterminded in Israel killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has subsequently killed more than 42,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Its offensive has made most of Gaza's 2.3 million people homeless, maimed tens of thousands, caused widespread hunger and destroyed hospitals and schools.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which began firing rockets at Israel in support of its Hamas ally on Oct. 8, is the target of Israel's intensifying assault on Lebanon, which has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced 1.2 million.</p>

<p>Israel has now killed several of Hamas' top leaders and in a matter of weeks decapitated the Hezbollah leadership, mainly through air strikes.</p>

<p>The killings have dealt a blow to what anti-Israeli forces call the Axis of Resistance: a group of proxy militant groups that Iran has spent decades supporting across the region.</p>

<p>Experts said the Palestinian militant group was likely to replace Sinwar with a new political leader based outside Gaza while his brother Mohammad Sinwar was expected to assume a bigger role directing the war against Israel in the territory.</p>

<p>Iran showed no sign Sinwar's killing would shift its support.</p>

<p>"The spirit of resistance will be strengthened," its mission to the United Nations said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said on Friday it had also killed Muhammad Hassin Ramal, Hezbollah's commander of the Tayibe area in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, visiting Beirut, called for the U.N. peacekeeping mission to Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to be strengthened. Italy contributes troops to the force.</p>

<p>"I repeat that I consider targeting UNIFIL is unacceptable," Meloni told a joint news conference with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, referring to recent Israeli attacks involving the mission's troops.</p>

<p>She said she planned to hold talks with Netanyahu after her visit to Lebanon and Jordan.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook owner Meta said on Friday it was releasing a batch of new AI models from its research division, including a "Self-Taught Evaluator" that may offer a path toward less human involvement in the AI development process.</p>

<p>The release follows Meta's introduction of the tool in an August paper, which detailed how it relies upon the same "chain of thought" technique used by OpenAI's recently released o1 models to get it to make reliable judgments about models' responses.</p>

<p>That technique involves breaking down complex problems into smaller logical steps and appears to improve the accuracy of responses on challenging problems in subjects like science, coding and math.</p>

<p>Meta's researchers used entirely AI-generated data to train the evaluator model, eliminating human input at that stage as well.</p>

<p>The ability to use AI to evaluate AI reliably offers a glimpse at a possible pathway toward building autonomous AI agents that can learn from their own mistakes, two of the Meta researchers behind the project told Reuters.</p>

<p>Many in the AI field envision such agents as digital assistants intelligent enough to carry out a vast array of tasks without human intervention.</p>

<p>Self-improving models could cut out the need for an often expensive and inefficient process used today called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, which requires input from human annotators who must have specialized expertise to label data accurately and verify that answers to complex math and writing queries are correct.</p>

<p>"We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human," said Jason Weston, one of the researchers.</p>

<p>"The idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI," he said.</p>

<p>Other companies including Google and Anthropic have also published research on the concept of RLAIF, or Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Unlike Meta, however, those companies tend not to release their models for public use.</p>

<p>Other AI tools released by Meta on Friday included an update to the company's image-identification Segment Anything model, a tool that speeds up LLM response generation times and datasets that can be used to aid the discovery of new inorganic materials.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said it had intercepted a suspicious "aerial target" approaching from Syria on Friday, which a war monitor said was a drone launched by an Iran-backed group.</p>

<p>"A short while ago, a suspicious aerial target that approached Israeli territory from Syria was intercepted by the IAF (air force)... before it crossed into Israeli territory," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the drone was launched by the Iran-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq group.</p>

<p>"Israeli air defences in the occupied Syrian Golan targeted two drones launched by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, coming from Iraq through Syrian territory," the war monitor said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a network of pro-Iran militias, has regularly claimed launching drones targeting Israel.</p>

<p>Israel is fighting a war on two fronts, one with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the other with Hamas in Gaza, while it also faces attacks from Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities rarely comment publicly about individual strikes or operations involving Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow Iran to expand its foothold in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is set to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup today, focusing on how its flagship device's features have been infused with artificial intelligence, rather than its usual emphasis on hardware upgrades.</p>

<p>The event at the tech giant's Apple Park headquarters at 10 a.m. PDT (1700 GMT) follows its developer conference in June during which the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, its take on generative AI that can conjure text, images and other content on command.</p>

<p>It had also showed off an improved version of voice assistant Siri, featuring an integration with ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.</p>

<p>The refresh comes as iPhones face stiff competition from Huawei in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them. Huawei itself has scheduled its own product announcement mere hours after Apple's event.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence must be approved by Beijing in order to be released in the Chinese market. In July, OpenAI blocked access to ChatGPT in China, a move that could impact the chatbot's integration into Siri.</p>

<p>"The Chinese market is hungrier for AI features than the U.S. market," said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. "It will be very difficult to bring it to China immediately, so they'll be going off the merits of the hardware."</p>

<p>IPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's $383 billion sales last year, and the new devices are an important update for the Cupertino, California-based company that is betting the AI feature will drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in iPhone sales.</p>

<p>In China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, prompted by government restrictions and increased domestic competition.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 lineup will be the first Apple smartphones designed around these AI features, though those will also be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the top-end versions of the previous-generation devices. New versions of the Apple Watch and AirPods are also expected.</p>

<p>"The software side, and how Apple frames it, is the biggest question," said Bajarin. "Investors will look for if it's compelling enough to have a larger than normal upgrade cycle."</p>

<p>Rivals including Alphabet's Google are also showcasing AI features to try to upend Apple's dominance in the high-end smartphone market.</p>

<p>Google, developer of the Android operating system which competes with Apple's iOS, traditionally announced its Pixel smartphones in the autumn. This year, it pushed the event to August ahead of Apple's announcement.</p>

<p>Google focused on AI features including Gemini Live, which allows users to hold live voice conversations with a digital assistant. Many of the AI features Google announced were also rolled out to the Android-based devices made by manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola.</p>

<p>"The question is who is going to be the first to combine a truly personal AI assistant with knowledge and information that is accurate and personalized," said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst for TECHnalysis Research.</p>

<p>Apple has so far shared a timeline for the release of Apple Intelligence only in the United States, where it is slated to launch on compatible devices in the autumn.</p>

<p>In June, one week after its developer conference, Apple said it would delay the release in Europe due to European Union tech rules.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French retail giant Carrefour announced Monday that it will return to India by June 2025 in a franchise partnership with Dubai firm Apparel Group, a decade after leaving the country.</p>

<p>Carrefour pulled out of the Indian market in 2014, closing five wholesale stores after only a four-year presence in the country.</p>

<p>The supermarket group did not say how many stores may open in India.</p>

<p>With its population of more than 1.4 billion, "India is a strategic market pulled by economic growth, urbanisation and the growing purchasing power of consumers", Carrefour said in a statement.</p>

<p>Patrick Lasfargues, Carrefour's executive director of international partnerships, said the move was an "an important step in our strategy of expanding our franchise in more than 10 new countries by 2026".</p>

<p>Carrefour has more than 14,000 stores in more than 40 countries.</p>

<p>Apparel Group, a fashion and lifestyle retail company, already has a presence in India where it employs 24,000 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's Ambassador to India, Oleksandr Polishchuk, said on Monday that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may visit India by the end of the year following an invitation extended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but the dates of the visit will be decided according to mutual convenience.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Modi kindly invited my president to visit India, and I'm hopeful it will happen. Maybe by the end of this year, we will be happy to see President Zelenskyy here, as it would mark another step forward in our bilateral relationship. It would also provide a great opportunity for the two leaders to spend more time discussing the peace-building process around the world," Oleksandr Polishchuk told ANI.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian envoy mentioned that Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine was relatively short due to security concerns. However, in India, both leaders would have more time for discussions, he said.</p>

<p>"I know for certain that President Zelenskyy is very keen to visit India. He has never been here," he said, adding that "visit would take place at a time convenient for both sides".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Ukraine on August 23 this year at the invitation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. This marked the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established between the two countries in 1992.</p>

<p>In a joint statement issued at the end of the visit, Prime Minister Modi and President Zelenskyy reiterated their readiness for further cooperation in upholding principles of international law, including the UN Charter, such as respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of states. They agreed on the desirability of closer bilateral dialogue in this regard.</p>

<p>The Indian side reiterated its principled position and focus on peaceful resolution of Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, as a part of which, India has attended the Summit on Peace in Ukraine, held in Burgenstock, Switzerland, in June 2024.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian side welcomed such participation by India and highlighted the importance of high-level Indian participation in the next Peace Summit.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian side conveyed that the Joint Communique on a Peace Framework, adopted at the Summit on Peace in Ukraine, could serve as a basis for further efforts to promote just peace based on dialogue, diplomacy, and international law.</p>

<p>The Leaders appreciated various efforts to ensure global food security, including Ukrainian humanitarian grain initiative. The importance of uninterrupted and unhindered supply of agricultural products to global markets, especially in Asia and Africa, was emphasized.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi reiterated the need for sincere and practical engagement between all stakeholders to develop innovative solutions that will have broad acceptability and contribute towards early restoration of peace. He reiterated India's willingness to contribute in all possible ways to facilitate an early return of peace.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Modi thanked President Zelenskyy for the warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation during the visit and invited him to visit India at a mutually convenient opportunity," the joint statement said.</p>

<p>Zelenskyy had expressed his gratitude over PM Modi's visit to Ukraine.</p>

<p>"A very good meeting. This is a historic one... I am very thankful to the PM for coming. It's a good beginning with some practical steps," he said at a press conference later.</p>

<p>"I am happy that PM Modi came to visit us and I believe this is very important...This is the first visit of the Prime Minister of India to Ukraine. We are ready on our part to do the respective steps. We've heard messages from the Indian side that they would be happy to welcome our team to India," he added.</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who met Zelenskyy last week, said India and China can play a role in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>"China and India have a role to play in resolving this conflict. The only thing that cannot happen is to believe the conflict can be solved by abandoning Ukraine," Giorgia Meloni said according to Italian Government TV, cited by Reuters.</p>

<p>Giorgia Meloni's remarks follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's statement that India, China and Brazil could mediate in potential peace talks over Ukraine. Addressing the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF), the Russian leader stated that leaders of India, Brazil, and China are making a sincere effort to contribute to resolving the situation in Ukraine.</p>

<p>PM Modi had visited Russia in July this year. Putin was cited by Russian state media TASS as saying that he is in constant touch with India, China, and Brazil over the Ukraine conflict, as these countries are sincerely seeking to resolve all issues surrounding the conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time on Tuesday, each seeking an edge in what has become a neck-and-neck race for the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time on Tuesday, each seeking an edge in what has become a neck-and-neck race for the White House.</p>

<p>After weeks of back-and-forth on the where, when and how of the debate, US broadcaster ABC -- which is hosting the event -- announced the final rules of the contest, as agreed to by the two campaigns, this week.</p>

<p>Here are the major takeaways.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;When and where?</strong></p>

<p>The debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:00 pm local time Tuesday (0100 GMT Wednesday,) and will be aired live. There will be no audience present in the room.</p>

<p>The event will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, and will run for 90 minutes of debate time, with two commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Muted mics?</strong></p>

<p>The issue of whether microphones would be muted -- as they were during a previous debate between US President Joe Biden and Trump -- was a contentious one, with each side accusing the other of cowardice over the question.</p>

<p>ABC has announced that each candidate's microphone will only be live for when it is their turn to speak, and muted when the time belongs to the other candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only moderators will be allowed to ask questions, and no topics or questions will be shared in advance with the candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Who speaks when?</strong></p>

<p>Candidates will not offer opening statements. They will be allotted two minutes to answer each question, with two minutes granted to their opponent for a rebuttal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be an additional minute for "a follow-up, clarification, or response," according to the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the debate, each candidate will offer a two-minute closing statement, with Trump to go last, as per the results of a virtual coin toss.</p>

<p><strong>No props</strong></p>

<p>Candidates will stand behind podiums through the entire length of the debate, with no props or pre-written notes allowed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump and Harris will each be given a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water.</p>

<p>Campaign staff will not be allowed to speak or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed is the son of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the current president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-holds-talks-with-abu-dhabi-crown-prince-6523616 ">extensive discussions with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince</a> Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, focusing on improving the overall strategic partnership between India and the United Arab Emirates. The Crown Prince arrived in India on Sunday, and PM Modi received him at the Hyderabad House. The talks covered various aspects of bilateral relations and explored future areas of cooperation.<br />

<br />
In maritime luxury, the Al Nahyan family owns three of the world's top ten largest yachts. The Azzam, the largest yacht globally, measures 180 metres and includes a golf practice room and pearl inlays. Their second yacht, Blue, is the fourth largest and boasts features such as a dance floor, beach club, and a beauty salon.&nbsp;<br />

The Al Nahyan family's commitment to culture is exemplified by the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi, the largest museum in the Arabian Peninsula.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Personal life</strong><br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled has been married to Sheikha Fatima bint Suroor Al Nahyan since 2008. They have three children together – Shamma, Mohammed and Salama.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Positions</strong><br />
<br />
Currently, Sheikh Khaled serves on Abu Dhabi's Supreme Council for Financial and Economic Affairs and is a board member of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. He is also the chairman of the Emirates Genome Council, launched in 2023. He also initiated the AED 1.9 billion RizeUp scholarship program in 2022, offering 6,000 Emirati students opportunities to study in the US and Canada by 2028.<br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled's business partners include Singaporean businessman Ong Beng Seng. The crown prince has also launched several initiatives, including the Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi project, a clean energy partnership between ADNOC and Emirates Water and Electricity Company, and the Abu Dhabi Industrial Strategy, aiming to grow the emirate's industrial sector to AED 172 billion.<br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled supports Masdar's Youth 4 Sustainability program and has launched the Abu Dhabi Mangrove project, aiming to make Abu Dhabi a global centre for research and innovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">In July 2023, rising US basketball star Bronny James collapsed on the court during practice and was sent to hospital. The 18-year-old athlete, son of famous LA Lakers' veteran LeBron James, had experienced a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bronny-james-cardiac-arrest-3953eee8789e83f3cccfb6dd798bc54e">cardiac arrest</a>.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Many media outlets incorrectly referred to the event as a “<a href="https://en.as.com/nba/lebron-james-son-bronny-plays-for-the-usc-trojans-for-the-first-time-since-suffering-a-heart-attack-n/">heart attack</a>” or used the terms interchangeably.</p>

<p>A cardiac arrest and a heart attack are distinct yet overlapping concepts associated with the heart.</p>

<p>With some background in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKrgEv7-rVM&amp;t=16s">how the heart works</a>, we can see how they differ and how they're related.</p>

<h2><strong>Understanding the heart</strong></h2>

<p>The heart is a muscle that contracts to work as a pump. When it contracts it pushes blood – containing oxygen and nutrients – to all the tissues of our body.</p>

<p>For the heart muscle to work effectively as a pump, it needs to be fed its own blood supply, delivered by the coronary arteries. If these arteries are blocked, the heart muscle doesn't get the blood it needs.</p>

<p>This can cause the heart muscle to become injured or die, and results in the heart not pumping properly.</p>

<h2><strong>Heart attack or cardiac arrest?</strong></h2>

<p>Simply put, a heart attack, technically known as a myocardial infarction, describes injury to, or death of, the heart muscle.</p>

<p>A cardiac arrest, sometimes called a sudden cardiac arrest, is when the heart stops beating, or put another way, stops working as an effective pump.</p>

<p>In other words, both relate to the heart not working as it should, but for different reasons. As we'll see later, one can lead to the other.</p>

<h2><strong>Why do they happen? Who's at risk?</strong></h2>

<p>Heart attacks typically result from blockages in the coronary arteries. Sometimes this is called coronary artery disease, but in Australia, we tend to refer to it as ischaemic heart disease.</p>

<p>The underlying cause in about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507799/#:%7E:text=It%20has%20been%20reported%20that,increases%20beyond%20age%2050%20years.">75% of people</a> is a process called <a href="https://youtu.be/jwL4lkSlvSA?si=H2as7dQkhbIqWWkU">atherosclerosis</a>. This is where fatty and fibrous tissue build up in the walls of the coronary arteries, forming a plaque. The plaque can block the blood vessel or, in some instances, lead to the formation of a blood clot.</p>

<p>Atherosclerosis is a long-term, stealthy process, with a number of risk factors that can sneak up on anyone. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, diet, diabetes, stress, and your genes have all been implicated in this plaque-building process.</p>

<p>Other causes of heart attacks include spasms of the coronary arteries (causing them to constrict), chest trauma, or anything else that reduces blood flow to the heart muscle.</p>

<p>Regardless of the cause, blocking or reducing the flow of blood through these pipes can result in the heart muscle not receiving enough oxygen and nutrients. So cells in the heart muscle can be injured or die.</p>

<p>But a cardiac arrest is the result of heartbeat irregularities, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively around the body. These heartbeat irregularities are generally due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_soKG-Tzh0&amp;t=903s">electrical malfunctions</a> in the heart. There are four distinct types:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>ventricular tachycardia:</strong> a rapid and abnormal heart rhythm in which the heartbeat is more than <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10541285/">100 beats per minute</a> (normal adult, resting heart rate is generally 60-90 beats per minute). This fast heart rate prevents the heart from filling with blood and thus pumping adequately</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>ventricular fibrillation:</strong> instead of regular beats, the heart quivers or “fibrillates”, resembling a bag of worms, resulting in an irregular heartbeat greater than 300 beats per minute</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>pulseless electrical activity:</strong> arises when the heart muscle fails to generate sufficient pumping force after electrical stimulation, resulting in no pulse</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>asystole:</strong> the classic flat-line heart rhythm you see in movies, indicating no electrical activity in the heart.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cardiac arrest can arise from numerous underlying conditions, both heart-related and not, such as drowning, trauma, asphyxia, electrical shock and drug overdose. James' cardiac arrest was attributed to a <a href="https://www.espn.com.au/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/38260006/bronny-james-cardiac-arrest-caused-congenital-heart-defect">congenital heart defect</a>, a heart condition he was born with.</p>

<p>But among the many causes of a cardiac arrest, ischaemic heart disease, such as a heart attack, stands out as the most common cause, accounting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11898927/">for 70%</a> of all cases.</p>

<p>So how can a heart attack cause a cardiac arrest? You'll remember that during a heart attack, heart muscle can be damaged or parts of it may die. This damaged or dead tissue can disrupt the heart's ability to conduct electrical signals, increasing the risk of developing arrhythmias, possibly causing a cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>So while a heart attack is a common cause of cardiac arrest, a cardiac arrest generally does not cause a heart attack.</p>

<h2><strong>What do they look like?</strong></h2>

<p>Because a cardiac arrest results in the sudden loss of effective heart pumping, the most common signs and symptoms are a sudden loss of consciousness, absence of pulse or heartbeat, stopping of breathing, and pale or blue-tinged skin.</p>

<p>But the common signs and symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain or discomfort, which can show up in other regions of the body such as the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach. Also frequent are shortness of breath, nausea, light-headedness, looking pale, and sweating.</p>

<h2><strong>What's the take-home message?</strong></h2>

<p>While both heart attack and cardiac arrest are disorders related to the heart, they differ in their mechanisms and outcomes.</p>

<p>A heart attack is like a blockage in the plumbing supplying water to a house. But a cardiac arrest is like an electrical malfunction in the house's wiring.</p>

<p>Despite their different nature both conditions can have severe consequences and require immediate medical attention.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>Police director Mauricio Arriaza was escorting former cooperative manager Manuel Coto back to El Salvador.</p>

<p>Coto, who was is accused of embezzling $35 million, had been arrested earlier on Sunday in Honduras after attempting to flee to the United States. He was subsequently handed over to Salvadoran police.</p>

<p>According to the Salvadoran Armed Forces, the helicopter crashed in the Pasaquina district, in the southeast of the country near the border with Honduras. The total number of people in the helicopter when it crashed remains unknown.</p>

<p>President Nayib Bukele said on X: "What happened cannot remain a simple 'accident'. It must be investigated thoroughly and to the last consequences."</p>

<p>He praised Arriaza for his significant contribution to national security and his roles in various police operations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late on Sunday in the southern Philippines, police arrested Apollo Quiboloy, a self-proclaimed "Appointed Son of God" and pastor of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) church, after an extensive manhunt spanning more than two weeks. The manhunt for Quiboloy - an evangelist with global reach, close ties to former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and millions of followers across the world -culminated in his surrender to local police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 74-year-old Quiboloy now faces charges of child sex trafficking, sexual abuse, and human trafficking that stem from a US indictment in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Quiboloy's Rise to Power</strong></h2>

<p>Born in the southern Philippines, Apollo Carreon Quiboloy is no ordinary preacher. He founded KOJC in 1985, a fringe religious organisation that grew exponentially, drawing millions of adherents across the Philippines and more than 200 countries. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/world/asia/philippines-pastor-kingdom-trafficking.html">New York Times</a>, KOJC, which blends elements of Pentecostal Christianity with Quiboloy's self-declared divine status, quickly became a dominant force in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Known as a "spiritual adviser" to former President Rodrigo Duterte, Quiboloy wielded immense influence over local and national politicians. His ability to deliver large voting blocs earned him a reputation as a spiritual kingmaker. Many saw his support as essential for winning elections, especially in Davao City, where he maintained a sprawling 75-acre compound called "New Jerusalem."</p>

<p>However, Quiboloy's spiritual kingdom hid a much darker reality, according to US and Philippine law enforcement agencies. His influence wasn't just political but allegedly included the systematic abuse and exploitation of vulnerable women and children, who were coerced into lives of servitude under the guise of faith.</p>

<h2><strong>Allegations Of Abuse And Exploitation</strong></h2>

<p>In 2021, Quiboloy was indicted by the US on charges of sex trafficking, sexual abuse, conspiracy, and forced labour. Quiboloy's alleged victims, some as young as 12, were recruited as "pastoral" -personal assistants who were expected to provide for his every need, including sexual favours. Referred to as "night duty," these sexual encounters were coerced under threat of spiritual and eternal damnation, according to US prosecutors. The indictment claimed that young women were forced to write "commitment letters" in which they devoted their lives and bodies to Quiboloy.</p>

<p>According to testimonies from some of the victims, those who were deemed to have "sinned" by resisting him were sent to "Prayer Mountain," a remote property on the outskirts of Davao City. There, punishments included head shaving, physical beatings, and other degrading forms of discipline, the New York Times reported.</p>

<h2><strong>Human Trafficking</strong></h2>

<p>Quiboloy's alleged abuses did not remain confined to the Philippines. His church had an international footprint, and American prosecutors revealed that his operations involved the trafficking of women and children across borders. According to the FBI, church members were sent to the United States on fraudulently obtained visas. There, they were forced to solicit donations for a purported children's charity called the "Children's Joy Foundation." However, those donations never made it to underprivileged children. Instead, the funds supported the lavish lifestyles of Quiboloy and other church leaders, including private jets, luxury properties, and other extravagances.</p>

<p>Quiboloy's workers, many of whom were part of the Philippines' large overseas labour force, were forced to solicit donations in countries like the United States, Singapore, and the UAE. In some cases, church members were made to endure near-enslavement conditions, sleeping in cars and being denied food if they failed to meet financial quotas.</p>

<h2><strong>The Fall Of The 'Appointed Son Of God'</strong></h2>

<p>In the Philippines, Quiboloy continued to preach from his Davao City headquarters and exerted influence over local government officials. Despite being placed on the FBI's Most Wanted list in 2021, he remained largely untouchable, protected by his powerful political allies, including Duterte.</p>

<p>This invincibility was tested when, on August 24 Philippine authorities, in coordination with the military, launched a massive raid on KOJC's Davao City compound. Nearly 2,000 heavily armed police officers surrounded the church's headquarters, searching for the fugitive pastor. The operation resulted in a weeklong standoff between law enforcement and church members, many of whom saw Quiboloy as a divine figure being unfairly persecuted.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A plane with 48 people aboard skidded off the runway in Indonesia's remote eastern region of Papua on Monday, police said, injuring several passengers.&nbsp;The Southeast Asian archipelago has a poor aviation safety record, and Papua is covered in mountainous terrain where flying is hampered by frequent poor weather.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ATR-42 aircraft belonging to Trigana Air was taking off from an airport in the remote Yapen Islands regency to Papuan capital Jayapura on Monday morning when it skidded off the runway.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi today have signed multiple pacts in the fields of nuclear energy, oil and food parks development.</p>

<p>The two leaders signed an agreement in the field of Barakah Nuclear Power Plant Operations and Maintenance between Emirates Nuclear Energy Company (ENEC) and Nuclear Power Cooperation of India Limited (NPCIL).</p>

<p>Another agreement was signed for long-term LNG supply between Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited. An MoU was signed between ADNOC and India Strategic Petroleum Reserve Limited (ISPRL).</p>

<p>Lastly, an MoU was signed between Government of Gujarat and Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company PJSC (ADQ) on food parks development in India.</p>

<p>After the meeting, the Crown Prince paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. "His teachings continue to inspire us as we strengthen our friendship with UAE," the Ministry of External Affairs wrote on X.</p>

<p>PM Modi received Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>This is the first time India has officially engaged with the next generation of royalty and government from the UAE, highlighting the importance India gives to its ties with the UAE.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince will also call on President Droupadi Murmu.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to visit Mumbai tomorrow, where he will participate in a Business Forum in which top business leaders from both countries will participate.</p>

<p>Since the landmark visit by PM Modi to UAE in August 2015, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 34 years, bilateral relations between the two countries have elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>India is the UAE's second-largest trading partner, while the UAE is India's largest trading partner in the Arab world. Total trade between India and the UAE is projected to reach USD 100 billion by the end of the decade. The bilateral trade between the two countries in 2022-23 was about USD 85 billion, according to official data.</p>

<p>The UAE is also among the top four investors in India in terms of Foreign Direct Investments or FDI in 2022-23.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to hostile exchanges between prosecutor and felon, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are old hands.</p>

<p>But Tuesday's high-stakes debate will be new territory for the Democratic vice president and her Republican rival, due to meet for the first time in front of a prime-time television audience of millions.</p>

<p>"The striking thing about this debate is, it's the first time in history where we'll see a prosecutor and convicted felon facing off against each other," Andrew Koneschusky, a PR expert and former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That's an incredible contrast. I wouldn't expect a lot of intricate policy discussion. I expect we'll see more style than substance."</p>

<p>Students of debating technique identify Trump, who is 78, as an avid proponent of the "Gish Gallop," named for Duane Gish.</p>

<p>Gish, who defended as literally true the Biblical account of the world's creation in six days, would overwhelm opponents with a dizzying torrent of rapid-fire falsehoods, distortions and distractions.</p>

<p>Trump -- who is not known to have a granular grasp of policy -- owes much of his success to this kind of filibustering, as he packs conspiracy theory, anecdote and aside into an arcane, rebuttal-proof word salad.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to debate someone who is quickly changing topics and not fully or truthfully answering the questions," said Flavio Hickel, a politics professor at Maryland liberal arts school Washington College.</p>

<p>But while the "Gish Gallop" may be good at putting opponents on the back foot, it is a risky strategy for someone trying to look presidential, analysts warn.</p>

<h2><strong>'Certainty and strength'</strong></h2>

<p>"As a debater, Trump brings energy, conveys certainty and strength, and never admits error, which translates for many people into presidential qualities," said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and professor at Binghamton University in New York state.</p>

<p>"Of course, they are likely to be coupled with transparent lies, wild exaggerations, unseemly ad hominem attacks and loopy digressions that have the opposite effect, especially on the few undecided voters."</p>

<p>Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket after 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dismal debate performance against Trump led to him dropping out of the race amid questions around his advanced years.</p>

<p>Analysts expect the 59-year-old Californian -- "Kamala the Cop" to her admirers -- to lean into her experience as a district attorney and press Trump on his role in the deadly 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, as well as his multiple criminal cases.</p>

<p>"Harris is a sharp prosecutor," said Keith Gaddie, a politics professor at Texas Christian University.</p>

<p>"She showed her chops debating Biden and others in 2020, and will likely lean into a combination of tricks used by prosecutors to control witnesses, while also cultivating 'jury sympathy.'"</p>

<p>Since Harris's ascension, Democrats' messaging has evolved from presenting Trump as a powerful and existential threat to democracy to minimizing him as "weird" and small.</p>

<p>Koneschusky expects to see more of this in the debate, but warned that Harris faces a balancing act between going after her opponent and using her precious airtime to make her own pitch for the Oval Office.</p>

<h2><strong>Former prosecutor</strong></h2>

<p>"On the one hand, this is a chance for Harris to define herself, and she needs to fully capitalize on that opportunity," he said.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, it's also important that Harris prosecutes the case against Trump in this debate, and she's well-equipped to do so as a former prosecutor. This is something Biden failed to do in the last debate."</p>

<p>One of Harris's standout debate moments came against Biden, ironically, in the 2019-20 Democratic presidential nominating contest, when she took her then-rival to task for his opposition to using federal funds to desegregate schools through busing.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me," Harris said, in a moment that immediately went viral.</p>

<p>But her short-lived 2020 bid for the White House also illustrated weaknesses, as when she allowed herself to be rattled by former Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who savaged Harris over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard has switched sides and Trump has been using her in his debate prep.</p>

<p>The use of muted microphones during the Trump debate may meanwhile deprive Harris of another strength -- her ability to shut down rivals when they try to interrupt.</p>

<p>Harris deployed this to full effect when Mike Pence tried to cut her off during their 2020 vice-presidential debate and she stopped him dead with an ice-cold, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Telegram channel with more than 220,000 participants was reportedly being used to create and share these artificial intelligence-generated pornographic images, serving as a global reminder of the darker consequences from the widespread rush of AI.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea has been rocked by a wave of sexually explicit deepfake images being created and shared online, indiscriminately targeting women and girls using their school photos, social media selfies and even military headshots. A Telegram channel with more than 220,000 participants was reportedly being used to create and share these artificial intelligence-generated pornographic images, serving as a global reminder of the darker consequences from the widespread rush for this technology.</p>

<p>Users could upload photos and in a matter of seconds create explicit content with the faces of their friends, classmates or romantic partners. The initial reporting from local news outlets prompted more women to come forward as victims and more Telegram channels being exposed, revealing the true scale of the issue. Many of the victims involved are minors. Protesters wearing white masks over their eyes gathered in Seoul calling for justice late last month.</p>

<p>As outrage mounted, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called on his government to crack down on the digital abuse, and authorities said they would form a task force to tackle the issue. While police investigated, another disturbing trend emerged. Preliminary data indicate a vast majority of the suspected perpetrators from the recent wave of cases were in their teens.</p>

<p>"Some may dismiss it as a mere prank, but it is clearly a criminal act that exploits technology under the shield of anonymity," Yoon said during a cabinet meeting late last month, acknowledging that many of both the victims and perpetrators were minors.</p>

<p>Yoon is right. This isn't just a prank, and the impact of this type of digital sexual violence can be devastating for victims. A lot of the blame is rightly being placed on Telegram, especially as the scandal is coming to a head at the same time as the platform's Chief Executive Officer Pavel Durov has been arrested and charged in France for alleged complicity in crimes, including the sharing of child pornography, committed on his app. Korean authorities said Telegram is cooperating with the investigation and requests to remove content.</p>

<p>But Yoon's words will ring hollow for some, given he came to power in 2022 courting young male voters with proposals to scrap the gender equality ministry, which he accused of treating men like "potential sex criminals." He also claimed that systemic gender discrimination does not exist in South Korea, and implied feminism was to blame for the country's low birth rate. Meanwhile, women earn some 30% less than their male counterparts, marking the highest gender wage gap in the developed world. Even in dual-income households, women bear the brunt of housework and childcare responsibilities.</p>

<p>And before the recent crop of AI tools made generating deepfake explicit images much easier, advocacy groups had been drawing attention to a rash of digital sex crimes, usually involving non-consensual intimate images or hidden cameras.</p>

<p>There is a host of reasons that South Korean women, like their counterparts across the developed world, are choosing not to have children, including rising participation in the labor force and the uneven toll of raising children. Rather than blame feminism, it might be more useful to look at this mountain of deeply troubling data. Ironically, one of the main Telegram groups spreading these images reportedly had some 227,000 members - that's roughly on par with the number of babies born last year.</p>

<p>South Korean women are boldly bringing this issue to light with protests and activism, the first step in enacting change for a crisis that is impacting people around the globe. Compared to other jurisdictions, the nation is also ahead of the curve when it comes to regulating deepfake porn. It actually has laws in place, including punishments of up to five years in prison and fines for people convicted of creating images with the intent to distribute. In the US, federal legislation has garnered bipartisan support among lawmakers but is still making its way at a snail's pace through Congress.</p>

<p>Regulation is important, but the cases in Korea also expose how difficult enforcement can be for such a widespread problem, as well as how easy it is for this content to be created and shared in the first place. Expanding laws to make it illegal to possess such material could help. But this still puts a lot of responsibility on victims to digitally trace back who created the content that upended their lives.</p>

<p>The Telegram CEO's recent arrest shows there's increased global momentum to hold tech companies accountable for their role in harms taking place on their platforms. This is a step in the right direction; as more regulators shift responsibility to these powerful companies, more industry-led solutions would be welcome. Universities and research centers are developing some promising tools to protect images from AI manipulation. But not enough resources are being devoted to ensuring the responsible rollout of AI from the industry creating it.</p>

<p>More onus must be put on tech companies to come up with proactive solutions. Many tech giants have pulled back on ethical and responsible AI teams in recent years amid broader cost-cutting. But the dignity of women and girls isn't something that should be sacrificed in favor of profit.</p>

<p>South Korea is the current epicenter of this crisis. But it is a global issue that can impact anyone from celebrities like Taylor Swift to middle school girls from Seoul to New Jersey. The tech sector cannot keep skirting responsibility much longer.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two British women have accused controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate of "rape" and "strangulation", the BBC reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two British women have accused controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate of “rape” and “strangulation”, the BBC reported. Andrew Tate and his brother, Tristan, are facing charges of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in Romania. If convicted, the brothers could face jail for over 10 years. Both of them deny the charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrew Tate, currently under house arrest in Romania, is already under investigation for multiple charges, including sex with a minor and human trafficking of underage individuals. New allegations, including testimonies from British women who claim they were attacked by the Tate brothers in the UK before the Romania case began, have also emerged.</p>

<p>“Anna,” not her real name, says she dated Andrew Tate in 2013. She recalls him threatening her before raping and strangling her. “He just looked at me and said, ‘I'm debating whether I should rape you or not,'” she told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyje823er4o ">BBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tate later sent her disturbing messages about enjoying the violence he inflicted. “The more you didn't like it, the more I enjoyed it,” he said in a voice note to the victim. He also wrote in a text message, “I love raping you.”</p>

<p>Another woman, “Sienna,” says she met Tate in 2014 and was strangled to unconsciousness during sex. “I was absolutely terrified,” she told BBC. “I just remember gasping for air... It was rape.” He kept raping her even after she regained consciousness, she said.</p>

<p>She woke up with a bloodshot eye the next day, a common symptom of strangulation in domestic abuse cases. A friend of Sienna's corroborated her account, stating she told him about the incident at the time and he saw her eye injury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two women's allegations follow a series of other similar claims. Many women say Tate used manipulation and control to trap them in abusive situations.</p>

<p>The Tate brothers have faced growing legal challenges, including trafficking and exploitation charges in Romania, where prosecutors say women were transported from the UK for sexual exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite numerous accusations, Andrew Tate denies ever hurting anyone, claiming in a 2023 BBC interview that he never engaged in non-consensual acts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Night owls -- a person who is habitually active or wakeful at night -- tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI), larger waists, and more hidden body fat and thus are almost 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Night owls -- a person who is habitually active or wakeful at night -- tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI), larger waists, and more hidden body fat and thus are almost 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) than those who go to bed earlier, shows new research on Monday.</p>

<p>Previous studies have indicated that late chronotype -- people who prefer to go to bed late and wake up late -- live an unhealthy lifestyle, and are at higher risk of obesity and metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>The new study showed that a late chronotype had a 46 per cent higher risk of developing diabetes, which suggests that the increased risk of T2D can't be explained by lifestyle alone.</p>

<p>"We believe that other mechanisms are also at play," said lead researcher Dr. Jeroen van der Velde, from Leiden University Medical Centre, in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>"A likely explanation is that the circadian rhythm or body clock in late chronotypes is out of sync with the work and social schedules followed by society. This can lead to circadian misalignment, which we know can lead to metabolic disturbances and ultimately type 2 diabetes," van der Velde added.</p>

<p>To explore, the team studied the association between sleep timing, diabetes, and body fat distribution in more than 5,000 individuals who were divided into three groups: early chronotype (20 per cent), late chronotype (20 per cent), and intermediate chronotype (60 per cent).</p>

<p>The team measured all participants' BMI and waist circumference, while visceral fat and liver fat were measured in 1,526 participants, using MRI scans and MR spectroscopy, respectively.</p>

<p>About 225 were diagnosed with diabetes after a follow-up of 6.6 years.</p>

<p>Late chronotypes were found to be at higher risk of developing diabetes, had a 0.7 kg/m2 higher BMI, 1.9 cm larger waist circumference, 7 cm2 more visceral fat, and 14 per cent higher liver fat content, compared with those with an intermediate chronotype.</p>

<p>More visceral fat and liver fat were responsible for making people with a late chronotype to be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, van der Velde said.</p>

<p>The findings will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Madrid, Spain (September 9-13).</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Forget the polls, ditch the data and stop sending journalists to swing-state diners to interview undecided voters: historian Allan Lichtman already knows who is going to win the US presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forget the polls, ditch the data and stop sending journalists to swing-state diners to interview undecided voters: historian Allan Lichtman already knows who is going to win the US presidential election. "Harris will win," Lichtman confidently announced to AFP.</p>

<p>He was speaking at his home in the leafy Washington suburb of Bethesda shortly after unveiling his much-discussed, once-every-four-years White House prediction, based on what he calls the "13 keys" method.</p>

<p>It can be easy to dismiss Lichtman's signature methodology as just another gimmick in the endless, drawn-out "horse race" style coverage of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/search?searchtext=US-Election">US elections</a> -- where journalists, pollsters and pundits are constantly trying to see who is up and who is down.</p>

<p>But the American University history professor has answers for his critics -- and a track record that's hard to beat, having correctly called all but one election since 1984.</p>

<p>Lichtman pays no attention to opinion polls.</p>

<p>Instead, his predictions are based on a series of true-or-false propositions applied to the current presidential administration. If six or more of these "keys" are false, the election will go to the out-of-power challenger -- in this case, Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<h2><strong>Sage of Bethesda?</strong></h2>

<p>One of the keys, for example, posits that the president's party won seats in the most recent midterm elections. The Democrats actually lost control of the House in the 2022 midterms, meaning this particular key is termed "false," tipping the scales toward Trump.</p>

<p>A few more keys break Trump's way: President Joe Biden stepped down, meaning Democrats lost the key which determines the "incumbency," a vital advantage.</p>

<p>Biden's vice president and replacement as nominee, Kamala Harris, is surging on optimism among party faithful. But Lichtman rules that she does not qualify for another of the keys, which is being a charismatic, "once-in-a-generation" candidate in the style of Ronald Reagan or Franklin Roosevelt.</p>

<p>More points to Trump, yes. But after that the keys start breaking in rapid succession for Harris.</p>

<p>For example, the Biden administration's massive environment and infrastructure legislation ticks the box for the key requiring a "major policy change" by the current White House.</p>

<p>Another key for Harris is the exit of fringe independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

<p>She also satisfies the key demanding lack of major scandal.</p>

<p>Do the math and it turns out that only three keys are falling for Trump. But to be declared the presumptive winner, he would have needed six.</p>

<p>And there's another key which could go Harris's way, if the administration reaches a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza.</p>

<p>It's a move that would likely require Democrats to push harder against the Israeli government -- sure to cause strain among poll-obsessed advisors in a party trying to straddle a base that is heavily divided over the issue. Yet, a ceasefire would mean the Democrats actually delivered a policy achievement, Lichtman argues, and deliver one of the keys on foreign policy.</p>

<p>"I don't like to speculate, because the devil is in the details, but that could be seen as a big success," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>Forget the 'noise'</strong></h2>

<p>Critics of the "13 keys" home in on the speculative nature of some of the true-false propositions. What is a charismatic leader, for example?</p>

<p>Yet the sage of Bethesda, as some have dubbed him, is well-versed in arguing his case.</p>

<p>"I've been doing this for 40 years. I think I've heard every conceivable question," he said. "'Aren't your keys subjective?' I obviously have an answer to that -- they're not subjective, they're judgmental.</p>

<p>"We're dealing with human beings. Historians make judgments all the time, and the judgments are very tightly constrained."</p>

<p>Amid the "noise" of national political punditry, Lichtman argues, presidential elections are a simple "vote up or down on the strength and performance of the White House party."</p>

<p>In that way, his method is anti-horse race -- focused on good governance rather than campaigns, since in reality "we forget virtually anything a candidate has to say."</p>

<p>The one election where Lichtman's calculations did not predict the president was the 2000 victory of George W. Bush. Lichtman can defend his record by pointing out that this was a legally complicated nail-biter in which Democrat Al Gore won the popular vote but Bush took victory courtesy of a Supreme Court decision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To address the impact of remote workers on business operations, two UK coffee shops have implemented policies limiting laptop use during peak hours. The Collective in Caversham and Milk and Bean in Newbury have introduced these restrictions to increase table turnover and enhance the overall customer experience.</p>

<p>Manager Alex Middleton told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ndnn6zzno"><em>BBC </em></a>that the policy was about finding a "balance", where it "doesn't compromise us losing money".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Milk and Bean owner Chris Chaplin told the BBC, "Having [people using] laptops isn't really ideal - it does mean a lower turnover and quite a low spend compared to people that aren't on laptops.</p>

<p>"It also brings the vibe of the place down with people on laptops.</p>

<p>"On one hand, we rely on them for revenue, but on the other hand, they've got to be reasonable and have some self-awareness."</p>

<p>Mr Middleton echoed the sentiments: "We are a small independent business, so we need to keep those tables busy and turned around - we can't have people hogging the table and we don't want to disrespect people that come in with laptops either."</p>

<p>He said that people coming in with laptops often had "quite a low spend", but would sit at tables for "quite a long time".</p>

<p>While remote workers contribute to revenue, their extended stays and lower spending can negatively affect a coffee shop's profitability. By implementing these measures, the establishments aim to strike a balance between accommodating customers and ensuring the sustainability of their businesses.</p>

<p>The policies have garnered mixed reactions from patrons, with some expressing support and others expressing concerns. Despite the potential for negative feedback, the coffee shop owners believe that the restrictions are necessary to optimize operations and provide a more equitable environment for all customers.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Many AI builders say this tech promises a path to utopia. Others say it could bring about the collapse of our civilization. In reality, the science-fiction scenarios have distracted us from the more insidious ways AI is threatening to harm society.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After clicking the link to this article and reading these first few words, you might be half-wondering if a human wrote them. Don't worry, I'm not offended. Two years ago, the thought wouldn't have even crossed your mind. But today, machines are generating articles, books, illustrations and computer code that seem indistinguishable from the content created by people.</p>

<p>Remember the "novel-writing machine" in the dystopian future of George Orwell's 1984 and his "versificator" that wrote popular music? Those things exist now, and the change happened so fast that it's given the public whiplash, leaving us wondering whether some of today's office workers will have jobs in the next five to 10 years. Millions of white-collar professionals suddenly look vulnerable. Talented young illustrators are wondering if they should bother going to art school.</p>

<p>What's remarkable is how quickly this has all come to pass. In the 15 years that I've written about the technology industry, I've never seen a field move as quickly as artificial intelligence has in just the last two years. The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked a race to create a whole new kind of AI that didn't just process information but generated it. Back then, AI tools could produce wonky images of dogs. Now they are churning out photorealistic pictures of Donald Trump with pores and skin texture that look lifelike.</p>

<p>Many AI builders say this technology promises a path to utopia. Others say it could bring about the collapse of our civilization. In reality, the science-fiction scenarios have distracted us from the more insidious ways AI is threatening to harm society by perpetuating deep-seated biases, threatening entire creative industries, and more.</p>

<p>Behind this invisible force are companies that have grabbed control of AI's development and raced to make it more powerful. Driven by an insatiable hunger to grow, they've cut corners and misled the public about their products, putting themselves on course to become highly questionable stewards of AI.</p>

<p>No other organizations in history have amassed so much power or touched so many people as today's technology juggernauts. Alphabet Inc.'s Google conducts web searches for 90% of Earth's internet users, and Microsoft Corp. software is used by 70% of humans with a computer. The release of ChatGPT sparked a new AI boom, one that since November 2022 has added a staggering $6.7 trillion to the market valuations of the six Big Tech firms - Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft and most recently, Nvidia Corp.</p>

<p>Yet none of these companies are satisfied. Microsoft has vied for a chunk of Google's $150 billion search business, and Google wants Microsoft's $110 billion cloud business. To fight their war, each company has grabbed the ideas of others. Dig into this a bit deeper, and you'll find that AI's present reality has really been written by two men: Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis.</p>

<p>One is a scrawny and placid entrepreneur in his late 30s who wears sneakers to the office. The latter is a former chess champion in his late 40s who's obsessed with games. Both are fiercely intelligent, charming leaders who sketched out visions of AI so inspiring that people followed them with cult-like devotion. Both got here because they were obsessed with winning. Altman was the reason the world got ChatGPT. Hassabis was the reason we got it so quickly. Their journey has not only defined today's race but also the challenges coming our way, including a daunting struggle to steer AI's ethical future when it is under the control of so few incumbents.</p>

<p>Hassabis risked scientific ridicule when he established DeepMind in 2010, the first company in the world intent on building AI that was as smart as a human being. He wanted to make scientific discoveries about the origins of life, the nature of reality and cures for disease. "Solve intelligence, and then solve everything else," he said.</p>

<p>A few years later, Altman started OpenAI to try to build the same thing but with a greater focus on bringing economic abundance to humanity, increasing material wealth, and helping "us all live better lives," he tells me. "This can be the greatest tool humans have yet created, and let each of us do things far outside the realm of the possible."</p>

<p>Their plans were more ambitious than even the zealous Silicon Valley visionaries. They planned to build AI that was so powerful it could transform society and make the fields of economics and finance obsolete. And Altman and Hassabis alone would be the purveyors of its gifts.</p>

<p>In their quest to build what could become humankind's last invention, both men grappled with how such transformative technology should be controlled. At first they believed that tech monoliths like Google and Microsoft shouldn't steer it outright, because those firms prioritized profit over humanity's well-being. So for years and on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, they both fumbled for novel ways to structure their research labs to protect AI and make benevolence its priority. They promised to be AI's careful custodians.</p>

<p>But both also wanted to be first. To build the most powerful software in history, they needed money and computing power, and their best source was Silicon Valley. Over time, both Altman and Hassabis decided they needed the tech giants after all. As their efforts to create superintelligent AI became more successful and as strange new ideologies buffeted them from different directions, they compromised on their noble goals. They handed over control to companies that rushed to sell AI tools to the public with virtually no oversight from regulators, and with far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>This concentration of power in AI threatened to reduce competition and herald new intrusions into private life and new forms of racial and gender prejudice. Ask some popular AI tools to generate images of women, and they'll make them scantily clad by default; ask for photorealistic CEOs, and they'll generate images of White men. Some systems when asked for a criminal will generate images of Black men. In a ham-fisted effort to fix those stereotypes, Google released an image-generating tool in February 2024 that badly overcompensated, then shut it down. Such systems are on track to be woven into our media feeds, smartphones and justice systems, sometimes without due care for how they might shape public opinion, thanks to a relative lack of investment in ethics and safety research.</p>

<p>Altman and Hassabis' journey was not all that different from one two centuries ago, when two entrepreneurs named Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse went to war. Each had pursued a dream of creating a dominant system for delivering electricity to millions of consumers. Both were inventors-turned-entrepreneurs, and both understood that their technology would one day power the modern world. The question was this: Whose version of the technology would come out on top? In the end, Westinghouse's more efficient electrical standard became the most popular in the world. But he didn't win the so-called War of the Currents. Edison's much larger company, General Electric, did.</p>

<p>As corporate interests pushed Altman and Hassabis to unleash bigger and more powerful models, it's been the tech titans who've emerged as the winners, only this time the race was to replicate our own intelligence.</p>

<p>Now the world has been thrown into a tailspin. Generative AI promises to make people more productive and bring more useful information to our fingertips through tools like ChatGPT. But every innovation has a price to pay. Businesses and governments are adjusting to a new reality where the distinction between real and "AI-generated" is a crapshoot. Companies are throwing money at AI software to help displace their employees and boost profit margins. And devices that can conduct new levels of personal surveillance are cropping up.</p>

<p>We got here after the visions of two innovators who tried to build AI for good were eventually ground down by the forces of monopoly. Their story is one of idealism but also one of naivety and ego - and of how it can be virtually impossible to keep an ethical code in the bubbles of Big Tech and Silicon Valley. Altman and Hassabis tied themselves into knots over the stewardship of AI, knowing that the world needed to manage the technology responsibly if we were to stop it from causing irreversible harm. But they couldn't forge AI with godlike power without the resources of the world's largest tech firms. With the goal of enhancing human life, they would end up empowering those companies, leaving humanity's welfare and future caught in a battle for corporate supremacy.</p>

<p>After selling DeepMind to Google in 2014, Hassabis and his co-founders tried for years to spin out and restructure themselves as a nonprofit-style organization. They wanted to protect their increasingly powerful AI systems from being under the sole control of a tech monolith, and they worked on creating a board of independent luminaries that included former heads of state like Barack Obama to oversee its use. They even designed a new legal charter that would prioritize human well-being and the environment. Google appeared to go along with the plan at first and promised its entity billions of dollars, but its executives were stringing the founders along. In the end, Google tightened its grip on DeepMind, making the research lab that once focused on "solving intelligence" to help cure cancer or solve climate change now largely focused on developing its core AI product, Gemini.</p>

<p>Sam Altman made a similar kind of shift, having founded OpenAI on the premise of building AI for the benefit of humanity, "free from financial obligations." He has spent the last seven years twisting out of that commitment, restructuring his nonprofit as a "capped profit" company so that it could take billions of investment from Microsoft, to effectively become a product arm for the software firm. Now he is reportedly looking to restructure again in order to become more investor friendly and raise several billion more dollars. One likely outcome: He'll neuter the nonprofit board that ensures OpenAI serves humanity's best interests.</p>

<p>After the release of ChatGPT, I was struck by how these two innovators had both pivoted from their humanitarian visions. Sure, Silicon Valley's grand promises of making the world a better place often look like a ruse when its companies make addictive or mediocre services, and its founders become billionaires. But there's something more unsettling about Altman and Hassabis' shift away from their founding principles. They were both trying to build artificial general intelligence, or computers that could surpass our brainpower. The ramifications were huge. And their pivots have now brought new levels of influence and power to today's tech giants. The rest of us are set to find out the price.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk denied a report that his artificial intelligence startup xAI has held talks for a share in future Tesla revenue in return for giving Musk's electric vehicle maker access to xAI's technology and resources.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Tesla would license xAI's artificial-intelligence models to help power its driver-assistance software, full self-driving technology and share some of that revenue with the startup, according to the proposed arrangement as described to investors.</p>

<p>"Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI," Musk posted late on Saturday on his social media platform X, adding that the report is "not accurate."</p>

<p>The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter whom it did not identify, said xAI would support the development of other features for Tesla, including a voice assistant in its electric cars and software to power its humanoid robot Optimus.</p>

<p>The terms of any revenue-sharing agreement between xAI and Tesla would depend in part upon how extensively Tesla relied on xAI's technology as opposed to its own, the report said, adding that xAI executives have discussed an even revenue split from Tesla's FSD.</p>

<p>xAI could not be reached for a comment.</p>

<p>Musk launched xAI last year to compete with Microsoft-backed OpenAI. It sparked concerns that he might allocate some resources of the automaker to the AI company.</p>

<p>He has said xAI would be "helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center," adding that there were opportunities to integrate xAI's chatbot, Grok, with Tesla's software.</p>

<p>In July, the billionaire CEO said he and the Tesla board would discuss a $5 billion investment in xAI.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

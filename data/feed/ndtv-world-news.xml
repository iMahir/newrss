       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan on Thursday said it would host the SCO Heads of Government meeting in October and invite all heads of government of the member states of the grouping.</p>

<p>Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at the weekly press briefing that Pakistan as the rotating Chairmanship of the SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) would host the SCO Heads of Governments Meeting in October this year.</p>

<p>When asked if Pakistan would extend an invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit and attend the Summit in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Baloch replied, "The chairmanship belongs to Pakistan, so in our capacity as the chair, we will be extending invitations to all Heads of Government of SCO member states." "This conference will take place in person and we hope and expect that all members of SCO will be represented at the Heads of Governments Meeting being held in October," she said.</p>

<p>She said the October summit will be preceded by a Ministerial meeting and several rounds of Senior Officials meetings, focusing on the financial, economic, socio-cultural and humanitarian cooperation among the SCO member states.</p>

<p>Baloch also said that Pakistan would not become a part of any bloc in international politics as it believed in having good ties with all countries.</p>

<p>"I would first like to clarify that Pakistan has repeatedly said that we are not part of any bloc. We do not believe in bloc politics. We believe in good relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect, mutual confidence and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs," she said.</p>

<p>She said Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless assertions made about Pakistan in the recent report on religious freedom released by the US Department of State and as a matter of principle, Pakistan opposes such unilateral reports that make observations on the internal affairs of sovereign states.</p>

<p>"We believe that International Religious Freedom cannot be viewed from the lens of any single country's social and legal perspective," it said.</p>

<p>It said unilateral reports assessing other countries' human rights situations are not free from political bias and present an incomplete and distorted picture and the methodology adopted in preparing these reports and the mandate and expertise of its authors are not transparent.</p>

<p>"We strongly believe that each State itself has the primary responsibility to promote and protect the religious rights and freedoms of its nationals," she said, adding that Pakistani citizens are entitled to the freedom of religion and belief under the law and as enshrined in Pakistan's constitution.</p>

<p>She said that during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Tajikistan this week, the two sides signed the Pakistan-Tajikistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, which would be based on five pillars of bilateral cooperation, including political, trade and investment, energy and connectivity, security and defence, and people-to-people contacts.</p>

<p>It will include structured high-level dialogue at the leadership and Foreign Ministers' level.</p>

<p>She termed the UN group report on Imran Khan as unwarranted and said, "I would like to underline that a report on any particular case is unwarranted when it lacks objectivity and is based on an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of Pakistan's legal and judicial system".</p>

<p>The report said that cases against Khan were politically motivated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May 2024, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a surprise snap election announcement. Now, the UK will vote on July 4 and the focus, apart from the Prime Minister's Conservative Party, is on Keir Starmer, the Labour Party's candidate and the leader of the opposition. Mr Starmer is not a firebrand politician, but the Labour Party believes his steady and dependable leadership is exactly what Britain needs after 14 years of Conservative rule. At 61, Mr Starmer is favourite to win the upcoming election.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some facts about Keir Starmer:</strong></p>

<p>1. Keir Starmer was born on September 2, 1962, in Oxted, Surrey, in a working-class family. His mother, a dedicated NHS nurse, battled a rare and severe case of rheumatoid arthritis, while his father worked as a toolmaker. Mr Starmer attended Reigate Grammar School and was the first in his family to attend university. He studied Law at Leeds University.</p>

<p>2. Before he ventured into politics, Mr Starmer was a distinguished human rights defence lawyer. Dubbed a "lefty lawyer" for his commitment to social justice, he began his career in 1987 as a barrister and co-founded Doughty Street Chambers in 1990. He specialised in human rights cases, representing clients through legal aid and pro bono work. His expertise earned him a Queen's Counsel (QC) appointment in 2002 and recognition as QC of the Year. Mr Starmer represented the "McLibel Two" in their landmark defamation suit against McDonald's. He also travelled to the Caribbean and Africa to represent defendants facing the death penalty. He also challenged the Tony Blair government's invasion of Iraq, drafting legal arguments against the war.</p>

<p>3. Mr Starmer was the legal advisor to the Northern Ireland Policing Board for five years from 2003 to 2008. This was a critical time in the region's history, following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which was a significant step towards peace after decades of conflict. During this time, he met his wife, Victoria, who was working for the National Health Service (NHS). The couple got married in 2007 and have two children.</p>

<p>4. In 2008, Mr Starmer was appointed Director of Public Prosecutions, leading the Crown Prosecution Service and managing its thousands of employees. During his tenure, he handled several high-profile cases, including the Stephen Lawrence murder case. His contributions to criminal justice were recognised with a knighthood conferred by the late Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2014.</p>

<p>5. Keir Starmer entered politics in 2015 as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, quickly taking on key roles in the Labour Party. He served as Shadow Immigration Minister from 2015 to 2016. Following Jeremy Corbyn's resignation in 2019, Mr Starmer was elected the Labour Party leader in 2020. Mr Starmer promised a culture change; his mantra -- the country before the party. He opposed Britain's decision to leave the European Union but clarified that a Labour government would not rejoin the group, which now has 27 members. If elected as the country's Prime Minister, Mr Starmer promises to bring stability and change.</p>

<p>The Labour Party's manifesto focuses on key initiatives such as hiring 6,500 new teachers, expanding childcare and providing free breakfast clubs in primary schools. They aim to improve economic security by creating more stable jobs, reforming Universal Credit and strengthening housing regulations. The manifesto also talks about support for mental health in schools, reforming social care and advancing equality for women, ethnic minorities, disabled individuals and the LGBT+ community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Thursday he has agreed to send a delegation for talks on securing the release of hostages seized in the October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>In a statement after telephone talks with US President Joe Biden, Netanyahu's office said: "The prime minister updated President Biden about his decision to send a delegation that would continue negotiations for freeing the hostages."&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was no indication where the delegation would go or when it would leave.</p>

<p>In its own readout of the phone call, the White House said Biden welcomed the decision to have Israeli negotiators "engage" with mediators in a bid "to close out the deal".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netanyahu called a meeting of his security cabinet for later Thursday to discuss new proposals sent by Hamas through Qatari mediators, media reports said.</p>

<p>Hamas has demanded an end to the fighting and an Israeli withdrawal as a prelude to any hostage deal.</p>

<p>Israel has countered that there can be no end to the war without the release of hostages in the Palestinian territory. Netanyahu has also repeatedly vowed that the Gaza campaign will not end until Hamas's military and government capabilities have been destroyed.</p>

<p>Hamas said late Wednesday that it had sent new "ideas" for a potential deal and Netanyahu's office said the government was "evaluating" them.</p>

<p>Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been mediating between the two sides and sources close to their efforts said there had been a renewed push to bridge the "gaps" between the foes in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Biden announced a pathway to a truce deal in May which he said had been proposed by Israel and which included a six-week truce to allow for talks and eventually a programme to rebuild devastated Gaza.</p>

<p>"There are important developments in the latest proposals with positive options for both sides," said a diplomat briefed on the latest proposals. "This time the Americans are very serious about this."</p>

<p>The war started with the October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has approved a new payment of more than $140 million to the Palestinian Authority after announcing it had also unblocked some funds frozen because of the Gaza war, a finance ministry spokesperson told AFP on Thursday.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war on Hamas, far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has withheld payments of customs and tax duties to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's administration.</p>

<p>But Israeli officials said on Wednesday that the government had made a 435 million shekel ($116 million) payment for duties collected for April and May.</p>

<p>A finance ministry spokeswoman said a further payment of about 530 million shekels for duties collected for June was approved.</p>

<p>Israel collects tax and customs duties for the Palestinian Authority under a 1994 protocol, which granted sole control over the territories' borders to Israel.</p>

<p>According to economists, the payments collected by Israel account for 60 percent of the cash-strapped authority's revenues.</p>

<p>Palestinian Authority prime minister Mohammed Mustafa confirmed the 435 million shekel payment at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He said the money would be used for unpaid wages for tens of thousands of Palestinian civil servants and suppliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Authority workers have been living on reduced wages for months and the PA has made repeated appeals for international aid.</p>

<p>Mustafa added that Israel still owed the authority six billion shekels in back payments.</p>

<p>Israel stopped making the payments after the October 7 Hamas attacks in southern Israel, with Smotrich accusing the PA of backing the Islamist operatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas is designated a "terrorist" organisation by the United States, the European Union and other countries. It is distinct from the Palestinian Authority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas took over Gaza in 2007 following a violent struggle with Abbas' Fatah faction, with the Palestinian Authority's influence limited to Palestinian-run parts of the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>According to Israeli media reports, Smotrich only agreed to make the new payments under a deal in which the government recognised five wildcat settlements in the West Bank.</p>

<p>In June, he ordered the transfer of about $35 million of the funds collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority to help Israeli "victims of terrorism". The decision was condemned by the US government as "extraordinarily wrongheaded".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he took seriously US presidential candidate Donald Trump's comments that he could bring about a quick end to the fighting in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Trump had said during a debate with President Joe Biden last week that if elected, he would have the conflict "settled" before he took office in January 2025.</p>

<p>"The fact that Mr. Trump as a presidential candidate is saying that he is ready and wants to stop the war in Ukraine, we take that quite seriously," Putin said at a press conference in Astana.</p>

<p>Russia usually refers to its military offensive on Ukraine as a "special military operation."</p>

<p>Putin added that he was "not familiar" with Trump's specific proposals to end the fighting, now in its third year.</p>

<p>"That, of course, is the key question," Putin said.</p>

<p>"But I have no doubt that he says it sincerely, and we support it," he added.</p>

<p>Putin has always claimed to be open to talks on ending the conflict, though last month demanded Ukraine effectively capitulate as a precondition of a ceasefire.</p>

<p>The Kremlin leader had called for Ukraine to pull its troops out of the south and east of the country, vacating territory currently held by its forces, if it wanted Russia's offensive to end.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea of a temporary ceasefire, which he says Russia would use to regroup and rearm.</p>

<p>Kyiv wants Russian forces out of the country entirely, including the Crimea peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014, as part of any settlement, and for Russia to pay compensation for damage and destruction caused by the conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian troops have made modest advances on the battlefield this year after a Ukrainian counter-offensive in 2023 was largely unsuccessful.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian authorities Thursday sentenced to death a woman labour activist on charges of links to an outlawed Kurdish organisation, rights groups said.</p>

<p>Sharifeh Mohammadi, initially arrested in December in Rasht, Iran, was convicted of the capital crime of rebellion and sentenced to death, said the Norway-based Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.</p>

<p>She is accused of being a member of the Kurdish separatist Komala party, which is banned in Iran. Hengaw said she endured "physical and mental torture" by intelligence agents while in custody.</p>

<p>A revolutionary court in Rasht, the main city of Gilan province on the Caspian Sea, convicted and sentenced her to death following a hearing, the groups said.</p>

<p>A source close to her family said Mohammadi was a member of a local labour organisation and had "nothing to do with Komala".</p>

<p>The US-based Iran-focused rights group Abdorrahman Boroumand Center said the death sentence was linked to "her involvement with an independent labour union".</p>

<p>"This extreme ruling highlights the harsh crackdown on dissent within Iran, particularly against labour activists amid economic turmoil," it added.</p>

<p>A campaign set up to support her case wrote on its social media accounts that the ruling was "absurd and unfounded" and aimed to create "fear and intimidation" among activists in Gilan province.</p>

<p>Gilan was a major centre for protests that erupted in 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman arrested for allegedly violating dress rules for women.</p>

<p>Rights activists have accused Iranian authorities of using the death penalty as a tool to intimidate the entire population in response to the protests.</p>

<p>The non-governmental group Iran Human Rights said at least 249 people, including 10 women, were executed in Iran in the first six months of 2024.</p>

<p>It warned of the risk of a "sharp increase" in executions after Iran's presidential election runoff on Friday, which will pit ultraconservative Saeed Jalili against reformist Masoud Pezeshkian.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>St. Philip's church once offered a haven of devotion to Gaza's small Christian community. After nine months of Israeli military action that has devastated the Palestinian enclave's health system, priests have turned it into a hospital.</p>

<p>Beds line the pale stone walls under a vaulted roof as doctors tend to patients unable to find a space at the Anglican-run Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital, which like Gaza's other remaining medical facilities is straining under high demand.</p>

<p>"The space designated for prayers was converted into a clinic due to the lack of available places. Today, our priority is to save the life of every human being that we can," said priest Munther Isaac, wearing a black shirt and clerical collar.</p>

<p>A man stood by one bed, fanning the elderly patient lying with an oxygen mask over his mouth. Crosses were carved into the walls of the nave. St Philip's is located in the same compound as the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital.</p>

<p>"There was no place to admit patients to the departments so we were forced to turn to this place, which is a place for Christians to worship here in Gaza," said Doctor Mohammed al-Sheikh.</p>

<p>"Due to the shortage of supplies we used pews as beds for the patients," he added.</p>

<p>The war began on Oct. 7 when fighters from the Palestinian group Hamas stormed border defences to raid communities in Israel, killing 1,200 people and grabbing about 250 as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's assault on Gaza in response began the same day with a pounding bombardment that has continued for nine months along with a ground invasion that Palestinian health authorities say has killed more than 38,000 people and injured more than 80,000.</p>

<p>The high number of injured from the conflict has added to the rampant disease and malnutrition among the 90% of Gaza residents that the U.N. says have been made homeless, putting massive pressure on the enclave's health system.</p>

<p>However, Israel's military campaign has put many hospitals and other health facilities out of action, according to the World Health Organisation, and caused major shortages of needed medical supplies.</p>

<p>Israel denies deliberately targeting health facilities or stopping medical supplies getting into Gaza.</p>

<p>"In this church, which is no longer a house of worship but has been turned into a nursing facility, we are getting some basic medical services," said Abu Mohammed Abu Samra, who was accompanying his sick mother being treated at St. Philip's.</p>

<p>"It shows the solidarity between Muslims and Christians in northern Gaza," he added.</p>

<p>While there is a significant Palestinian Christian population in the West Bank, the Christian community is very small in Gaza, which since 2006 has been controlled by the Islamist group Hamas.</p>

<p>Outside St. Philip's, life in Gaza continued, the signs of war damage visible on the busy street as a man cycled past.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British teacher who had&nbsp;sex&nbsp;with two teenage students and had a baby with one of them was sentenced Thursday to six and a half years in jail.</p>

<p>Rebecca Joynes, 30, was on police bail for&nbsp;sexual activity with one victim, identified as Boy A, when she began having&nbsp;sex&nbsp;with the second, Boy B, by whom she became pregnant.</p>

<p>Sentencing Joynes, a judge said she had been a "high achiever" who had thrown her career away and had her baby taken away from her through her own actions.</p>

<p>Joynes groomed the schoolboys from the age of 15, exchanging messages on social media before engaging in&nbsp;sexual activity, prosecutors told the court.</p>

<p>She was found guilty by a jury of six counts of engaging in&nbsp;sexual activity with a child, including two while being in a position of trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neither of the boys can be identified by name.</p>

<p>Passing sentence at Manchester Crown Court in northwestern England, Judge Kate Cornell told the former teacher she had behaved with "breathtaking arrogance".</p>

<p>"You were the person in control, the person who should have known better," she said.</p>

<p>"Instead, you abused that position of trust and exploited the privileged role for your own&nbsp;sexual gratification."</p>

<p>In a statement to the court, Boy B said he had been "coerced and controlled, manipulated,&nbsp;sexually abused, and mentally abused" by Joynes.</p>

<p>The court previously heard that when police opened an investigation into her relationship with Boy A, she was warned not to have unsupervised contact with anyone under 18.</p>

<p>But she then began a relationship with Boy B and later gave birth to his child. The baby was removed from her care within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Outside court, Detective Constable Beth Alexander said there was still a lack of understanding about men and boys being the victims of&nbsp;sexual offences.</p>

<p>"They have had to read comments stating others are 'jealous' of them, and that they should be 'happy a young female teacher was interested in them', and this rhetoric is very damaging and dangerous", she told reporters.</p>

<p>"Women can still be paedophiles. This term is not reserved only for men. Men and boys can still be victims of&nbsp;sexual abuse," she said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian court on Thursday sentenced U.S. citizen Robert Romanov Woodland to 12-1/2 years in a maximum security penal colony after finding him guilty of attempting to sell drugs, Woodland's lawyer and Moscow prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Stanislav Kshevitsky, his lawyer, told Reuters that Woodland, who was detained in Russia in early January, had partially admitted his guilt.</p>

<p>Video footage released by the authorities showed a shaven-headed Woodland inside a glass courtroom cage listening intently, but with little emotion, as the verdict was read out.</p>

<p>Moscow's prosecutors office said in a statement that Woodland, acting as part of a large-scale criminal group, had transported about 50 grams of mephedrone, a kind of amphetamine, from a pick-up point outside Moscow and brought the drugs to an apartment in the city, where he packed them for further sale.</p>

<p>He was arrested as he was dropping the drugs into a safe cache, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old is one of a growing list of Americans who have been detained in Russia amid the greatest breakdown in relations between the two powers in decades.</p>

<p>Washington has repeatedly warned all Americans to leave Russia immediately, citing the risk of wrongful detentions and harassment from Russian security services.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Known to his friends as "Rob," Woodland was adopted from Russia in 1993 by American parents, he told a Russian newspaper in 2020.</p>

<p>Woodland, who appears to have both Russian and American passports, said he had returned to Russia to meet his biological mother. Their tearful reunion was broadcast on Russian state television.</p>

<p>A Facebook account in the name of Robert Woodland indicated that he had been working as an English teacher in Russia, and lived outside Moscow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The progress made by India in developing Iran's Chabahar Port not only holds "great value" to landlocked Central Asian states but also "de-risks" commerce between India and Eurasia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who is in Astana to attend the SCO Summit, delivered Modi's remarks at the extended format meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State here in the Kazakh capital.</p>

<p>He also said, "While standing resolute on challenges, it is equally important to actively and collaboratively explore avenues of progress. The current global debate is focused on creating new connectivity linkages that would better serve a rebalanced world." "If this is to gather serious momentum, it requires the joint efforts of many. It must also be respectful of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and be built on the foundation of non-discriminatory trade and transit rights to neighbours."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For the SCO extended family, we flag the progress made on Chabahar port recently through a long-term agreement between India and Iran. This not only holds great value to landlocked Central Asian states but also de-risks commerce between India and Eurasia," he said.</p>

<p>The Chabahar port on the Gulf of Oman - which India proposed to develop way back in 2003 - will provide Indian goods with a gateway to reach landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asia using a road and rail project called the International North-South Transport Corridor, bypassing Pakistan.</p>

<p>US sanctions on Iran over its suspected nuclear programme had slowed the development of the port.</p>

<p>In May, India signed a 10-year contract to operate the strategic Iranian port of Chabahar which will help it expand trade with Central Asia.</p>

<p>Chabahar port was last year used by India to send 20,000 tonnes of wheat aid to Afghanistan. In 2021, the same was used to supply environmentally friendly pesticides to Iran.</p>

<p>This is the first time India will take over the management of an overseas port that will also have a multiplier effect on trade among India, Iran and Afghanistan as efforts continue to directly tap the potential in Central Asia, bypassing neighbouring Pakistan.</p>

<p>India has been developing a part of the Chabahar Port and discussions on the development of the port date back to 2003 during Iranian President Muhammad Khatami's visit to India.</p>

<p>Chabahar is an oceanic port. By leveraging Chabahar Port, India aims to bypass Pakistan and establish direct access to Afghanistan and beyond, into Central Asia. Kandla port in Gujarat is the closest to the Chabahar port at 550 nautical miles while the distance between Chabahar and Mumbai is 786 nautical miles.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The woman lied to the doctors and relatives that her parents were unwell, on holiday or on vacation to cover her tracks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from the United Kingdom pleaded guilty to murdering her parents and living in their home for several years after, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/virginia-mccullough-murder-parents-chelmsford-b2573910.html"><em>Independent</em></a>. Virginia McCullough, 36, entered a guilty plea to the murders of Lois McCullough, aged 71, and John McCullough, aged 70, between June 17 and June 20, 2019, during her appearance via prison video call at Chelmsford Crown Court on Thursday. She hid their bodies inside the house and kept residing at that location.</p>

<p>The woman lied to the doctors and relatives that her parents were unwell, on holiday or on vacation to cover her tracks. Her actions came to light on September 15, 2023, when Essex police executed a warrant at the Pump Hill residence after her parents' doctors expressed concerns about missing visits. At that point, the 36-year-old admitted to stabbing her mother and poisoning her father with prescription drugs, according to the cops.</p>

<p>McCullough confirmed her identity, entered guilty pleas to both counts and stated that she understood the judge's remarks. She will be sentenced on October 10 and 11.</p>

<p>As per the outlet, Judge Christopher Morgan said, "You will understand that there is a single sentence that can be passed upon you in these circumstances. Consideration however has to be given to the minimum term."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, people living around the neighbourhood described the woman as "quite chatty" and a "little bit odd", according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/04/woman-virginia-mccullough-pleads-guilty-murdering-parents-family-home-essex"><em>The Guardian</em></a>. Dave Oldershaw, a neighbour, said McCullough was "carrying on, going up to the Chinese (takeaway) like nothing has happened". He "thought she lived on her own" at the house and stated that he "only knew her to say hello to - she wasn't trouble."</p>

<p>A worker at a nearby shop said the woman had told him her parents had moved to be by the seaside. He said he had not seen them since the Covid-19 pandemic but would previously "see them two or three times per week".</p>

<p>According to the employee, McCullough appeared "a little bit odd sometimes." "She would come in and go 'do you want a coffee' then five minutes later, there would be a coffee sitting there," the worker continued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's far-right National Rally (RN) party is expected to fall short of an absolute majority in the second round of parliamentary elections on Sunday, an opinion poll showed on Thursday.</p>

<p>It was the second survey in as many days to show Marine Le Pen's RN winning more seats than any other party - but also missing the 289 threshold required for an absolute majority.</p>

<p>This suggested that a "republican front," by which more than 200 candidates across the political spectrum pulled out of three-way second rounds to clear the path for whoever was best placed to defeat the RN runner in their district, seemed to be working.</p>

<p>The IFOP poll for LCI and Le Figaro showed the RN winning 210 to 240 seats, down from 240-270 before the withdrawals.</p>

<p>The leftist New Popular Front was seen in second place, with 170 to 200 seats, ahead of President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Together group with 95 to 125 seats. The conservative Republicans were forecast to win 25 to 45 seats.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a Harris Interactive poll forecast 190 to 220 seats for the RN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the voting for snap general elections began on Thursday, the Indian community in the United Kingdom expressed confidence that the Labour Party would end the nearly 15-year stint of the Conservatives.</p>

<p>The Indian-origin UK residents, in a conversation with ANI, also acknowledged that Rishi Sunak has done a good job as Prime Minister, but the party will lose because of the "mess" created by his predecessors.</p>

<p>Polling opened at 7 am (local time) today and will close at 10 pm.</p>

<p>The six-week campaign that saw all major parties comb the nation will end today with the voting to decide the next Prime Minister of the country.</p>

<p>Voters in a total of 650 constituencies across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will cast their votes in the election.</p>

<p>A party needs to win at least 326 out of 650 parliamentary seats and the leader of that party becomes prime minister.</p>

<p>An Indian-origin resident from Gujarat said that, as per expectations, the Labour Party should win because of the instability and poor performance under Conservative rule.He, however, also acknowledged that Labour's 'internal problems' could upset their chances.</p>

<p>"I think if the current political trends are anything to go about and if they continue till the end of the polling day, I think Labour should come back with a resounding victory," a UK resident said.</p>

<p>"What is going to happen is that they (Conservatives) are going to lose. There are some reasons for that as well. There has been a mess...they have changed so many prime ministers and the services are in a mess. The National Health Service (NHS) is in a mess and other things are in a mess. So I personally believe that Labour should come back with a victory," he added.</p>

<p>Expressing support for the incumbent Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, the UK resident said that he is a good PM. He said that the Conservative Party will lose due to problems created by previous leaders, not because of the current Prime Minister's performance.</p>

<p>"He (Rishi Sunak) is a good prime minister. Unfortunately, if the Conservatives lose, which sounds sure, it's not because of him. It's because of the mess that the others made. Because he is a very good Prime Minister, he didn't have enough time as well, because when he came as Prime Minister, there was only a year or something left for the next elections as well. So I would personally love to see him as the Prime Minister," he told ANI.</p>

<p>Another Indian-origin lady also affirmed confidence that the Labour Party will win. She, however, also said that she likes PM Rishi Sunak.</p>

<p>"I am definitely sure if Labour came, it would support us. Rishi Sunak is a nice person. But it's a Labour wave, so Labour will come in. Basically, I support both but definitely Labour is beneficial for us," said Brinda.</p>

<p>Another resident gave a similar prediction, saying the Rishi Sunak-led Conservative Party would end up losing the elections.</p>

<p>"So we're not going to see Rishi Sunak this time? No, definitely not," he said.</p>

<p>On being asked the issues faced by the Indian community, another UK resident said that the people are facing difficulties due to the current immigration rules.</p>

<p>He also said the next government should work on reducing college fees, reducing unemployment.</p>

<p>The Conservative Party, which has been in power in the United Kingdom for around 15 years, faces a mounting task while heading into the general elections under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's leadership, with most polls predicting the return of a Labour government in the country for the first time since 2010.</p>

<p>Polling suggests the vote will result in a Labour majority after more than a decade of Conservative rule under five leaders, including current PM Rishi Sunak and David Cameron, now foreign secretary, as per Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>The status of Britain's public services, the cost of living, taxes, immigration, and the economy will remain major subjects, around which much of the debate during the campaigns have revolved, according to CNN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the 'Make in India' initiative can add to engines of global growth and help democratise the global economy, and highlighted the importance of creating multiple, reliable and resilient supply chains.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who is in Astana to attend the SCO Summit, delivered PM Modi's remarks at the extended format meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State here in the Kazakh capital.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that India has contributed significantly to enhancing the economic agenda of the SCO grouping with institutionalised mechanisms such as the SCO Startup Forum and Special Working Group on Startup and Innovation.</p>

<p>With 130,000 startups in India, including 100 unicorns, our experience can be useful to others, a Ministry of External Affairs statement cited the prime minister as saying in his remarks.</p>

<p>"When it comes to geo-economics, the need of the day is to create multiple, reliable and resilient supply chains. This is an important takeaway from the Covid experience. 'Make in India' can add to engines of global growth and help democratise the global economy. India is open to partnering with others in capacity building, especially nations of the Global South," the statement said.</p>

<p>The prime minister said technology not only held great promise in his times but was increasingly a game changer in both development and security. "The digital era needs more trust and transparency. AI and Cyber security raise crucial issues of their own," he said.</p>

<p>"When it comes to medical and wellness tourism, you may be aware that World Health Organisation has set up a Global Centre for Traditional Medicine in Gujarat. In SCO, India has taken the initiative for a new SCO Working Group on Traditional Medicine," the prime minister said.</p>

<p>"Enhancing education, training, and capacity-building are key pillars of India's international cooperation. We are committed to further building on them, be it with the C5 partners, or those of 'Neighbourhood First' or the extended neighbourhood." "India has shown that digital public infrastructure and digital financial inclusion can make such a huge difference. Both were discussed during our SCO Presidency. They also expand the scope for international cooperation, involving SCO members and partners," he said.</p>

<p>"While standing resolute on challenges, it is equally important to actively and collaboratively explore avenues of progress. The current global debate is focused on creating the new connectivity linkages that would better serve a rebalanced world," he said.</p>

<p>"If this is to gather serious momentum, it requires the joint efforts of many. It must also be respectful of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and be built on the foundation of non-discriminatory trade and transit rights to neighbours," he said, in a veiled jibe at China, whose President Xi Jinping was present at the summit.</p>

<p>China has invested billions in various power projects and road networks in Pakistan under the USD 65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.</p>

<p>The CPEC is opposed by India as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).</p>

<p>For the SCO extended family, "we flag the progress made on Chabahar port recently through a long-term agreement between India and Iran. This not only holds great value to landlocked Central Asian states but also de-risks commerce between India and Eurasia," Modi said.</p>

<p>India and Iran in May signed a 10-year contract for the operation of a terminal at the strategically important Chabahar port in Iran, a move that will boost regional connectivity as well as trade ties.</p>

<p>This is the first time India will take over the management of an overseas port that will also have a multiplier effect on trade among India, Iran and Afghanistan as efforts continue to directly tap the potential in Central Asia, bypassing neighbouring Pakistan.</p>

<p>Talking about Afghanistan, PM Modi said India and its people have a historical relationship with Afghanistan that is the bedrock of the ties between the two countries. "Our cooperation covers development projects, humanitarian assistance, capacity building and sports. India remains sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the Afghan people," Modi said.</p>

<p>The prime minister also touched upon granting English the status of a third official language, which he said was crucial as more countries sought association with SCO as Observers or Dialogue Partners.</p>

<p>"We must strive to communicate better and deepen our consensus." Congratulating the Kazakh side for hosting a successful summit, Modi said India as a 'Vishwa Bandhu', or the friend of the world will always strive to deepen cooperation with all its partners.</p>

<p>The prime minister also extended its best wishes to the success of the upcoming Chinese presidency of SCO.</p>

<p>India became a member of SCO in June 2017 at a summit in Kazakhstan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the Taliban, a banned group in Russia, are Moscow's "allies" in fighting terrorism because they are in control of Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moscow has for years fostered relations with the Taliban, despite being a banned organisation in Russia since 2003, and Putin last month called for Moscow to "build up" relations with the Taliban government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We must assume that the Taliban control the power in the country. And in this sense the Taliban are, of course, our allies in the fight against terrorism, because any authorities are interested in stability in the state they govern," Putin said in Astana. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Taliban have been fighting against jihadist rival Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) in Afghanistan for years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, IS-K fighters killed more than 140 people in an assault on a Moscow concert hall, the deadliest terror attack in Russia for almost two decades.</p>

<p>Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban have enforced an extreme form of Islamic law that effectively bans women from public life. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Putin said that the Taliban have "taken on some responsibilities" but that there are still "issues that need constant attention inside the country and from the international community".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am sure that the Taliban are interested in everything being stable in Afghanistan," he added.</p>

<p>Moscow has warmed relations with Afghanistan -- with which it has a complicated history after the Soviet invasion in the 1980s -- since the US exit from the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it has fallen short of officially recognising the Taliban government and what it calls the "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has launched the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) at Paris' historic department store Galeries Lafayette after a successful launch at the iconic Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>This significant step is towards realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of globalising UPI, which is an Indian instant payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016.</p>

<p>"On July 3, 2024, the UPI became live at the flagship store of the world-renowned Galeries Lafayette in Haussmann, Paris. This expands the acceptance of UPI in Paris after a successful launch at the iconic Eiffel Tower," the Indian Embassy in France said in a release on Thursday.</p>

<p>Ambassador of India to France and Principality of Monaco Jawed Ashraf launched UPI by live use at the store in the presence of Nicolas Houze, CEO of Galeries Lafayette, and Alain Lacour, Chairman of Lyra Group, the release said.</p>

<p>"Delighted to launch @UPI_NPCI in the world-famous @Galeries_Laf in Paris. After the launch in the Eiffel Tower in Jan 2024, expanding UPI across France. A journey that PM @narendramodi began in 2018 with UPI in Singapore taking another step forward," Ashraf said in a post on X.\</p>

<p>In February, India formally launched UPI at the iconic Eiffel Tower here, terming it as taking Prime Minister Modi's "vision of taking UPI global." Recalling the success of the UPI launch at the Eiffel Tower in January 2024 and the meeting hosted for potential merchants with NPCI International in February 2024, the Ambassador welcomed the quick conclusion of the agreement and arrangement between Lyra and NPCI for the launch of UPI at the world-famous Galeries Lafayette ahead of the Paris Olympics starting July 26, 2024, which is expected to draw a large number of Indian visitors, the release said.</p>

<p>The ambassador recalled the first international launch of UPI in Singapore in 2018 by Modi and expressed satisfaction with the international journey of UPI.</p>

<p>He hoped that in addition to quick, safe and efficient means of cross-border digital payments, UPI would grow as a medium of cross-border remittances and eventually become the digital payment system in countries across the world.</p>

<p>UPI is a system that powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund routing &amp; merchant payments into one hood, according to NPCI.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign and some of his supporters have launched a pre-emptive political offensive on US Vice President Kamala Harris, moving to discredit her amid speculation among some of her fellow Democrats that she may replace President Joe Biden atop the party's 2024 presidential candidate. Amid this, a clip of Mr Trump attacking Ms Harris and calling her "pathetic" has emerged on social media.</p>

<p>In the video, Mr Trump, sitting in a golf cart, holding a pile of cash, and with his son Barron said that Joe Biden is withdrawing from the race due to his performance in the June 27 debate. The 78-year-old asked, "How did I do with the debate the other night?"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Donald Trump claimed he got President Biden out of the race and called him “an old broken down pile of crap” on top of calling Kamala Harris “pathetic.”<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Talking about President Biden, he said, "He just quit, you know - he's quitting the race. I got him out of the - and that means we have Kamala." Mr Trump stated that he thinks that "she's gonna be better" candidate than the 81-year-old, who he described as an "old, broken-down pile of crap."</p>

<p>"She's so bad. She's so pathetic. She's so f****** bad," he continued.</p>

<p>Mr Trump also questioned Mr Biden's ability to deal with foreign adversaries, including Russia's President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping. He said in the now-viral footage, "Can you imagine that guy dealing with Putin? And the president of China - who's a fierce person. He's a fierce man, very tough guy. And they see him."</p>

<p>Towards the end of the clip, the former President added, "But they just announced he's probably quitting."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre rejected rumours and said that he is "absolutely not" pulling out of the presidential race and has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-absolutely-not-pulling-of-us-presidential-race-says-white-house-6032827">no intention of withdrawing</a>. "The president is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race," she told reporters.</p>

<p>Mr Biden told a call with campaign and party staffers that he is going nowhere, as per a report in news agency AFP. "I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win. Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we're going to beat him again in 2024," he said, according to a source close to the campaign. He repeated that message in an emergency meeting with Democratic governors, who pledged their continued support, attendees said afterwards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in the US was found to have been stung by a bee, in one of the most unfortunate spots - in his eye. And the bee stinger was found stuck in his right eye. According to a case study, published in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2400652">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>, the 55-year-old man from Philadelphia went to a local eye hospital complaining of "worsening vision and pain in his right eye". The man first went to the emergency department of a local hospital on the day of the sting, but the staff was unsuccessful in removing the bee sting entirely.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bee-sting-man-eye-hospital-1920809">As per <em>Newsweek</em></a>, the man's vision and pain worsened dramatically, and the iris began to bleed. The man was not able to see at all from the injured eye, which prompted him to visit the ophthalmologic clinic.</p>

<p>"A man suffered a bee sting directly to his eye, resulting in an intense ocular inflammatory response which affected his vision," Wills Eye Hospital ophthalmologist Talia Shoshany told the outlet. "The patient reports walking by a bee hive at work and being stung. He was not otherwise tending to the bees."</p>

<p>The sting was found stabbed in his cornea, a key part of the eye that performs the initial refraction onto the lens, which further focuses the light onto the retina.</p>

<p>"On physical examination at the current presentation, vision in the right eye was limited to counting fingers," the doctors wrote in the paper.</p>

<p>It "showed conjunctival injection, inferior corneal edema [swelling of the cornea], and an infiltrate [collection of inflammatory cells] at the nasal limbus [region of the cornea] with a piece of retained stinger. A hyphema [blood collecting within the eye] which was attributed to iris trauma from the buried stinger and bleeding iris vessels, was also observed", the study further said.</p>

<p>The doctors removed the stinger fragment from his eye using hyper-precise tweezers.</p>

<p>Sting from a bee is extremely painful as it injects venom through its stinger into the skin. The venom contains proteins that affect skin cells and the immune system, leading to pain and swelling around the sting site.</p>

<p>"He improved with steroid and antibiotic drops, although eventually required both cataract surgery and a corneal transplant from the sequelae of the topical steroids and the toxic effect of the venom on the cornea. The patient fully recovered his vision after several months of treatment," Dr Shoshany said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A duo of Russian pranksters who often target and compromise people the Russian state is interested in have been given a top state award in the Kremlin, the RIA state news agency reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>RIA published a picture of the two pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, who use the aliases "Vovan and Lexus," at a Kremlin award ceremony wearing what appear to be Order of Friendship awards as they clutched flutes of champagne.</p>

<p>It said the ceremony had taken place on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The award is given to Russian and foreign nationals for strengthening peace, friendship, cooperation and understanding between Russia and other nations, among other criteria.</p>

<p>There was no immediate word from the Russian pranksters who last month released footage of a video call they did with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron after tricking him into thinking he was speaking to a former Ukrainian president.</p>

<p>The duo is well-known inside Russia having duped a string of politicians over the years, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and, in 2022, Britain's then-defence minister, Ben Wallace.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

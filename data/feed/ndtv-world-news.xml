       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv said Tuesday, amid growing international tensions after Russia fired a nuclear-capable missile that could reach European cities.</p>

<p>The Kremlin declined on Tuesday to confirm that Ukrainian forces had again launched US-provided long-range ATACMS at Russia this week but blamed Washington for escalating the conflict nonetheless.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have been ratcheting up their drone and missile broadsides, with Ukraine recently firing US long-range missiles at Russia and the Kremlin retaliating with an experimental hypersonic missile.</p>

<p>The barrage came as ambassadors from Ukraine and NATO's 32 members were due to meet in Brussels over Russia's firing last week of the intermediate-range missile on the city of Dnipro.</p>

<p>"During the night attack, the enemy launched a record number of Shahed strike unmanned aerial vehicles and unidentified drones," the air force said Tuesday, referring to Iranian-designed drones and putting the overall number fired at 188.</p>

<p>The air force said it had shot down 76 Russian drones in 17 regions, while another 95 were either lost from their radars or downed by electronic jamming defensive systems. It did not specify what happened to the remainder.</p>

<p>Moscow also fired four Iskander-M ballistic missiles, the air force said.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, critical infrastructure facilities were hit, private and apartment buildings were damaged in several regions," a statement said.</p>

<p><strong>Explosions in Kyiv</strong></p>

<p>AFP journalists heard explosions ring out over the capital, while Kyiv city officials said the air alert had lasted five hours and 10 Russian drones were shot down there.</p>

<p>In the western Ternopil region, which is among those spared the worst of the fighting, authorities said drones had damaged a "critical infrastructure facility," without elaborating.</p>

<p>They said however that the attack had disrupted electricity in the city of Ternopil and surrounding towns, and that engineers were working to stabilise supplies.</p>

<p>Putin had said the new missile attack last week was in response to Ukraine firing weapons supplied by the United States and Britain into Russia.</p>

<p>The Kremlin leader warned that Moscow felt it had the right to hit military facilities in countries that allow Ukraine to use their weapons against Russia.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week called the strike "the latest bout of Russian madness" and appealed for updated air-defence systems to meet the new threat.</p>

<p>Kyiv says it hopes to get "concrete and meaningful outcomes" after calling the meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.</p>

<p>But diplomats and officials at NATO have played down expectations for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance's Brussels headquarters.</p>

<p>The most that is expected is a reiteration of NATO's earlier insistence that Moscow's deployment of the new weaponry will not "deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine".</p>

<p><strong>Russian forces advance</strong></p>

<p>The meeting "provides an opportunity to discuss the current security situation in Ukraine and will include briefings from Ukrainian officials via video link," a NATO official said.</p>

<p>The Kremlin dismissed the meeting saying it was unlikely any significant decisions would be taken.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, Ukraine's fatigued troops are struggling to halt advances by Russian forces in the east of the country.</p>

<p>Russia said Tuesday its troops had captured another village in the Kharkiv region, in an area where the front line had been relatively stable until recently.</p>

<p>The defence ministry said its units had "liberated" the settlement of Kopanky," a village near the Ukrainian-held city of Kupiansk that was previously captured by Russian forces at the start of the 2022 offensive before being re-taken by Ukraine later that year.</p>

<p>Moscow also on Tuesday confirmed it had detained a British man it captured fighting for Ukraine in Kyiv's offensive into Russia's western Kursk region.</p>

<p>A court in the region said it had on Monday ordered James Scott Rhys Anderson be remanded in custody, alleging he had "participated in armed hostilities on the territory of the Kursk region".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/dslr8lu8_antiabortion-marchers-rally-reuters_625x300_01_November_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"></p>
</div>

<p>Earlier this month, tragic news from Texas brought the abortion debate into sharp focus. According to a media report, a pregnant woman died because medical staff delayed care due to fear of legal repercussions under the state's strict abortion laws. Such stories underline the life-threatening consequences of restricting reproductive rights.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris made abortion rights the heart of her campaign, but President-elect Donald Trump first waffled on his positions on abortion but towards the end of his campaign he finally admitted he would "not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances." But the abortion rights activist fear Trump might do the opposite. America may become intolerant to unwanted pregnancies. It may become a place where coming out of the closest could be looked down upon.</p>

<p>In any case, across the US, 41 states now enforce abortion bans, many with minor exceptions. Thirteen of these have outright bans, leaving women with few options even in cases of severe health risks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, countries like Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia enforce equally harsh abortion restrictions, rooted in religious principles. In Iran, the Youthful Population and Protection of the Family Law, introduced in 2021, has made obtaining an abortion even harder, emphasising state control over women's reproductive choices.</p>

<p>What ties these regions together is a shared ideological conservatism-one that prioritises the moral sanctity of foetal life over women's autonomy. In both conservative US states and Islamic fundamentalist societies, the convergence of politics, religion, and societal norms has turned women's health into a battleground.</p>

<p>I am writing these lines from a liberal man's perspective but I often hear in my Muslim friends and families' circles strong arguments in support of abortion bans.</p>

<p>The idea here is to show that the two sides might be sworn enemies, almost incapable of seeing eye to eye, but quite interestingly they speak the same ideological language and practise the same dogma. Whether it's on religion or abortion or whether it's on the role of women and their collective disdain for gay people. It's hard to believe how much they have in common-until you remember they can't stand each other. I'm talking more Evangelicals in America and Muslim fundamentalists in the Islamic world.</p>

<p><strong>Two sides of the same ideological coin</strong></p>

<p>Strange bedfellows? politically yes but ideologically not quite. They are more like two sides of the same ultra-conservative coin, but wittingly or unwittingly locked in a battle of supremacy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, the world watched, as a young Iranian woman staged a bold protest, removing her hijab and clothes in public at a university, defying a government that enforces compulsory hijab laws with a heavy hand. Her act of rebellion harks back to the tragic case of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman who died in police custody in 2022 after being detained for not wearing her hijab "properly." The nationwide protests following Amini's death highlighted the deep resentment against these restrictive laws.</p>

<p>So, in one world-the conservative US states-women fear criminalisation for seeking abortions, bound by laws that strip them of autonomy over their own bodies. In another world-places like Iran-women defy oppressive mandates, risking everything to assert their right to freedom.</p>

<p>I have often wondered about two things, without giving them much thought: how the Evangelicals of America and the ultra-fundamentalists of Iran and other Islamic states, such as Saudi Arabia, seem to speak the same language and use identical idioms-yet why do they hate each other despite being cut from the same ideological cloth? But first, let's take a quick look at some of the views the two sides share on a variety of issues.</p>

<p>Family Values, a cornerstone of society: Both Islamic and Evangelical fundamentalists emphasise the centrality of the family as a divinely ordained unit. In many conservative Islamic societies, family is seen as the bedrock of a society, based on morality, with strict roles for men as providers and women as caretakers. I believe the family structure is designed to preserve religious and cultural traditions. Evangelical Christians in the US similarly prioritise family roles. They too advocate for traditional gender roles, with the husband as the head of the household and the wife in a submissive role. Both groups view the family as under attack from liberal views of secularists, such as single parenthood, same-sex parenting or gender fluidity. They see these views as a threat to social order.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is against nature: Conservative Rev Jerry Falwell had once said: "AIDS is the wrath of a just God against homosexuals". &nbsp;Ayatollah Abdol-Hamid Masoumi-Tehrani, an Iranian cleric, has referred to homosexuality as a "moral corruption" and aligned it with societal decay, suggesting that such behaviour brings misfortune upon communities, a sentiment echoing Falwell's rhetoric.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is widely condemned in conservative Islamic contexts, often punished severely, including imprisonment or even execution in some countries. Gender fluidity is considered unnatural and an affront. Evangelicals oppose same-sex marriages and gender identity rights, viewing them as sins. For them, only two genders exist -- male and female</p>

<p>Liberal Values as Satan's Workshop: Both Islamic and Evangelical fundamentalists reject liberal values, associating them with moral decay and godlessness. In Islamic societies, liberal ideas like freedom of speech, individualism, and secularism are often condemned as corrupting influences from the West, undermining culture and morality. Music, art and media that challenge traditional norms are viewed with suspicion. Evangelicals similarly view liberal values, such as LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive freedom and secular governance, as evidence of a decay.</p>

<p>If their views on many issues converge and overlap, why do they hate each other? I think it stems from historical, cultural and political factors. Let's consider the following:</p>

<p>Historical Hostility and Religious Exclusivity: Both Islamic and Evangelical fundamentalists claim exclusive access to ultimate truth, which puts them in opposite camps. One set of people views the other as misguided at best or heretical at worst.</p>

<p>Historical Conflicts: In the Islamic world, children in educated families grow up knowing about the Crusades, Spanish Inquisition and centuries of atrocities committed by the Catholics against Muslims. Centuries of historical clashes have left deep scars on their psyche. Evangelical Christians often see Islam as a "threat to Western civilisation," while Islamic fundamentalists view Christian missionaries and Western expansion as attempts to undermine their culture and religion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cultural Hegemony and Identity Politics: Their shared ideological views are overshadowed by cultural and nationalistic narratives that pit them against each other. Evangelicals in the US often see themselves as defenders of a "Christian America" against perceived external threats. Political rhetoric about the "clash of civilisations" feeds into this dynamic, painting Muslims as adversaries in a broader cultural war. Islamic fundamentalists often see Western Christian powers, including evangelical movements, as aggressors trying to impose their values and political dominance on Muslim-majority societies. The US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and evangelical missionary activities are often cited as examples of Western hostility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political Alignment and Global Power Dynamics Following the 9/11 terror attack, President George Bush declared a war against Islamic terrorism. For the proposed war, he used the word 'crusade', which stirred old hostilities between Christians and Muslims. The choice of the word 'crusade' coming from the US president may just have been accidental but that was not how it was viewed in the Muslim world. He came in for a massive criticism by Muslim leaders. Many Evangelicals support US foreign policies that are perceived as hostile to Muslim-majority nations, such as unwavering support for Israel, military interventions in West Asia and policies against Muslim immigration.</p>

<p>Media Narratives and Fearmongering Both groups are often manipulated by political actors and media to stoke fear and division. In Western narratives, Islamic extremists are often portrayed as violent ones while Evangelicals are projected as defenders of Western values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rivalry in preaching their religious faiths: The two groups' approaches to spreading their faith also create conflict. Evangelicals actively proselytise, often working to convert others. Islamic fundamentalists also promote dawah (inviting others to Islam), but their efforts are often localised or defensive, aimed at countering Western influence rather than converting Christians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a world where identity politics often outweigh shared ideologies, I tend to believe that these two groups are unlikely to find common ground despite their similar stances on family, gender and morality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uncontrolled social media networks and artificial intelligence amplify the worst human impulses, allowing hate speech to spread like wildfire and ignite violence, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We must reign in hate speech and disinformation spreading online," Guterres told a top-level meeting of the United Nations' Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC) in Portugal.</p>

<p>"Unchecked digital platforms and Artificial Intelligence have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before," he told UNAOC's 10th global forum in Cascais, near Lisbon.</p>

<p>"The worst impulses of humanity are given a megaphone, and many times they lead to violence," he told a session at the gathering on "upending hate".</p>

<p>The proliferation of deepfakes online allowed "the impossible and the unverified (to) become credible in an instant", Guterres said.</p>

<p>"Misinformation and outright lies are fuelling repulsive anti-semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and attacks on minority Christian communities, among others," Guterres said.</p>

<p>Social media and AI offered a "new medium" for these "old tactics".</p>

<p>The UN leader reiterated his pleas for peace in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan.</p>

<p>The UN Alliance of Civilisations seeks to promote "cultural diversity, religious pluralism and mutual respect".</p>

<p>This year's global forum -- whose attendees include presidents, ministers and the heads of international bodies -- runs from November 25 to 27.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of new HIV infections and deaths is falling worldwide, marking significant progress in the fight against the disease.</p>

<p>But HIV is far from being stamped out and more needs to be done, health experts warned ahead of World AIDS Day on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Uneven progress</strong></p>

<p>Fewer people contracted HIV last year than at any point since the rise of the disease in the late 1980s, according to a UNAIDS report on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But the 1.3 million new HIV cases recorded in 2023 is still more than three times higher than needed to reach the UN's goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, the UN agency said.</p>

<p>Last year also saw around 630,000 people die from AIDS-related illnesses, the lowest level since a peak of 2.1 million in 2004.</p>

<p>A separate study published in The Lancet HIV journal on Tuesday found that the number of HIV infections across the world declined by a fifth during the 2010s.</p>

<p>Deaths related to HIV, which are generally caused by other diseases during the late stages of AIDS, fell by about 40 percent to below a million a year, the study said.</p>

<p>The decline was mainly driven by improving rates in sub-Saharan Africa, which is by far the hardest-hit region in the global epidemic.</p>

<p>However infections did not go down everywhere. Other regions, such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East, saw HIV numbers increase.</p>

<p>"The world has made remarkable global progress to significantly reduce the number of new HIV infections," said lead study author Hmwe Kyu of the US-based Institute For Health Metrics and Evaluation.</p>

<p>"More than a million people acquire a new HIV infection each year and, of the 40 million people living with HIV, a quarter are not receiving treatment," she said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>Effective tools, for some</strong></p>

<p>Preventative treatments called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have proven to be a powerful tool in the fight against HIV.</p>

<p>These daily pills reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by around 99 percent, and have helped drive down HIV rates in many countries.</p>

<p>But "only 15 percent of people who need PrEP were receiving it in 2023," UNAIDS said, pointing to anti-gay laws such as in Uganda hindering access to these life-saving treatments.</p>

<p>For people who have been infected with HIV, antiretroviral therapy can reduce the amount of the virus in their blood to undetectable levels.</p>

<p>But around 9.3 million people -- nearly a quarter of those living with HIV worldwide -- were not receiving this treatment, UNAIDS warned.</p>

<p><strong>New drug raises hopes</strong></p>

<p>These tools have worked well in wealthier countries but the high costs have meant that poorer countries -- such as in Africa -- have often been left behind.</p>

<p>There are fears that this history could repeat for a new drug that has been hailed as a potential game-changer in the battle against HIV.</p>

<p>Early trials have found that the antiretroviral treatment lenacapavir is 100 percent effective in preventing HIV infection. And it only needs to be injected twice a year, making the drug far easier to administer than current regimens requiring daily pills.</p>

<p>US pharmaceutical giant Gilead has been charging around $40,000 per person per a year for the treatment in several countries.</p>

<p>But researchers have estimated the drug could be made for as little as $40, calling on Gilead to allow for cheaper access in hard-hit nations.</p>

<p>Last month, Gilead announced it had signed licensing deals with six generic drugmakers to produce and sell lenacapavir in lower-income countries.</p>

<p>While experts largely welcomed the move, some noted that millions of people with HIV live in countries not included in the deal.</p>

<p>The twice-yearly injection is also hoped to help get around another problem for administering HIV drugs -- the stigma that comes along with having the disease.</p>

<p><strong>What about a vaccine?</strong></p>

<p>Despite decades of effort, a vaccine for HIV remains elusive.</p>

<p>But the lenacapavir shot is "like having a vaccine basically", Andrew Hill, a researcher at the UK's Liverpool University, told AFP earlier this year.</p>

<p>A handful of patients have also been effectively cured of HIV.</p>

<p>But these cures happen only after a patient endures a brutal stem cell transplant for their leukaemia, so is not an option for almost all people living with HIV.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The only son of Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan, Ven Ajahn Siripanyo gave up the world of riches and spoils to become a Buddhist monk.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robin Sharma, in his bestseller "The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari", wrote about a successful lawyer, Julian Mantle, who sold his worldly possessions to embrace a spiritual journey. While Mantle's story was fictional, Thai-Malaysian monk Ven Ajahn Siripanyo denounced a fortune worth billions in real life for spiritual servitude.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only son of Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan, Ven Ajahn Siripanyo gave up the world of riches and spoils to become a Buddhist monk. Mr Krishnan, also known as AK, is Malaysia's third richest man and is worth more than US$5 billion (Rs 40,000 crore approx), according to a report by South China Morning Post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His business empire spans across telecom, satellites, media, oil, gas, and real estate industries. The billionaire also owns Aircel, the phone company that once sponsored the renowned IPL team Chennai Super Kings, led by cricket legend MS Dhoni.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite being groomed from an early age to inherit Mr Krishnan's substantial fortune, Ajahn Siripanyo chose to detach himself from worldly possessions at the age of 18, a decision his father respects. Mr Krishnan is reportedly a devout Buddhist himself, who engages in several philanthropist and charitable endeavours.</p>

<h2><strong>Ven Ajahn Siripanyo's Spiritual Journey</strong></h2>

<p>On top of being a billionaire's son, Ajahn Siripanyo is also reportedly a blue-blooded noble. His mother, Momwajarongse Suprinda Chakraban, is a descendant of the Thai royal family, according to the South China Morning Post report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Ajahn Siripanyo was 18 years old, he went to Thailand to pay homage to his Thai mother's family. During his trip, he reportedly ordained at a retreat temporarily for fun. However, what started as a temporary experience eventually evolved into a permanent commitment. Now, over twenty years down the line, the modern-day Siddhartha is reportedly a forest monk.</p>

<p>He resides at the Dtao Dum Monastery located somewhere on the Thailand-Myanmar border as an abbot.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Occasional Embrace Of Oppilance</strong></h3>

<p>Ajahn Siripanyo, along with his two sisters, grew up in London. He completed his studies in the UK and is known to speak at least eight languages including English. Quoting sources, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3093934/billionaire-heir-who-became-monk-why-son-malaysias-third" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">South China Morning Post</a> reported that Ajahn Siripanyo's outlook in life as being open to different cultures, so it doesn't come as a surprise that embraced Buddhist teachings.</p>

<p>As per the report, though the monk lives on the generosity of others on a daily basis, he accepts his opulence where it is necessary. As one of the precepts of Buddhism is familial love, Ajahn Siripanyo makes time to see his father now and then and reports to his old lifestyle temporarily.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's oldest man, Briton John Tinniswood, has died aged 112 at the care home where he lived in Southport, northwest England, Guinness World Records said on Tuesday, quoting his family.</p>

<p>Tinniswood was born in Liverpool on August 26, 1912, and died on Monday.</p>

<p>He became the world's oldest man in April following the death of 114-year-old Venezuelan Juan Vicente Perez.</p>

<p>"His last day was surrounded by music and love," the family said in a statement, also thanking "all those who cared for him over the years".</p>

<p>Born the same year the Titanic sank and living through both World Wars, Tinniswood told Guinness World Records that the secret to his longevity was "pure luck".</p>

<p>"You either live long or you live short, and you can't do much about it," he said.</p>

<p>He nonetheless advised moderation in all things to stay healthy.</p>

<p>"If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you're going to suffer eventually," he added.</p>

<p>During World War Two, Tinniswood held an administrative role in the Royal Army Pay Corps, going on to work in accounts for oil giants Shell and BP.</p>

<p>He was a life-long supporter of Liverpool football club, and ate fish and chips every Friday.</p>

<p>The world's oldest living woman currently is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who is 116.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Warren Buffett, philanthropist and multi-billionaire CEO of American multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, has donated another $1.2 billion of his wealth to foundations, serving his 2006 pledge to steadily donate his $150 billion wealth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warren &nbsp;Buffett, philanthropist and multi-billionaire CEO of American multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, has donated another $1.2 billion of his wealth to foundations, serving his 2006 pledge to steadily donate his $150 billion wealth during his lifetime and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his letter to the shareholders, the 94-year-old CEO reflected upon life and how "fickle" it can be, sharing his most detailed plan to donate his fortunes after his death.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Father, Time Always Wins'</strong></p>

<p>In his four-page letter to the shareholders, Mr Buffett announced that he would "convert 1,600 A shares into 2,400,000 B shares to give these B shares to four family foundations: 1,500,000 shares to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and 300,000 shares to each of The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation.</p>

<p>"Father time always wins. But he can be fickle - indeed unfair and even cruel - sometimes ending life at birth or soon thereafter while, at other times, waiting a century or so before paying a visit. To date, I've been very lucky, but, before long, he will get around to me," Mr Buffett said, reflecting on how he thought his first wife, Susie, would outlive him and subsequently donate the vast majority of their fortune, but "that was not to be."</p>

<p>Read the full letter:&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov2524.pdf" rel="noindex,nofollow">BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</a></p>

<p>With his $1.2 billion donations, his class A shares in Berkshire Hathaway - which accounts for 99.5% of his $150 billion wealth - have reduced to 206,363 shares after he gave way almost 56.6% of his shareholdings since his pledge in 2006. He is currently the sixth richest person in the world according to Forbes.</p>

<p>"In 2004, before Susie, my first wife, died, the two of us owned 508,998 Class A shares. For decades, we had both thought that she would outlive me and subsequently distribute the vast majority of our large fortune. That was not to be," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Warren Buffett's New Will</strong></p>

<p>The Berkshire CEO made changes to his will, detailing how he plans to donate the rest of his wealth after his death. Mr Buffett said that he and his first wife Susie had "long encouraged" their children in small philanthropic activities and had been pleased with their enthusiasm, diligence and results. Since 2006, their philanthropic activities have dramatically increased.</p>

<p>He hopes his three children - Susie, Howie and Peter - will gradually distribute all of his Berkshire holdings that account for 99.5% of his wealth. In his lifetime, Mr Buffett has donated more than $60 billion of his wealth to various foundations, a majority of which, approximately $43 billion, to the Gates Foundation run by Bill and Melinda Gates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he reflected upon mortality, relationships and the fickle nature of life, he talked about a downside to his "good fortune" and said, "The expected life span of my children has materially diminished since the 2006 pledge. They are now 71, 69 and 66. I've never wished to create a dynasty or pursue any plan that extended beyond the children. I know the three well and trust them completely. Future generations are another matter. Who can foresee the priorities, intelligence and fidelity of successive generations to deal with the distribution of extraordinary wealth amid what may be a far different philanthropic landscape? Still, the massive wealth I've collected may take longer to deploy than my children live."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Buffett has assigned three potential successor trustees for the distribution of wealth, each being well-known to his children and is "somewhat younger to them." However, he hopes that the trustees stay on the waitlist, and his children fulfil the responsibility in their lifetime.</p>

<p>His children have to "unanimously" decide on how to donate his wealth, a caveat in his will, which he explained in his letter through the unpleasant reality of philanthropy and those who can distribute huge sums are forever regarded as "targets of opportunity."</p>

<p><strong>'One Suggestion For All Parents'</strong></p>

<p>"I have one further suggestion for all parents, whether they are of modest or staggering wealth. When your children are mature, have them read your will before you sign it," he said in his letter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Be sure each child understands both the logic for your decisions and the responsibilities they will encounter upon your death. If any have questions or suggestions, listen carefully and adopt those found sensible. You don't want your children asking "Why?" in respect to testamentary decisions when you are no longer able to respond."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beijing said Tuesday it deployed air and naval forces to monitor a US military plane as it flew over politically sensitive waters separating China and Taiwan.</p>

<p>The United States and its allies regularly cross through the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait, either by ship or aircraft, to reinforce the international status of the waterway, angering Beijing.</p>

<p>China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and claims jurisdiction over the body of water separating the two.</p>

<p>To assert its claims, Beijing regularly deploys fighter jets and warships around the island, while opposing transits by military ships and aircraft belonging to the United States and its allies.</p>

<p>"A US Navy P-8A Poseidon transited the Taiwan Strait in international airspace on Nov. 26, 2024 (local time)," the US Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The aircraft's transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific."</p>

<p>China said it had monitored the aircraft and condemned the flight for being "openly hyped".</p>

<p>"US remarks distort legal principles, confuse the public and mislead international perception," said Cao Jun, a senior colonel and spokesman for China's Eastern Theatre Air Force, in a statement.</p>

<p>Beijing had "organised naval and air forces to monitor and guard the trajectory of the US aircraft and effectively responded and dealt with it", Cao added.</p>

<p>During a previous transit by a US P-8A Poseidon in September, the Chinese military tailed the aircraft.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important security partner, but like most other countries it does not have official diplomatic relations with Taipei.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Tuesday that the US P-8A aircraft flew from south to north through the Taiwan Strait in the morning.</p>

<p>The Taiwan military "fully monitored the movements in the surrounding sea and airspace, and the situation remained normal," the ministry said in a statement.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Walmart spokesperson confirmed the changes, stating, "We are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walmart has announced plans to cut back on some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, a spokesperson said on Monday. The move comes amid growing pressure from conservative groups.</p>

<p>The US retail joint will no longer consider race and gender when granting supplier contracts, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/walmart-cuts-dei-pride-after-activist-starbuck-threatens-boycott" rel="noindex,nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. The company will also scale back racial equity training and stop participating in rankings by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.</p>

<p>A Walmart spokesperson confirmed the changes, stating, "We are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America."</p>

<p>Walmart's decision follows a similar move by other major US companies, including Starbucks, JPMorgan Chase, and Ford. These companies have modified their DEI policies in response to pressure from conservative groups.</p>

<p>Conservative activist Robby Starbuck claimed credit for Walmart's decision, stating that he had "productive conversations" with company executives. Starbuck has been a vocal critic of DEI initiatives and has targeted several companies over their employment policies.</p>

<p>In addition to scaling back its DEI initiatives, Walmart has also agreed to monitor its online marketplace for listings that may be deemed objectionable or what Starbuck describes as "sexual and/or transgender products marketed to children" and remove them if necessary.</p>

<p>The company will also review its grants for Pride events to ensure that they are not supporting "sexualised content" that may be unsuitable for children.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A groundbreaking study suggests severe COVID infections may generate special immune cells capable of shrinking advanced cancers in mice, opening doors to innovative cancer treatments.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a startling connection between treating cancer and severe Covid infections, according to a recent study published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Investigation. </em>Researchers discovered that the immunological response brought on by severe Covid-19 can generate specialized monocytes, which are white blood cells with particular anti-cancer properties.</p>

<p>These monocytes are distinct from normal ones, which are frequently taken over by cancer cells to promote their proliferation. Rather, the monocytes produced by Covid-19 actively target tumors and trigger natural killer cells, reducing malignant growths. Mice with advanced malignancies, such as melanoma, lung, breast, and colon tumors, were used to test the discovery. In every instance, tumors were reduced by a medication that imitated the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03083-7">Covid immunological response.</a></p>

<p>This mechanism is independent of T cells, the focus of most current immunotherapy treatments, which work in only 20%-40% of cases. The new approach could provide options for patients who don't respond to traditional therapies.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/mit-offers-free-education-for-families-earning-under-200-000-7108780"><strong>Also Read | MIT Offers Free Education For Families Earning Under $200,000</strong></a></p>

<p>While this breakthrough offers hope, the findings are based on animal studies. Clinical trials will be necessary to confirm its effectiveness in humans. Scientists believe this mechanism might apply to various cancer types, potentially revolutionizing treatment options.</p>

<p>Though Covid vaccines don't trigger the same immune response, the research could pave the way for novel drugs that harness these cancer-fighting monocytes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the situation worsened in Pakistan's capital Islamabad amid fierce protests demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan, the government asked the army to intervene. As a sea of protesters flooded the streets of Islamabad, clashes with the police left at least four cops and a civilian dead.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg report, when the Pakistan Army stepped in, it issued "shoot at sight" orders under Section 245 - which is a clause meant for the armed forces "to defend Pakistan against external aggression or threat of war". The clause also gives the army an open hand as it nullifies any judicial intervention or future proceedings.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>The local media in Pakistan also reportedly said that the Army's order instructed soldiers to "not spare anyone".</p>

<p>Protesters in Pakistan have defied police warnings and been demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan. Tens of thousands of citizens from across Pakistan descended on the streets of Islamabad with sticks, stones and catapults.</p>

<p>Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, who was prime minister for little over 3 years between 2018 and 2022, has for years since been imprisoned and banished by the Pakistani establishment. Despite having a mass following in Pakistan, Mr Khan has been barred from contesting elections. He is now charged with dozens of legal cases from cheating and corruption to vandalism and arson, and even accused of sedition and treason - all of which he says is to frame him in order to prevent him from a political comeback.</p>

</div>

<p>The elections in Pakistan, held in February this year, have been marred by allegations of rigging by parties opposing Imran Khan. Though Mr Khan was barred from standing for election, his party contested the polls.</p>

<p>Imran Khan's party won more seats than any other party in the election, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to military influence shut them out of power. The protest now in Islamabad has these two main demands - 'Release Imran Khan', and overturn the allegedly rigged election results.</p>

</div>

<p>Imran Khan's party - Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI - has defied all government crackdowns by holding frequent rallies across the country showing a resolve against attempts to end his political career. The current rally in Islamabad is the largest protest in support of Imran Khan since he was jailed last year in August. He was jailed on several occasions prior to that as well.</p>

</div>

<p>Though the protests were meant to be peaceful, they turned violent after a police push back in which four policemen and a civilian were killed and nearly a dozen people critically injured.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has blamed "disruptive elements" who "do not seek a revolution but instead, seek bloodshed." He went on to say that "This is not a peaceful protest, it is extremism," claiming that those who were killed had been "run over by a vehicle".</p>

<p>Islamabad has been under siege since Saturday and has seen a total crackdown since then. More than 20,000 policemen and several columns of soldiers have been called in with batons, guns, rifles, tear gas shells, and riot gear. The city has also been fortified and several arterial roads leading to the government district under clamp down. Mobile phone connectivity has also been cut sporadically. Drones are also being used to monitor the protesters. The government has also imposed a two-month ban on all public gatherings, short of declaring a state of emergency.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Vietnamese property tycoon sentenced to death for multi-billion-dollar fraud begged a court to spare her life Tuesday, saying she was trying to repay the stolen funds.</p>

<p>Property developer Truong My Lan, 68, was convicted earlier this year of embezzling money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) -- which prosecutors said she controlled -- and condemned to die for fraud totalling $27 billion in one of the biggest corruption cases in history.</p>

<p>She is appealing against her sentence at a court in Ho Chi Minh City, with the ruling expected in the coming days.</p>

<p>In her final remarks before the court, Lan said: "My only thought is on how to repay the debt to the SBV (State Bank of Vietnam) and the people. I don't think about the damage to myself and my family.</p>

<p>"I feel pained due to the waste of national resources," Lan said, adding she felt "very embarrassed to be charged with this crime".</p>

<p>"Please reconsider and reduce my sentence," she asked the court.</p>

<p>According to Vietnamese law, Lan could escape the death penalty if she proactively returns three-quarters of the embezzled assets and is judged to have co-operated sufficiently with authorities.</p>

<p>But prosecutors argued Monday that she had not met the conditions, and emphasised her crime's consequences were "huge and without precedent".</p>

<p>Among key points being debated in court is an estimate of Lan's personal wealth.</p>

<p>Lan, who founded real estate development group Van Thinh Phat, told the court that "the quickest way" to repay the stolen funds would be "to liquidate SCB, and sell our assets to repay SBV and the people".</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in SCB lost money, shocking the communist nation and prompting rare protests from the victims -- who demonstrated again on Tuesday outside the State Bank of Vietnam in Hanoi.</p>

<p>The State Bank said in April that it pumped funds into SCB to stabilise it, without revealing how much.</p>

<p>During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling $12.5 billion, but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam amounted to $27 billion -- equivalent to around six percent of the country's 2023 GDP.</p>

<p>A total of 47 other defendants have requested reduced sentences at the appeal, which began in early November.</p>

<p>Last month, Lan was convicted of money laundering and jailed for life in a separate case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly four years after his death, LGBTQ activist Edgar Ng was vindicated by Hong Kong's top court Tuesday as judges ruled in his favour on housing and inheritance rights for same-sex couples.</p>

<p>The outcome is a major step forward for Hong Kong's LGBTQ community, but one Ng will never see.</p>

<p>In 2020, aged 33, he died by suicide.</p>

<p>"(Ng) was a strong and cheerful person on the outside, but he experienced a lot of pain," recalled his husband Henry Li in a 2023 interview with AFP.</p>

<p>"He relied on his good cheer and spirit of service... thinking that, by solving others' problems, he would solve his own."</p>

<p>After Ng's death, Li took over as plaintiff even as he continued to be confronted with further examples of discrimination.</p>

<p>The morgue at first refused to let Li identify Ng's body, saying Hong Kong did not recognise same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>"They were telling me that my husband was not my husband and that I was nobody," Li said. "I couldn't react. I froze."</p>

<p>The government relented and changed the procedures after Li took legal action.</p>

<p>And on Tuesday, the government's appeals in the housing and inheritance cases were unanimously dismissed.</p>

<p>"I have lived in pain, but I have never given up your desire to pursue equality, and I have continued to work hard on our case to defend the fact that we have always been a family," Li wrote in a letter addressed to Ng after the latest victory.</p>

<p>"Without you by my side, the government's... arguments in the cases seemed even more cruel."</p>

<p>He added: "I hope I didn't let you down."</p>

<p><strong>'We didn't feel safe'</strong></p>

<p>The couple first met while working at the same accounting firm in Britain and married in London in 2017.</p>

<p>Ng insisted on having an additional ceremony in Hong Kong to show they had nothing to hide -- an idea that took some convincing for Li.</p>

<p>Photos from the private event found their way onto social media, where some people reacted with vomit emojis, he said.</p>

<p>For a while the newlyweds lived in Hong Kong public housing, but found themselves targeted by anonymous complaints as those flats were, by law, reserved for heterosexual couples.</p>

<p>"There was a lot of pressure and we didn't feel safe in our own home," said Li.</p>

<p>That was the genesis of Ng's first legal bid in 2019, to "ask the court to tackle this problem directly, instead of burying our heads in the sand".</p>

<p>Ng took the government to court a second time, also in 2019, over inheritance rules that treated same-sex couples differently from opposite-sex ones.</p>

<p><strong>The 'storm'</strong></p>

<p>Around that time, Ng was retraining to be a canoe coach because he loved spending time on the water, Li said.</p>

<p>But in December 2020, Ng, who had struggled with depression, took his own life.</p>

<p>Li compared it to observing a storm approaching a house in slow motion.</p>

<p>"Neither the house nor the people (inside) could run away and you watch the house slowly disintegrate. And then there is nothing left."</p>

<p>In 2023, Li -- now a lawyer -- lived with his cats in the Hong Kong flat that he and Ng once furnished together, looking out over the glittering waters of Tolo Harbour.</p>

<p>The walls were adorned with reminders of their Catholic faith, a "winning" court document, as well as a photo that showed the couple on their wedding day.</p>

<p>Li said at the time that he hoped Hong Kong would one day protect same-sex couples' rights in all stages of life: growing up, growing old, illness and death.</p>

<p>"Our case has finally come to an end... I hope you can still hear our affirmations of you," he wrote in his letter to Ng on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Our cats and I await the day when we can be reunited."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clashes erupted between police and supporters of arrested Hindu priest, Chinmoy Krishna Das, outside a court in Bangladesh's Chattogram on Tuesday. Hundreds of people, largely believed to be from the minority Hindu community, had gathered outside the court premises to protest against the arrest of the former ISKCON leader in a sedition case.</p>

<p>The unrest began around noon after the court denied bail to Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is also the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sanatan Jagaran Mancha.</p>

<p>As per Bangladeshi media, the agitators obstructed the prison van carrying the priest. After nearly three hours of deadlock, violence broke out outside the court premises, with police lobbing teargas shells, firing sound grenades, and charging batons at the protesters.</p>

<p>One person is feared dead in the violence, however, an official confirmation is yet to come.</p>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar, also known as Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, was arrested at a Dhaka airport on Monday afternoon in connection with a sedition case filed in Chattogram. The case against the Hindu priest and 18 others was filed by a local Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader, who was later expelled from the party.</p>

<p>The priest was produced before the Chattogram Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate's Court earlier in the day, which denied him bail and fixed Wednesday morning for his bail hearing again.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.</p>

<p>Earlier, India also condemned the arrest of the Hindu priest. In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) urged the Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities.</p>

<p>"We have noted with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is also the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote. This incident follows the multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh," the statement read.</p>

<p>The MEA noted that there are several documented cases of arson and looting of minorities' homes and business establishments, as well as theft, vandalism and desecration of deities and temples in Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate that while the perpetrators of these incidents remain at large, charges should be pressed against a religious leader presenting legitimate demands through peaceful gatherings," MEA said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr. Jaishankar emphasised India's reliance on Italy's support in its engagement with the European Union, highlighting the EU as India's largest trade partner and key investor.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar recently discussed global issues with Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera while attending the G7 meeting in Fiuggi, Italy.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaishankar emphasised India's reliance on Italy's support in its engagement with the European Union, highlighting the EU as India's largest trade partner and key investor. He also touched on the Joint Strategic Action Plan announced by the Prime Ministers of India and Italy.</p>

<p>He stressed the importance of cooperation on trade matters, despite the complexities arising from the EU's tendency to introduce non-trade issues in negotiations, stating that the EU "brings up many non-trade issues in the negotiations, it is more complicated than a normal FTA".</p>

<p>Regarding India's purchase of below-market-price oil from Russia, Mr. Jaishankar argued that each country has its own interests. He pointed out, "If everything is a matter of such a deep principle, then Europe itself should have cut off all its business with Russia, but it doesn't do that." He also said that countries need to see how a particular action might impact them.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy, the country "highlights its unwavering support for Ukraine's territorial integrity, full sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognised borders and its proactive engagement within the Euro-Atlantic community efforts to support Ukraine." On the subject of the war, Mr. Jaishankar emphasised that diplomacy is key to working out the Russia-Ukraine war, and that negotiation is essential for finding a solution.</p>

<p>He said, "You're not going to get a solution from the battlefield, right? We have to negotiate. At some stage, people will come to the table. The sooner they do it, the better, because the rest of the world is affected", which is why, he added, India is trying to make an effort and talk to both sides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is putting the entire international system under great stress," Mr. Jaishankar said, and advocated that countries need to keep trying to solve the conflicts in Ukraine and in West Asia by taking initiatives to find common ground instead of being "spectators", stressing the need to find something better than what we have today.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China warned on Tuesday that "no one will win a trade war" after US President-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere in response to illegal drug trade and immigration.</p>

<p>"China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for China's embassy in the United States, said in an email to AFP.</p>

<p>In a series of posts to his Truth Social account, Trump on Monday vowed to hit some of the United States' largest trading partners with duties on all goods entering the country.</p>

<p>He said he would also be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," in response to what he said was its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling.</p>

<p>Asked on Tuesday whether Beijing had reached out to Trump's team for talks, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said: "As a principle, we are open to maintaining dialogue and communication."</p>

<p>Tariffs are a key part of Trump's economic agenda, with the Republican vowing wide-ranging duties on allies and adversaries alike while he was on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Washington has long accused Beijing of complicity in the deadly fentanyl trade that has ravaged communities across the country.</p>

<p>The embassy in Washington's Liu rebuffed those claims in his statement, detailing steps that Beijing was taking to help curb the trade.</p>

<p>"All these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality," he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A new study by scientists from the Universities of Geneva and Toulouse has found a small inconsistency in Einstein's general relativity predictions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Albert Einstein's general relativity theory has been a pillar of contemporary physics for more than a century. But according to a recent study, there is a little discrepancy between Einstein's predictions and how the Universe has behaved during various cosmic eras.</p>

<p>In order to better understand the Universe's accelerated expansion, which was found 25 years ago, researchers from the University of Geneva and Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier examined data from the Dark Energy Survey. When applied on a global scale, the analysis revealed variances that cast doubt on Einstein's equations, especially for extrasolar occurrences.</p>

<p>These results, titled<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53363-6"><em> "Measurement of the Weyl potential evolution from the first three years of dark energy survey data,"</em></a> which were published in <em>Nature Communications,</em> lead to fresh debates on the validity of general relativity and the forces influencing the universe. The results point to gaps in our knowledge of space-time and dark energy, but they do not refute Einstein's theories.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unige.ch/medias/en/2024/les-equations-deinstein-se-heurtent-aux-mysteres-de-lunivers"><em>Albert Einstein's theory, </em></a>the Universe is deformed by matter, like a large, flexible sheet. These deformations, caused by the gravity of celestial bodies, are called ''gravitational wells''. When light passes through this irregular framework, its trajectory is bent by these wells, similar to the effect of a glass lens. However, in this case, it is gravity, not glass, that bends the light. This phenomenon is known as ''gravitational lensing''.</p>

<p>Observing it provides insights into the components, history, and expansion of the Universe. Its first measurement, taken during a solar eclipse in 1919, confirmed Einstein's theory, which predicted a light deflection twice as large as that predicted by Isaac Newton. This difference arises from Einstein's introduction of a key new element: the deformation of time, in addition to the deformation of space, to achieve the exact curvature of light.</p>

<p>"Until now, Dark Energy Survey data have been used to measure the distribution of matter in the Universe. In our study, we used this data to directly measure the distortion of time and space, enabling us to compare our findings with Einstein's predictions," says Camille Bonvin, associate professor in the Department of Theoretical Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science, who led the research.</p>

<p>"We discovered that in the distant past - 6 and 7 billion years ago - the depth of the wells aligns well with Einstein's predictions. However, closer to today, 3.5 and 5 billion years ago, they are slightly shallower than predicted by Einstein," reveals Isaac Tutusaus, assistant astronomer at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP/OMP) at Universite; Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier and the study's lead author.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the holiday season fast approaching, two flight attendants have shared their expert tips to help you survive the travel chaos. Hunter Smith-Lihas from Florida - a flight attendant on a major US airline - and Liz Simmons - an Australian flight attendant turned psychologist - know firsthand how hectic air travel can be during this time of year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From managing stress to staying comfortable on long flights, here are some valuable tips to help passengers as shared with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/flight-attendants-secrets-surviving-holiday-travel/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Give Yourself Extra Time</strong><br />
Don't book flights last minute. Try to give yourself at least one buffer day between travel and the event you're attending. If your flight gets cancelled, you will have time to rebook.<br />
<br />
<strong>Choose Longer Layovers</strong><br />
Avoid tight connections. It is better to have a longer layover (around 90 minutes) to reduce the risk of missing your next flight.<br />
<br />
<strong>Book Flights Midweek</strong><br />
If you can, try flying on weekdays to avoid weekend crowds and possibly find cheaper flights.<br />
<br />
<strong>Check Your Passport</strong><br />
Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates, especially for international trips.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fly Early</strong><br />
Booking the first flight of the day helps avoid delays that can happen later. You'll also have time to rebook if something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
<strong>Plan Flights Around Kids' Nap Times</strong><br />
If you're flying with kids, choose flights during their nap times to keep them calm and avoid meltdowns.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ask for an Upgrade</strong><br />
It doesn't hurt to ask the gate agent about upgrades, especially if you have loyalty points. But don't expect it to always work, especially during the busy holiday season.<br />
<br />
<strong>Wipe Down Surfaces</strong><br />
While aeroplane air filters are designed to combat germs, flight attendants recommend wiping down your seat and tray table for extra safety. Some airlines even provide sanitising wipes, so make use of them.<br />
<br />
<strong>Make Your Seat Your Own</strong><br />
Bring your own travel essentials like a blanket, eye mask, pillow, and headphones. Download movies or books to keep yourself entertained. Having snacks on hand is also a good idea since delays can affect meal timing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Never Encroach Into Someone Else's Seat</strong><br />
While it's okay to make your seat more comfortable, be mindful of your neighbours. Avoid spreading out into someone else's space or using bright, light-up travel mirrors. Respect others' need for rest, especially on long flights.<br />
<br />
<strong>Be Considerate of Fellow Passengers</strong><br />
Holiday travel can bring increased stress and anxiety. If you find yourself frustrated, take a deep breath and remember that everyone is trying to get home. Small gestures of kindness, like offering a smile or patience, can make a big difference.<br />
<br />
<strong>Create Your Own ‘Bubble of Peace'</strong><br />
Don't let other passengers' negativity impact your holiday mood. Focus on your own comfort and well-being during the flight, and keep your holiday spirit intact.<br />
<br />
<strong>Show Appreciation to Flight Attendants</strong><br />
Flight attendants work hard, especially during the busy holiday season. Small acts of kindness, like a smile or a small gift, can help lift their spirits. Flight attendants appreciate gestures, though they may not accept cash. A simple thank you can go a long way.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A former officer in Russia's nuclear forces is among the rare few to speak out about his experiences at one of the country's most secretive military bases.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former officer in Russia's nuclear forces is among the rare few to speak out about his experiences at one of the country's most secretive military bases. His testimony to the BBC is about the chilling readiness of Russia's nuclear arsenal at the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.<br />
<br />
On that fateful day, Mr Anton was stationed at a nuclear weapons base where his unit was put on full combat alert. “Before that, we had only exercises. But on the day the war started, the weapons were fully in place,” he recalls. “We were ready to launch the forces into the sea and air and, in theory, carry out a nuclear strike.” Russia prepared for the worst.<br />
<br />
Mr Anton served as an officer at a highly secretive nuclear weapons facility, an environment with limited insight into its operations. Documents provided to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dl2pv0yj0o " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">BBC</a> confirmed his rank, unit, and base. Three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin announced that the country's nuclear forces were placed on high alert. Mr Anton confirmed that the alert was in place from day one, and he and his colleagues were confined to the base, with access only to Russian state TV. They were not involved in combat but were tasked with guarding the nuclear weapons. The heightened alert status lasted two to three weeks before it was finally lifted.<br />
<br />
Mr Anton gave a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Russia's nuclear forces. All personnel are professional soldiers, with no conscripts, and undergo regular checks and lie-detector tests. The pay is significantly higher, and the troops are not sent to war. Instead, their role is to either defend or execute a nuclear strike.<br />
<br />
Life on the nuclear base was strictly controlled, with no personal phones allowed and visitors requiring approval from the FSB months in advance. Mr Anton worked in the security unit, part of a rapid-response force with a two-minute reaction time.<br />
<br />
Things took a turn when he was given an order he couldn't follow. He was told to teach his troops that Ukrainian civilians should be treated as combatants and destroyed. Anton refused, calling it a war crime and rejecting the “propaganda.”<br />
<br />
His refusal led to severe consequences. He was reprimanded by senior officers and transferred to a regular assault brigade, units often sent into battle as the “first wave.” Mr Anton, in an act of defiance, signed a statement refusing to participate in the war, resulting in a criminal case opened against him. “I showed them documents confirming my transfer to the assault brigade and details of the criminal case,” Mr Anton explained.<br />
<br />
Before being sent to the front lines, Mr Anton decided to flee Russia with the help of a volunteer organisation that helps deserters. He explained if he had tried to escape from the nuclear forces base, the FSB Security Service would have responded swiftly, making it nearly impossible for him to leave the country. However, since he had been transferred to a regular assault brigade, the high-level security clearance was no longer in effect, allowing him to escape.<br />
<br />
After escaping, Mr Anton joined the volunteer group “Idite Lesom” (meaning “Go by the Forest” or “Get Lost”), which helps deserters evade the Russian authorities. The group reports that the number of deserters seeking help has risen to 350 a month, with the risks for those fleeing escalating. Mr Anton is acutely aware of the dangers he faces, both in his past role and in his current actions. “I understand the more I do that, the higher the chances they could try and kill me.”<br />
<br />
He said that he no longer speaks to his former colleagues at the nuclear base to protect them from the repercussions of their contact with him. “They must take lie-detector tests, and any contact with me could lead to a criminal case.”<br />
<br />
Although he has left Russia, Mr Anton remains under threat. The Russian security services continue to look for him, and he now lives in hiding, taking extreme precautions to avoid detection. “I work off the books and I don't show up in any official systems,” he reveals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emily Calandrelli, an MIT-trained engineer and future Blue Origin astronaut, recently made history after she became the 100th woman to venture into space. Her journey aboard Blue Origin's latest human spaceflight has solidified her position as a trailblazer in the space industry.</p>

<h2><strong>Passion For Space</strong></h2>

<p>Emily Calandrelli's fascination with space and science began at a young age. With a bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from West Virginia University (WVU), she quickly made her mark in the world of aerospace. Her educational journey continued at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she completed her Master's in Aeronautics and Astronautics, along with Technology and Policy.</p>

<p>Ms Calandrelli's <a href="http://https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycalandrelli/details/experience/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> describes her as an “MIT engineer turned Emmy-nominated science TV host, #1 New York Times bestselling author, Blue Origin astronaut, and TEDx speaker (x3).”</p>

<h2><strong>Engineer To TV Host</strong></h2>

<p>In addition to her technical expertise, Ms Calandrelli is a science communicator, known for making complex topics accessible to the public. She is the host and co-executive producer of Emily's Wonder Lab on Netflix, where she is known as ‘Space Gal.' Her work on the show, which encourages young minds to explore science through fun experiments, is just one example of her dedication to science education.</p>

<p>She has also featured as a correspondent on Netflix's Bill Nye Saves the World and serves as the executive producer and host of Xploration Outer Space, a FOX educational show on space exploration. She is also a regular contributor to TechCrunch, where she writes about developments in the space industry.</p>

<p>Ms Calandrelli's passion for science and technology is further reflected in her book series, <em>Ada Lace Adventures,</em> for kids aged 6-10. She has also authored a picture book,<em> Reach For The Stars,</em> in addition to the NYT bestseller, <em>Stay Curious And Keep Exploring.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Empowering Women In STEM</strong></h2>

<p>Emily Calandrelli is devoted to encouraging young girls and women of colour to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). She believes that many young students, especially women and minorities, are unaware of the incredible opportunities available to them in STEM fields. Ms Calandrelli aims to change this through her work, hoping to make STEM more inclusive and accessible to everyone.</p>

<h2><strong>Overcoming Online Harassment</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Calandrelli has been the target of online harassment after her spaceflight. When she expressed her awe and excitement after crossing the Karman line - the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space - her reaction was met with criticism from online trolls who sexualised her response. In a video shared by Blue Origin, Emily's emotional remarks were overshadowed by disparaging comments, prompting the company to remove the original video from social media and post an edited version.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ms Calandrelli refused to let the negativity affect her. On social media, she shared a powerful message, saying, “I refuse to give much time to the small men on the internet. I feel experiences in my soul.” She added, “I will not apologize or feel weird about my reaction. It's wholly mine and I love it. When I can, I'll reshare it myself with all of you.”</p>

<p>Despite the trolls, she remains focused on the positive impact of her journey. A representative for Emily told CNN that she preferred to concentrate on the “positive impact” of her journey rather than engage with “misguided” remarks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's Conservative Party leadership candidate Priti Patel has been eliminated from the contest after the first round of voting.</p>

<p>Ms Patel, who was the home secretary in former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, was running to succeed Rishi Sunak as the party's leader. Mr Sunak stepped down from the post after the Conservatives lost the general election in July.</p>

<p>Former immigration minister Robert Jenricks came out on top with 28 votes followed by Kemi Badenoch with 22 votes. James Cleverly was in the third position as he secured 21 votes and Tom Tugendhat won 17. Mel Stride was fifth with 16 and the last was Ms Patel with 14 votes.</p>

<p>The next vote will take place next Tuesday after which four candidates would remain before the party's annual conference at the end of September.</p>

<p>Multiple rounds of voting will take place after the conference from October 8. The voting will last three days until there are only two candidates left.</p>

<p>The MPs will then finally choose their leader, with the result announced on November 2.</p>

<p>During her term as home secretary, Ms Patel was known for her tough stance on immigration. She led the Conservative government's flagship scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.</p>

<p>In her Tory leadership campaign, she had promised to unite the party and get it ready for the next general election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian lawmaker Maria Butina said on Wednesday that reported US claims that Russia was trying to influence the 2024 election were nonsense and that Moscow felt that the only winner of the election would be the US military-industrial complex.</p>

<p>Butina was responding after CNN reported that the United States plans to accuse Russia later on Wednesday of a campaign to influence the presidential election using online platforms to target American voters with disinformation.</p>

<p>"The US claims were and are pure rubbish and a witch hunt," Butina, who spent 15 months in US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent and is now a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, told Reuters when asked about the CNN report.</p>

<p>"Russia thinks it does not matter who wins the US elections - the only winner is the US private military-industrial complex. That is what matters - and nothing else," Butina said.</p>

<p>The Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly said that Moscow has not meddled in the US election, but is watching it closely.</p>

<p>The Kremlin in June dismissed as absurd US intelligence assertions that Russia was seeking to meddle in the presidential election and has said that US spies were intent on casting Russia as an enemy.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin had suggested in the past that, for Russia, Joe Biden would have been preferable to Donald Trump, though he spoke with irony about Biden.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published on Sunday that Russia saw US Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a more predictable opponent than Trump, but said there was no prospect of an improvement in relations with Washington anyway.</p>

<p>Previous US intelligence assessments have found that Moscow tried to meddle in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Russian officials have suggested that the United States has also meddled in its domestic affairs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suffered an unexpected blow on Wednesday when the small political party helping keep his minority Liberal government in power withdrew its support.</p>

<p>The announcement by Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), does not mean Trudeau is in immediate danger of having to step down and call new elections.</p>

<p>However, he will have to find support from other opposition legislators in the House of Commons chamber if he is to pass budgets and survive confidence votes.</p>

<p>Jagmeet Singh said in a video that he was "ripping up" a deal the two men struck in 2022 and accused Justin Trudeau of not being able to take on the opposition Conservatives, who polls indicate are set to easily win an election that must be held by end-October 2025.</p>

<p>"The Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too devoted to corporate interests to fight for people. They cannot be the change - they cannot restore the hope," said Jagmeet Singh.</p>

<p>Under the 2022 deal, the NDP agreed to keep Justin Trudeau in power until mid-2025 in return for more social spending. Justin Trudeau first took office in November 2015 and polls suggest he is suffering from voter fatigue.</p>

<p>The same tiredness appears to have spread to the New Democratic Party, which despite successfully pushing the Liberals to introduce measures such as a national dental program are languishing in third place in polls.</p>

<p>A Justin Trudeau aide, speaking before the NDP announcement, said it "would be a shame if their own weakness and desperation causes them to walk away from a progressive agreement that is delivering for Canadians".</p>

<p>Jagmeet Singh is not due to speak to media until Thursday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Braving the constant threat of airstrikes and bombings, 15-year-old Youssef Saad, a Gazan oud player, rides his bicycle through the war-ravaged streets of northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, his instrument strapped to his back.</p>

<p>Saad sings for children who have endured daily horrors in 11 months of conflict, trying to offer them a little joy or distraction.</p>

<p>"The homes in my city were once full of dreams," Saad said, gazing at the rubble of the decades-old urban refugee camp, which before the war was built-up and heavily populated.</p>

<p>"Now, they're gone," he says.</p>

<p>Saad was studying at the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music in nearby Gaza City before it was reduced to ruins in the war that has devastated much of the enclave.</p>

<p>Now, living with relatives after his own home was destroyed, he is one of five siblings whose futures have been upended.</p>

<p>His father, a government employee with the Palestinian Authority, always supported Saad's dream of becoming a musician.</p>

<p>But now, Saad's focus has shifted. He spends his days at a Jabalia day centre, playing his oud and singing for children traumatized by war.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on October 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has since killed more than 40,800 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, displaced almost the entire population and laid the besieged enclave to waste.</p>

<p>"Every house holds a tragedy," Saad said. "Some have lost their mother, others their father, their neighbour, or their friend."</p>

<p>Despite the danger, Saad is determined to continue his mission.</p>

<p>"We try to help improve their mental health, even if it means putting myself at risk," he said. "This is my duty to the children."</p>

<p>And he refuses to give up on his dreams for the future: "We, the children of Palestine, strive to stay resilient, even in the face of genocide."</p>

<p>Saad says he lives by a saying that carries him through the darkest days: "If you live, live free, or die standing like trees."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rome's ancient Arch of Constantine was hit by lightning during a heavy storm, causing some fragments to fall off, an official said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"All the fragments were recovered and made safe" following the strike on Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the Colosseum archaeological park told AFP.</p>

<p>"Damage assessments have already begun and analyses are continuing this morning with a works site already operational," she added.</p>

<p>The arch, built in 315 to celebrate the victory of Emperor Constantine in the battle of Ponte Milvio, was already undergoing maintenance work, which had begun on Monday.</p>

<p>Standing about 25 metres high, it is the largest of the three triumphal arches still preserved in Rome. It is located along the route followed by triumphal processions, near the Colosseum.</p>

<p>After a hot, dry summer, the centre of Rome was hit on Tuesday afternoon by a sudden storm, bringing heavy rain, high winds, thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>More than 80 millimetres (3.1 inches) of rain per square metre fell on the historic centre -- about the same amount that falls on average in a month in autumn, the municipality said.</p>

<p>The "downburst" caused floods and winds of up to 90 kilometres per hour (56mph) that brought down trees, it said.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change is shifting weather patterns and increasing the number of extreme weather events.</p>

<p>"It is increasingly evident that the issue of climate change and its impact on our lives is now unavoidable for everyone," said Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta's Oversight Board ruled on Wednesday that the standalone use of the phrase "From the River to the Sea," a slogan oft-used by pro-Palestinian users, does not violate the company's content policies.</p>

<p>The phrase "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free," has been used as a rallying cry for many since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, with Israel accusing those who use it of "anti-Semitism."</p>

<p>The independent Meta board is the top authority in Meta's content moderation decisions. It reviewed three cases involving Facebook posts containing the controversial phrase, which has gained prominence due to the conflict and the worldwide protests against it.</p>

<p>The board found that the content did not break Meta's rules on hate speech, violence and incitement, or dangerous organizations and individuals, and should not lead to post removal on its platforms.</p>

<p>"In upholding Meta's decisions to keep up the content, the majority of the Board notes the phrase has multiple meanings and is used by people in various ways and with different intentions," it said.</p>

<p>"Specifically, the three pieces of content contain contextual signs of solidarity with Palestinians -- but no language calling for violence or exclusion," it added.</p>

<p>The phrase "From the River to the Sea" refers to the geographical area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, which encompasses Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.</p>

<p>It is often used in support of Palestinians as a call for self-determination and equal rights, or to advocate for a one-state solution to the conflict with Jews and Palestinians as citizens of the same nation.</p>

<p>Many Israelis and Jews, however, interpret the phrase as a call for the violent elimination of Israel as a Jewish state.</p>

<p>The board said that a minority of board members felt that given armed group Hamas's October 7 attacks that sparked the war, the phrase's use in a post should be presumed to constitute glorification of the group and violence "unless there are clear signals to the contrary."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of pupils in France are going through a slightly different return to school this autumn, deprived of their mobile phones.</p>

<p>At 180 "colleges", the middle schools French children attend between the ages of 11 and 15, a scheme is being trialled to ban the use of mobile phones during the entire school day.</p>

<p>The trial of the "pause numerique" ("digital pause"), which encompasses more than 50,000 pupils, is being implemented ahead of a possible plan to enforce it nationwide from 2025.</p>

<p>Right now, pupils in French middle schools must turn off their phones. The experiment takes things further, requiring children to hand in their phones on arrival.</p>

<p>It is part of a move by President Emmanuel Macron for children to spend less time in front of screens, which the government fears is arresting their development.</p>

<p>The use of "a mobile phone or any other electronic communications terminal equipment" has been banned in nurseries, elementary schools and middle schools in France since 2018.</p>

<p>In high schools, which French children attend between the ages of 15 and 18, internal regulations may prohibit the use of a cell phone by pupils in "all or part of the premises."</p>

<p>Bruno Bobkiewicz, general secretary of SNPDEN-Unsa, France's top union of school principals, said the 2018 law had been enforced "pretty well overall".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The use of mobile phones in middle schools is very low today", he said, adding that in case of a problem "we have the means to act".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- Improving 'school climate' -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The experiment comes after Macron said in January he wanted to "regulate the use of screens among young children."&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report submitted to Macron, children under 11 should not be allowed to use phones, while access to social networks should be limited for pupils under 15.</p>

<p>With an increasing amount of research showing the risks of excessive screen time for children, the concern has become a Europe-wide issue.</p>

<p>Sweden's Public Health Agency said this week children under the age of two should be kept away from digital media and television completely and it should be limited for more senior ages.</p>

<p>One of Britain's biggest mobile network operators, EE, has warned parents they should not give smartphones to children under the age of 11.</p>

<p>The French education ministry hopes that the cellphone-free environment would improve "school climate" and reduce instances of violence including online harassment and dissemination of violent images.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ministry also wants to improve student performance because the use of telephones harms "the ability to concentrate" and "the acquisition of knowledge".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The experiment also aims to "raise pupils' awareness of the rational use of digital tools".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jerome Fournier, national secretary of the SE-UNSA teachers' union, said the experiment will seek "to respond to the difficulties of schools for which the current rule is not sufficient", even if "in the vast majority of schools it works".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Complicated to implement' -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>According to the education ministry, "it is up to each establishment to determine practical arrangements", with the possibility of setting up a locker system.</p>

<p>Pupils will have to hand in their phones on arrival, putting them in boxes or lockers. They will collect them at the end of classes. The ban also extends to extracurricular activities and school trips.</p>

<p>But the enforcement of the measure across all schools in France from January 2025 could be expensive.</p>

<p>According to local authorities, the measure could cost "nearly 130 million euros" for the 6,980 middle schools in France.</p>

<p>If a phone goes missing from a locker, this would also cause an added financial problem.</p>

<p>Education Minister Nicole Belloubet said on Tuesday that the ban would be "put in place gradually".</p>

<p>"The financial costs seem quite modest to me", she added.</p>

<p>Many are sceptical.</p>

<p>For the leading middle and high school teachers' union Snes-FSU, the ban raises too many questions.</p>

<p>"How will things work on arrival?" wondered the head of the union, Sophie Venetitay. "How will things work during the day," she said, adding that some students have two mobile phones.</p>

<p>The SE-UNSA teachers' union also expressed reservations.</p>

<p>"We're going to need staff to manage arrivals, drops-off and departures, and the collection of mobile phones," said Fournier.</p>

<p>"Sometimes pupils just have time to put their things away when classes end, and run to the bus so as not to miss it", he added.</p>

<p>Bobkiewicz of SNPDEN-Unsa, France's top union of school principals, agreed.</p>

<p>He said he did not want to rummage through pupils' bags to look for their phones.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"It's going to be complicated to implement."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Personal notes that played a key role in convicting child serial killer Lucy Letby were reportedly written under the guidance of counsellors to help the nurse manage severe stress. The handwritten notes, which included disturbing phrases such as "I am evil I did this" and "I killed them on purpose because I am not good enough to care for them," were used as evidence during Letby's trial.</p>

<p>Letby was convicted in 2023 for the murder of seven babies and the attempted murder of six others, including two attempts on one child. Earlier this year, she proclaimed her innocence while receiving an additional whole-life sentence for the attempted murder of another baby girl. She is currently serving 15 whole-life sentences for her crimes, committed at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.</p>

</div>

<p>Sources close to the case told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/03/i-am-evil-i-did-this-lucy-letbys-so-called-confessions-were-written-on-advice-of-counsellors" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Guardian </em></a>that the notes, labelled as confessions, were produced as part of a therapeutic process during counselling sessions. Letby was reportedly advised to document her troubling thoughts and feelings to cope with intense stress. The notes, written after some of her colleagues began suspecting her of murder, included references to her family, pets, and coworkers, and described recurring suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>The prosecution built its case against Letby by highlighting incriminating phrases like "I am evil I did this," which were repeatedly brought to the jury's attention. However, other phrases in the notes, which were also considered confessions, included statements like "Why me?", "I haven't done anything wrong," and "Police investigation slander discrimination victimisation."</p>

<p>Some experts have dismissed Letby's notes as "meaningless" and argued they held no value as evidence, especially if written as part of therapy. David Wilson, a professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, commented, "Many people say things under stress that may imply one thing but mean nothing, other than reflecting their underlying stress." He added that if the notes were part of therapy, they should not be considered confessions.</p>

<p>Richard Curen, chair of the Forensic Psychotherapy Society, echoed this sentiment, stating that "doodling and journaling are ways to take control of one's thoughts," and do not indicate a confession. He noted that Letby's response about the notes in court was "robust" and aligned with her explanation that she was expressing how she felt she was being perceived.</p>

<p>A public inquiry into Letby's case is set to begin next week amid growing questions about the safety of her conviction. Sources revealed that Kathryn de Beger, the head of occupational health and wellbeing at the hospital where Letby worked, had encouraged her to write down her feelings to cope with extreme stress. Letby's Chester GP also advised her to write down thoughts she found difficult to process.</p>

<p>Letby had received several counselling sessions from Ms. de Beger, and her notes frequently referenced her. During her trial, Letby explained that she had always written things down to help understand her feelings, describing the notes as random thoughts. She questioned herself, wondering if she had unintentionally caused harm by not being knowledgeable enough or by not being a good enough nurse.</p>

<p>In her defence, it was argued that the notes reflected her distressed state of mind after being accused of killing babies, rather than an admission of guilt. Her defence barrister, Ben Myers KC, previously argued that the prosecution's case was "riddled with guilt" and that everything Letby said or did was interpreted as evidence of her guilt.</p>

<p>Despite this, no expert forensic psychologists were called to testify on how the notes should be interpreted. The Countess of Chester Hospital declined to comment on the case while the inquiry and further investigations are ongoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least four people have died after a gunman opened fire at a high school in US's Georgia. Police and medics rushed to the school and the neighbourhood was put under "a hard lockdown". The suspect is now arrested.</p>

<p>Local news reports suggest that there are some who have been injured and at least one person has been evacuated in an air ambulance.</p>

<p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigation or GBI said it responded to the "shooting" at the high school.</p>

<p>"At approximately 10:23 a.m., officers from multiple law enforcement agencies and Fire/EMS personnel were dispatched to the high school in reference to a reported active shooting," the Barrow County Sheriff's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Students were evacuated from the scene of the shooting and several were seen huddled at a field near the school. The Barrow County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the suspect has been taken into custody.</p>

<p>The shooter who opened fire inside Apalachee High school is believed to be a 14-year-old boy, a law enforcement source told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/apalachee-high-school-shooting-georgia-09-04-24/index.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_top">CNN</a>, adding that it is not yet known whether the teen attended that school.</p>

<p>CNN also confirmed that at least four people have died in today's shooting incident. In addition to the four killed, over a dozen people are injured, it reported. It further said that not all injuries were gunshot wounds. Several were injuried while trying to take cover or flee the scene.</p>

<p>The Apalachee High School in Barrow County, Georgia, sent out a message to parents saying it was "currently in a hard lockdown after reports of gunfire."</p>

<p>The school is located in the town of Winder, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta, the state capital.</p>

<p>"We have agents on site assisting local, state, and federal law enforcement w/ the investigation. One suspect in custody," the GBI said in a post on social media.</p>

<p>"Law enforcement has arrived. Please do not attempt to come to the school at this time while officers work to secure the area," it added.</p>

<p>ABC News quoted a witness, student Sergio Caldera, as saying he was in chemistry class when he heard gunshots. Caldera, 17, told ABC his teacher opened the door and another teacher ran in to tell her to shut the door "because there's an active shooter."</p>

<p>As students and teachers huddled in the room, someone pounded on his classroom door and shouted several times for it to be opened. When the knocking stopped, Caldera heard more gunshots and screams. He said his class later evacuated to the school's football field, reported Reuters.</p>

<p>"What we see behind us is an evil thing today," Sheriff Jud Smith said during a brief news conference on school grounds.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said on social media website X that state agencies were responding to the incident.</p>

<p>The White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting "and his administration will continue coordinating with federal, state, and local officials as we receive more information."</p>

<p>The U.S. has seen hundreds of shootings inside of schools and colleges in the past two decades, with the deadliest resulting in over 30 deaths at Virginia Tech in 2007. The carnage has sparked pitched debate over the U.S. gun laws and the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which enshrines the right "to keep and bear arms."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The virus, which spreads primarily through close physical contact, has now been detected in an Iowa prison, raising concerns about containment within high-risk environments.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organisation declared the last mpox global emergency over in May 2023. And just over a year later, here we are again. Since the start of 2024, a deadlier, more transmissible strain of the virus has killed over 600 people. New cases have recently appeared in Europe and Asia. In August, the WHO declared a new mpox global health emergency. The WHO Mpox report dated September 3, 2024, provides global data up to July 31, 2024. A total of 102,997 laboratory-confirmed cases and 186 probable cases, including 223 deaths, have been reported to the WHO.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-this-mpox-outbreak-is-different-according-to-experts-6442594"><strong>Also Read | How This Mpox Outbreak Is Different, According To Experts</strong></a></p>

<p>Now the Mpox, a highly contagiously deadly disease that causes rashes and flu-like symptoms, has been detected in an Iowa prison. It is not known how many confirmed cases there are at Fort Dodge Correctional Facility, but prison staff told the local press that they were controlling the situation.</p>

<p>"We're actively managing the situation with robust health measures," Iowa Department of Corrections Chief of Staff Paul Cornelius said in a statement to the Des Moines Register, initially reported by KCCI-TV.</p>

<p><strong>How does monkeypox spread?</strong></p>

<p>Mpox is not airborne like influenza or COVID-19, said Atul Goel. It is primarily transmitted by unprotected close physical contact with an infected person. Apart from sexual transmission, it can also spread through contact with infected material, such as the patient's blisters and scabs; therefore, maintaining hygiene is crucial. Finally, carers must use personal protective measures to avoid contracting and transmitting the infection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States plans to accuse Russia on Wednesday of a campaign to influence the 2024 elections using online platforms to target American voters with disinformation, CNN reported, citing six sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Russian state media network RT will be a focus of the announcement, CNN reported.</p>

<p>The news comes just hours before Attorney General Merrick Garland is due to make public remarks at a meeting of the Justice Department's Election Threats Task Force.</p>

<p>He will be joined by FBI Director Chris Wray, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri, and Matt Olsen, the Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.</p>

<p>A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment ahead of the election task force meeting.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has previously warned that Russia remains a threat to the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>In a speech last month, Monaco warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin "and his proxies are using increasingly sophisticated techniques in their interference operations."</p>

<p>"They're targeting specific voter demographics and swing-state voters in an effort to manipulate presidential and congressional election outcomes," she said.</p>

<p>"They're intent on co-opting unwitting Americans on social media to push narratives advancing Russian interests. They're working to diminish American support for Ukraine. And they're always adapting."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand will drastically raise its international visitor entry charge on October 1st, raising concerns about possible effects on the number of tourists. The International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy is going to increase by almost three times, from NZ$35 (Rs 1,825) to NZ$100 (Rs 5,214).</p>

<p>The government of New Zealand has defended the hefty increase, citing it as an essential step to encourage economic expansion and guarantee that tourists contribute equitably to public services and the calibre of experiences provided in the nation. This action is a component of a larger plan to reduce tourism's negative environmental effects while boosting the local economy.</p>

<p>"The International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) will be raised to NZ$100 to ensure visitors contribute to public services and high-quality experiences while visiting New Zealand," Minister for Tourism and Hospitality Matt Doocey and Minister of Conservation <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/news/media-releases/2024-media-releases/ivl-increase-to-ensure-visitors-contribute-more-to-new-zealand/">Tama Potaka said.</a></p>

<p>"The government is serious about enabling the tourism sector to grow as part of our overall goal of doubling exports in 10 years. International tourism plays a hugely important role in the New Zealand economy, with international visitors spending over NZ$11 billion in the year ending March 2024," Mr Doocey said.</p>

<p>"But international tourism also comes with costs to local communities, including additional pressure on regional infrastructure and higher upkeep and maintenance costs across our conservation estate.</p>

<p>"The IVL was introduced in 2019 as a mechanism to ensure international visitors were contributing directly to these costs, the vast majority of which are paid for by New Zealand taxpayers and ratepayers."</p>

<p>"Public consultation by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) found 93 per cent of submitters supported raising the IVL, with the main rationale being an increase would be reasonable to help cover the costs of tourism."</p>

<p>"The new IVL remains competitive with countries like Australia and the UK, and we are confident New Zealand will continue to be seen as an attractive visitor destination by many around the world."</p>

<p>"A NZ$100 IVL would generally make up less than 3 per cent of the total spending for an international visitor while in New Zealand, meaning it is unlikely to have a significant impact on visitor numbers."</p>

<p>"Increasing the IVL means we can continue to grow international tourism to support economic growth while ensuring international visitors contribute to high-value conservation areas and projects, such as supporting biodiversity in national parks and other highly visited areas and improving visitor experiences on public conservation land," Mr Doocey said.</p>

<p>"Taxpayers already contribute close to NZ$884 million a year directly on tourism and conservation, including tourism promotion, natural heritage, and recreation. This money funds Tourism New Zealand, protects biodiversity within the Department of Conservation estate, and provides quality experiences at the likes of Milford Sound, Aoraki/Mt Cook, and the Tongariro Alpine Crossing," Mr Potaka said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 36-year-old was horrified to find her son having a seizure on the kitchen floor before he went into cardiac arrest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 12-year-old boy nearly lost his life after participating in a dangerous social media trend. Cesar Watson-King inhaled a can of deodorant as part of a challenge known as "chroming," and collapsed at his home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on August 21, reported the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/02/boy-12-narrowly-survives-deadly-social-media-challenge-goes-wrong-21534581/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Metro</em></a>.</p>

<p>His mother, Nichola King, who had just finished breastfeeding her youngest child upstairs, was alarmed by a loud thud and rushed downstairs to investigate. The 36-year-old was horrified to find her son having a seizure on the kitchen floor before he went into cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>Nichola's eldest son, Kaiden, immediately called 999 while Nichola performed CPR on Cesar as they awaited the ambulance. Cesar was rushed to the hospital, where he was placed in a medically induced coma for two days after experiencing further seizures and cardiac arrests.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Cesar recovered and is now back home, but Nichola, a mother of four, has shared photos of her son receiving CPR and in intensive care to warn others about the dangers of chroming. The trend involves inhaling toxic chemicals from substances like paint, solvents, aerosol cans, cleaning products, or petrol to achieve a brief 'high.'</p>

<p>This practice can cause slurred speech, dizziness, hallucinations, nausea, and disorientation, but it can also lead to heart attacks or suffocation.</p>

<p>Recalling the moment she heard her son collapse, Nichola said, "I had just finished breastfeeding my baby and was drifting off to sleep when I heard a really loud bang. I thought one of the kids had done something. I heard Cesar creeping downstairs and assumed he was getting something to eat. The bang sounded like someone had fallen over. I heard a moaning sound from downstairs and thought Cesar had broken a bone or something. When I went downstairs, I saw him lying on the floor, and his eyes were rolling back into his head. It was terrifying. He was having a seizure."</p>

<p>Nichola ran upstairs to grab her phone, but her hands were shaking so much she couldn't unlock it, so she asked her eldest to call an ambulance. She then began performing CPR on Cesar to try to restore his breathing.</p>

<p>"I thought he'd fallen and hit his head. I had no idea what had happened. He turned blue and stopped breathing. I thought he'd died. I was in complete shock. I watched my son die and saw the light go out of his eyes."</p>

<p>After Cesar was taken to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, police informed Nichola that they had found a can of Aldi Lacura deodorant and other chroming paraphernalia on the kitchen floor, leading them to believe Cesar had inhaled the deodorant before losing consciousness.</p>

<p>Nichola said, "I hadn't heard of chroming before this. An older boy had shown him how to do it. When police told me what he'd inhaled, I thought he was going to die. I knew the warnings on the back of the cans that say 'solvent abuse kills instantly.'"</p>

<p>Cesar was later transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital, where he was kept in a medically induced coma for 48 hours. When he came out of the coma, he began showing signs of progress, soon breathing on his own and able to talk and walk.</p>

<p>After eight days in the hospital, Cesar was discharged and allowed to return home.</p>

<p>Nichola said, "I was over the moon. He was almost back to normal when he was discharged-eating, drinking, having a laugh. He just feels tired. We don't know about long-term damage, but his short-term memory is very bad. He couldn't remember what had happened. If I hadn't heard something that night, I would have found a dead body the next morning. I've spoken to Cesar and asked him never to do anything like this again. I've thrown out everything in the house that sprays."</p>

<p>Nichola also wants to warn other children who might be tempted to try chroming: "It's not worth it. It might feel good, but it definitely doesn't when you're in the hospital struggling to breathe and causing pain to your parents."</p>

<p>She added, "I also want to stress the importance of parents being trained in first aid. I believe anyone with kids should attend a course, as it could be the difference between life and death."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday his government needed "new energy" during a major reshuffle that saw the foreign minister and several others hand in their resignation.</p>

<p>"We need new energy. And these steps are related to strengthening our state in various areas," said Zelensky, when asked about the reshuffle and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba's future.</p>

<p>"I am very grateful to the ministers and the entire Cabinet team who have been working for Ukraine, for the sake of Ukrainians, for four and a half years, and some of them have been our ministers for five years," he added.</p>

<p>A source close to the presidential office told AFP that Zelensky and Kuleba "will discuss and decide" his future post.</p>

<p>The announcement came a day after several other ministers and officials resigned in one of Kyiv's most significant government reshuffles since Russia invaded two and a half years ago.</p>

<p>Kuleba -- the face of Ukrainian diplomacy during the war -- is the most senior of the ministers to offer to step down.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old has held the post since 2020 and since Russia's 2022 attack has travelled the world to advocate for Western support for Kyiv and sanctions on Moscow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A recent report reveals that a major marketing firm with clients including Facebook and Google, has admitted to using its "Active Listening" software to monitor smartphone conversations for targeted advertising.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the start of targeted advertising on websites and social media, there have been many theories circulating that claim smartphones and other gadgets, including tablets and laptops, actively listen to users' conversations in order to offer personalised ads. Now, a new report has validated these long-standing suspicions.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.404media.co/heres-the-pitch-deck-for-active-listening-ad-targeting/"><em>404 Media,</em></a> Cox Media Group, a marketing firm whose clients include Facebook and Google, has privately admitted that it listens to users' smartphone microphones and then places ads based on the information that is picked up. The television and radio news conglomerate admitted in a pitch deck to investors that its "Active Listening" software uses artificial intelligence to "capture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/how-to-choose-right-laptop-step-by-step-guide-23680"><strong>Also Read | How To Choose Right Laptop: Step-by-Step Guide</strong></a></p>

<p>"Advertisers can pair this voice data with behavioural data to target in-market consumers," the company wrote in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.404media.co/heres-the-pitch-deck-for-active-listening-ad-targeting/">pitch deck.</a></p>

<p>"Consumers leave a data trail based on their conversations and online behaviour," and that the AI-powered software collects and analyses said "behavioural and voice data from 470+ sources," CMG noted in the deck.</p>

<p>Google removed CMG from its "Partners Program" website after it was contacted by 404 Media to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>"All advertisers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations as well as our Google Ads policies, and when we identify ads or advertisers that violate these policies, we will take appropriate action," a Google spokesperson told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/business/marketing-firm-spies-on-you-through-your-phones-microphone-report/"><em>The Post.</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

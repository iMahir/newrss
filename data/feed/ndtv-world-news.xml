       <description><![CDATA[Rishi Shah, an Indian-American businessman, has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for a Rs 8,300 crore ($1 billion) fraud involving his advertising startup.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rishi Shah, an Indian-American businessman, has been sentenced to <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/indian-american-man-rishi-shahs-rs-8-300-crore-fraud-scheme-shakes-top-us-investors-6014486 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/private-equity/ex-billionaire-gets-7-1-2-years-for-defrauding-goldman-google ">seven and a half years in prison</a> for a Rs 8,300 crore ($1 billion) fraud involving his advertising startup. The fraud scheme deceived high-profile investors such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's venture capital firm.<br />
<br />
Mr Shah, the co-founder of Outcome Health, was indicted on over 12 counts of fraud and money laundering. He was convicted in April 2023, along with his company co-founders Shradha Agarwal and Brad Purdy. The judge sentenced Agarwal to three years in a halfway house and Purdy to two years and three months in prison.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The US Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a civil lawsuit against Shah, Agarwal, Purdy and former chief growth officer Ashik Desai, who pleaded guilty before the trial.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Rishi Shah?</strong><br />
<br />
1. Rishi Shah is a technology investor and entrepreneur who co-founded JumpStart Ventures in 2011. As the Chairman and Managing Director of the company, he made over 60 direct investments in health technology, education technology and media.<br />
<br />
2. Rishi Shah, the son of a doctor, attended Harvard's summer economics programme in 2005. He then studied at Northwestern University for a year before dropping out to start his own business.<br />
<br />
3. In 2006, Shah founded Outcome Health, formerly known as Context Media Health. The company installed TVs at doctors' offices to stream health ads targeted at patients. Under his leadership, Outcome Health grew significantly in valuation and became a crucial player in the tech and healthcare investment communities by the mid-2010s.<br />
<br />
4. The 38-year-old serves on the Board of Directors of Young Presidents Organisation (YPO), 1871 and MATTER, a community of healthcare innovators and incubator for ideas. He also advises technology startup accelerator/incubator programs, nonprofits and universities.<br />
<br />
5. Rishi Shah's net worth was falsely inflated to over $4 billion in 2016. The truth emerged in 2017 when the Wall Street Journal exposed fraudulent activities at Outcome Health. Investors, including Goldman Sachs and Alphabet, sued the company for fraud, revealing that Shah and his co-founder had profited while investors were left with worthless stakes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taliban authorities were told women must be included in public life, UN Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo said on Monday as she defended a decision to sideline civil society groups at official talks in Doha.</p>

<p>Rights organisations have strongly criticised the controversial UN move to exclude the groups, including women's rights activists, from the two-day meeting on Afghanistan as the price for the Taliban government's participation.</p>

<p>"Authorities will not sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format, but they have heard very clearly the need to include women and civil society in all aspects of public life", DiCarlo told a Doha news conference.</p>

<p>The UN-hosted meeting began on Sunday and is the third such gathering to be held in Qatar in a little over a year, but the first to include the Taliban authorities who seized power in Afghanistan for a second time in 2021.</p>

<p>The talks were due to discuss increasing engagement with Afghanistan and a more coordinated response to the country, including economic issues and counter-narcotics efforts.</p>

<p>The international community has wrestled with its approach to the Taliban since they returned to power, with no country officially recognising its government.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Gender apartheid'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The group has imposed a strict interpretation of Islam, with women subjected to laws characterised by the UN as "gender apartheid".</p>

<p>The Taliban refused an invitation to Doha talks in February, insisting on being the only Afghan representatives, to the exclusion of civil society groups. But their condition was accepted in the build-up to this latest round.</p>

<p>The United States said it agreed to participate in Monday's talks after receiving assurances that the talks would meaningfully discuss human rights.</p>

<p>US point man on Afghanistan Thomas West and Rina Amiri, the US special envoy on the rights of Afghan women and girls, in Doha "made clear that the Afghan economy cannot grow while half the population's rights are not respected", State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said.</p>

<p>DiCarlo, who chaired the UN talks in the Qatari capital, said she "hopes" that "there'll be new consideration" of Taliban government policy on women in public life including girls' education.</p>

<p>The UN and international delegations will have the chance to meet with civil society representatives, including women's rights groups, following the close of the main meetings.</p>

<p>But Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement ahead of the talks that "caving into the Taliban's conditions to secure their participation in the talks would risk legitimising their gender-based institutionalised system of oppression".</p>

<p>The Taliban authorities have repeatedly said the rights of all citizens are guaranteed under Islamic law.</p>

<p>The head of the Taliban delegation, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, told the more than 20 assembled special envoys and UN officials at the opening session that diplomats should "find ways of interaction and understanding rather than confrontation", despite "natural" differences in policy.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Engaging constructively'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is keen on engaging constructively with Western nations as well," Mujahid said.</p>

<p>"Like any sovereign state, we uphold certain religious and cultural values and public aspirations that must be acknowledged," he added.</p>

<p>Mujahid also pressed to end sanctions, saying Afghans are "being ganged up on".</p>

<p>The Taliban government spokesman questioned whether ongoing sanctions were "fair practice" after "wars and insecurity for almost half a century as a result of foreign invasions and interference".</p>

<p>Russia, which has maintained an embassy in Kabul, hinted it could drop its own sanctions, saying the group were the de facto authorities.</p>

<p>"We've been saying consistently that you have to recognise this fact and deal with them as such because, whether you like it or not, this movement is running the country now. You cannot simply ignore that," said Russia's envoy to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya.</p>

<p>DiCarlo said the issue of sanctions was "raised" but not discussed in depth.</p>

<p>"It's a member-state issue whether they're going to continue certain sanctions or not. The sanctions are on people, not on the country at large," she said</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Tributes have poured in, honoring his heroism and dedication. His organization, Project Konstantin, praised his unwavering commitment to saving lives and delivering humanitarian aid.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The front-line combat medical worker, Peter Fouche, a volunteer from Britain who saved the lives of over 200 soldiers in Ukraine, has died, according to the <em>BBC.</em></p>

<p>Since 2022, Fouche, who hails from Fulham and formerly worked in west London as a taxi driver and carpenter, has been assisting the Ukrainian Army in Donbas. After taking his oath, he formally enlisted in the Ukrainian military in January 2024 as a medic, as per<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp38xlkk5pzo"> the news report.</a></p>

<p>His daughter Nicole, who is fifteen years old, was left behind when the news of his death was verified earlier today. The 'hero' Fouche, whose 'legacy of bravery and compassion' will never be forgotten, has received an overwhelming amount of tribute.</p>

<p>In a statement on social media his organisation Project Konstantin said: "There are no words that can do Pete's life justice. No words or phrases that could ever encapsulate how much he meant to all of us. Pete's unwavering dedication, endless compassion, and relentless commitment to Ukraine and her people have left an everlasting impact on the countless lives he touched."</p>

<p>"His heroism knew no bounds. He was actively involved in saving more than 200 wounded Ukrainian soldiers, evacuating civilians from the most dangerous frontline cities, as well as bringing humanitarian aid to people in those towns and cities. Pete's bravery and selflessness in the face of danger were nothing short of extraordinary, and his actions will forever be etched in our hearts."</p>

<p>The organisation, which was founded in 2022, provides vehicles, drones, uniforms and food to soldiers in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ever present by US president Joe Biden's side after his calamitous debate -- and foursquare behind him as he vowed to fight on in his reelection bid -- First Lady Jill Biden has been fighting her husband's battles from the front lines.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever present by the US president's side after his calamitous debate -- and foursquare behind him as he vowed to fight on in his reelection bid -- First Lady Jill Biden has been fighting her husband's battles from the front lines.</p>

<p>"I think she is as influential as pundits are claiming and her opinion likely matters more to him than anyone else's," said Tammy Vigil, a professor of communications at Boston University.</p>

<p>"Without her support, it would be impossible for him to continue in the race."</p>

<p>The 73-year-old community college professor was making headlines of her own on Monday, as Vogue unveiled the cover of its August issue -- with the first lady looking seraphic in a long white tuxedo gown by Ralph Lauren.</p>

<p>The picture and the article date from April, long before President Joe Biden struggled to make himself understood during a halting, unfocused performance at a CNN debate against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>But in a note introducing the article, the magazine's editors revealed they'd had a telephone conversation with the first lady shortly after the debate, as calls mounted for her 81-year-old husband to withdraw his candidacy.</p>

<h3><strong>'The right person'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>She told Vogue the Biden family "will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he's been president."</p>

<p>The woman who has shared her last 47 years with the Democratic leader also told a weekend meeting of donors: "Joe isn't just the right person for the job. He's the only person for the job."</p>

<p>On Thursday, after the debate, Jill Biden was shown taking her husband's arm to help him down a few steps in the CNN studio.</p>

<p>The following day, she was there again in a dress that read "vote," as a much more energetic Joe Biden headlined a rally in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Before they married in 1977, Joe Biden had been turned into a widower by a horrific car crash five years earlier that had claimed the lives of his first wife and their infant daughter. His two boys, Beau and Hunter, survived.</p>

<p>The family was revisited by tragedy years later as Beau, a cherished son at the start of what looked like a promising political career of his own, died of cancer.</p>

<p>Adding to the family's difficulties, Hunter struggled for years with a crack addiction.</p>

<p>The first lady is now the center of gravity of the troubled but burgeoning clan, bolstered with the birth of Jill and Joe's daughter Ashley a few years after their wedding -- and eventually the arrival of their grandchildren.</p>

<p>Without her support, the Democrat would not have embarked on his quest for a second term.</p>

<p>When she arrived at the White House, she continued to teach English at a college near Washington, unheard of for a president's wife.</p>

<h3><strong>Decorations and campaigning&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, she assumed the traditional role of first lady -- in charge of Christmas decorations and gala dinner menus, as well as promoting pet causes -- in her case, literacy.</p>

<p>Amid the shaky reelection campaign, Jill Biden could well encourage an outpouring of sympathy with her passionate advocacy for the president since his calamitous showdown with Trump -- but also risks alienating a segment of public opinion by doing so.</p>

<p>"A contemporary US first lady is supposed to be the 'not-so-secret weapon' that helps her husband by attesting to his character and by helping raise funds, et cetera. Because of that, Jill Biden is expected to participate in the campaign," said Vigil.</p>

<p>"However, there are also unstated limits to that activity that are hard to figure out until a particular line is crossed. If she is too vigorous in her support and defense of her husband, people will complain."</p>

<p>The first lady has become a prime target on social media since the debate, with Trump supporters painting her as an unscrupulous manipulator.</p>

<p>"What Jill Biden and the Biden campaign did to Joe Biden tonight -- rolling him out on stage to engage in a battle of wits while unarmed -- is elder abuse, plain and simple," Wyoming Republican Harriet Hageman posted on X after the debate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steve Ballmer passed Bill Gates on Monday to become the sixth-richest person in the world, the first time the former chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. has been wealthier than the company's co-founder.</p>

<p>The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%. The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.</p>

<p>More than 90% of Ballmer's $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.</p>

<p>Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.</p>

<p>In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world's richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.</p>

<p>Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer - one of the company's earliest employees - replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft's largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl strengthened into a top-level category 5 storm late Monday after it swept across several islands in the southeastern Caribbean, dumping heavy rain and unleashing devastating winds.</p>

<p>Beryl is now the earliest category 5 storm in the Atlantic on record, and has developed into a "potentially catastrophic" hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160 miles (260 kilometres) per hour, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.</p>

<p>Early in the day, Grenada's Carriacou Island took a direct hit from the storm's "extremely dangerous eyewall," with sustained winds at upwards of 150 miles, the NHC said.</p>

<p>Nearby islands, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines, also experienced "catastrophic winds and life-threatening storm surge," according to the NHC.</p>

<p>"In half an hour, Carriacou was flattened," Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell told a press conference.</p>

<p>"We are not yet out of the woods," Mitchell added, noting that while no deaths had been reported so far, he could not say for sure that none had occurred.</p>

<p>Video obtained by AFP from St. George's in Grenada showed heavy downpours with trees buffeted by gusts.</p>

<p>Later on social media, Mitchell said the government was working to get relief supplies to both Carriacou and the island of Petite Martinique on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The state of emergency is still in effect. Remain indoors," he wrote on Facebook.</p>

<h3><strong>Rare early strong storm&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Beryl became the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season on Saturday and quickly gathered strength.</p>

<p>Experts say that such a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season -- which runs from early June to late November -- is extremely rare.</p>

<p>It is the first hurricane since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June, and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.</p>

<p>"Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July," hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Barbados appeared to be spared from the worst of the storm but was still hit with high winds and pelting rain, though officials reported no injuries so far.</p>

<p>Barbados seems to have "dodged a bullet," Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in an online video, but nonetheless "gusts are still coming, the storm-force winds are still coming," he said.</p>

<p>Homes and businesses were flooded in some areas, and fishing boats were damaged in Bridgetown.</p>

<p>The storm prompted the cancellation of classes on Monday in several of the islands, while a meeting this week in Grenada of the Caribbean regional bloc CARICOM was postponed.</p>

<p>Jamaica has issued a hurricane warning, ahead of the storm's expected arrival on Wednesday. The NHC also warned the Cayman Islands and areas on the Yucatan Peninsula to monitor the storm's progress.</p>

<h3><strong>Extreme weather&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane.</p>

<p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an "extraordinary" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.</p>

<p>The agency cited warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events including hurricanes have become more frequent and more devastating in recent years as a result of climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The bill is being introduced as New Zealand media companies struggle against technology firms for advertising dollars, leading them to find new ways to provide news programming.</p>

<p>The Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill, introduced last year by the previous Labour government, will be presented in Parliament with amendments to support "our local media companies to earn revenue for the news they produce", Communications Minister Paul Goldsmith said.</p>

<p>The proposed changes would align it more closely with Australia's digital bargaining law, Goldsmith said.</p>

<p>That law, which took effect in Australia in March 2021, gives the government power to force internet firms such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Alphabet Inc's Google to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets, if the parties fail to reach an agreement on payments.</p>

<p>Meta said the New Zealand bill ignored the realities of how its platforms work, their voluntary nature, the preferences of users and the free value it provided news outlets.</p>

<p>"We will continue to be open and transparent with the government and publishers on our business decisions as this bill progresses," a Meta spokesperson said in an email.</p>

<p>Google did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.</p>

<p>After Canada introduced a similar law in 2023, Meta blocked news content from appearing on Facebook. Meta has also said it plans to stop paying Australian media companies for news and the government is still considering whether to intervene.</p>

<p>Goldsmith said the proposed changes would give power to the communications minister to decide which digital platforms would come under the law. An independent regulator will be appointed as the bill's authority, he said.</p>

<p>One of the governing coalition's partners, the right-wing ACT New Zealand party, will not support the bill, Goldsmith said, which means it must have the support of other parties to pass.</p>

<p>The opposition Labour Party said it would check the amendments but supported the intent of the bill.</p>

<p>"I am relieved the government is seeing sense and progressing with legislation to make the media landscape fairer for news companies operating online," Willie Jackson, Labour spokesperson for media and broadcasting, said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday responded to criticism of President Joe Biden's performance in last week's debate, saying his policies over the past 3-1/2 years have boosted confidence in American leadership in the world.</p>

<p>With global media outlets expressing alarm at Biden's debate performance against Donald Trump, Blinken was asked at a Brookings Institute event what "friends and foes" around the world should know about U.S. leadership under Biden.</p>

<p>Blinken said people around the world were looking at what Biden has done since coming into office, not just one night, and that they appreciate his policies.</p>

<p>"They've seen a president who's reinvested America, reinvested America in the world, reinvested in these alliances, in these partnerships in ways that they seek and want," Blinken said.</p>

<p>Many Americans expressed dismay at both candidates after last Thursday's 90-minute debate on CNN. Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, his voice hoarse from a cold, stumbled over some answers and trailed off during others. Republican Trump, 78, repeated a series of outrageous contentions that have been proven false many times, including claims that he actually won the 2020 election, but Biden did not refute them.</p>

<p>It was the first time since Thursday that Blinken, a top U.S. diplomat and a long-serving aide to Biden, was asked about the debate. He stressed Biden's performance in office.</p>

<p>"If you look at surveys around the world, for what they're worth, you see it again and again and again, that confidence in American leadership has gone up dramatically over the last 3-1/2 years," he said.</p>

<p>"That doesn't just happen. ... It's the product of policies that we pursue, it's the product of our engagement. And they see President Biden having led the way in all of those different areas, and in ways that are bringing people together and focused in the same way on the challenges that we have before us and that are common to so many other countries."</p>

<p>Biden supporters had hoped the debate would dispel worries that he was too old for another term, but instead, it fed concerns. Some Democrats have called for Biden to drop out of the race.</p>

<p>Biden's performance raised cries of alarm in global media. France's newspaper Le Monde compared Biden to a shipwreck. Britain's left-leaning Daily Mirror called his performance a "gaffe-strewn nightmare". The Sydney Morning Herald said, "Trump monstered Biden. The Democrats can't win with Joe."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump will face each other in the 2024 presidential election in what is expected to be a divisive and closely fought contest.</p>

<h4><strong>Here is a timeline of events related to the November&nbsp;5 election between now and Inauguration Day in January 2025.</strong></h4>

<h3><strong>2024</strong></h3>

<p>- <strong>July 11</strong>: Trump, the first sitting or former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, will be sentenced in the Manhattan hush money case where he was found guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star. He denies wrongdoing and plans to appeal.</p>

<p>- <strong>July 15-18</strong>: Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party formally chooses its candidate.</p>

<p>- <strong>In late July or beyond</strong>: Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to debate Trump's yet-to-be-announced running mate on CBS on either of the proposed dates of July 23 or Aug. 13. Trump has accepted a vice presidential debate to be held by Fox News.</p>

<p>Fox wrote to both campaigns suggesting July 23, Aug. 13 or other dates following the party conventions. Trump's campaign has yet to say whether his running mate would debate Harris on CBS. Nor has the Biden campaign said if Harris would debate on Fox.</p>

<p>- <strong>By Aug. 7</strong>: The Democrats are set to hold a "virtual roll call" to nominate Biden. It will take place by Aug. 7, the original ballot certification deadline in Ohio, although that date has since been pushed back.</p>

<p>Biden had been due to be officially nominated at the Democratic National Convention later in August.</p>

<p>- <strong>Aug. 19-22</strong>: Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>- <strong>Sept. 10</strong>: The second debate between Biden and Trump will be hosted by ABC.</p>

<p>- <strong>Nov 5</strong>: Election Day</p>

<p>-<strong> Later in November</strong>: It could take days for the election result to be known, especially if it is close and mail-in ballots are a factor.</p>

<h3><strong>2025</strong></h3>

<p>- <strong>Jan. 6</strong>: The vice president presides over the Electoral College vote count at a joint session of Congress, announces the results and declares who has been elected. Ahead of the count on Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Trump lambasted his vice president, Mike Pence, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. On that day, the U.S. Capitol was attacked by rioters, and some people chanted, "hang Mike Pence" as they tried to stop the count. Both chambers of Congress later resumed their work and certified Biden's win.</p>

<p>Congress has since passed the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022, which requires approval of one-fifth of the House and Senate to consider a challenge to a state's results - a much higher bar than existed before when any single lawmaker from each chamber could trigger a challenge.</p>

<p>- <strong>Jan. 20</strong>: The inauguration of the election winner and their vice president takes place. At this ceremony, the victor and vice president are officially sworn into office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is deepening its relationship with India in several key areas, a senior administration official said Monday.</p>

<p>"India is a country in which we are deepening our relations within a number of keyspaces, especially as it relates to deepening our economic ties, deepening our security cooperation," State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>

<p>"The president had the opportunity to briefly see Prime Minister Modi in the margins of the G7 a couple of weeks ago," he added.</p>

<p>Patel said that he imagines there will be a number of additional areas where the two countries could continue to deepen cooperation.</p>

<p>"National Security Adviser Sullivan just had a visit to Delhi a number of weeks ago as well," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on Pakistan, Patel, though he denounced terrorism, said "ultimately, this is between India and Pakistan." "Broadly, of course, we welcome any countries making more positive relations with their neighbours. But as it relates to this specifically, I just, I don't have anything to offer," he added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-American businessman Rishi Shah, the former billionaire cofounder of Outcome Health, has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison by a US court. The saga involves a Rs 8,300 crore ($1 billion) fraud scheme that shook high-profile investors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's venture capital firm. The verdict, handed down by US District Judge Thomas Durkin, closed the lid on one of the largest corporate fraud cases in recent history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/private-equity/ex-billionaire-gets-7-1-2-years-for-defrauding-goldman-google">report</a>, Outcome Health was a brainchild of Mr Shah during his university days. Originally known as Context Media Health, the company was founded in 2006 with a vision of changing medical advertising through installing televisions at doctors' offices to stream health ads targeted at patients. Mr Shah was joined by his co-founder Shradha Agrawal, and the growth for the company became exponential as far as valuation was concerned, all in the quest to bridge the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers innovatively through ad placements.</p>

<p>By the mid-2010s, Outcome Health had emerged as a big player in the tech and healthcare investment communities. The promise of meshing cutting-edge technology into traditional healthcare marketing beckoned high-profile investors. During its meteoric rise, Outcome was securing enormous funds and clientele, placing Mr Shah as a rising star in Chicago corporate circles.</p>

<h3><strong>Lies And Deceit</strong></h3>

<p>But behind the glittering success, Outcome Health's foundations were rotting. Prosecutors said Mr Shah, 38, along with Ms Agarwal and another defendant, chief financial officer Brad Purdy, engaged in a scheme of monumental fraud against investors, clients, and lenders by misrepresenting the operational and financial health of the company. At the centre of the fraud was selling more advertising inventory than could be delivered by Outcome Health, and fabricating data to cover up the shortfall.</p>

<p>It defrauded pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk A/S and other clients about its network size and ad reach. Misleading information, combined with fraudulent data, painted a picture of exponential revenue growth that beguiled further investment or financial backing.</p>

<p>Mr Shah lived life to the fullest because the money rolling in from the inflated ad sales and financing from investors was huge. Reports exposed this spending habit, featuring exotic trips with private jets and yachts, even the purchase of a $10 million home. In 2016, Mr Shah's net worth was pegged at more than $4 billion, reflecting an amount depreciated and inflated by a raft of duplicitous accounting practices.</p>

<p>The facade began to crumble in 2017 when a media expose by the Wall Street Journal brought the fraudulent activities into light.</p>

<p>Later, a group of investors that included Goldman Sachs, Alphabet, and Governor Pritzker's firm filed lawsuits against Outcome Health, accusing the firm of fraud in its $487.5 million fundraising earlier in the year. The fundraiser had returned a $225 million dividend for Mr Shah and Ms Agarwal but left investors holding a grossly overvalued stake in a company teetering on collapse.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Legal Consequences</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Shah was indicted on more than a dozen counts of fraud and money laundering until he was convicted on these charges in April 2023. He was joined by Ms Agarwal and Mr Purdy. While the prosecutors asked for 15 years for Mr Shah and 10 years for his co-conspirators,</p>

<p>District Judge Durkin's final rulings were disparate and included a three-year sentence for Ms Agarwal in a halfway house and Mr Purdy two years and three months in prison. Aside from the criminal case, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the US has likewise filed a civil action against Mr Shah, Ms Agarwal, Mr Purdy, and former chief growth officer Ashik Desai. Mr Desai and other Outcome employees had pleaded guilty already before the jury trial.</p>

<h3><strong>Public Apology</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Shah, in ill health, spoke of remorse and accepted responsibility at sentencing. In a prepared remark he accepted his failure to ensure adequate management of the aggressive Outcome Health expansion and creating a corporate culture that led through deceptive practices. He said he was "ashamed and embarrassed" by the misconduct that brought down the company.</p>

<p>"The culture I created permissioned people on my team to think it was okay to create false data in response to a client question." he confessed.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's son Hunter is suing right-wing Fox News for airing nude images of him in a miniseries that he claims amount to "revenge porn," court documents showed Monday.</p>

<p>"The Trial of Hunter Biden" was made up of six episodes published in 2022 on Fox Nation, the conservative broadcaster's online platform owned by the family of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.</p>

<p>A dramatized version of a criminal trial, the series contained a warning the proceedings were fiction, depicting the first son being prosecuted for graft -- accusations that have been made for years by Donald Trump supporters who point to Hunter Biden's past business ties with Ukraine and China.</p>

<p>The accusations have never led to legal action.</p>

<p>But the series integrates real images of Biden, "depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts," the complaint alleges.</p>

<p>"Fox published and disseminated these intimate images to its vast audience of millions as part of an entertainment program in order to humiliate, harass, annoy and alarm Mr. Biden and to tarnish his reputation."</p>

<p>The images originated from a laptop that Hunter Biden dropped off at a computer repair shop, but which he never collected.</p>

<p>Its contents have been circulating ever since, and are the subject of widespread conspiracy theories as well as embarrassing fodder for the political opposition.</p>

<p>"This entirely politically motivated lawsuit is devoid of merit," Fox News said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Mr. Biden did not complain about (it) until sending a letter in late April 2024. The program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution.</p>

<p>"Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden's own making, and we look forward to vindicating our rights in court."</p>

<p>Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury in June of illegal possession of a firearm in a federal trial that again brought to light his years of addiction to alcohol, cocaine and crack cocaine, apparent in many of the images discovered on the laptop.</p>

<p>In September he will face a separate tax fraud case, a trial that is likely to distract from his father's presidential campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Monday freed the head of Gaza's biggest hospital who said he was tortured during seven months in detention, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon after criticised the release as a "serious mistake".</p>

<p>Tensions over the freeing of Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammed Abu Salmiya became public almost as soon as he was sent back to Gaza with dozens of other Palestinians held since the October 7 attacks that sparked the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>The World Health Organisation expressed concern after Abu Salmiya was detained on November 23 with other hospital staff.</p>

<p>Israel's military has accused Hamas of using hospitals, including Al-Shifa, as a cover for military operations, which the operative group denies.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he had ordered the Shin Bet intelligence agency to conduct an investigation into the release and provide him with the results by Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The release of the director of Shifa Hospital is a serious mistake and a moral failure. The place of this man, under whose responsibility our abductees were murdered and held, is in prison," Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>The decision was made "without the knowledge of the political echelon," he added.</p>

<p>The agency had said earlier that it had decided on the release with the Israeli military "to free up places in detention centres".</p>

<p>It said it "opposed the release of terrorists" who had taken part in attacks on Israeli civilians "so it was decided to free several Gaza detainees who represent a lesser danger".</p>

<p>National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, a hard right member of Netanyahu's coalition, earlier called Abu Salmiya's release "with dozens of other terrorists" a "security abandonment".</p>

<p>Israeli raids and a weeks-long battle earlier this year have devastated Al-Shifa. Other clinics and medical institutions have also suffered damage, leading to condemnation from UN agencies, NGOs and foreign governments.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya said he and other prisoners were put through "severe torture" in Israeli prisons during their detention.</p>

<p>"Several inmates died in interrogation centres and were deprived of food and medicine," according to Abu Salmiya, who said his thumb was still broken.</p>

<p>"For two months no prisoner ate more than a loaf of bread a day," he added.</p>

<p>"Detainees were subjected to physical and psychological humiliation."</p>

<p>The medical chief said no charge had ever been made against him.</p>

<h3><strong>Emotional reunions&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>After crossing back to Gaza, five detainees were admitted to Al-Aqsa Hospital at Deir al-Balah and the others were sent to hospitals in Khan Yunis, a medical source said.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent at Deir al-Balah saw some detainees in emotional reunions with their families.</p>

<p>Hamas denied that it used hospitals as a shield for its operations. It called in a statement on the United Nations and countries to "stop this massacre" of prisoners in Israeli jails. It called on the International Committee of the Red Cross to "reveal the fate of thousands of Palestinian detainees" in Israel.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya was not the only top medical practitioner detained.</p>

<p>The Gaza European hospital in Khan Yunis said the head of its orthopaedic unit, Bassam Miqdad, was among those freed on Monday.</p>

<p>In May, Palestinian rights groups said a senior Al-Shifa surgeon had died in an Israeli jail after being detained. The Israeli army said it was unaware of the death.</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,900 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media platform X owner <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/elon-musk-and-shivon-zilis-welcomed-new-baby-this-year-was-never-a-secret-says-tesla-ceo-5964126" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> on Monday slammed US Vice President Kamala Harris for "lying" about former president Donald Trump's stance on abortion ban.</p>

<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Harris said that Trump, who is running against <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/supreme-court-immunity-ruling-sets-dangerous-precedent-biden-6014176" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> in the November 5 US presidential election, "would ban abortion nationwide". She also said that she and Biden will do "everything in their power to stop him and restore women's reproductive freedom."</p>

<p>Her post, however, was flagged by a community note, a fact-checking type feature on X that allows people to add context to potentially misleading posts collaboratively.</p>

<p>The community note in her post said that "President Trump has repeatedly said he will not sign a national abortion ban."</p>

<p>Musk then called out Harris and said, "When will politicians, or at least the intern who runs their account, learn that lying on this platform doesn't work anymore?"</p>

<p>The billionaire attached the screenshot of her post receiving the community note.</p>

<p>The topic of abortion ban in the US has figured prominently in the presidential campaigning between Biden, a Democrat, and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-has-some-immunity-from-prosecution-as-ex-president-us-supreme-court-6012125" target="_blank">Trump</a>, his Republican opponent.</p>

<p>Abortion regulation was placed in the hands of the US states following the country's Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning the historic Roe v. Wade ruling that had protected abortion rights nationwide.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Principal Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, Vedant Patel reiterated the country's stand on terrorism and said that they hope that any country on the planet condemns terrorism anywhere.</p>

<p>Vedant Patel was asked by a media person about where the US relations stand with India and Pakistan as India has always emphasised that terrorism and talks cannot go together with Pakistan.</p>

<p>Addressing the media briefing on Monday, the US official was responding to a question on where the US stands as a triangle between the US and India, Pakistan and India and India-US relations.</p>

<p>The reporter restated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intent and quoted that he has been trying even during his second term that India wants a good relationship with Pakistan, adding that terrorism and talks cannot go together.</p>

<p>"We would hope that any country on the face of the planet condemns terrorism anywhere," Patel said.</p>

<p>He further said that the US welcomes any countries making more positive relations with their neighbours.</p>

<p>"But ultimately this is between India and Pakistan broadly, of course, we welcome any countries making more positive relations with their neighbours. But as it relates to this specifically, I just don't have anything to offer," he said.</p>

<p>Vedant Patel emphasised that India is a country in which the US is deepening relations in a number of key spaces.</p>

<p>"India is a country in which we are deepening our relations within a number of key spaces, especially as it relates to deepening our economic ties, deepening our security cooperation," he said.</p>

<p>He further noted that US President Joe Biden had the opportunity to briefly see Prime Minister Modi in the margins of the G7 a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>"So, this is an area we will continue to cultivate this relationship," he said.</p>

<p>Further underscoring PM Modi's state visit to the US, Patel said that there will be several additional areas where the US continue to deepen cooperation.</p>

<p>"You are no stranger to the fact that we hosted India for a state visit last summer. And I imagine there will be a number of additional areas where we continue to deepen cooperation. National Security Adviser Sullivan just had a visit to Delhi a number of weeks ago as well," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden warned on Monday that the US Supreme Court's landmark ruling on presidential immunity sets a "dangerous precedent" that Donald Trump would exploit if elected in November.</p>

<p>"For all practical purposes today's decision almost certainly means there are no limits to what a president can do. This is a fundamentally new principle, and it's a dangerous precedent," Biden said in a speech at the White House.</p>

<p>"The American people must decide if they want to entrust... once again, the presidency to Donald Trump, now knowing he'll be more emboldened to do whatever he pleases, whenever he wants to do it," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's Defence Ministry said on Monday that its forces had taken control of two villages in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>It was the second day in succession that Moscow has announced the capture of new localities. Ukrainian military statements have, at least in part, denied the Russian assertion.</p>

<p>The Russian ministry said in a statement that its forces were in control of the settlement of Stepova Novoselivka in Kharkiv region, and of Novopokrovske in Donetsk region.</p>

<p>The General Staff of the Ukraine's Armed Forces, in an evening report, said its troops had repelled 17 attacks in the Kupiansk sector near Kharkiv, including by Stepova Novoselivka. It said fighting was raging near Synkivka, further west.</p>

<p>Russia has announced a string of incremental gains since capturing the city of Avdiivka in Donetsk region in February.</p>

<p>Donetsk and Kharkiv regions remain focal points along the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line in Ukraine's east and south.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian military earlier said it had repelled Russian attacks near two towns in Donetsk region -- Novooleksandrivka and Spirne, a day after Russian forces claimed control of them. The evening report said fighting continued near both localities.</p>

<p>The evening report identified the Pokrovsk front as the theatre of the fiercest fighting. Forty-four Russian assaults had been repelled in the last 24 hours, with 14 clashes still going on.</p>

<p>The military said Russia maintained a military presence across the border from Ukraine's northern Chernihiv and Sumy regions, adding that Moscow's forces were increasing the density of minefields and conducting sabotage activities.</p>

<p>That area is under scrutiny for any sign that Russia plans to open a new front to pressure Ukraine's outnumbered defenders.</p>

<p>Russia launched an assault into the border areas of the northeastern region of Kharkiv in May, opening a new front in 28-month full-scale invasion.</p>

<p>The latest Ukrainian report said Kyiv's troops controlled the area and turned back 11 Russian assaults near three towns, including Vovchansk, 5 km (3 miles) from the border.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A 51-year-old Indian American physician from the Chicago area has pleaded guilty to a federal healthcare fraud by billing Medicaid and private insurers for nonexistent services.</p>

<p>Mona Ghosh, who owns and operates Progressive Women's Healthcare, specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology services, pleaded guilty to two counts of health care fraud.</p>

<p>Each count is punishable by up to ten years in federal prison.</p>

<p>US District Judge Franklin U Valderrama has set sentencing for October 22.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors allege that Ghosh is accountable for at least $2.4 million in fraudulently obtained reimbursements.</p>

<p>She admitted in her plea agreement that she was accountable for more than $1.5 million of such fraudulently obtained reimbursements.</p>

<p>The final amount will be determined by the court at sentencing, a media release said.</p>

<p>According to court documents, from 2018 to 2022, Ghosh submitted, and caused her employees to submit, fraudulent claims to Medicaid, TRICARE, and numerous other insurers for procedures and services that were not provided or were not medically necessary, some of which were performed without patient consent.</p>

<p>Ghosh also fraudulently overstated the length and complexity of in-office and telemedicine visits and submitted claims using billing codes for which the visits did not qualify in order to seek higher reimbursement rates, her plea agreement states.</p>

<p>She admitted that she had prepared false patient medical records to support the fraudulent reimbursement claims.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 39 people have lost their lives in recent anti-government protests in Kenya against the new tax hike, reported Al Jazeera, citing the national rights watchdog.</p>

<p>The activists have geared up for a new round of protests this week in Kenya.</p>

<p>The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) announced the toll on Monday, which is almost double the figure previously disclosed by the government for those killed while demonstrating against a raft of unpopular tax increases that have now been withdrawn.</p>

<p>KNCHR records further indicated that 39 people have died and 361 have been injured "in relation to the protests countrywide", the state-funded body said in a statement, adding that the figures covered the period from June 18 to July 1, reported Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>It further stated that there had been 32 cases of "enforced or involuntary disappearances" and 627 arrests of protesters.</p>

<p>Moreover, largely peaceful anti-tax rallies, led by mostly young Gen-Z protesters, descended into shocking scenes of deadly violence last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the contentious legislation.<br />
Later, following the announcement of the vote, crowds ransacked the parliament complex in central Nairobi and it was partly set ablaze as police fired live bullets at protesters, as reported by Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>Notably, it is the most serious crisis to be confronted by the government of President William Ruto since he took office in September 2022 following a deeply divisive election in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.</p>

<p>Ruto, in a televised interview on Sunday, said that 19 people had died in the protests, but insisted that he did not have "blood on my hands" and pledged an investigation into the deaths.<br />
The KNCHR "continues to condemn in the strongest terms possible the unwarranted violence and force that was inflicted on protesters, medical personnel, lawyers, journalists and on safe spaces such as churches, medical emergency centres and ambulances," the rights body said.</p>

<p>"We maintain that the force used against the protesters was excessive and disproportionate," it added.</p>

<p>The watchdog also said that it "strongly condemns the violent and shocking acts of lawlessness that were exhibited by some of the protesters" including the parliament and other government buildings.</p>

<p>Moreover, fresh protests have been called by activists beginning Tuesday despite last week, when Ruto announced that he would not sign into law the bill containing the tax hikes.</p>

<p>Additionally, leaflets have been posted on social media with the hashtags "Occupy Everywhere", "Ruto must go" and "Reject Budgeted Corruption".</p>

<p>India has also issued an advisory for its nationals in Kenya, as protests against a tax hike turned violent, causing a rampage in the African nation.</p>

<p>The Indian Embassy in Kenya earlier advised the Indian nationals there to "exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up."</p>

<p>"In view of the prevailing tense situation, all Indians in Kenya are advised to exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up," the Embassy stated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

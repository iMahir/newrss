       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk gave another $56 million to elect Donald Trump and other Republicans in the final weeks of the 2024 election, bringing to at least $132 million the amount spent by the world's richest person to elevate his allies to the White House and Congress, federal filings show.</p>

<p>The donations - revealed in disclosures with the Federal Election Commission Thursday - show that the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer has poured money into the Washington trifecta: funding Trump's White House bid, along with supporting House and Senate Republicans.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-elon-musk-says-he-is-all-in-for-donald-trump-as-the-next-us-president-6740162">Musk, who had only given</a> modest political donations until the 2024 election cycle, funneled $43.6 million in the first half of October into America PAC, the group he founded, bringing his total for the year to $118.6 million. He also spent millions more spreading money around the political system which helps him build a network of allies.</p>

<p>The filings show donations through Oct. 16 and are the final detailed look at federal campaigns' and super political action committees' finances before Election Day on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>Musk's super PAC is paying for operations to boost voter turnout for Trump in battleground states and Republicans in swing districts that could help the GOP win a House majority. America PAC is also spending on digital ad campaigns, some of which target young men, trying to get them to the polls to offset Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris' advantage among women voters.</p>

<p>Musk's giving to other groups included $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC that aims to elect Senate Republicans, and $2.3 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC doing get-out-the-vote work for Republican Senate campaigns in Montana, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The donations are the latest demonstration of how Musk, whose companies boast billions of dollars worth of federal contracts and who has personally bristled at government regulations, is expanding his political influence network to include a potential future president and members of Congress.</p>

<p>His political activities have received some scrutiny from federal officials. The US Justice Department sent a letter to his super PAC this week warning that a program to give $1 million a day to registered voters in swing states who sign an online petition may violate federal laws. It's illegal to pay individuals to vote or to register to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to Musk, eight other individuals also donated to America PAC, including investor Nelson Peltz and members of the DeVos family, who are longtime Republican donors. Betsy DeVos was Trump's education secretary.</p>

<p>America PAC spent $47 million and had $3.3 million cash on hand heading into the last 19 days before Election Day. Since its launch earlier this year through Oct. 16, America PAC has spent $105 million backing Trump.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-elon-musk-donates-nearly-75-million-for-donald-trumps-presidential-cause-6807420">Musk is playing</a> an unprecedented role in the 2024 campaign for a political donor. In addition to his donations, he's appeared on stage with Trump and held his own campaign rallies without the former president. At an event earlier this month in Pennsylvania, Musk used ominous rhetoric, telling the crowd that "this election is going to decide the fate of America. And along with the fate of America, the fate of western civilization."</p>

<p>The former president has said he would ask Musk to join his administration should he win a second term, heading up an effort to cut government waste nicknamed the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a reference to a cryptocurrency Musk has embraced.</p>

<p>Deep-pocketed donors are playing a critical role in supporting Trump, who lags far behind Harris in fundraising. She's been outspending his campaign in all seven of the battleground states that will decide the election in the final stretch since Labor Day, according to data from AdImpact. Her media buys total $352 million compared to $214 million for Trump.</p>

<p>Harris' financial advantage has also allowed her to open more then 330 field offices staffed with more than 2,000 paid employees to help conduct its voter-mobilization operations. But the candidates are statistically tied among likely voters in each of the seven swing states in the Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll, with the razor-thin margins in these battlegrounds underscoring how the final blitz of advertising, rallies and door-knocking campaigns could decide who claims the White House.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ernst &amp; Young (EY) recently fired dozens of employees in the US for attending multiple online training courses simultaneously during the firm's learning week organised earlier this year. According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, the company said that the act amounted to an ethical breach. "Our core values of integrity and ethics are at the forefront of everything we do. Appropriate disciplinary action was recently taken in a small number of cases where individuals were found to be in violation of our global code of conduct and US learning policy," EY said. However, the dismissals, which took place last week, have sparked an internal debate about business ethics and the limits of multitasking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the termination, several employees who were sacked for the reason spoke with the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/dff2246e-e949-4cfb-833d-a8e38ba1e7da" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, countering that there was no prior warning from the company against attending multiple courses at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Their emails marketing EY Ignite actually encouraged us to join as many sessions as our schedule allowed," one person told the <em>FT</em>, adding, "We all work with three monitors. I was hoping to hear new ideas that I could bring to the table to separate myself from others."</p>

<p>Another person who lost their job said that the firm "breeds a culture of multitasking". "If you are forced to bill 45 hours a week and do many more hours of internal work, how can it not?" the former employee said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A third person said, "I know a partner who will do two (client) calls and switch their camera on and off depending on who he is talking to. If this is unethical, then that is unethical, too."</p>

<p>EY termed the sackings as "appropriate disciplinary action", saying attending more than one course at the same time was a breach of the company's ethics. But some staff reacted to the latest dismissals by calling them a disproportionately severe response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EY's response was "just bizarre", said one employee, adding, "Perhaps reduce their rating, deduct bonus, or even delay promo, but simply terminating them effective immediately is just cruel... If this was so important, then implement better systems."</p>

<p>The firm has since updated its guidance for training events, explicitly requiring staff to "be present for all content and class interactions." The dismissed employees were reportedly not provided severance packages.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Bank announced on Thursday a new gender strategy aimed at boosting economic opportunities for women and enabling their participation in the global economy through social protection and access to broadband and capital.</p>

<p>The Gender Strategy 2024-2030, unveiled during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, has set goals by 2030 that aim to enable 300 million more women to use broadband internet, unlocking essential services, financial services, education and job opportunities.</p>

<p>It also aims to support 250 million women with social protection programs focusing on the poorest and most vulnerable, and to provide 80 million more women and women-led businesses with capital, addressing constraints to entrepreneurship growth.</p>

<p>"When we increase women's economic participation, it not only boosts the global economy, but also strengthens families and communities," World Bank President Ajay Banga said in a statement. "Through economic empowerment, we are building a ladder out of poverty and extending hope and dignity as far as possible."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With less than two weeks to voting day, the US presidential race remains maddeningly deadlocked and statistically tied. A gain of a percentage point here, a fraction there could mean victory or defeat. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That said, Donald Trump appears to have some last-minute momentum while Kamala Harris seems to be struggling to win new converts while losing a percentage of traditional voters. Although the average of various national polls still shows Harris ahead with 48.1% and Trump at 46.4%, her four-point lead in August has narrowed and changed the ‘vibe' somewhat. But national polls don't tell the real story, it's state polls where the action is because of the complicated Electoral College system in the presidential election.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Of the seven so-called battleground states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina –Trump is ahead in five and Harris in two in a sign of the wheels turning in his favour. But it's all within the margin of error.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Beyond The "Vibes" Campaign</strong></h2>

<p>Last week, Nate Silver, a reputed pollster, listed 24 reasons why Trump could win, ranging from the Electoral College bias favouring Republicans, voters' negative perceptions about the economy, illegal immigration ballooning under the current administration where Harris is Vice-President to the shift in Black and Latino male vote towards Trump, and, most importantly, Harris's failure to define herself on issues in a manner that resonates.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Being a “joyful warrior” and running a “vibes” campaign is proving inadequate—voters are worried about inflation, not what influencers say. Harris has been in office for nearly four years but can't seem to disassociate herself from the administration's failed policies in a way that works for her.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
No surprise then the Democrats are anxious while the Republicans are swaggering a bit at the moment. But the tables could turn yet again because polls can be and have been wrong in the past two elections. Things could swing either way in the final phase, depending on voter turnout and the ground game where Democrats have a definite edge. The Dems also have more money—the Harris campaign has collected $1 billion in small and large donations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Harris's Warnings Are Not Working</strong></h2>

<p>But what about the closing arguments to sway those who are still undecided? Trump and Harris are making a similar case—‘elect me because the other is a threat to democracy, your way of life and to America itself'. While Trump's arsenal always had shades of the apocalypse—Democrats as ‘closet communists', Harris as a ‘radical leftist', ‘illegals are invading', ‘world is in chaos'--Harris has also caught the fever in the final stretch.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Her attacks are increasingly pointed. She is busy painting Trump as toxic, dangerous, unchecked, unstable, even a potential dictator and a man who can't follow a thought for a minute. A second Trump administration would be a living manifestation of Project 2025, an extremist agenda prepared by ultra-conservatives. The plan includes mass firing of government workers and dismantling the entire department of education. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The problem is, the warnings are not working, especially with blue-collar voters. Her campaign might be making a mistake by hammering the wrong nail. Voters have already factored in Trump's dangerous flaws and taken a measure. They have filtered out what they don't like. His inflammatory rhetoric and threats to unleash the military on fellow Americans (Democrats) are seen as bombastic talk and not a plan of action. After two assassination attempts, he is also a beneficiary of some sympathy, especially with those who feel the Democrats overreached by drowning him in legal cases.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>An Undefined Candidate</strong></h2>

<p>By contrast, Harris remains largely undefined for many Americans. Is she a populist who will take on big business, or will she swim within her lane? Even when given a chance to clarify her positions on illegal immigration and what she would do differently to fix the economy, she played safe instead of striking a different note. It reinforced the idea she's an incumbent defending the current administration's record, not a candidate of change who will “turn the page” as she says.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Voters are hungering for “change” from this administration's policies, whether on the economy, broken borders, or two raging wars. Trump has hammered on all those issues from the start and set the narrative of Democrats' failure on all three.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While Harris may be struggling with male voters, she does have an advantage with women on the issue of reproductive rights. No matter how Trump spins it, he can't get away from the fact that his Supreme Court appointees dismantled Roe v. Wade, taking away a woman's right to have an abortion. The court sent the matter to states resulting in a patchwork of restrictive laws, with some states banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Harris is passionate when speaking on the issue, unlike any other. She needs to hammer on it until the end to rouse women to come out in ever greater numbers. At the same time, she could admit that illegal immigration should have been managed better.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Dems and liberals feel outraged that Trump, a convicted felon, might win the White House again, but voters have other things on their minds. It doesn't help Harris to parade Republicans who broke from Trump and consider him a closet fascist at her town hall meetings. It doesn't matter how many Republicans sign letters in her support. What matters are her plans, policies and predilections, which even at this late stage remain largely confined to her website. They haven't been translated into effective messaging to voters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The McDonald's Masterstroke</strong></h2>

<p>Economic populism is working well for Trump. He appeared at a McDonald's in the battleground state of Pennsylvania last Sunday to cook fries and hand out orders at the drive-in window. It was a political masterstroke and reinforced the image that he connects with average folks. How a billionaire who has played the system forever can also play a messiah for the working class will remain a mystery, but that's where the messaging of one camp has succeeded over the other.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Democratic Party's disconnect from working-class voters—Blacks, Whites and Latinos—is shocking to some, but it's been in the process for some time. The Republicans stole the constituency in broad daylight, while the Democrats were busy playing ‘woke' and pandering to the extreme fringe of the party. In the process, the Dems lost touch with a majority of everyday Americans who don't live in California and New York.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, the two brothers whose grisly 1989 murder of their wealthy parents was the subject of a recent Netflix series, could be released from prison after a US prosecutor said Thursday he would ask a judge to look again at their sentences.</p>

<p>The pair were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the shotgun slayings in the family's swanky Beverly Hills home, following a blockbuster trial that gripped the United States and grabbed headlines around the world.</p>

<p>Prosecutors at the time argued that the two had plotted to murder Jose and Mary Louise "Kitty" Menendez in a bid to hasten a $14 million inheritance.</p>

<p>But supporters said they were the victims of sustained sexual and physical abuse, and had snapped after years of suffering at the hands of a tyrannical father.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/menendez-brothers-killed-parents-to-avoid-abuse-relatives-urge-their-release-6808424">Menendez Brothers Killed Parents To Avoid Abuse, Relatives Urge Their Release</a></p>

<p>"After a very careful review of all the arguments... I believe that under the law, resentencing is appropriate, and I am going to recommend that to a court tomorrow," Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon told reporters Thursday.</p>

<p>Gascon said his recommendation would be that the brothers be resentenced for murder, a charge that carries a sentence of 50 years to life.</p>

<p>"Since they were under 26 years of age at the time that these crimes occurred, they would be eligible for parole immediately."</p>

<p>Gascon, who is facing a tough re-election battle in November, said while he did not condone the violent murders the Menendez brothers -- aged 19 and 21 at the time -- carried out, he believed there were specific circumstances.</p>

<p>"If you get abused, the right path is to call the police, seek help. But I understand also how sometimes people get desperate."</p>

<p><strong>'Compassionate'</strong></p>

<p>Erik Menendez, now 53, and Lyle Menendez, now 56, have served nearly 35 years in prison since their convictions.</p>

<p>Their cousin Karen Vander Molen hailed Gascon's "compassionate" announcement.</p>

<p>"We know this wasn't an easy decision, but it is the right one," she said.</p>

<p>"This is about truth, justice and healing. It is time for Lyle and Erik to come home."</p>

<p>She said the decision "gives us all hope the truth will finally be heard and Erik and Lyle can begin to heal from the horrors of their past."</p>

<p>It will be up to a judge to make the final determination on Gascon's recommendation, which he acknowledged was not unanimous even within his own department.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear when a hearing on the matter might be held, although Gascon said his office would file the court papers on Friday.</p>

<p>Legal experts told local media the brothers would not be leaving prison anytime soon, with a long legal process still ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Global headlines</strong></p>

<p>Their initial trial, starting in 1993, was one of the first televised US murder cases and made daily headlines around the world. It ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury, but they were found guilty in a second trial.</p>

<p>Last year, attorneys filed a court petition setting out new evidence which they said demonstrates Jose Menendez's history of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Among the new evidence was a letter Erik wrote to a cousin months before the murders, saying "I've been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening... Every night I stay up thinking he might come in."</p>

<p>Roy Rossello, a former member of 1980s boy band Menudo, said in a documentary series released last year that he was drugged and raped by Jose Menendez in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Earlier this month Gascon told reporters he had "a moral and an ethical obligation to review what is being presented to us."</p>

<p>His comments came two weeks after the release of Netflix crime drama "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story." The streaming giant also put out a documentary film, "The Menendez Brothers," last week.</p>

<p>Gascon said the Netflix show resulted in a large number of calls to his office about the case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's King Charles faced calls to reckon with his country's colonial past Friday, as a summit of Commonwealth allies turned into a factious debate about the legacy of slavery and empire.</p>

<p>Leaders from the 56-nation Commonwealth -- made up mostly of British ex-colonies -- gathered for a summit in Samoa, hoping to prove the bloc is still relevant.</p>

<p>But instead of uniting to tackle pressing issues like climate change, Charles III's maiden summit as king has been overshadowed by history.</p>

<p>Many African, Caribbean and Pacific nations want to see Britain -- and other European powers -- pay financial compensation for slavery, or to at least make political amends.</p>

<p>They want this summit in particular to commit to a discussion on the topic of reparatory justice -- a debate Britain's cash-strapped government has tried to stymie.</p>

<p>The Bahamas' Prime Minister Philip Davis told AFP that a debate about the past was vital.</p>

<p>"The time has come to have a real dialogue about how we address these historical wrongs," he said.</p>

<p>"Reparatory justice is not an easy conversation, but it's an important one," Davis added.</p>

<p>"The horrors of slavery left a deep, generational wound in our communities, and the fight for justice and reparatory justice is far from over".</p>

<p>The British royal family, which benefited from the slave trade over centuries, has also faced calls to apologise.</p>

<p>But the monarch stopped well short of that on Friday, asking summit attendees to "reject the language of division".</p>

<p>"I understand, from listening to people across the Commonwealth, how the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate," he said.</p>

<p>"None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure."</p>

<p><strong>'Honesty and integrity'</strong></p>

<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly rejected calls to pay reparations, and aides have ruled out an apology at the summit.</p>

<p>A draft summit communique calling for debate on colonialism is the subject of fierce negotiations.</p>

<p>One diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP that developed countries were trying to water down the language in the final communique.</p>

<p>"The call for reparations isn't simply about financial compensation; it's about recognising the enduring impact of centuries of exploitation and ensuring that the legacy of slavery is addressed with honesty and integrity," Davis insisted.</p>

<p>Joshua Setipa from Lesotho -- who is one of three candidates vying to be the next Commonwealth's secretary-general -- said reparations could include non-traditional forms of payment such as climate financing.</p>

<p>"We can find a solution that will begin to address some injustices of the past and put them in the context happening around us today," he told AFP ahead of the summit.</p>

<p>Kingsley Abbott, Director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London said the apparent inclusion of the text on reparatory justice was a "significant advancement" for the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>He told AFP it "reveals the door to meaningful dialogue is opening".</p>

<p>The British monarch is concluding an 11-day tour of Australia and Samoa, both independent Commonwealth states -- the first major foreign trip since his cancer diagnosis earlier this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Justice Department said Thursday that it has reached a $100 million settlement with the Singaporean owner and operator of a cargo ship that destroyed a Baltimore bridge.</p>

<p>The 1,000-foot (300-meter) M/V Dali collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early morning of March 26, killing six road workers and blocking the busy shipping channel.</p>

<p>Grace Ocean Private Ltd and Synergy Marine Private Ltd have agreed to pay $101.1 million to settle a civil suit aimed at recovering costs incurred in responding to the disaster and for removing tons of bridge debris from the channel leading to the port of Baltimore, the Justice Department said.</p>

<p>"Nearly seven months after one of the worst transportation disasters in recent memory, which claimed six lives and caused untold damage, we have reached an important milestone with today's settlement," Benjamin Mizer, a senior Justice Department official, said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This resolution ensures that the costs of the federal government's cleanup efforts in the Fort McHenry Channel are borne by Grace Ocean and Synergy and not the American taxpayer," Mizer said.</p>

<p>The Justice Department said the settlement does not include any damages for eventual rebuilding of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. That is the subject of a separate claim from the state of Maryland.</p>

<p>The families of the six road workers who lost their lives are also pursuing legal claims of their own.</p>

<p>The Fort McHenry channel leading to the port of Baltimore, a key hub for the auto industry, reopened to commercial navigation on June 10.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bruce Springsteen took the stage Thursday at Kamala Harris's star-studded campaign rally in swing state Georgia, with the rock legend warning that White House hopeful Donald Trump aims to be an "American tyrant."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Springsteen took the stage Thursday at Kamala Harris's star-studded campaign rally in swing state Georgia, with the rock legend warning that White House hopeful Donald Trump aims to be an "American tyrant."</p>

<p>Harris is cranking up the celebrity wattage -- including with Beyonce in Texas on Friday, according to reports -- at a series of concerts in battleground states to boost support in the final days of a nail-biting election.</p>

<p>Thursday's rally in Atlanta is also Harris's first campaign stop with Barack Obama, the only Black president in American history and who remains widely popular with Democratic voters.</p>

<p>But it was Springsteen's gritty commentary at the start that echoed through the packed rally, where the iconic singer said he would "oppose" the Republican former president because "Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant."</p>

<p>Large numbers of Americans, including about 2.2 million in Georgia, have already cast ballots in early voting, reflecting intense engagement ahead of Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p>Springsteen brought his brand of socially conscious, working-class anthems including "The Promised Land" to get out the vote and bolster Harris's blue-collar credentials.</p>

<p>The vice president herself had raised the stakes further in a CNN appearance late Wednesday when she said she considers 78-year-old Trump to be a "fascist" -- as charged in a bombshell interview by the Republican's former chief of staff John Kelly.</p>

<p>Trump, the oldest major presidential nominee in US history and the first to be running with a criminal record, is also casting the election as an existential battle for the United States.</p>

<p>But it will have profound personal implications too, given he is the subject of serious criminal probes into his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his post-presidential hoarding of top-secret documents.</p>

<p>The Republican was campaigning Thursday in the western battleground of Arizona where he conjured dark imagery of migrant violence and warned that America had become "a dumping ground" for dangerous and undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>"We're like a garbage can for the world," Trump said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Revenge' -</strong></p>

<p>In a radio interview on his way to the rally in Arizona and then another in Nevada -- both swing states -- Trump announced that if elected he'd fire the special prosecutor overseeing his remaining cases in "seconds."</p>

<p>Harris, 60, for her part assailed Trump for "plotting revenge and retribution" against his political enemies, and took a swipe at his energy levels.</p>

<p>"The sad part about that is he's trying to be president of the United States -- probably the toughest job in the world -- and he's exhausted," Harris told reporters.</p>

<p>The election remains a toss-up, with the two candidates jostling within the margin of error in polls from all the swing states set to tip the overall national result.</p>

<p>US media reported Thursday that Beyonce -- whose hit "Freedom" is already the Harris campaign's signature song -- will join the Democrat when she visits Houston on Friday to highlight abortion rights.</p>

<p>Obama, 63, has been making his own headlining appearances in support of Harris in a slew of swing states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign hopes the former president will reverse fears of eroding support among Black voters.</p>

<p>Harris, 60, is of mixed Black and South Asian heritage, and is vying to become the country's first female president.</p>

<p><strong>- American Dream 'unreachable ' -</strong></p>

<p>Trump was expected to attack Harris's economic policies at a rally in Tempe, Arizona.</p>

<p>His campaign said the current vice president had "made the American Dream of home ownership unreachable for young Americans and families."</p>

<p>But in his 55-minute address Trump made zero mention of soaring housing costs, opting instead to blame Harris for a "migrant invasion" that has overwhelmed American cities.</p>

<p>"No person who is responsible for so much bloodshed and death on our soil can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States," he said.</p>

<p>Trump then was set to attend a Las Vegas rally aimed at recruiting volunteers and celebrating the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.</p>

<p>Like Harris, Trump also heads Friday to Texas, where he is to deliver remarks on border security.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lankan police arrested three persons on suspicion of plotting an attack against Israeli tourists in the eastern coast surfing resort of Arugam Bay following a tip-off from Indian intelligence, authorities said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Public Security Minister Vijitha Herath said all three suspects arrested by the Terrorism Investigation Division of the police are Sri Lankan nationals.</p>

<p>They are being interrogated to ascertain if they had a plan to carry out the attack targeting Israelis, the minister said.</p>

<p>Earlier, police announced the arrest of two persons and said it came as a result of Indian intelligence information, which warned of an attack between October 19 and 23.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the US embassy and the British High Commission in Colombo issued statements warning their citizens that they had received credible information targeting Arugam Bay and urged tourists to avoid the area until further notice.</p>

<p>Responding to the opposition's criticism that the public was not informed about the threat until the US embassy issued its travel advisory, Herath said, "We did not inform the public until the information could be verified." "Some information has been revealed that there may be potential threats to the safety of the tourists who visited Sri Lanka," Herath was quoted as saying by local media.</p>

<p>"Intelligence agencies received information about it. Upon receiving that information, we immediately took action," he added.</p>

<p>He said the government had taken swift action to provide security at all coastal areas and tourism sites after receiving the information.</p>

<p>Herath said adequate measures have been put in place to ensure the safety of all tourists.</p>

<p>He said US Ambassador Julie Chung had informed the government of the travel advisory on the Arugam Bay security situation.</p>

<p>The US warned its citizens to avoid the popular tourists' resort on the eastern coast until further notice. Security has been beefed up in the region.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the police said that the security net has been extended to the southern coast and the southeastern resort areas.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka's Muslim minority groups have condemned the wars in Gaza and Lebanon by holding continuous anti-Israel protests.</p>

<p>Several posts have appeared on social media calling for a boycott of Israeli businesses on the east coast.</p>

<p>The police vowed to accord protection to all foreign nationals. A hotline has been set up for tourists to alert authorities of any suspicious activities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BRICS countries are committed to fostering a more democratic and multipolar world order, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, during his press conference on the last day of the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan.</p>

<p>Putin noted on Thursday that the Kazan Declaration, endorsed at the summit, outlines a positive agenda for the future, the Kremlin reported.</p>

<p>"It is important that the declaration reaffirms the commitment of all our states to building a more democratic, inclusive, and multipolar world order based on international law and the UN Charter," he said.</p>

<p>Putin also said that the BRICS group is open to all who share its values, with members dedicated to finding joint solutions free from external pressure or narrow approaches, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The bloc does not operate in a closed format, he stressed at the press conference.</p>

<p>The Russian President confirmed that BRICS leaders have agreed on the list of BRICS partner countries.</p>

<p>"Some countries that have participated in these events have submitted their proposals and requests for full-fledged participation in the work of the BRICS association," Putin added.</p>

<p>He said that BRICS nations haven't developed and are not developing any alternatives to SWIFT, adding however that the issue remains important, and member countries are moving towards the use of national currencies.</p>

<p>He said BRICS members are currently using the Financial Messaging System created by the Russian Central Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Israel's military said on Thursday it killed a Hamas commander who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel and who also worked for the U.N. aid agency in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The agency, UNRWA, has been accused by Israel for having many employees who double as members of Hamas and other armed group. The U.N. said in August that nine UNRWA staff were possibly involved in the Oct. 7 attacks and fired them.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from UNRWA regarding the latest Israeli allegation. Separately, the agency on Wednesday had said that one of its staff members was killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that Mohammad Abu Itiwi was killed on Wednesday. It said he was a Hamas commander and had been involved in the murder and abduction of Israeli civilians. It also said he had been employed by UNRWA since July 2022 and that his name appeared on a list of the agency's employees.</p>

<p>UNRWA provides education, health and aid to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It has long had tense relations with Israel but relations have deteriorated sharply since the start of the war in Gaza and Israel has called repeatedly for UNRWA to be disbanded.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel said Thursday its spy chief will attend Gaza ceasefire talks and Hamas vowed to stop fighting if a truce is reached, as long-stalled efforts to end the war appeared to gain momentum.</p>

<p>Previous bids to stop the year-long war have failed, though the United States has voiced hope the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week could serve as an opening for a deal.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP that a delegation from the group's Doha-based leadership discussed "ideas and proposals" related to a Gaza truce with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Hamas has expressed readiness to stop the fighting, but Israel must commit to a ceasefire, withdraw from the Gaza Strip, allow the return of displaced people, agree to a serious prisoner exchange deal and allow the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza," the official said.</p>

<p>The talks in Cairo were part of Egypt's ongoing efforts to resume ceasefire negotiations, he added.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Egypt's readiness to reach a deal "for the release of the hostages" still held by militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>After the Cairo meeting, Netanyahu directed the head of Israel's Mossad spy agency to leave for key mediator Qatar on Sunday to "advance a series of initiatives that are on the agenda," the prime minister's office said.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, the United States and Qatar said Gaza ceasefire talks would resume in the Qatari capital.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Qatar's leaders in Doha on Thursday on his 11th trip to the region since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Time is running out' -</strong></p>

<p>During the trip, which comes less than two weeks before US elections, Blinken said that mediators would explore new options.</p>

<p>He said they were seeking a plan "so that Israel can withdraw, so that Hamas cannot reconstitute, and so that the Palestinian people can rebuild their lives and rebuild their futures".</p>

<p>Qatar said that US and Israeli teams would fly to Doha, with Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani adding that Qatari mediators had "re-engaged" with Hamas since Sinwar's death.</p>

<p>Israeli and US officials as well as some analysts said Sinwar had been a key obstacle to a deal allowing for the release of 97 hostages still held in Gaza, 34 of whom the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>An Israeli group representing families of hostages called on Netanyahu and Hamas to secure an agreement to free the remaining captives.</p>

<p>"Time is running out," the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.</p>

<p>Blinken landed late Thursday in London, where a US official said he would meet on Friday with the foreign ministers of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, two key partners in a post-war plan for Gaza.</p>

<p>The official said Blinken would also meet with Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati to discuss the parallel conflict in that country.</p>

<p>- Hundreds dead in days -</p>

<p>On the battlefield, the Israeli military has kept up pressure on Hamas, launching an operation earlier this month in the north of Gaza where tens of thousands of civilians are trapped.</p>

<p>"More than 770 people have been killed" in the territory's north in the 19 days since the operation started, Gaza civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said, adding that the toll could rise as people were buried under the rubble.</p>

<p>He also said a strike on a school-turned-shelter killed 17 people on Thursday in central Gaza, where the Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas militants.</p>

<p>One Palestinian woman, Umm Muhammad, told AFP she was sitting in a classroom when the strike hit.</p>

<p>"I hugged my little girl and I couldn't see anything through the thick plume of smoke," she said.</p>

<p>"I ran and screamed for my sister and found her alive downstairs, but there were (some) children torn to pieces."</p>

<p>The civil defence agency said it can no longer provide first responder services in northern Gaza, accusing Israeli forces of threatening to "bomb and kill" its crews.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says the goal of its assault is to destroy the operational capabilities it says Hamas is trying to rebuild in the north.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 42,847 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, data which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>- Lebanon strikes, clashes -</p>

<p>After nearly a year of war in Gaza, Israel expanded its focus to Lebanon a month ago, vowing to secure its northern border against near-daily attacks by Hamas ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>It launched a massive bombing campaign targeting mainly Hezbollah strongholds around Lebanon, and sent in ground troops on September 30.</p>

<p>Since September 23, the war in Lebanon has killed at least 1,580 people, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher.</p>

<p>The ministry said three children were among 12 people killed in Israeli strikes on two villages in eastern Lebanon on Thursday.</p>

<p>Later Lebanese state media said Israel struck Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah bastion, about half an hour after Israel issued evacuation warnings.</p>

<p>Israel said five of its soldiers were killed fighting in southern Lebanon, scene of daily fighting with Hezbollah militants since the ground offensive began.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it attacked Israeli troops and positions in Israel's north and also soldiers inside Lebanese territory.</p>

<p>The war has sparked a huge displacement crisis in Lebanon, already suffering from a years-long political and economic crisis.</p>

<p>A conference in Paris on Thursday raised $800 million in aid for cash-strapped Lebanon, according to the French government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's fiscal 2024 compensation surged 63% to $79.1 million, according to a filing on Thursday, helped by his stock awards in a year when the tech behemoth's market value breached $3 trillion.</p>

<p>Stock awards for Nadella, who earned $48.5 million in 2023, climbed to about $71 million from $39 million a year earlier.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday that his invasion of neighboring Ukraine violated the United Nations charter and international law, according to a readout of their meeting.</p>

<p>The UN secretary-general met with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, after a speech in which Guterres called for a "just peace" in Ukraine.</p>

<p>He "reiterated his position that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law," a readout from the UN chief's spokesperson said after their meeting, which had been criticized by Kyiv.</p>

<p>Guterres also emphasized his commitment to "establishing freedom of navigation in the Black Sea," saying the move was vital for both Ukraine and Russia, as well as global "food and energy security."</p>

<p>"He fully supports the continuation of negotiations in this regard," the statement said, citing "deep appreciation" to Turkey's mediating efforts.</p>

<p>The Black Sea is a significant trade route for Ukraine, one of the largest exporters of grain in the world, but it has been mired since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>A UN-brokered agreement allowed Ukraine to export agricultural exports on the Black Sea, but Moscow withdrew from the deal in 2023.</p>

<p>Kyiv has nonetheless carved out a maritime corridor allowing trade to continue.</p>

<p>Guterres and Putin, who last met in April 2022, also discussed the conflict in the Middle East, "in particular the absolute need for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the need to avoid a further regional escalation," the readout said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Vastly superior" is what 15 Nobel Prize-winning economists had called President Joe Biden's economic plan in June, and this is what 23 of them now call Vice President Kamala Harris' plan. The group now also includes two of the most recent laureates - Simon Johnson and Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>In a recent, 228-word letter signed by 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists, Kamala Harris has got a symbolic sanction on an issue quite commonly ranked as the most important: the economy.</p>

<p>In a letter procured by CNN, the economists write, "While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we believe that, overall, Harris' economic agenda will improve our nation's health, investment, sustainability, resilience, employment opportunities, and fairness and be vastly superior to the counterproductive economic agenda of Donald Trump."</p>

<p>The letter, a brainchild of Joseph Stiglitz, reads, "Among the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these."</p>

<p>The letter delineates how Republican nominee Donald Trump's tariff and tax policies are inflationary. However, Trump sticks to the view that his tariff plans would "have a massive effect, a positive effect."</p>

<p>"The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff," he said. "It's my favorite word."</p>

<p>However, the situation on the ground tells a different tale. According to the major polls, Americans prefer Trump over Harris when it comes to economic development. Based on the survey taken by The Financial Times, 45% of Americans favour Trump when it comes to financial decisions while only 37% lean towards Harris. Similarly a CNBC survey found that 42% of participants trusted Trump to deliver economic benefits compared to 29% for Harris.</p>

<p>Despite the discrepancy, economists remain confident in Harris' plan. "Simply put, Harris's policies will result in a stronger economic performance, with economic growth that is more robust, more sustainable, and more equitable," the economists write.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Criminal Court on Thursday accused member state Mongolia of failing to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin during a trip there last month, and referred the matter for further action.</p>

<p>The Russian leader visited Ulaanbaatar in early September despite an arrest warrant issued against him by the Hague-based court, for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children after his troops invaded the country in 2022.</p>

<p>"The International Criminal Court found that, by failing to arrest Mr Putin while he was on its territory and surrender him to the Court, Mongolia has failed to comply with the Court's request to cooperate," the ICC said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Rome Statute, the court's founding treaty signed by all member states, compels countries to arrest wanted suspects.</p>

<p>"States Parties and those accepting the Court's jurisdiction are duty-bound to arrest and surrender individuals subject to ICC warrants, regardless of official position or nationality," the ICC's judges said.</p>

<p>"In view of the seriousness of Mongolia's failure to cooperate with the Court, the Chamber deemed it necessary to refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties," the judges said, referring to the ICC's overseer body.</p>

<p>The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023.</p>

<p>It said there were "reasonable grounds to believe" that Putin "bears responsibility for the war crime of unlawful deportation" of Ukrainian children to Russia.</p>

<p>Kyiv says thousands of Ukrainian children were forcibly deported from orphanages and other state institutions after Russian forces took control of swathes of the country in its 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Russia said it moved some children away from areas close to the fighting for their own protection.</p>

<p>Moscow has dismissed the warrant as having no consequence, but the Mongolia trip marked Putin's first to an ICC member in the 18 months since it had been issued.</p>

<p>Last year he called off a visit to a BRICS summit in South Africa, another ICC member, after internal and external pressure on Pretoria to arrest the Russian leader should he attend.</p>

<p>Past instances of ICC members failing to execute arrest warrants have had little consequence beyond verbal dressing-downs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president Barack Obama made an appearance on the basketball podcast, "The Young Man &amp; the Three" and exhorted young people to exercise their right to vote. The podcast was hosted by Tyrese Haliburton and Tommy Alter.</p>

<p>During the podcast, Obama urged young men to not get frustrated when it comes to the slow progress of politics and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"It's not that hard to vote," he said. "You're not gonna vote which means you're going to let a bunch of old people decide your future. You wouldn't do that about your music, you wouldn't do that about your clothes but you're gonna let them decide what your future, your potential careers, what the environments gonna look like, you're gonna let them decide that?"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here's my message to young people: you wouldn't let a bunch of old people decide what music you're going to listen to or what clothes you're going to wear – so don't let them decide your future.<br />
<br />
Make a plan to vote today: <a href="https://t.co/V3uLF7XRqt">https://t.co/V3uLF7XRqt</a> <a href="https://t.co/VR5T97x8K1">pic.twitter.com/VR5T97x8K1</a></p>
— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1849110018467017165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>He persuaded people to vote saying, "People vote on everything, they are voting on American Idol, you can vote to decide who's gonna represent you and our country."</p>

<p>One X user commented saying, "We the People see right through you... &nbsp;Race baiting trash." While another said, "Don't know how to say it more clearly, but to young people especially: If you don't vote for Kamala Harris in this presidential election, you might not have a country left in which you can ever truly be free again."</p>

<p>According to the University of Chicago's latest GenForward poll, obtained by NPR, Harris has significant support among young Black Americans, with six in 10 backing her. However, this is a notable decline from the support President Biden received four years ago, when more than seven in 10 young Black Americans supported him.</p>

<p>In contrast, former President Donald Trump has garnered support from one in five young Black Americans, with a notable 25% backing from Black men specifically. Meanwhile, only 12% of young Black women support Trump, while 16% express a desire for "someone else" beyond Trump and Harris.</p>

<p>These findings highlight challenges for Harris in maintaining strong support among young Black Americans, particularly men, ahead of the election.</p>

<p>In the episode, Obama also attacked Trump's work ethic saying, "I don't think it's any secret that I think Donald Trump is not somebody who is going to work hard on behalf of ordinary people," he said. "I think his agenda is basically about himself. His status is ego and self-promotion."</p>

<p>This year, the election campaign has seen some unorthodox stops on both sides of the coin. Obama has not been the only one endorsing Harris on a podcast, but this Friday, Trump is set to record an interview with "The Joe Rogan Experience". Harris has also become a member of the podcasting world by giving an interview on, "Call Her Daddy", a popular podcast among women.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Privacy campaigners filed a complaint this week against lifestyle website Pinterest, accusing it of secretly gathering personal data to use for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>Pinterest users are automatically opted-in to data sharing, in a breach of European Union privacy laws, Austria-based group None Of Your Business said in a statement received by AFP on Thursday.</p>

<p>The group filed the case on Tuesday in France after receiving a complaint from a French user of the platform, where subscribers swap ideas on home furnishings, travel, recipes and other lifestyle concerns.</p>

<p>"Pinterest is secretly tracking European users without asking for their consent," Kleanthi Sardeli of NOYB said in the statement.</p>

<p>"This allows the social media platform to unlawfully profit from people's personal data without them ever finding out."</p>

<p>Pinterest told news agency AFP they had not seen the complaint yet, but a company spokesman insisted their approach to targeted advertising complied with European privacy law.</p>

<p>NOYB spearheads a campaign to have Europe's 2018 regulation on data privacy (GDPR) enforced by complaining to data regulators in jurisdictions across the bloc.</p>

<p>GDPR imposes strict limits on the reasons a company or other entity can use to justify gathering personal data in Europe.</p>

<p>But many tech companies built their businesses by taking people's data and using it to sell targeted advertising.</p>

<p>These firms initially relied on an exception that allowed them to bypass GDPR's restrictions by claiming they had a "legitimate interest" in harvesting the data.</p>

<p>But EU regulators and the European Court of Justice have repeatedly ruled that "legitimate interest" cannot be used to warrant collecting such information for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>"It appears that Pinterest is actively ignoring a European Court of Justice ruling in order to maximise its profits," said Sardeli.</p>

<p>The group is asking France's data regulator CNIL to erase users' information, impose a fine on Pinterest and oblige it to comply with the GDPR rules.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris has Bruce Springsteen and Eminem. Donald Trump has the world's richest man. But will it make any difference on Election Day?</p>

<p>Celebrity endorsements do little to sway voter opinion, experts say, and polls show only a sliver of the electorate have yet to make up their mind before the November 5 vote.</p>

<p>But big names appearing at campaign events help to grab headlines and boost enthusiasm among key groups, which could spur higher turnout or motivate more early voting -- as millions have already done.</p>

<p>With two weeks to go, "your real goal right now has to be to get your audience, your voters to show up," Megan Duncan, a communications professor at Virginia Tech, told AFP.</p>

<p>In an election expected to be decided by razor thin margins in a handful of states, any marginal lift could prove decisive.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Harris got the endorsement of rapper and Detroit icon Eminem at a rally in the city. Also attending was former president Barack Obama, a superstar in the Democratic Party who rapped the opening segments of Eminem's famous hit "Lose Yourself" to cheers from the crowd.</p>

<p>Duncan said celebrities would be used more by campaigns in the final two weeks to tap into a localized "sense of identity," with appearances becoming "more targeted" to specific cities.</p>

<p>Popstar Lizzo joined Harris last weekend for an event to mark the first day of early voting in the "About Damn Time" singer's home city of Detroit, while R&amp;B star Usher appeared with the vice president in Atlanta, where he launched his career.</p>

<p>Democrats hope that the potent presence of Obama, America's first Black US president, and his popular wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, will shore up support among African American voters, particularly men, in key cities.</p>

<p>The former president is also set to hold multiple events with rocker Bruce Springsteen in the coming days, with Harris joining them in Atlanta on Thursday, her campaign said.</p>

<p>Superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris minutes after her first and only debate against Trump, in early September, timing which Duncan called "very strategic... to have the most impact."</p>

<h2><strong>TEAM TRUMP</strong></h2>

<p>Trump has relatively few celebs in his corner, but a few power hitters are nonetheless working to push him over the finish line.</p>

<p>Most notably is the world's richest person, Elon Musk, who has donated at least $75 million to efforts at electing Trump and other Republicans.</p>

<p>The SpaceX and Tesla boss has also used his influential platform on X, which he rebranded from Twitter after buying it, to boost Trump-aligned and often false narratives about immigration and other hot-button issues.</p>

<p>In recent days, he has campaigned for Trump in Pennsylvania, telling voters there that the key swing state could decide the "fate of Western civilization."</p>

<p>But the eccentric billionaire has also courted controversy, including by launching a legally dubious $1 million daily sweepstakes that only registered voters in swing states can win.</p>

<p>While Musk's support could lift enthusiasm among some who view him favorably, particularly young men, it also risks alienating moderate voters weary from almost a decade of Trump's norm-breaking.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign's push to expand support among young men has received a boost from Dana White, the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July and recently on ex-NFL star Robert Griffin III's podcast.</p>

<p>Trump's backers also include several financial personalities with large social media followings, including David Sacks and Bill Ackman, and a few prominent Hollywood actors such as Jon Voight and Dennis Quaid.</p>

<p>But aside from Kid Rock and country singer Lee Greenwood, who frequently performs his patriotic anthem "God Bless the USA" at rallies, Trump has few star musicians to lean on in the final two weeks.</p>

<p>The Republican instead uses on an oft-repeated playlist, which includes the Village People's 1978 hits "Y.M.C.A." and "Macho Man."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has seen several musicians or their estates threaten legal action against unapproved uses of their songs.</p>

<p>The most recent action came last week, after the 78-year-old played Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," as performed by Rufus Wainwright, at an event in Pennsylvania.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly amended laws in Nepal to tackle crimes committed during its decade-long bitter civil war could instead deprive victims of justice and grant amnesty to those culpable, rights lawyers warned Thursday.</p>

<p>Both government forces and former rebels are accused of carrying out torture, killings, rapes and forced disappearances during Nepal's Maoist insurgency.</p>

<p>The conflict ended in 2006 with a peace deal that brought the rebels into government and promised justice for the victims, whick included more than 16,000 dead and around 1,000 missing.</p>

<p>Nepal's two transitional justice commissions began operating in 2015, but failed to resolve a single case, despite receiving over 60,000 complaints of murders, torture and unexplained disappearances.</p>

<p>In August, parliament passed long-delayed amendments to the transitional justice act aiming to address this.</p>

<p>But a team of international rights lawyers, in a report released Thursday and based on a research mission to Nepal, warned the changes could do the opposite and exclude "swathes of victims" from justice.</p>

<p>The lawyers added that the new law "permits amnesties which would prevent criminal accountability for gross violations of human rights".</p>

<p>The lawyers said that until addressed, the "doors to the regular justice system should not be closed".</p>

<p>The group was supported by rights organisation Peace Brigades International (PBI).</p>

<p>Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, a constitutional lawyer from Sri Lanka, and part of the team, said effective justice was not possible so long as the law "excludes certain gross violations, opens the door for amnesties and allows for the exclusion of certain victims".</p>

<p>Just two convictions related to crimes committed during the civil war crimes have been handed down in civilian courts.</p>

<p>One was linked to the murder of a teenage girl. The other was related to the killing of a journalist.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

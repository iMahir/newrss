       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">A <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/c984wz29xexo">group of scientists</a>, including people from the Royal Society of Chemistry, recently proposed that experiences such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/aug/20/add-ice-lolly-licking-to-england-primary-school-curriculum-urge-scientists">licking an ice lolly</a> should be part of the science curriculum. By licking a lolly and seeing how it melts – the idea goes – children would better learn about melting, and therefore about chemistry and physics.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>But does licking a lolly, or experiences such as kneading dough, playing with shadows or digging in soil, actually help pupils learn science? Deploying examples and demonstrations in the classroom can be a helpful gateway towards deeper understanding, but it's not a shortcut to knowledge.</p>

<p>The idea of learning through experiences has a long history. It's perhaps most closely associated with the work of educator <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/ENTRIES/dewey/">John Dewey</a> in the early 20th century. Dewey and other educators of the time were concerned that an emphasis on rote learning would lead to “inert knowledge”: facts that students wouldn't be able to apply <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203056646-5/cognitive-coping-strategies-problem-inert-knowledge-carl-bereiter-marlene-scardamalia">to the real world</a>.</p>

<p>An experience like licking a lolly may at least be memorable – especially if you've never done it before. Licking a lolly or seeing it melt in class would lead to what psychologists call an episodic memory: a memory of an event in your life.</p>

<h3><strong>Experience and understanding</strong></h3>

<p>However, there <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-08951-001">is a difference</a> between having memories for events and having knowledge. There is a difference, for example, between having personally lived through the French Revolution and knowing what happened.</p>

<p>The latter involves a different type of memories – semantic memories. These are based on understanding how things work and what they mean. It is the type of memory that is at play when you use a word such as “heavy”, unconnected to a specific heavy object. Such understandings are essential to both scientific learning and our use of language.</p>

<p>If you stop to think about it, most of your knowledge can't be clearly tied to one particular experience. Learning is usually not a one-shot process – think of how much experience a gardener needs before they “know” how plants grow and thrive, for example.</p>

<p>These semantic memories derive from an amalgam of lots of experiences, and sometimes, from comparing and contrasting different things: the difference between two types of plants, or between an ice lolly and an ice cream.</p>

<p>Learning about melting is similar. We don't just demonstrate melting one time, and boom (or squelch), the students have learned it.</p>

<h3><strong>Importance of context</strong></h3>

<p>Understanding science or anything else is also not just about remembering experiences. Learners need to <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781410603784-7/teaching-learning-understanding-david-perkins-chris-unger">understand the encounter</a>, to have their attention directed towards similar and different processes, and to experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00505/full">multiple examples</a>.</p>

<p>To profit most from this, learners need sufficient prior knowledge to understand what is happening when they observe something in class. This is one reason that leaving students to discover things entirely by themselves is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.14">flawed strategy</a>.</p>

<p>It's also another reason why relying on one-off experiences doesn't work. Students need to revisit ideas periodically, each time bringing more knowledge and understanding to the table.</p>

<p>Without a basic understanding of science, there is a risk that a learner will fail to connect a classroom observation to its wider context. Knowing about melting, for example, is a lot more than knowing that a lolly melts – it involves knowing why, and under what circumstances. It involves knowing that other everyday substances would melt in higher temperatures.</p>

<p>This foundational understanding is also important to stop students from coming up with scientific misconceptions. In the lolly example, students might <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461520.2012.695709">overgeneralise surface features</a> such as how quickly the lolly melts or how sticky it is, seeing these as characteristics of melting in general.</p>

<p>In short, understanding science or anything else is not just about remembering things. It's about understanding what an experience connects to, what category it is an example of, and how it differs from other concepts.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal learning</strong></h3>

<p>Another notable claim in the ice lolly story was the suggestion that it is valuable to promote learning <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/c984wz29xexo">“on a personal level”</a>. There is research on this, too.</p>

<p>Imagine you were asked to remember a list of random words such as “music, broccoli, dancing, plastic bottles, baby sharks”. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1970-03138-001">A study</a> looking at memory found that people better recalled words from lists like this if they were asked “do you like this?” compared to a blander, information-processing question, such as “does the word contain a letter ‘e'?”. We also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17470211003770938">remember our own possessions</a> better than generic objects.</p>

<p>So, yes – there is some evidence that we might retain experiences better if we are personally invested in them. However, it's worth noting that such experiments are rather short-term. In everyday life, we can really enjoy and engage with something on a personal level (such as a book or a conversation) yet forget the details within a few weeks or months.</p>

<p>This is partly why people write diaries. Memories of our lives are ephemeral, easily lost over time. Sometimes such memories are distorted, or even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60124-3">entirely imagined</a> – false memories. It's risky to base science learning upon this type of memory.</p>

<p>If we want students to build up their knowledge of science and be able to use it in future, it's vital that the focus is on strategies that build deep understanding of concepts and how they are structured, rather than relying on gimmicks or one-off experiences.</p>

<p>All of this is to say nothing of the practicality of storing an ice lolly for every school pupil, handing them out in class – or cleaning up afterwards.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major setback to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, key ally Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party has pulled out support for his minority Liberal government ahead of the general election next year.</p>

<p>In a video message shared on social media, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-weakened-after-key-sikh-ally-withdraws-support-6492183">Jagmeet Singh </a>said Mr Trudeau will not be able to take on the opposition Conservatives amid recent polls showing them securing an easy win in elections.</p>

<p>"<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-to-reduce-number-of-temporary-foreign-workers-6424021">Justin Trudeau</a> has proven again and again he will always cave to corporate greed. The Liberals have let people down. They don't deserve another chance from Canadians," Mr Singh said in the video.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The deal is done.<br />
<br />
The Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to stop the Conservatives and their plans to cut. But the NDP can.<br />
<br />
Big corporations and CEOs have had their governments. It's the people's time. <a href="https://t.co/BsE9zT0CwF">pic.twitter.com/BsE9zT0CwF</a></p>
— Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) <a href="https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh/status/1831375557507850740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>The leader said that the "big battle" now is defeating the Conservatives to stop them from choosing big corporations over the young people and Canadian families.</p>

<p>"There is another, even bigger battle ahead. The threat of Pierre Poilievre and Conservative cuts. From workers, from retirees, from young people, from patients, from families -- he will cut in order to give more to big corporations and wealthy CEOs," he said.</p>

<p>The two leaders had struck in 2022 to come together to boost the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/setback-for-canadas-trudeau-liberals-lose-stronghold-in-key-polls-5969262">Liberal </a>party's minority government. The deal was supposed to go on till October next year but an NDP spokesperson said the plan to end the agreement was in the works for the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the sudden social media post was a surprise for the Canadian PM's party as within minutes of informing them of their decision to withdraw Mr Singh posted the video on social media.</p>

<p>Mr Singh said "the NDP is ready for an election, and voting non-confidence will be on the table with each and every confidence measure."</p>

<p>Reacting to Mr Singh's announcement, Mr Trudeau said his government will continue to focuse on tackling the affordability crisis in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These are the things that we're focused on. I'll let others focus on politics.I really hope the NDP stays focused on how we can deliver for Canadians, as we have over the past years, rather than focusing on politics," he said.</p>

<p>The Canadian prime minister also said he remained hopeful that the next election will not happen "until next fall" so that his government can also work on pharmacare, dental care, and school food programmes.</p>

<p>Mr Singh's NDP kept the Mr Trudeau's Liberal government in power through a confidence-and-supply agreement. In exchange for its support, the government agreed to address key priorities, including introducing dental care benefits, providing one-time rental supplements for low-income tenants, and temporarily doubling the GST rebate.</p>

<p>But some of the promises made to Mr Singh's party are yet to be fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 14-year-old student who killed four of his schoolmates in US's Georgia was questioned last year by police about online threats, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said.</p>

<p>In May 2023, Colt Gray was questioned by police who believed he was behind internet posts that contained images of guns, warning of a school shooting.</p>

<p>The FBI said its National Threat Operations Center had alerted local law enforcement after receiving tips about "online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time".</p>

<p>After the location of the threats were determined, the police interviewed the teen and his father.</p>

<p>While the teen denied sending the threats, his father told police that he had hunting guns in the house but the then 13-year-old "did not have unsupervised access to them".</p>

<p>"At the time, there was no probable cause for an arrest or to take any additional law enforcement action on the local, state or federal levels," the FBI said in a statement.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the boy used an assault rifle to open fire in Apalachee High School, killing two teachers and two student, investigators say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eight other students and one teacher were injured in the attack. Gray was arrested from the school premises and will be tried as an adult.</p>

<p>The school sent out a message to parents saying it was "currently in a hard lockdown after reports of gunfire."</p>

<p>Survivors recounted the moment when Gray began attacking the students. One student told BBC that she saw him leave a class after a maths lesson and when he returned he had a gun in his hand. One of her classmates saw the gun and refused to open the door for Gray even as he continued to pound on it.</p>

<p>Gray then moved to the next classroom and opened fire.</p>

<p>According to the BBC, this was the 23rd US school shooting of 2024. So far 11 people have died and 38 have been injured in such attacks this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boeing Starliner on which Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams flew to the International Space Station (ISS) on June 5 was touted as a space capsule made by astronauts for astronauts but, much to the embarrassment of Boeing, is now set to return without any human spacefarers. The return journey, in autonomous mode, is slated for September 6 and the Starliner is expected to land about six hours after it undocks.</p>

<p>The Starliner, whose development was plagued by delays, was on its first crewed test flight, carrying Sunita Williams and Barry "Butch" Wilmore for what was meant to be an eight-day mission. The two astronauts have been at the International Space Station since June 6 and their stay kept getting extended because of propulsion issues on the Starliner. NASA announced on August 24 that the astronauts would return to Earth in February 2025 and the Boeing spacecraft would come back without its crew. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The uncrewed return allows NASA and Boeing to continue gathering testing data on the Starliner during its flight home while also allowing it not to accept more risk than is necessary for its crew. NASA officials said the decision was "unanimous" on its part, while Boeing asserted it could return the Starliner both with or without crew.</p>

<p><strong>'Tense Meeting'</strong></p>

<p>The space agency has confirmed that the decision to get the spacecraft to return without crew was taken at a "tense" meeting between NASA and Boeing officials.</p>

<p>Explaining the decision, NASA chief Senator Bill Nelson, who is also a former astronaut, said, "Spaceflight is risky, even at its safest and most routine. A test flight, by nature, is neither safe nor routine.</p>

<p>The decision to keep Butch and Suni (Sunita Williams) aboard the International Space Station and bring Boeing's Starliner home without crew is the result of our commitment to safety - our core value and our North Star."</p>

<p>Boeing, on its part, said it remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew. "We continue to support NASA's requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft's safe undocking and landing capabilities. Our confidence is based on this abundance of valuable testing from Boeing and NASA. The testing has confirmed that 27 of 28 RCS (reaction control system) thrusters are healthy and back to full operational capability," the company said in a statement.<br />
"Starliner's propulsion system also maintains redundancy and the helium levels remain stable. The data also supports root cause assessments for the helium and thruster issues and flight rationale for Starliner and its crew's return to Earth," it added. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Requirements Unmet</strong></p>

<p>But NASA, having burnt its fingers after the twin accidents of the Challenger and Columbia space shuttles, did not want to take any risks.</p>

<p>In a statement, NASA said the "uncertainty and lack of expert concurrence does not meet the agency's safety and performance requirements for human spaceflight".</p>

<p>Experts said the space capsule which Indian origin astronaut Sunita Williams had piloted to the International Space Station (ISS) is the most modern crew module and has been designed to ensure that astronauts who fly in it are safe and comfortable. Ms Williams herself has her imprint on almost all aspects of the spacecraft as she has been involved in its making for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>Calypso</strong></p>

<p>According to data released by Boeing, the Starliner has a height of 5 metres with both the crew module and service module, a diameter of 4.6 metres, and weighs 13,000 kg at lift-off. The Starliner is designed to accommodate a maximum crew of seven, but NASA missions will carry a crew of four to five. Each crew module is designed to fly up to 10 missions, so it is partially reusable. The service modules, however, are made for each mission as they get jettisoned in space.</p>

<p>The Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner spacecraft was designed for a mix of crew and cargo for missions to low-Earth orbit.</p>

<p>Ms Williams, who had also called the Starliner a 'fantastic spacecraft', was given the opportunity to name the spacecraft she would fly in and decided to call it 'Calypso' - after the famous ship on which the French oceanographer and legendary filmmaker Jacques-Yves Cousteau explored the oceans when she was still a student.</p>

<p>The making of the Starliner was much delayed and went way over the budget, and some say the same problems which have beset the Boeing Company in its aviation business may be plaguing the space side as well.</p>

<p>In 2014, NASA had awarded a $ 4.2 billion contract to Boeing for making the Starliner from scratch and it managed to go on its first human spaceflight only this June - ten years later. In comparison, Space X, which was given a similar contract for the development of Crew Dragon,&nbsp; delivered it at an estimated cost of $ 2.6 billion and has been ferrying astronauts since 2020. Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore will also be returning to Earth aboard the Crew Dragon.</p>

<p><strong>Development To Continue</strong></p>

<p>On August 24, the NASA chief said he had 100% confidence that the Boeing Starliner would continue to be developed but asserted that the agency had awarded a fixed-price contract to Boeing, meaning that the company will have to bear the extra costs for its full certification as a human space flight-worthy vehicle at its own expense.</p>

<p>The Starliner had also been making headlines recently for "strange noises" emanating from it, which have now been identified as feedback from a speaker.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA admitted on Wednesday there was "tension" during meetings with Boeing executives about how to bring home two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station, but denied reports of shouting matches.</p>

<p>The US space agency is enlisting SpaceX to rescue the astronauts because of safety concerns with Boeing's Starliner capsule, which encountered thruster malfunctions and helium leaks on its way to the orbital outpost.</p>

<p>Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched in June for what was meant to be around a weeklong stay, but they now aren't expected back until February 2025 when the SpaceX Crew-9 mission returns.</p>

<p>Boeing had publicly insisted it was confident in its spaceship, but the absence of its executives from recent NASA press briefings had fueled speculation of a rift.</p>

<p>According to sources cited by the New York Post, meetings between the two sides often descended into yelling and arguments.</p>

<p>Asked to address the claims, Steve Stich, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said "anytime you're in a meeting of this magnitude where there's this kind of decision, there is some tension in the room."</p>

<p>"Boeing believed in the model that they had created that tried to predict the thruster degradation for the rest of the flight," he added, but "the NASA team, due to the uncertainty in the modeling, could not get comfortable with that."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say it was a yelling, screaming kind of meeting," Stich told reporters. "It was a tense technical discussion where we had both sides listening intently to all the data."</p>

<h2>Fresh clothes</h2>

<p>Despite their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams remain in good spirits and are in touch with their families.</p>

<p>They are no longer dependent on borrowed clothes having been sent better fitting suits during a recent resupply mission, the NASA officials reported.</p>

<p>Starliner is set to depart the ISS on Friday evening US Eastern Time before making a parachute and airbag assisted landing in the western United States early on Saturday morning.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expressing condolences for the victims of a shooting incident at a school in Georgia, President Joe Biden has called on Republicans to work with Democrats in the US Congress to pass gun safety legislation to help prevent future gun violence in the United States.</p>

<p>At least four people, including two students, have been killed and nine others were injured when a fellow student opened fire in a high school in the US state of Georgia on Wednesday, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Biden described the shooting incident as "another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart."</p>

<p>"Jill (Biden) and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short due to more senseless gun violence and thinking of all of the survivors whose lives are forever changed. What should have been a joyous back-to-school season in Winder, Georgia, has now turned into another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart," Biden said in a statement released by the White House.</p>

<p>The US president lamented that students across the country are "learning how to duck and cover instead of how to read and write."</p>

<p>"We cannot continue to accept this as normal. We are closely coordinating with officials at the federal, state and local levels and are grateful for the first responders who brought the suspect into custody and prevented further loss of life," Biden said.</p>

<p>Further, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to tackling the gun violence epidemic in the US and highlighted his efforts to address the issue, including the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.</p>

<p>"Ending this gun violence epidemic is personal to me. It's why I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act--the most meaningful gun safety bill in decades--and have announced dozens of gun safety executive actions. I also established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris. We've made significant progress, but this crisis requires even more," the US president said.</p>

<p>Biden called on Republicans to work with Democrats in Congress to pass gun safety legislation to help prevent future gun violence and stated that 'enough is enough.'</p>

<p>"After decades of inaction, Republicans in Congress must finally say 'enough is enough' and work with Democrats to pass common-sense gun safety legislation. We must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again, require safe storage of firearms, enact universal background checks, and end immunity for gun manufacturers. These measures will not bring those who were tragically killed today back, but they will help prevent more tragic gun violence from ripping more families apart," Biden said.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris also took to X and expressed condolences for the people who are impacted by this shooting and described it as a "senseless tragedy."</p>

<p>"Today, Doug and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short by gun violence at Apalachee High School in Georgia. Our hearts are with the students, teachers, and families impacted by this shooting, and we are grateful to the first responders and law enforcement on the scene. This is a senseless tragedy -- and it does not have to be this way. We must end the epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for," said Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian P Kemp also posted on X and stated "I have directed all available state resources to respond to the incident at Apalachee High School and urge all Georgians to join my family in praying for the safety of those in our classrooms, both in Barrow County and across the state."</p>

<p>"We will continue to work with local, state, and federal partners as we gather information and further respond to this situation," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the suspected gunman is in custody and was identified as 14-year-old Colt Cray, a student of Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, about an hour outside of Atlanta. Two of those killed were students and two were teachers. Law enforcement agencies are still investigating the shooting and the motive behind it.</p>

<p>The high school had received an earlier phone threat, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN.</p>

<p>The phone call Wednesday morning warned there would be shootings at five schools, and that Apalachee would be the first. It is not known who placed the call. Officials tell CNN they are investigating the call and where it originated.</p>

<p>The US has suffered at least 385 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines mass shootings as those in which four or more victims are shot. That's an average of more than 1.5 mass shootings every day.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British hiker has been found dead and another is missing on the Spanish island of Mallorca after heavy rains swept over the popular tourist destination, emergency services said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Emergency services had been looking for the two hikers since Monday night in an area of mountains in Mallorca where the Torrent de Pareis canyon descends to the Mediterranean, a police spokeswoman told AFP.</p>

<p>The search was called off on Wednesday at around 1900 GMT as dusk fell, with emergency services saying it would resume on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The body found is that of a woman and the missing person is a man," police said in a statement, adding that the search for the man had been suspended because of poor weather but would resume when conditions improved.</p>

<p>Juan Carlos Rodriguez, the head of the Mountain Rescue Group brigade in the Balearic islands, told reporters they had rescued 10 people who were hiking in the canyon and "were surprised by the storm".</p>

<p>"They were the ones who told us that they had seen two people who had been swept away by the water," he said.</p>

<p>"When you don't look at the weather before, and you are in a foreign country doing sport tourism, or sun and beach tourism, that leads to people having accidents," he added.</p>

<p>Local authorities had called for people to be careful due to the "very intense storms" that were expected.</p>

<p>"Avoid outdoor activities (going to the beach, hiking, water sports)," the archipelago's emergency services warned on X.</p>

<p>Mallorca remained on alert on Wednesday for heavy rains and strong winds, with the national weather office Aemet warning that gusts of over 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour were possible.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean island, known for its picturesque beaches and sunny weather, is one of Europe's most visited destinations. It is especially popular with German and British tourists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first phase of a large-scale polio vaccination campaign in Gaza has concluded successfully, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, providing nearly 200,000 children in the centre of the Palestinian territory with their initial dose.</p>

<p>With Gaza lying in ruins and the majority of its 2.4 million residents forced to flee their homes due to Israel's military assault -- often taking refuge in cramped and unsanitary conditions -- disease has spread.</p>

<p>After the first confirmed polio case in 25 years, a massive vaccination effort began on Sunday, aided by localised "humanitarian pauses" in fighting.</p>

<p>The campaign aims to fully vaccinate more than 640,000 children in the besieged territory, devastated by almost 11 months of war.</p>

<p>During the first phase of the campaign, conducted between September 1 and 3 in central Gaza, more than 187,000 children under the age of 10 were reached, the WHO said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We are grateful for the dedication of all the families, health workers and vaccinators who made this part of the campaign a success despite the dire conditions in the Gaza Strip," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Over 187,000 children under the age of ten were vaccinated, well over the target of 156,500. The numbers are being finalised.<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"We ask for the humanitarian pauses to continue to be respected. We continue to call for a ceasefire."</p>

<p>The WHO had estimated that vaccines would be needed for nearly 157,000 children below the age of 10 in central Gaza but acknowledged that that was an underestimate.</p>

<p>This it said was "due to population movement towards central Gaza, and expanded coverage in areas outside the humanitarian pause zone". &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>No child left behind&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>More than 500 teams, consisting of nearly 2,200 health and community outreach workers, took part in the campaign in central Gaza, with vaccinations provided at 143 fixed sites across the area.</p>

<p>In addition, mobile teams visited tents and hard-to-reach areas, including those outside the agreed humanitarian pause zone.</p>

<p>While the large-scale campaign in central Gaza is over, the WHO said that vaccinations would continue at four large health facilities there over the next few days "to ensure no child is missed in the area".</p>

<p>The main focus is meanwhile set to move to southern Gaza, where an estimated 340,000 children over the next four days will receive their first dose.</p>

<p>And finally, the campaign will be concentrated in northern Gaza between September 9 and 11, targeting around 150,000 children, the WHO said.</p>

<p>A fresh campaign to provide a needed second dose is due to begin in about four weeks time.</p>

<p>The WHO has stressed that it is vital to reach at least 90 per cent coverage to avoid the spread of the disease both within Gaza's borders and beyond.</p>

<p>"We want to ensure... there will be no other Gaza children who actually will suffer from polio," Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative for the Palestinian territories, told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"But we also want to make sure that we prevent the spread of polio to neighbouring countries."</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians and including hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas since October 7 has killed at least 40,861 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Japan, companies are cashing in on employees' hesitancy to call it quits and helping people leave their unsatisfying workplaces. According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, a company named Exit is in the job of helping people resign from their jobs and is even offering half-off for returning clients. The firm, launched in 2017, overseas the resignations of around 10,000 people per year. For 20,000 yen (approximately Rs 11,600), the business makes a call to the client's company and informs them that they are quitting while spelling out other details. They also tell them about when their last day would be at the office and gather other information about how to return company-issued tech or uniforms and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since Exit's launch, similar services have cropped up across the country, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/workplace-dissatisfied-quitting-agencies-japan-5c5586d5?mod=lifestyle_lead_story" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>WSJ</em></a>. Its competitor Albatross calls clients' places of employment and declares they are quitting and specifies details, such as last day. Another firm called Momuri - which translates to "I can't do this anymore" - is also gaining popularity in Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To answer why workers are reaching out to such firms is quite simple. People in Japan find it difficult to quit jobs because they face immense opposition and stress while doing so. In most extreme cases, grumpy bosses rip up resignation letters and harass employees to force them to stay. "Japanese are not educated to debate and express opinions," Exit co-founder Toshiyuki Niino, 34, told the Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Ayumi Sekine, who works at Albatross, said he also faced a similar situation with his previous job. He said that when he tried to resign from his job at a gas company, his former boss refused to acknowledge it and he had to beg him to go. Only after an immense crying was he allowed to leave the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yuta Sakamoto, another disgruntled employee, paid over $200 to a quitting agency to help him leave his job where his former boss warned him that he'd be ruining his career if he ever left. Then there are some who can't afford these services and pretend to be from a quitting agency when tendering a resignation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Albatross CEO Shinji Tanimoto says that most of the bosses are fine with a third party informing them about an employee going on notice. However, a few of them demand legal negotiations with a lawyer present.</p>

<p>The reason behind quitting is mostly because of difficult bosses, unpaid overtime, and a culture of not being able to use your paid time off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to <em>WSJ</em>, many companies in Japan are also reaching out to quitting agencies for referrals for the newly unemployed.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China insisted Thursday it did not pose a threat to New Zealand's national security after the country's spy service singled out Beijing-backed groups as a "complex intelligence concern".</p>

<p>New Zealand's Security Intelligence Service levelled unusually candid criticisms at China in its annual threat report, released this week, saying ongoing foreign interference efforts were "complex and deceptive".</p>

<p>China's embassy in New Zealand hit back on Thursday, branding such claims "entirely baseless" and "a figment of imagination or sheer fabrication".</p>

<p>"There is no competition to speak of between the two countries, and China is not a threat to New Zealand," an embassy spokesperson said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beijing was accused of infiltrating local groups, replacing authentic community views with those approved by the ruling party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one example, a Chinese-language community news outlet was accused of regurgitating government talking points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The report's blatant attempts to discredit the Chinese diaspora and students are nothing but an effort to sow discord, create fear, and foster division," replied China's embassy spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is highly irresponsible, reckless, and deeply unfair to the Chinese community."&nbsp;</p>

<p>China's embassy suggested external forces -- likely a veiled reference to the United States -- had been meddling to undermine relations between the trading partners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand's centre-right government has shifted the country's foreign policy closer to traditional Western allies such as the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has come with an increased willingness to speak out against China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, Wellington said a Chinese state-sponsored group was behind a 2021 malicious cyber attack that infiltrated sensitive government computer systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China remains New Zealand's biggest trading partner -- exporting dairy, meat and wood products that exceeded NZ$21.39 billion (US$13.2 billion), according to the most recent official data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Christoper Luxon has warned that although China was "a country of undoubted influence", different values mean "there are issues on which we cannot and will not agree".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, US President Joe Biden expressed his concerns about the safety of people in Bangladesh and the future of democratic institutions there, the White House has said.</p>

<p>During the call, President Biden and PM Modi “shared concerns” on the recent developments in Bangladesh, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told a press conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"I mean, the president made clear his continued concerns about the safety and security of the people in Bangladesh and the future of their democratic institutions," he said in response to a question.</p>

<p>The statement issued by the White House after the August 26 call did not mention Bangladesh. However, a post on X by PM Modi and a statement issued by his office mentioned that Bangladesh was discussed during the telephonic conversation.</p>

<p>"The two leaders expressed their shared concern over the situation in Bangladesh. They emphasized restoration of law and order and ensuring safety and security of the minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh," the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) had said.</p>

<p>In his post on X, PM Modi had said,“We also discussed the situation in Bangladesh and stressed on the need for early restoration of normalcy, and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In yet another endorsement of Republican candidate Donald Trump, tech billionaire Elon Musk said the former US president must win if the American people want to "preserve freedom and meritocracy".</p>

<p>"I have never been materially active in politics before, but this time I think civilization as we know it is on the line. If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America, then Trump must win," he wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>Musk was responding to a post that praised him as the "one of the best in the world at synthesizing complex information". The post was responding to a X user accusing Musk of spreading misinformation and joining the "MAGA cult", a reference to Trump's campaign slogan Make America Great Again.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO had first openly endorsed Trump after he was shot at during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery. Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt," he wrote on X while sharing a video of Trump raising his fist in the air after a bullet grazed the top of his ear during an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Since then, Musk has not shied away from throwing his weight behind the former president's re-election bid. From wanting to work on Trump's cabinet to holding an exclusive interview with the Republican candidate on X, years after the platform banned him for "incitement of violence" after the January 6 violence.</p>

<p>Musk has also hit out at Trump's rival and US Vice President Kamala Harris. On Wednesday, he shared a shared an AI-generated image of Harris and said she "vows to be a communist dictator on day one".&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US welcomes any nation that is willing to try to help end the conflict in Ukraine, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby has said.</p>

<p>His remarks came after he was asked at a press conference on Wednesday about President Joe Biden's call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the latter's trip to Ukraine that was preceded by his visit to Moscow, and if he thought India could play a role in ending the war.</p>

<p>Kirby said, "Any nation that is willing to try to help end this war and do so in keeping with President Zelenskyy's prerogatives, the Ukrainian people's prerogatives, his plan for a just peace, we would certainly welcome a role like that." On whether he thought India could play a role in bringing peace, the White House official said, "Well, we certainly hope so."</p>

<p>In his call, President Biden commended PM Modi for his historic visits to Poland and Ukraine, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in decades, and for his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine, including its energy sector.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel will only agree to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza that guarantees the border area between southern Gaza and Egypt could never be used as a lifeline for the Islamist movement Hamas.</p>

<p>"Until that happens, we're there," he told a news conference in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Netanyahu repeated his outright rejection of a withdrawal from the so-called Philadelphi corridor in the first phase of a deal, expected to last 42 days, saying international pressure would make it effectively impossible to return.</p>

<p>For a permanent ceasefire to be agreed upon after that, Israel would need guarantees that whoever ran postwar Gaza would be able to prevent the corridor from being used as a route for smuggling weapons and supplies for Hamas.</p>

<p>"Somebody has to be there," he said. "Bring me anyone who will actually show - not on paper, not in words, not on a slide - but day after day, week after week, month after month, that they can actually prevent a recurrence of what happened there before," he said, referring to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"We're open to consider it, but I don't see that happening right now."</p>

<p>The Philadelphi corridor, along the southern edge of the Gaza Strip bordering Egypt, has been one of the main obstacles to a deal to halt the fighting in Gaza and bring Israeli hostages home in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has insisted on retaining control of the corridor, where Israeli troops have uncovered dozens of tunnels that officials say have been used to supply Hamas with weapons and ammunition.</p>

<p>The prime minister has faced heavy criticism from many in Israel for holding out on the issue, including from many in his own security establishment who believe Israeli troops can make targeted interventions if needed to prevent any smuggling.</p>

<p>The families of many hostages, including some of the six whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza on Sunday, have accused him of sacrificing their loved ones by insisting on keeping troops in the corridor.</p>

<p>But he said maintaining pressure on Hamas was the best way to return the 101 hostages still remaining in Gaza.</p>

<p>"You need to squeeze them, to put pressure on them to release the remaining hostages. So if you want to release the hostages, you've got to control the Philadelphi corridor," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said on Thursday there was no need for new ceasefire proposals for Gaza and pressure should be put on Israel to agree to a U.S. plan that the Islamist group had already accepted.</p>

<p>The United States was expected to present a new truce proposal aimed at breaking an impasse between Hamas and Israel.</p>

<p>In a statement, Hamas said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to thwart an agreement by insisting that Israel will not withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"We warn against falling into Netanyahu's trap and tricks, as he uses negotiations to prolong the aggression against our people," the statement said.</p>

<p>Hamas said it accepted a July 2 proposal put forward by the U.S.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Hamas had rejected all elements of a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would help facilitate the release of hostages.</p>

<p>"Hamas has rejected everything... I hope that changes because I want those hostages out," Netanyahu told a news conference, casting doubt on the possibility of a breakthrough one day after the State Department said it was "time to finalise that deal".</p>

<p>"We're trying to find some area to begin the negotiations," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>"They (Hamas) refuse to do that... (They said) there's nothing to talk about."</p>

<p>Netanyahu has come under added domestic and international pressure to seal a deal that would free Israeli hostages after authorities announced on Sunday the deaths of six whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>On Monday, Netanyahu said Israeli forces would retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, vowing "not to give in to pressure" over the issue.</p>

<p>Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel started the war, is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal from the area as part of the stalled talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>At Wednesday's news conference, Netanyahu reiterated his position on the Philadelphi Corridor, saying that ceding control would allow Hamas to smuggle weapons in and hostages and "terrorists" out.</p>

<p>"You need something to squeeze them, to prevent them, to put pressure on them to release the remaining hostages," he said.</p>

<p>"So if you want to release the hostages, you've got to control the Philadelphi Corridor."</p>

<p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Wednesday that Washington recognised "the very real needs that Israel has to ensuring that there can't be smuggling across the Philadelphi Corridor", but said "we think that there are ways to address" the issue.</p>

<p>Reaching a deal "is going to require flexibility from the government of Israel, just as it's going to require Hamas to finally find a way to get to yes," Miller said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, for his part, said he was "flexible when I can be" and "firm when I have to be".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Whole thing' unresolved -</strong></p>

<p>He also stressed that the debate over the Philadelphi Corridor was not the sole sticking point.</p>

<p>Also unanswered, he said, were questions over how many Palestinian prisoners would be freed in exchange for hostages, whether Israel could veto the release of certain prisoners and where released prisoners should go.</p>

<p>"The whole thing has not been resolved," he said.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack by Hamas resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead. Scores were released during a one-week truce in November -- the only one so far.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,861 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN rights office.</p>

<p>At protests in several Israeli cities this week, Netanyahu's critics have blamed him for hostages' deaths, saying he has refused to make necessary concessions for striking a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said this week he did not think Netanyahu was working hard enough to free the hostages.</p>

<p>Also on Wednesday, an Israeli far-right minister stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to end negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire altogether.</p>

<p>"A country whose six hostages are murdered in cold blood does not negotiate with the killers, but ends the talks, stops the transfer of fuel and electricity, and crushes them until they collapse," National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir wrote on the social media platform X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Wednesday implored Americans to bring a halt to the "epidemic of gun violence" plaguing the United States, after a mass shooting at a Georgia high school left four people dead.</p>

<p>The US vice president, speaking at a rally in New Hampshire, also reiterated her call for an assault-weapons ban -- a position widely opposed by Republicans -- and support for the further tightening of US gun safety laws.</p>

<p>"This is just a senseless tragedy, on top of so many senseless tragedies," Harris said of the shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, the latest spasm of gun violence to impact a country that has already seen hundreds of mass shootings this year.</p>

<p>"And it's just outrageous that every day in our country, in the United States of America, that parents send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive," she added.</p>

<p>"We have to end this epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all. It doesn't have to be this way," Harris, locked in a tight race with Republican former president Donald Trump, told the crowd before she started laying out elements of her economic plan.</p>

<p>Trump, seen by his party as a champion for gun rights, posted on social media that "our hearts are with the victims," and said "these cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster."</p>

<p>Harris, a onetime prosecutor and attorney general of California and former US senator, called on Congress to "finally" pass an assault weapons ban, similar to the one current President Joe Biden helped write as a senator and get passed into law in 1994.</p>

<p>That ban expired in 2004, and Congress did not renew it.</p>

<p>Harris also called for adopting universal background checks and implementing so-called red flag laws -- state protective orders aimed at preventing certain individuals seen as a threat from purchasing or possessing firearms.</p>

<p>"It is a false choice to say you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away," Harris said. "I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I know we need reasonable gun safety laws in our country."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

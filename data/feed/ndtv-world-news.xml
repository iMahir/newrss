       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 90-foot-tall bronze murti of Lord Hanuman, unveiled near Houston, symbolising "a new milestone in the cultural and spiritual landscape of America," has become the latest landmark in Texas visible from miles away, and the third tallest sculpture in the US.</p>

<p>The Statue of Union, as it has been named, is one of the tallest statues in the world and holds several other distinctions: it is the tallest Hanuman murti outside India, the tallest in Texas, and the third tallest statue in the United States, surpassed only by the Statue of Liberty in New York (151 feet) and the Pegasus and Dragon in Hallandale Beach, Florida (110 feet), the organisers said.</p>

<p>The 'Statue of Union' Hanuman murti, which was unveiled at the Sri Ashtalakshmi Temple in Sugar Land, about 35-odd km from here, during a grand Prana Prathishta Mahotsavam ceremony from August 15 to 18, symbolises "selflessness, devotion, and unity," the organisers said, adding, the murti is named so to "honour Hanuman's pivotal role in reuniting Lord Ram and Sita."</p>

<p>"This awe-inspiring structure is the result of the visionary efforts of His Holiness Sri Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji, a Padma Bhushan awardee, and a renowned Vedic scholar, who envisioned the project as a spiritual epicentre for North America," the organiser said in a statement.</p>

<p>The festivities commenced on August 15, coinciding with India's Independence Day and the core of the celebrations unfolded on August 18, with the grand Pran Prathistha ceremony. "The rituals, led by Sri Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji and overseen by a multitude of Vedic priests and scholars, were a powerful display of devotion and spirituality," the statement said.</p>

<p>The ceremony featured a helicopter showering flowers upon the murti, sprinkling of sacred water, and placing of a 72-foot-long garland around Hanuman's neck amid thousands of devotees chanting the names of Shri Ram and Hanuman in unison.</p>

<p>The statue stands tall not only as a symbol of Hanuman's indomitable spirit but also as a new milestone in the cultural and spiritual landscape of America, embodying the principles of devotion, strength, and unity for all who come to witness its grandeur, the organisers added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift may have been absent from the Democratic National Convention (DNC), but her presence was still felt through her music. On the second night of the convention, her chart-topping hit <em>Shake It Off </em>took centre stage during the roll call vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event featured a unique musical twist, with DJ Cassidy curating a playlist of 62 songs to represent each state and territory. From Lil Jon's <em>Turn Down for What </em>for Georgia to Michael Jackson's <em>Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough </em>for Indiana, the music selections brought a lively spirit to the proceedings.</p>

<p><em>Shake It Off</em> was a fitting choice for Rhode Island, given Taylor Swift's ties to the state. She owns a home in Watch Hill on the island. The home has become a cultural landmark, celebrated in her music and famous for its star-studded Fourth of July parties.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the only Taylor Swift reference of the night.</p>

<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, "Donald Trump is like an old boyfriend who you broke up with, but he just won't go away. He spent the last four years trying to get back into a relationship with the American people. Bro, we broke up with you for a reason!" There is no reason for us to "get back together," he said, quoting Swift's hit song <em>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.</em></p>

<p>Colorado Governor and 'Swiftie' Jared Polis also referenced the song during his address at the DNC. "As a Redditor, gamer, entrepreneur and Swiftie from the free state of Colorado, I'm excited by Kamala Harris' vision of protecting and expanding our personal freedom, internet freedom and economic freedom," he said, adding the Democratic party does not consist of "weirdos who can tell people who can and can't have kids."</p>

<p>"We're never going back like never ever ever ever," he stated.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This comes as Swift has yet to officially endorse a candidate in the 2024 race, despite polls suggesting her support could significantly boost the chances of both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, Mississippi delegate Kelly Jacobs handed out thousands of Taylor Swift-themed bracelets at the event. Jacobs also made a statement on the first day of the convention, wearing a body-length sign that read "Storm the ballot box like they stormed the Capitol on Jan 6" and distributing homemade "Swifty Voter" friendship bracelets.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The historian will make the official prediction for the 2024 White House race after the Democratic convention.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Ronald Reagan's re-election triumph amid economic recession to Bill Clinton's victory against George HW Bush, Allan Lichtman, known as the 'Nostradamus' of US Presidential Polls has correctly predicted crucial poll contests in the country. Now, the expert has said that independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr's dropping out of the race for the White House will help Democrat candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign.</p>

<p>On his YouTube livestream, Mr Lichtman, according to his election prediction system, said that Mr Kennedy's exit and endorsement of former US President Donald Trump would help Ms Harris. "(Kennedy's) endorsement of Trump has nothing to do with the keys - (it) doesn't turn a key one way or the other." The expert was referring to his "13 keys to the White House," a groundbreaking method that revolutionised election forecasting.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://newsweek.com/allan-lichtman-rfk-kamala-harris-kennedy-drop-out-2024-election-trump-1942253"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, he stated that he "hasn't definitively called the 'third party' key, but said 'it certainly doesn't look like (Kennedy) is going to rebound."</p>

<p>"I'm still reserving judgement," he added.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Mr Lichtman said that he currently prefers Democratic US Vice President Kamala Harris to her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. He expressed his opinion to News Nation, saying that "a lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose." He predicted that Democrats presently hold six of the 13 keys. A main competition, a short- and long-term economy, policy changes, the absence of controversy, and the charisma of a challenger are some of these. "Right now, Democrats have lost three keys" by switching to Harris, he told News Nation.</p>

<p>The expert claimed that the Democrats' significant defeat in the 2022 midterm elections cost them the "party mandate". He added that Ms Harris no longer had the "incumbency" and "charisma" keys.</p>

<p>However, in order for him to forecast a Harris defeat, Democrats would need to lose three additional seats according to his prediction model. However, he says that is unlikely to occur.</p>

<p>The historian will make the official prediction for the 2024 White House race after the Democratic convention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the third day of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the chants of "Om Shanti, Shanti" echoed in the hall and the priest conducting the prayers urged Americans to choose a leader who believes in the concept of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'.</p>

<p>In an example of inclusivity in the US and growing influence of the Indian community there, a senior Hindu priest from the Sri Siva Vishnu Temple in Maryland, Rakesh Bhatt conducted Vedic prayers today, seeking blessings for unity across the nation.</p>

<p>At the Convention, Rakesh Bhatt remarked, "Even if we have differences, when it comes to the nation, we have to be united."</p>

<p>"Let our minds think together. Let our hearts beat as one. All for the betterment of society. May this make us powerful so we can unite and make our nation proud," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Bhatt also urged America to choose a leader who believes in the Vedic concept of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the whole world is one family).'</p>

<p>He further mentioned, "We are one universal family. Truth is our foundation and always prevails. Lead us from unreal to real, from darkness to the light, and from death to immortality. Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti."</p>

<p>Replying to the prayer conducted by Bhatt, Ajay Bhutoria, Deputy National Finance Chair of the Democratic Party stated, "Rakesh Bhatt's Hindu prayer at the DNC today is a significant moment, showcasing the Democratic Party's commitment to inclusivity and diversity."</p>

<p>"It is heartening to see the rich cultural and spiritual traditions of the Indian American community being honoured on such a prominent stage. This moment reflects the growing influence and recognition of our community within the fabric of American society," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Bhatt is a Madhwa priest from Bengaluru who has trained in Rig Veda and Tantrasaara (Maadhva) Agama, under his guru, Pejavar Swamiji of Udupi Ashta Matha, Karnataka.</p>

<p>He received his English and Kannada degrees from Osteen College, Bengaluru, and his Sanskrit degree from Jayachamarajendra College.</p>

<p>To acquire Vedic knowledge he later joined Udupi Ashta Matha and worked at the Badrinath and Raghavendra Swami Koil, Salem, before joining Sri Sri Vishnu Temple in July 2013.</p>

<p>Also, the Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz accepted his party's nomination for vice president at the Democratic National Convention and expressed gratitude.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may look like any other ordinary doll but it's not. It has gained notoriety for all the wrong reasons. Meet the world's "most haunted doll", reportedly possessed by the spirit of a jilted bride -- Elizabeth. It is said to have attacked 17 men so far and is currently at the Haunted Objects Museum in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Lee Steer, a 37-year-old paranormal investigator, became the owner of the doll for £866&nbsp;(Rs&nbsp;95,100) on eBay after learning of its purported hostility towards men.</p>

<p>Ms Steer claimed the doll had attacked men, leaving some with physical injuries, the New York Post reported. He's been among those at the receiving end of the doll's hostility. In contrast, Elizabeth doesn't harm any women around her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lee Steer experienced a burning sensation on his neck during an investigation in the museum's bridal doll room along with his 32-year-old partner, Sarah Carter. Later, he also discovered scratches on his back, which resembled a pentagram. "It seems like the doll has a hatred towards men. There have been well over 15 people who have come to me to say they have been scratched. It is all men and never a woman that it has attacked," Mr&nbsp;Steer told The NY Post. Sarah has been avoiding the bridal doll room due to her discomfort with its presence.</p>

<p>Besides physical attacks on men, Mr Steer revealed that the haunted doll also set off fire alarms, moved objects around the room, threw a perfume bottle across the room, and performed many other activities. During one paranormal investigation, he mentioned Elizabeth caused electronic interference in video footage, and the words 'bride' and 'haunting' mysteriously appeared repeatedly.</p>

<p>Another 34-year-old paranormal investigator, Jon-Paul Kenny, experienced a similar encounter with the doll while filming a live TikTok session in the museum. Mr Kenny recalled, "I felt someone grab my shirt, and my skin was touched. It was 100% the bridal doll that did this to me. I wasn't scared, but it put me on edge."</p>

<p><strong>"Acting out of jealousy"</strong></p>

<p>According to a report in The Daily Star, Mr Steer said the spirit within the doll might be acting out of jealousy, as the museum recently acquired a famous artefact from the horror film series <em>The Conjuring, </em>which features a possessed doll named 'Annabelle'.</p>

<p>He explained, "Why she (Elizabeth) is doing it is a mystery. Some people think she was treated badly by a man and some think her wedding went wrong so this is why she haunts a bridal doll."</p>

<p>Mr Steer added that the doll's behaviour could also stem from the fact that "Elizabeth has always been the centre of attention in the museum" and she's feeling a bit of jealousy.</p>

<p>"We've got famous items from<em> The Conjuring</em> now and maybe she is feeling a bit forgotten so she is making herself known in the most extreme way. I suspect it to be the most haunted doll," he concluded.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Seventeen-year-old Gus, who is neurodivergent and has ADHD, was overcome with emotion as he watched his father take the stage. With tears streaming down his face, Gus stood up and proudly pointed at his dad, exclaiming, "That's my dad!"</p>

<p>The crowd was visibly moved by the heartfelt display, and social media quickly filled with praise for the Walz family's authenticity.</p>

<p>In a whirlwind quarter-hour address, Walz raced through the story of his middle-class upbringing in small town Nebraska, where he worked on the family farm, and described his experience teaching students who inspired him to go into politics.</p>

<p>The speech comes ahead of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-kamala-harris-dials-running-mate-tim-walz-before-his-special-night-6390769">Kamala Harris' big night</a> where she will officially accept the democratic party's nomination to face Donald Trump in the upcoming US presidential elections. Harris and her running mate Walz will be up against Trump and JD Vance.</p>

<p>Polls show the race remains close, but Harris is moving slightly ahead - a remarkable turn of events, given that only a month ago Trump seemed to be gaining a steadily tightening grip over Joe Biden.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to drop out of the race for the White House, US media reported on Wednesday, with the independent candidate due to make a major address later in the week.</p>

<p>The New York Times and CNN reported that Kennedy, whose support was at 8.7 percent in a nationwide poll by The Hill this week, would back Republican nominee Donald Trump upon dropping out.</p>

<p>Analysts say that in the tight race between the Democratic Party's Kamala Harris and Trump for the presidency, the votes of Kennedy's supporters could determine the outcome in some battleground states.</p>

<p>Kennedy, the scion of America's most famous political clan, is an environmental lawyer and long-time vaccine skeptic whose campaign struggled to gain traction with mainstream voters.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, his campaign said he would make an address to the nation on Friday from the swing state of Arizona, where Trump is also due to hold a campaign event that day.</p>

<p>"Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will address the nation live on Friday about the present historical moment and his path forward," read a brief statement from RFK Jr.'s campaign.</p>

<p>The New York Times on Wednesday cited three anonymous sources as saying Kennedy would end his campaign and potentially endorse Trump.</p>

<p>CNN cited two anonymous sources who reported Kennedy was expected to suspend his campaign on Friday.</p>

<p>AFP has reached out to Kennedy's campaign for comment on the reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a podcast interview this week, Kennedy's running mate Nicole Shanahan hinted that he could withdraw in favor of Trump.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee told CNN on Tuesday that he would "certainly" be open to Kennedy playing a role in his administration if he was elected.</p>

<p>"He's a brilliant guy. He's a very smart guy," Trump told CNN. "I've known him for a very long time.</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I'd be open to it."</p>

<p>Known for sometimes bizarre pronouncements and for spreading often dangerous health-related conspiracy theories, Kennedy has faced a number of setbacks in his electoral campaign.</p>

<p>This month, a judge in New York claimed that Kennedy had falsely claimed residency in the state and barred him from ballots there.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Democratic luminaries including the Obamas enthusiastically support Kamala Harris for US president at their party's convention, an unlikely band of rebels is joining the effort: Republicans urging fellow conservatives to ditch Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The message is nothing new -- several Republicans have spoken out against Trump over the years. But their presence at this week's carefully orchestrated Democratic confab has amplified the call for conservatives and independents to reconsider their election choice in November.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear to my Republican friends at home watching," Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia where Trump sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election, said Wednesday from the convention stage.</p>

<p>"If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024 you're not a Democrat, you're a patriot," he boomed.</p>

<p>Slamming the recently convicted -- and twice-impeached -- former president as "a direct threat to democracy," Duncan said he was aiming his remarks at the millions of Republicans and independents he knows are "sick and tired of making excuses" for Trump.</p>

<p>"These days our party acts more like a cult, a cult worshipping a felonous thug," said Duncan.</p>

<p>Multiple Republicans have offered similar messages in Chicago, as the Harris campaign seeks to peel off as many Republicans and independent voters as possible in an election that is going down to the wire.</p>

<p>Former White House communications director Stephanie Grisham, who had close access to Trump, took the stage Tuesday slamming her ex-boss as a liar with "no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth."</p>

<p>"I saw him when the cameras were off. Behind closed doors, Trump mocks his supporters, he calls them basement dwellers," she said.</p>

<p>Grisham, who was also first lady Melania Trump's chief of staff, mentioned how she had gone from "a true believer" to a disaffected close advisor who wanted out, and recalled a turning point during the 2021 US Capitol riot by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>"On January 6 I asked Melania if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there's no place for lawlessness or violence," Grisham said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She replied with one word: 'No.'"</p>

<p>Grisham resigned that day, "because I love my country more than my party," she said, to loud applause, adding that Harris "has my vote."</p>

<p>- 'Kidnapped by extremists' -</p>

<p>John Giles, mayor of Mesa, Arizona, and a self-described "lifelong Republican" who claims late senator John McCain as his hero, was equally blunt.</p>

<p>He told the convention his Republican Party "has been kidnapped by extremists and devolved into a cult: the cult of Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Giles's message to Americans like him who are in the political middle: "John McCain's Republican Party is gone, and we don't owe a damn thing to what's been left behind."</p>

<p>Organizers aired a video Wednesday showing former Trump voters explaining why they were flipping to Harris.</p>

<p>"I made a grave mistake," Florida voter Rich Logis said via video about how he had jumped headlong into Trump's MAGA movement. "But it's never too late to change your mind," Logis said.</p>

<p>Olivia Troye, a former counter-terrorism advisor for Trump's vice president Mike Pence, addressed the convention, while high-profile Republican never-Trumper Adam Kinzinger, an ex-congressman, takes the stage Thursday, the closing night.</p>

<p>Trump frequently assails such critics as traitors to the cause, and it remains unclear how persuasive they will be.</p>

<p>David Urban, a Republican advisor to Trump's 2016 campaign, dismissed any substantial impact.</p>

<p>But he told CNN the appearance by Georgia's Duncan "may give people permission to vote for Kamala Harris" in the state.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[DNC's maiden night averaged 20 million viewers across 13 networks on Monday, comfortably surpassing the audience for the first three days of the RNC held last month in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When former US President Barack Obama stepped onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), the atmosphere was electric. It was none other than Michelle Obama, the former first lady, who introduced the 44th President to the attendees, calling him "the love of my life". The two, all smiles, then hugged before Mr Obama, one of the most charismatic speakers, took to the dais.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the delegates and the supporters of the Democratic Party who patiently listened to the former president. People at home, too, watched him speak, data show. The second night of the Democratic Convention reached an average of 20.6 million viewers on Tuesday, courtesy of the Obamas.</p>

<p>The average viewership of the Democratic National Convention was 20 million on Monday, according to Nielsen.</p>

<p>Like the night before, data from 12 networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC, Scripps News, CNN, CNNe, FOX Business, FOX News Channel, MSNBC, Newsmax, NewsNation and PBS -- were compiled.</p>

<p>DNC's maiden night averaged 20 million viewers across 13 networks. It surpassed the audience for the first three days of the Republican National Convention (RNC) held last month in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The Nielsen data show that the DNC's viewership on the second day jumped above the night's average to reach 21.6 million when former US President Barack Obama addressed the crowd.</p>

<p>Viewership for the RNC stood at 18.1 million, 14.8 million and 18 million, respectively, during the first three days, as per Nielsen. Donald Trump, who is eyeing another term as US president in the November 5 elections, headlined the final night of the convention. At the time, the viewership averaged 25.4 million, with the peak recorded at 28.4 million.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Barack Obama said, "We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos."</p>

<p>Referring to Trump's first term as US president, he stated that people have seen that movie before, and "we all know that the sequel is usually worse".</p>

<p>As the audience started to boo Trump, Obama recalled the popular phrase from his 2016 DNC speech, when Trump competed against Hillary Clinton: "Don't boo. Vote."</p>

<p>According to TV analyst Michael Mulvihill, the DNC also witnessed significantly higher viewers percentage-wise.</p>

<p>Mulvihill, who is the president of insights and analytics at FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment and Tubi, shared on social media site X that the DNC had 11.9 per cent of sampled households watching across 44 major metro areas on Tuesday, while the RNC earlier had 7.7 per cent rating, which is a difference of over 50 per cent.</p>

<p>Further, he pointed out that the DNC beat the RNC on the maiden night by 21 per cent in the overnight figures, besides 10 per cent in the full nationals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In China, having a sex change procedure is viewed as disrespectful to parents.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in China who was waiting for sex reassignment surgery has filed an 80,000 yuan (Rs 9.4 lakh approximately) lawsuit against a hospital, claiming he was coerced into receiving electroshock treatment, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/gender-diversity/article/3275106/china-man-awaiting-sex-reassignment-surgery-sues-hospital-over-forced-electroshock-therapy"><em>South China Morning Post. </em></a>The 27-year-old is a live-streamer from the northern Chinese province of Hebei and posts videos of himself donning women's clothes and makeup. The man said that he received electric shocks for several days while being forced into a hospital for 97 days.</p>

<p>Despite being born a male, he informed <em>Hongxing News</em> that he identifies as a woman. The social media star started taking oestrogen, one of the main female sex hormones. As a result, he developed long hair, lost facial hair, and softened his voice. He claims that he has been putting aside the money he earned from live-streaming in the hopes of undergoing surgery to change his gender.</p>

<p>However, Linger's parents disapproved of his choice. Since the Chinese traditionally believe that a person's body is a gift from their parents and that a person's gender should not be changed, they were unable to accept their son's gender transition, which caused several disputes within the family. Notably, in China, having a sex change procedure is viewed as disrespectful to parents.</p>

<p>Linger told <em>Hongxing News</em> that he agreed to visit a hospital in 2022 to avoid any other conflicts. Although he was aware that the facility was for psychiatric patients, he did not believe he was mentally ill. A doctor there diagnosed him with "anxiety disorder" and "ego-dystonic sexual orientation," a mental illness characterising a conflict between a person's intended and real sexual orientation. Soon after, the medical personnel took away his phone and forced him to stay in the hospital for 97 days. "After being admitted to the hospital, I was tied to the bed with ropes, and many doctors controlled my body and administered electroshock therapy for days," Linger said.</p>

<p>He sued the hospital for violating his human rights, requesting 80,000 yuan in damages. However, on August 13, Jiulongshan Hospital said during the hearing that they had "done nothing wrong" and the shocks were given to control the emotions to enhance the self-awareness of psychiatric patients.</p>

<p>According to the hospital, Linger's mother signed a consent form. The legal case is still being heard in court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A celebrated Australian penguin famous for raising chicks as part of an unlikely same-sex couple has died, a Sydney aquarium said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Male gentoo penguins Sphen and Magic caught the attention of zookeepers, and then the world, when they built a nest of pebbles together in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were eventually given live eggs to incubate from other penguin couples, hatching chick Sphengic in 2018 and Clancy two years later.</p>

<p>Sealife Aquarium said Sphen -- the older partner in the "same-sex" penguin "power couple" -- had died just shy of turning 12, considered a long life in captivity.</p>

<p>Sphen and Magic were adopted as gay icons in Australia and further abroad, inspiring a float at the Sydney Mardi Gras parade and featuring in the Netflix sitcom Atypical.</p>

<p>But they also had their critics, with some in conservative circles saying the penguins were unwittingly being used to push a political agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike many mammal species, male and female penguins take on the same parenting roles, and share parental duties 50-50.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same-sex couples between both males and females are not unheard of, although they are often short-lived in the wild.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was not the first time same-sex penguin couples had adopted eggs in captivity, with a handful of zoos worldwide reporting similar cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2009, two male penguins -- Z and Vielpunkt -- successfully hatched and reared a chick that was rejected by its heterosexual parents at a zoo in Berlin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before them came Roy and Silo, two male chinstrap penguins at a zoo in New York who were spotted frequently trying to mate with each other.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Democrats will officially hand the baton to 59-year-old Kamala Harris with hopes of defeating Donald Trump in the US presidential elections later this year.</p>

<p>Polls show the race remains close, but Harris is moving slightly ahead - a remarkable turn of events, given that only a month ago Trump seemed to be gaining a steadily tightening grip over Joe Biden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop megastar Taylor Swift on Wednesday broke her silence about the cancellation of three Vienna concerts over an alleged suicide attack plot, saying the incident filled her with "fear" and "guilt."<br />
"Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating. The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many had planned on coming to those shows," the American said in a post on social media platform Instagram.</p>

<p>The Vienna shows, part of the European leg of Swift's record-breaking "Eras" tour, were cancelled after authorities warned of a terror plot by sympathizers of the Islamic State armed group.</p>

<p>Police have detained three suspects over the alleged attack threat, with the United States saying it shared intelligence to assist in the investigation.</p>

<p>The main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots, had allegedly confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives," according to Austrian domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner.</p>

<p>In the social media post Wednesday, Swift thanked the authorities.</p>

<p>"I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives. I was heartened by the love and unity I saw in the fans who banded together," she said.</p>

<p>The European leg of Swift's sold-out tour began in Paris in May and has taken in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.</p>

<p>It concluded on Tuesday with five shows at London's Wembley stadium.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 24-year-old woman in the United States has been sentenced to 11 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree reckless homicide in the killing of a man who she said trafficked her as a teenager. According to <em>CNN</em>, Chrystul Kizer was sentenced on Monday. She will also serve five years of parole. She must submit a DNA sample to authorities and attend a restitution hearing later. "The 11 years is minus ... 570 days because she has served those awaiting trial," Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley told the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kizer shot 34-year-old Randall Volar at his Kenosha, Wisconsin, home in 2018 when she was 17 years old. She shot him in the head, burned his house down and stole his BMW. She was initially charged with multiple counts, including first-degree intentional homicide, arson, car theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://amp-cnn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/08/19/us/chrystul-kizer-sentencing-sex-trafficking-death?amp_js_v=0.1&amp;amp_gsa=1#webview=1&amp;cap=swipe">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kizer was 16 when she met Volar. She alleged that he had sexually abused her multiple times. The prosecutor's office also confirmed that it was working on a case against Volar at the time of his death. But prosecutors also said that Ms Kizer didn't give any indication at the time of the killing that she was trafficked by Volar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a 2019 interview with<em> The Washington Post</em>, Ms Kizer said that in 2018 she went to Volar's house with a gun in her purse that she said her boyfriend gave her for protection. She alleged that while she was there, Volar gave her a drug and the two decided to watch a movie. They then began to fight after Volar began touching her and she refused to have sex with her, she alleged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kizer also said that Volar pinned her before she shot him twice. She then set Volar's body on fire and fled in his car. "I just thought that I didn't want to do that stuff anymore because I was trying to change," she said.</p>

<p>Kenosha District Attorney Michael D. Graveley accused Ms Kizer of premeditated murder, alleging she planned to steal Volar's BMW. In 2022, she had a legal victory when the state Supreme Court upheld a ruling that she could argue she acted in self-defence under a state law that allows victims of trafficking to present "an affirmative defence for any offence committed as a direct result" of being trafficked. She was released from prison earlier this year on a $400,000 bond when she fled the state, violating the conditions of her bail. She was caught two weeks later in Louisiana and was returned to Wisconsin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Senior officials from the U.S. State Department and the White House met with the Dalai Lama in New York on Wednesday and "reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to advancing the human rights of Tibetans," the State Department said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior officials from the U.S. State Department and the White House met with the Dalai Lama in New York on Wednesday and "reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to advancing the human rights of Tibetans," the State Department said.</p>

<p>The meeting with the 89-year-old exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism will likely irritate China, which considers him a dangerous separatist and opposes contact by officials of any country with him.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, traveled to New York in June for medical treatment on his knees, his first visit to the United States since 2017.</p>

<p>A State Department statement said Uzra Zeya, the U.S. undersecretary of state for human rights and special coordinator for Tibetan issues, traveled to New York for an audience with the Dalai Lama, joined by the White House director for human rights, Kelly Razzouk.</p>

<p>It said Zeya "conveyed, on behalf of President Biden, best wishes for His Holiness's good health and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to advancing the human rights of Tibetans and supporting efforts to preserve their distinct historical, linguistic, cultural, and religious heritage."</p>

<p>Zeya discussed U.S. efforts to address human rights abuses in Tibet and support for a resumption of dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama, the statement said.</p>

<p>A group of U.S. lawmakers met the Dalai Lama in India before his U.S. trip and said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor.</p>

<p>Last month, China expressed strong opposition to a U.S. law signed by President Joe Biden that presses Beijing to resolve a dispute over Tibet's demands for greater autonomy and vowed to "firmly defend" its interests.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama has met U.S. officials, including U.S. presidents, during previous visits to the U.S., but Biden has not met him since taking office in 2021.</p>

<p>In 2020, Biden criticized then President Donald Trump for being the only president in three decades who had not met or spoken with the Tibetan spiritual leader, calling it "disgraceful."</p>

<p>Wednesday's meeting comes at a time when Biden has sought to stabilize rocky ties with China ahead of a presidential election on Nov. 5, in which Vice President Kamala Harris is pitted against Trump.</p>

<p>China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's brain technology startup Neuralink said its implant, designed to allow paralyzed patients to use digital devices by thinking alone, is working well in a second trial patient.</p>

<p>The company said the patient, identified as Alex, did not face issues of "thread retraction", unlike Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink's first patient who received the implant in January.</p>

<p>The tiny wires of the implant retracted post surgery for Arbaugh, resulting in a sharp reduction in the electrodes that could measure brain signals. The threads have stabilized for Arbaugh, Neuralink said.</p>

<p>Reuters had reported Neuralink was aware of this issue from its animal trials.</p>

<p>The company said on Wednesday it implemented measures such as reduction in the motion of the brain during surgery as well as limiting the gap between the implant and the surface of the brain to prevent similar issues in its second patient.</p>

<p>Neuralink is in the process of testing its device, which is intended to help people with spinal cord injuries. The device has allowed the first patient to play video games, browse the internet, post on social media and move a cursor on his laptop.</p>

<p>Last month, the company successfully implanted the device in the second patient, who has been using the device to play video games and learn how to design 3D objects.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying destroyers have arrived in the Middle East, the US military said Wednesday, after the country's defense secretary ordered the strike group to accelerate its speed.</p>

<p>The carrier's arrival brings the number in the region to two -- at least temporarily, as the Lincoln is to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt -- at a time of heightened fears of regional conflict following high-profile assassinations claimed by, or blamed on, Israel.</p>

<p>"USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), equipped with F-35C and F/A-18 Block III fighters, entered the US Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility," the military command responsible for the Middle East said on social media.</p>

<p>"The USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 3, is accompanied by Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 21 and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 9," it added.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said on August 11 that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered the Lincoln to "accelerate its transit" to the Middle East, after directing its deployment to the region at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>Fears of a major escalation have mounted since Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to twin killings blamed on Israel late last month.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs killed a top Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, shortly before an attack in Tehran blamed on Israel killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump held his first outdoor campaign event on Wednesday since an assassination attempt, lobbing insults at his surging Democratic opponent Kamala Harris from behind bulletproof glass at a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump held his first outdoor campaign event on Wednesday since an assassination attempt, lobbing insults at his surging Democratic opponent Kamala Harris from behind bulletproof glass at a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, speaking against a backdrop of vintage warplanes at an aviation museum, called Harris the "most radical left person" ever to run for the White House and claimed that millions of jobs will "vanish overnight" if she wins in November.</p>

<p>"Your life savings will be totally wiped out," the Republican candidate told the crowd, one of a number of apocalyptic scenarios he painted during his speech.</p>

<p>"All over the world, our adversaries knew that America was not to be trifled with when I was your commander in chief," Trump said. "If comrade Kamala wins this November, World War III is virtually guaranteed to happen."</p>

<p>With Harris drawing enthusiastic crowds since replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, the event in Asheboro was a chance for Trump to reclaim his longtime dominance in staging spectacular rallies.</p>

<p>It was his first big outdoor event since being lightly wounded in an attempted assassination at a similarly open site in Butler, Pennsylvania, a month ago.</p>

<p>That attack left one rally participant dead before the 20-year-old gunman was killed by a Secret Service sniper.</p>

<p>The Secret Service recommended that Trump stick to more easily controllable indoor venues such as sports arenas. He has since held about a dozen indoor events.</p>

<p>The Secret Service does not comment publicly on security operations and did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday's preparations.</p>

<p>A bulletproof screen could be seen around the podium where Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, addressed the crowd in Asheboro.</p>

<p>At one point during his speech, Trump left the stage and entered the crowd to check on an attendee who was suffering a medical issue.</p>

<p>Crowds are an integral part of Trump's political brand, with the right-wing billionaire seeking to portray himself as an outsider and man of the people.</p>

<p>Even as president, he kept up a steady schedule of election-style rallies, often filling sports arenas with at least 10,000 people.</p>

<p>He had counted on these demonstrations of strength as a key weapon in his plan to make the 81-year-old Biden, whose own public events were generally low-key and relatively small-scale affairs, look ineffectual.</p>

<p>- Trump's strategy upended -</p>

<p>Trump's strategy was upended on July 21, however, when Biden abruptly dropped his reelection bid and endorsed his 59-year-old vice president as the future of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The immediate explosion of Democratic support for Harris appears to have stunned the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the shift in momentum more visible than in Harris's ability to pack arenas.</p>

<p>She is consistently filling venues with well over 10,000 people. On Tuesday night, supporters packed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago while she hosted a mass rally of her own in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>In a clear dig at Trump, her Milwaukee event took place in the same arena that the Republicans had used for their convention back in July.</p>

<p>North Carolina is one of a handful of swing states that are expected to determine the outcome of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>US presidential elections are not decided by an overall national vote but state-by-state, with each state worth varying amounts of Electoral College votes. The winning candidate needs to win a majority of the Electoral College.</p>

<p>Most states trend solidly Republican or firmly Democrat, and only around seven are considered true toss-ups where the race is really fought -- and where the candidates spend most of their campaigning time and money.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 Democratic National Convention continues today with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the running mate of Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris delivering the keynote address. As the convention enters its third day, anticipation is high for Walz's speech.</p>

<p>In addition to Walz, prominent figures such as former President Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also spoke at the convention. Wednesday's theme is "A Fight for Our Freedoms," where Democrats will emphasise the importance of Harris as a defender of American freedoms and argue that former President Donald Trump poses a significant threat to the nation.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama captivated the audience with their powerful speeches, receiving standing ovations. In his remarks, Obama criticised Trump, stating that the US cannot afford another four years of chaos.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's recent financial disclosures reveal over $1 million in cryptocurrency holdings and $300,000 earned from endorsing "The Greenwood Bible."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump's latest financial disclosure documents show he owns more than $1 million (Rs 8,39,68500) in cryptocurrency and made $300,000 (Rs 2,51,90550) from endorsing branded Bibles.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/read-donald-trump-financial-disclosure-forms/index.html">documents released</a> on Thursday, Trump earned $300,000 in royalty payments for "The Greenwood Bible." <em>"The Greenwood Bible"</em> is officially titled <em>"God Bless the USA Bible."</em> Its name comes from the GOP-favourite Lee Greenwood song.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://godblesstheusabible.com/">branded Bible's website</a>, it sells for $59.99 and includes a handwritten chorus to the song "God Bless the USA." by country singer Lee Greenwood. A limited-edition copy that is said to bear Trump's signature is also available on the website for $1,000.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/financial-disclosure-trump-2024/index.html"><em>CNN,</em></a> the disclosure, which totalled more than 250 pages, offers a window into the president's extensive finances, including everything from his real estate business to his investments, income, and debts. The release from the Federal Election Commission marks the first public update of his finances in a year.</p>

<p>The documents are a reminder of Trump's business interests all across the globe, including dozens of registered trademarks in China as well as ones in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ukraine, and Israel, among many others. It also reveals tidbits about how the president keeps his fortune, from millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency to a six-figure investment in gold bars.</p>

<p>Recently, Elon Musk hosted a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823430600872878321">2-hour unscripted interview</a> with Donald Trump, attracting over 1.3 million live views on X.</p>

<p>They discussed immigration, the US economy, and Biden's administration. Reactions were mixed, and the interview's impact on Trump's campaign remains uncertain, with Kamala Harris currently leading in the polls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has said that Kamla Harris will be a terrible president, launching a fresh attack on the vice president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president," he said further, attacking Harris in a fresh set of remarks.</p>

<p>"And I think it's very important that we win," he continued saying. "And whether the personal attacks are good, bad. She certainly attacks me personally. She actually called me weird."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech giant Google has announced to bring its 'AI Overviews' feature to six new countries, including India.</p>

<p>In India, the company is rolling out the 'AI Overviews' in English and Hindi and are also introducing popular country-first features that were well-received during its Search Labs experiment.</p>

<p>"It will help you easily switch between English and Hindi results with the language toggle button, and listen to responses with Text-To-Speech by tapping the 'Listen' button," the company said in a blog post.</p>

<p>The six new countries are India, United Kingdom, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil, along with local language support in each country.</p>

<p>Hema Budaraju, Senior Director, Product Management, Search, said as part of the testing, "we've seen that Indian users listen to AI Overviews responses more often than other countries".</p>

<p>"We're introducing more ways to check out relevant websites while you search, with a new right-hand link display for AI Overviews on desktop - also accessible on mobile by tapping the site icons on the upper right," Budaraju mentioned.</p>

<p>People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews. Google found that people prefer using Search with AI Overviews, and they find their search results more helpful.</p>

<p>"As we evolve the Search experience with AI Overviews, we remain focused on helping people access information and perspectives from a diverse range of sources," said Budaraju.</p>

<p>And when people click from search result pages with AI Overviews, these clicks are higher quality for websites - meaning users are more likely to spend more time on the sites they visit.</p>

<p>"Our continued focus on improving and growing Search also allows us to send more qualified traffic to the web," said Google.</p>

<p>The company is also testing the addition of links to relevant web pages directly within the text of AI Overviews (in addition to the prominent links it already shows), making it even easier for people to click out and visit sites that interest them.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few short weeks ago, Joe Biden was set to headline the Democratic National Convention -- but after a brutal political comedown, he's now the warm-up act for Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>For a proud man like the 81-year-old US president, his speech on the first day of the party's gathering in Chicago on Monday is sure to come with conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>Still harboring frustration over his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-quits-us-presidential-race-full-text-of-announcement-6156766" target="_blank">exit from the White House</a> race, Biden will be trying to balance his feelings with the need to help his vice president beat Republican Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p>With Harris set to formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, Biden's appearance was going to be like "opening for Taylor Swift," said Brookings Institution senior fellow William Galston.</p>

<p>"This will not be an easy speech," Galston told AFP.</p>

<p>But like all US presidents, Biden has an eye on the history books, and he'll know that the surest way to secure his legacy now runs through Harris.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he understands that the chances that his presidency will be regarded as successful go way up if Kamala Harris succeeds him," said Galston.</p>

<h3><strong>The worst night&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has wasted no time in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-mock-bidens-old-age-ahead-of-his-own-78th-birthday-5887446" target="_blank">mocking</a> the fact that his former opponent no longer has top billing.</p>

<p>"Monday, that's the worst day," Trump told a rally on Wednesday. "They're not even giving him a good spot to speak."</p>

<p>The former president also accused Harris of "trying to throw him (Biden) overboard."</p>

<p>Biden has deliberately taken a back seat to Harris since his stunning July 21 decision to bow out of the race following a catastrophic debate against Trump.</p>

<p>As Harris reenergizes the Democratic Party, Biden has spent long spells at his Delaware holiday home, where he was spotted cycling and relaxing on the beach with his family this past weekend.</p>

<p>And at times he has made light about the sudden end of his five-decade political career.</p>

<p>"I invited you to the White House because I'm looking for a job," Biden joked with influencers at an event on Wednesday.</p>

<p>But there have been flashes of frustration too.</p>

<p>Biden is reportedly angry at former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's role in pushing him out, and disappointed that former president Barack Obama didn't do more to support him.</p>

<p>Acknowledging that Congressional Democrats feared Biden would harm their own electoral chances in November, Biden told CBS on Sunday that "I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic."</p>

<p>"You'd be interviewing me about 'why did Nancy Pelosi say...' 'why did so-and-so...' -- and I thought it'd be a real distraction."</p>

<h3><strong>At peace</strong></h3>

<p>Biden is expected to head off on holiday straight after his convention speech, sparing him the sight of thousands of delegates cheering the newly anointed Harris as the balloons fall.</p>

<p>Despite all that, Biden will still be welcomed by the party in Chicago. He will have a crucial role in pursuing the goal that he says was at the heart of his decision -- beating Trump.</p>

<p>"With some reflection, particularly if they win, he could come to a really comfortable position with his legacy and his decision," Casey Burgat of George Washington University told AFP.</p>

<p>His challenge will now be to give a speech that helps Harris, without burdening her with too much of his own administration's baggage.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old vice president is keen to blaze her own path, particularly on the issue of the economy, one of the areas that hit Biden's popularity hardest.</p>

<p>For Biden, it will be more of a valedictory turn.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll see a Biden who is closer to being at peace with all of this than we might imagine," said Galston.</p>

<p>Biden is also expected to emphasize the idea of moving to a new generation -- especially since it is Republicans, with the 78-year-old Trump, who now have the oldest candidate in US history.</p>

<p>With Harris having wiped out Trump's lead in the polls, Democrats already view Biden more favorably than when he was their standard-bearer.</p>

<p>"He can expect a much warmer reception than if he'd stayed on, frankly," said Galston.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the early 1980s, and the Soviet Union had already invaded Afghanistan. The Cold War was at its peak. The Soviet Union and the United States worked on secret missions and operations to undermine each other. According to the CIA, spies working for Moscow had illegally acquired Western technology worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the late 1970s.<br />
<br />
But little did the leader of the Communist bloc know that the same process of acquisition of US technology would result in the delivery of sabotaged US high-tech. How did that happen, you ask? Let's find out. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
An FBI agent, who once saw an Austrian entrepreneur entering San Francisco's Soviet Consulate, had another chance encounter with the same man, this time at a bar. The agent, Rick Smith, and the man, whose name remains a mystery, would plant what remains a major counterintelligence campaign of the era, according to a report in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/08/04/us-spies-soviet-technology-00164126">Politico Magazine.</a><br />
<br />
The Austrian man was already actively exporting American goods to European nations. The FBI believed the Soviet Union was always desperately looking for the latest and cutting-edge American technology. And that's how they dealt a major blow to their Communist opponents.<br />
<br />
As part of Operation Intering, the FBI and the Austrian "would seed faulty tech to Moscow and its allies", draining the Soviet Bloc's coffers. And it wasn't limited to just that. The operation would also expose Moscow's intelligence officers and people who conspired against America.<br />
<br />
It was all executed from the Austrian capital Vienna, believed to be a neutral ground for both Communist and Western officials to operate from. The Austrian sought and got an appointment with the Soviet Embassy where he was to pitch Moscow cutting-edge Silicon Valley microelectronics and computer technology.<br />
<br />
Initially, Moscow spies expressed some interest, "but they wanted classified information, basically," Smith said. However, the Communists directed the Austrian man to their allies -- the Bulgarians, and their East German and Russian allies, who were to get that forbidden tech. But not before the FBI tampered with it.<br />
<br />
While some tech was altered before Bulgarians received it, some were left completely unusable. However, to ensure the operation's longevity and avoid suspicion, some of the technology was delivered unadulterated.<br />
<br />
The FBI would also tamper with the electronics, which then experienced "chance" voltage overloads once plugged in by the Soviets. Apart from that some of the machines and parts were fiddled with such that they would degrade over time.<br />
<br />
The Soviet Bloc unknowingly purchased sabotaged US goods to the tune of millions of dollars. The Communist spies, who had no idea they were being played, were lauded for their "success in purchasing this forbidden technology from the West".<br />
<br />
However, it was only a matter of time before the Austrian's cover was blown, and then the Americans couldn't risk using him as an agent anymore. &nbsp;“He did all this for the sheer fun of doing it,” said Bill Kinane, a retired longtime San Francisco-based FBI counterintelligence agent who helped supervise the Intering operation. “And, like most Austrians, he hated the Russians.”<br />
<br />
After the Cold War, the Austrian reportedly moved back to Europe and amassed a huge fortune there in real estate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many parents <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/parenting-digital-age">are worried</a> about their children using social media. But these concerns tend to focus on privacy, exposure to explicit material or contact with strangers.</p>

<p>As researchers looking at <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2023.2292622?src=exp-tr">sexism and misogyny in Australian schools</a> and the influence of social media, we think it is also important for parents to understand how algorithms work.</p>

<p>These can drive misogynistic content towards boys and young men and make extreme views seem normal.</p>

<h2>What does research say about social media?</h2>

<p>Researchers are increasingly studying how social media <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/232380/1/ZORA_4062.pdf">can amplify social and political divisions</a>. It is also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343248/">showing how</a> these platforms spread prejudice, hate speech and misinformation.</p>

<p>At the same time, researchers are <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/masculinity-and-womens-equality-study-finds-emerging-gender-divide-in-young-peoples-attitudes">identifying a growing divide</a> between young men and women in their attitudes towards gender equality.</p>

<p>Our own <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2023.2292622?src=exp-tr">research</a> has found a disturbing increase in sexism, sexual harassment and misogyny in Australian schools. This includes examples of boys physically intimidating women teachers in schools, gaslighting them, saying they are “hysterical”, describing gender inequality issues as “myths”, and saying things like “Miss, your boobs look really big today”.</p>

<p>Similar examples emerged from <a href="https://theconversation.com/make-me-a-sandwich-our-surveys-disturbing-picture-of-how-some-boys-treat-their-teachers-228891">other Australian research</a> this year.</p>

<p>Our research, done via interviews with Australian teachers, suggests these views are influenced by the rise of figures from the “manosphere” (a collection of extreme men's communities that are anti-women) on social media.</p>

<h2>How do algorithms work?</h2>

<p>How are boys and young men coming into contact with this content? Algorithms play a <a href="https://theconversation.com/teens-see-social-media-algorithms-as-accurate-reflections-of-themselves-study-finds-226302#:%7E:text=In%20our%20qualitative%20interview%20study,seeing%20that%20social%20media%20reflection.">huge role</a> in what we all see online.</p>

<p>Algorithms are set up by human coders, but once operational they are automated pathways that direct content to social media users. They are optimised to get us to click, like, share and view content and keep coming back. This is the key commercial goal of the so-called “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtsteinhorst/2024/02/06/lost-in-the-scroll-the-hidden-impact-of-the-attention-economy/">attention economy</a>”. The longer algorithms hold our attention, the more profit they generate for social media companies like Meta.</p>

<p>So, as a social media user demonstrates increasing interest in specific content or activities, they receive more of it.</p>

<h2>Boys are ‘fed' misogyny online</h2>

<p>Recent studies have shown us how boys and young men are being fed misogynistic content.</p>

<p>A 2022 <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/algorithms-as-a-weapon-against-women-how-youtube-lures-boys-and-young-men-into-the-manosphere/">Australian study</a> set up ten experimental YouTube accounts. These included profiles of four boys under 18, four young men over 18 and two blank control accounts.</p>

<p>It showed boys and young men were lured to the manosphere through “recommended video” features that pop up. On YouTube shorts (which feature shorter videos) this phenomenon was worse. The study found the algorithm was seen to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>optimise more aggressively in response to user behaviour and show more extreme videos within a relatively brief time frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A 2024 <a href="https://antibullyingcentre.ie/recommending-toxicity-how-tiktok-and-youtube-shorts-are-bombarding-boys-and-men-with-misogynist-content/">Irish study</a> made similar findings.</p>

<p>Researchers created ten fake profiles for TikTok and YouTube shorts on ten blank smartphones. On the two different platforms, the researchers created accounts for a 16- and 18-year-old boy who sought content typically associated with masculine gender norms for their age (such as the gym, sport and video games), a 16- and 18- year-old boy who sought manosphere content, and one blank control account.</p>

<p>Misogynist manosphere content was sent to users regardless of whether those accounts actively searched for it. This was especially the case for the profiles set up as teenage boys seeking out content typically associated with masculine gender norms.

<figcaption><span class="caption">Research has shown how algorithms drive misogynistic content towards young men, whether they seek it or not.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-black-and-red-pullover-hoodie-eNyXK17so6A">Ben den Engelsen/Unsplash</a>, <a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></span></figcaption>

<h2>How does misogynist content radicalise boys?</h2>

<p>We believe what is occurring is very serious. In our research we use the term “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09540253.2023.2292622">misogynist radicalisation</a>” to describe what is happening to some boys and young men.</p>

<p>This phrase was selected to capture a stark and sudden shift in boys' attitudes and behaviour towards women and girls in Australian schools, which teachers report occurred at the return from lockdown and remote schooling.</p>

<p>Although “radicalisation” is typically used to refer to the process of being recruited to religious or political terrorist ideology, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1057610X.2024.2318813">research</a> has identified misogyny as a feature of right-wing terrorism.</p>

<p>At the same time, the “<a href="https://theconversation.com/incel-violence-is-a-form-of-extremism-its-time-we-treated-it-as-a-security-threat-138536">incel</a>” (or involuntary celibate) community is also being seen as a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546553.2023.2296515">possible terrorist threat</a>. Incels, who are mostly men and boys, blame and resent women for their own inability to find a sexual partner.</p>

<p>We also know <a href="https://theconversation.com/stopping-violence-against-women-starts-with-learning-what-misogyny-really-is-175411">misogyny</a> perpetuates gender inequity and biases that underpin violence against women.</p>

<p>While we are not suggesting boys and young people who are influenced by extremist misogynist ideology will all become violent or <a href="https://spir.aoir.org/ojs/index.php/spir/article/view/12174">recruited to other extremist groups</a>, it is important to consider misogyny as both a form of extremism and as an ideology.</p>

<p>Research <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/womens-aid-publishes-groundbreaking-research-looking-at-what-influences-children-and-young-peoples-understanding-of-domestic-abuse/">shows</a> young people who view misogynist content are likely to harbour unhealthy views on relationships. A 2024 UK <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051241228811">study on teenagers</a> also found “manfluencer” Andrew Tate's content is emotionally engaging for boys and young men. It encourages feelings of fear and anger as well as belief in myths about gender equity.</p>

<h2>What can parents of boys do?</h2>

<p>An outright ban for young people is not necessarily the right step to take (even if <a href="https://theconversation.com/tech-solutions-to-limit-kids-access-to-social-media-are-fraught-with-problems-including-privacy-risks-231696">such a ban could work</a>). Research <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/being-a-young-man-online">tells us</a> social media is an important space for young men to explore their identities, interests and establish connections with others.</p>

<p>So we need education both for parents and young people about how algorithms shape the feeds of young people's social media accounts, and how this content can <a href="https://lens.monash.edu/@education/2024/04/29/1386672/post-truth-politics-and-manosphere-extremists-in-australian-schools">deliberately</a> exploit their emotions and beliefs.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/parents/issues-and-advice/hard-to-have-conversations">key thing</a> parents can do is initiate open, respectful conversations with their children about what they are viewing online.</p>

<p>These conversations should be free of judgement or reprimand and allow children to describe what they are seeing and why it might interest them. Open-ended questions that encourage your children to express their views are a good place to start. For example, “Can you tell me a little about about X? What's interesting about their content?”</p>

<p>Judgement-free conversations are important so young people don't fear bringing up difficult experiences. If you are going to be critical of something, try and do this together, with children contributing to explanations of whether specific content can be harmful and to whom.</p>

<p>You can also talk about the implications of “<a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-facebook-has-become-the-worlds-largest-echo-chamber-91024">echo chambers</a>” and how these are generated by algorithms. Some examples might include: “Do you notice you're seeing a lot of content by one particular creator? Or on one particular topic?” or “How does the content you are seeing make you feel?”.</p>

<p>There are also lots of useful organisations providing specific advice for parents around <a href="https://www.childnet.com/blog/algorithms/">algorithms</a> and <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/parents/issues-and-advice/online-safety-basics">general safety</a> online.</p>

<h2>Watch and listen</h2>

<p>Also, be on the look out for any changes in a child's behaviour and attitudes towards women and girls.</p>

<p>Are there certain terms they are using that did not before? How do they react if certain figures in the news or popular culture come up in conversations? How are they relating to women and girls in their family and social circles? Do you find them expressing opinions that are not aligned with your family values?</p>

<p>If teachers approach you about problems with your child's behaviour at school towards women and girls, try to be open to the conversation (rather than dismiss it as impossible). It is likely what parents see and hear is different to school and online contexts. Indeed, some teachers in our <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220620.2024.2316620?src=recsys">study</a> reported boys expressed different versions of themselves and different views, depending on the audience.</p>

<p>If you do notice your child is expressing some concerning views, as well as initiating an open, calm discussion with them, we recommend contacting your child's teachers or school wellbeing team. You can also seek support and advice from the <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/parents">eSafety Commissioner</a>.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the World Health Organization on Thursday called for increased production of cholera vaccines, highlighting what he called a "critical shortage" around the globe.</p>

<p>The UN health agency said 307,433 cases of cholera and 2,326 deaths have been reported in 26 countries up to July 28.</p>

<p>"The response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of the vaccine, as demand continues to outpace supply," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since the beginning of the year, over 300,000 people have gotten sick with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cholera?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cholera</a> and over 2300 died from it.<br />
<br />
The response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of the vaccine, as demand continues to outpace supply, with 105 million doses requested by 18 countries… <a href="https://t.co/RknHN8ih8D">pic.twitter.com/RknHN8ih8D</a></p>
— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1824100143081071040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Some 105 million doses have been requested by 18 countries since January 2023 -- but only 55 million doses have been produced in the same period, Tedros added.</p>

<p>In a fresh situation update, the WHO said that between January and May 2024, the oral cholera vaccine stockpile "was entirely depleted".</p>

<p>Tedros urged "further investment in scaling up vaccine production", and called on all countries to spend more on "water and sanitation, and emergency preparedness to prevent further outbreaks".</p>

<p>The eastern Mediterranean region, Africa and Southeast Asia have recorded the highest numbers of cases, said the WHO, which considers the global risk from cholera to be "very high" due to the growing number of cases and the shortage of vaccines.</p>

<p>The WHO says that after decades of progress against cholera, cases have been on the rise again since 2021, including in countries that had not seen the disease in years.</p>

<p>The cases registered so far should be interpreted cautiously due to potential reporting delays, the WHO said.</p>

<p>The disease, which causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting and muscle cramps, generally arises from eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with the bacterium, according to the WHO.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turning heads as they cruise past office buildings and malls, driverless taxis are slowly spreading through Chinese cities, prompting both wariness and wonder.</p>

<p>China's tech companies and automakers have poured billions of dollars into self-driving technology in recent years in an effort to catch industry leaders in the United States.</p>

<p>Now the central city of Wuhan boasts one of the world's largest networks of self-driving cars, home to a fleet of over 500 taxis that can be hailed on an app just like regular rides.</p>

<p>At one intersection in an industrial area of Wuhan, AFP reporters saw at least five robotaxis passing each other as they navigated regular traffic.</p>

<p>"It looks kind of magical, like a sci-fi movie," a local surnamed Yang told AFP.</p>

<p>But not everyone shares Yang's awe.</p>

<p>Debates around safety was sparked in April when a Huawei-backed Aito car was involved in a fatal accident, with the company saying its automatic braking system failed.</p>

<p>A minor collision between a jaywalker and a Wuhan robotaxi last month re-ignited concerns.</p>

<p>Taxi drivers and workers in traditional ride-hailing companies have also raised fears of being replaced by artificial intelligence -- although the technology is far from fully developed.</p>

<h3><strong>Five to 500</strong></h3>

<p>Wuhan's driverless cabs are part of tech giant Baidu's Apollo Go project, which first received licences to operate in the city in 2022.</p>

<p>Initially, only five robocars ferried passengers around 13 square kilometres (five square miles) of the city of around 14 million.</p>

<p>Baidu says the taxis now operate in a 3,000 square kilometre patch -- more than a third of the total land area of Wuhan, including a small part of the city centre.</p>

<p>In comparison, US leader Waymo says the largest area it covers is 816 square kilometres, in Arizona.</p>

<p>When a car reaches its pickup point, riders scan a QR code with their phones to unlock the vehicle -- with the front seats blocked off over safety concerns.</p>

<p>The fares are currently heavily discounted, with a thirty-minute ride taken by AFP costing just 39 yuan ($5.43) compared with 64 yuan in a normal taxi.</p>

<p>"They are stealing our rice bowls, so of course we don't like them," Wuhan taxi driver Deng Haibing told AFP, using a popular Chinese term for livelihoods.</p>

<p>Deng said he fears robotaxi companies will push traditional drivers out of business with subsidised fares, before raising prices once they achieve domination -- similar to the strategy employed by ride-hailing apps in the 2010s.</p>

<p>"Currently the impact isn't too big because robotaxis aren't fully popularised and can't drive everywhere yet," Deng said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Simply not ready'</strong></h3>

<p>The robotaxi fleet is a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of taxis and ride-hailing cars in Wuhan.</p>

<p>More and more Chinese cities are rolling out policies to promote self-driving services though, as part of a national push for tech supremacy.</p>

<p>Baidu and domestic rival Pony.ai have for years tested models of varying autonomy levels in industrial parks around the country.</p>

<p>Shanghai issued its first batch of provisional permits for fully driverless cars last month, and the capital Beijing has approved fully autonomous robotaxis in suburban areas.</p>

<p>The southwest city of Chongqing and the southern tech hub of Shenzhen also have pilot projects underway.</p>

<p>Technology-wise, there's still a long way to go before self-driving taxis become ubiquitous though, according to Tom Nunlist, tech policy analyst at Trivium China.</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to think autonomous driving is inevitable at this point, and frankly, I don't know that it is," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"Presently fully autonomous driving tech is simply not ready for large-scale deployment," he said.</p>

<p>Even in Wuhan's Apollo Go taxis -- which can spot obstacles and wait scrupulously at intersections -- ultimate responsibility for safety still lies with human officers monitoring rides remotely.</p>

<p>During one ride in an Apollo Go car, one manipulated the car's built-in touchscreen to remind AFP reporters to put on their seatbelts.</p>

<p>"Safety personnel provide strong assurances for your ride via remote 5G assistance technology," the Apollo Go app tells users.</p>

<p>Robotaxis are also far from able to replicate the human touch.</p>

<p>"Some customers have disabilities and (driverless cars) definitely wouldn't be able to help them, and some passengers are carrying large items," ride-hailing driver Zhao told AFP.</p>

<p>"Only a human can help."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week marked 75 years since the adoption of the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/geneva-conventions-1949-additional-protocols#:%7E:text=The%20Convention%20adopted%20in%201949%20takes%20account%20of,War%20II.%20It%20is%20composed%20of%20159%20articles.">Geneva Conventions</a> on August 12 1949. In theory, these rules of war are universally agreed by every nation. In practice, they are routinely violated everywhere.</p>

<p>With an estimated <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/how-term-armed-conflict-defined-international-humanitarian-law">120 armed conflicts worldwide</a>, more than 450 armed groups and 195 million people <a href="https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2023/10/ICRC-engagement-with-armed-groups-in-2023-Humanitarian-Law-Policy-Blog.pdfwith-armed-groups-in-2023-Humanitarian-Law-Policy-Blog.pdf">living in areas under their control</a>, the protection of the vulnerable is as vitally important as ever.</p>

<p>As the news headlines remind us daily, however, international humanitarian law can seem like too little, too late when faced with military might and political indifference.</p>

<p>This year also marks other, less hopeful, anniversaries: ten years since the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/08/ten-years-after-yazidi-genocide-un-syria-commission-inquiry-calls-justice">genocide against the Yazidi</a> by ISIS in Syria, and ten years of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-maidan-square.html">war in Ukraine</a>. Geopolitical tensions are escalating in the Middle East and the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Given the modern technologies used on today's battlefields (and in cyberspace), and the violation of even basic humanitarian protections, is there much to celebrate in 2024? Are the Geneva Conventions <a href="https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2024/08/08/wars-long-legacy-the-continued-importance-of-the-geneva-conventions-75-years-later/">still fit for purpose</a> for today's wars – and tomorrow's?</p>

<h2>Humanitarian values</h2>

<p>All societies have cultural, religious or legal rules of some kind around war. But in the aftermath of World War II's extreme horrors, the world agreed to a detailed set of codified rules governing armed conflict.</p>

<p>Despite differing political views and experiences of war, countries agreed to the Geneva Convention rules by striking a balance between military need and humanitarian ideals for the treatment of civilians, captured enemy soldiers and the dead.</p>

<p>The 1949 Conventions remain the core of international humanitarian law, or the laws of armed conflict. This body of law has been expanded over the years by other treaties and protocols dealing with civil war, chemical weapons, antipersonnel landmines, torture and enforced disappearances.</p>

<p>Designed to help prevent a spiral of tit-for-tat atrocities, many of the rules work due to reciprocal respect between combatants: treat our soldiers well when captured and we will do likewise.</p>

<p>But they also demand the humane treatment of people caught up in war, even if one warring party has breached those rules or started the war in violation of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter">United Nations Charter</a> that prohibits aggression.</p>

<h2>Four conventions, 400 articles</h2>

<p>The Geneva Conventions include more than 400 articles, setting out detailed rules for the treatment of prisoners, protecting hospitals and medical staff, allowing humanitarian aid, and prohibiting torture, rape and sexual violence.</p>

<p>In fact, four conventions were adopted in 1949. The first three's provisions built on existing laws protecting wounded soldiers on the battlefield, at sea and when captured as prisoners.</p>

<p>The key fourth convention sought to protect civilians living under the power of an adversary, such as in occupied territory.</p>

<p>A single article provided fundamental rules about the humane treatment of people during a civil war – the first time international law had dared to regulate violence occurring within a country rather than between two or more.</p>

<h2>War and peace</h2>

<p>Some say international humanitarian law took the wrong approach back in the 1860s when the very first Geneva Convention was adopted, because it accepted war and <a href="https://criticallegalthinking.com/2022/11/22/a-few-not-too-troublesome-restrictions-humanitarianism-solidarity-anti-militarism-peace/">gave up on insisting on peace</a>.</p>

<p>As the scholar <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/samuel-moyn-humane-interview/">Samuel Moyn has argued</a>, this has forced us to choose between the ideal of opposing war in the first place and opposing the crimes that take place within it.</p>

<p>Humanitarian law also accepts a minimum level of harm to civilians as “collateral damage” during an attack on a military target. In other words, not all civilian deaths are war crimes.</p>

<p>And some articles in the conventions seem old-fashioned today – tobacco is mentioned together with food and water for prisoners of war, for example.</p>

<p>But in my own experience working with the International Committee of the Red Cross, I have seen international humanitarian law in action. When respected, it can save and improve lives.</p>

<h2>Eternal vigilance</h2>

<p>Warring parties everywhere still allow the Red Cross to visit thousands of detained people, and to negotiate about improving their treatment.</p>

<p>Combatants make agreements for prisoner swaps, hostage release, return of the dead, and the provision of medical care to wounded enemy soldiers.</p>

<p>Sometimes, countries investigate war crimes allegations. And the conventions make it possible for warring parties to make other agreements for even greater protections.</p>

<p>And while the Geneva Conventions, and international humanitarian law more generally, are far from perfect, the rules seek a basic limit on the worst humanity has to offer, insisting on some fundamental human dignity.</p>

<p>To ensure they are at least not actively breached, and ideally their protections extended, countries must do three key things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>focus on collective responsibility, comply with the law themselves, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/gaza-war-countries-selling-israel-weapons-are-violating-international-law-legal-expert-227091">ensure respect by others</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>stop using technical legal arguments to legitimise large-scale devastation in ways that ignore <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/97582/war-law/">the fundamental humanitarian purpose</a> of the rules</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>and resist any claim by a nation state that exceptional national security threats (including terrorism, insurgency or new technologies) justify <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/news-release/times-insecurity-and-conflict-states-must-work-together">the rules being abandoned</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>It is precisely in the gravest situations, when politics and other laws have failed to prevent war, that these rules are most needed. Greater respect for them would go a long way to saving lives and preventing the horrors we see in today's conflicts.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Out of over 10,000 Palestinian applications, only 2922 were approved, while nearly 8750 Israeli visas were granted following the October 7 attacks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The air and ground operation has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry. After Palestinian terrorist group Hamas carried out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on October 7, 2023, Israel responded with a devastating military campaign in Gaza.</p>

<p>As a result, the number of Palestinians fleeing to other nations seeking refuge-including Australia-has increased. But there's a sharp difference in Australia when it comes to visa approval statistics; most Palestinian applications are turned down, but a disproportionately high number of Israeli visas are approved.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/majority-of-palestinians-fleeing-gaza-to-australia-have-had-their-visas-refused/news-story/cccaed5acd91f8a5bc83d0a4e54ad2a4"><em>News Corp Australia,</em></a> Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has confirmed that out of the 10,033 applications launched in the past 10 months, 7111 were rejected, while 2922 Palestinians were granted entry into Australia. Out of the 2922 figure, about 1300 refugees have resettled into Australia, who are understood to largely be on short-term visas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 8746 Israeli citizens have been granted visas since the October 7 attacks, with 235 applications rejected.</p>

<p>The report was released concurrently with calls by main opposition leader Peter Dutton to stop the entry of Palestinians from Gaza on the grounds that they were a threat to national security.</p>

<p>"I don't think people should be coming in from that war zone at all at the moment," Dutton said on Wednesday. "It's not prudent to do so, and I think it puts our national security at risk."</p>

<p>His remarks were a reaction to what happened on Tuesday, when Coalition Members of Parliament wrote to Tony Burke, urging him to tighten the process of evaluating visa applications from Gaza to make sure they had no support for Hamas. As it stands, applicants are only rejected if they are found to have given financial or material support to Hamas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From an economic perspective, the concerns around the AI bubble mirror those seen in past tech booms, such as the "dot-com bubble" of the late 1990s.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely regarded as a revolutionary technology, fuelling growth in various sectors and creating a surge in demand for specialised hardware, particularly from companies like Nvidia. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/08/07/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst/">According to <em>Forbes</em></a>, Nvidia's stock price has more than tripled in a year. Other tech giants like Google and Microsoft, invested heavily in AI, have also seen large increases. However, alongside the excitement, concerns have been growing about the sustainability of the AI boom, raising the spectre of a potential bubble bursting.</p>

<h3><strong>The Rise Of Nvidia: From Chipmaker To AI Giant</strong></h3>

<p>Nvidia has become a poster child for the AI boom, primarily due to its dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, which is essential for AI training and inference tasks. The company briefly became the world's most valuable firm in June 2024, dethroning Microsoft, largely due to skyrocketing demand for AI chips. Its market capitalisation hit $3.33 trillion due to the stellar rise in its stock price. Nvidia's GPUs power the development of AI models, enabling breakthroughs in machine learning, natural language processing and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

<p>However, Nvidia's meteoric rise has also led to concerns. Analysts have pointed out that much of Nvidia's value is tied to the belief that AI's economic potential will continue to expand exponentially. Some worry that if this expectation does not materialise, Nvidia's stock could suffer significantly, potentially signalling the burst of the AI bubble.</p>

<h3><strong>Demand And Supply Dynamics</strong></h3>

<p>The demand for AI-related hardware, especially GPUs, has far outstripped supply, with companies across the globe investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Major cloud service providers, often referred to as "hyperscalers", have placed massive orders for Nvidia's GPUs, hoping to bolster their AI capabilities. This rush has created supply chain bottlenecks, leading to rising prices and longer lead times for essential components.</p>

<p>Despite the high demand, some industry insiders are questioning whether this level of investment is sustainable. Hedge fund Elliott Management, for instance, said it was "sceptical" that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker's graphics processing units in such high volumes, and that AI is "overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time", per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/24a12be1-a973-4efe-ab4f-b981aee0cd0b"><em>Financial Times</em> report</a>. The company also pointed out that AI technology consumes significant amounts of power, making some applications prohibitively expensive in the long run.</p>

<h3><strong>Power Requirements And Sustainability Concerns</strong></h3>

<p>Another critical issue is the power consumption associated with AI technologies. Training large AI models requires vast amounts of computational power, which, in turn, demands enormous energy resources. Data centres housing thousands of GPUs have to be cooled and powered continuously, leading to concerns about the environmental impact of AI expansion. Nvidia shipped 100,000 units last year expected to consume 7.3 times of energy annually.</p>

<p>The energy consumption of AI models is becoming a point of contention, as stakeholders weigh the benefits of AI against its sustainability. Some experts believe that as AI technologies mature, they will become more efficient, reducing their environmental footprint. However, others are sceptical, arguing that the demands of AI will only increase as more complex models are developed.</p>

<h3><strong>Economic Theories And The AI Bubble</strong></h3>

<p>From an economic perspective, the concerns around the AI bubble mirror those seen in past tech booms. When demand for a particular technology skyrockets, driven by expectations of future profitability, it often leads to inflated valuations of companies associated with that technology. This dynamic has been observed in other periods of technological euphoria, such as the "dot-com bubble" of the late 1990s.</p>

<p>In the case of AI, many investors are betting heavily on the technology's future potential, often without a clear understanding of how or when these investments will generate returns. The economic principle of supply and demand suggests that if AI cannot meet the lofty expectations set for it, the resulting disappointment could lead to a sharp correction in the market. This is particularly relevant to companies like Nvidia, whose fortunes are closely tied to the success of AI.</p>

<p>Additionally, as more players enter the AI hardware market, competition could increase, leading to lower prices and thinner profit margins. This could further destabilise the market, especially if the anticipated demand for AI technologies does not materialise as expected.</p>

<h3><strong>Is The AI Boom Sustainable?</strong></h3>

<p>The AI industry continues to attract massive investments, and Nvidia's growth has been a significant beneficiary of this trend. However, experts caution that this surge in interest may not be sustainable in the long term. Companies are spending billions on AI research, hardware, and applications, yet the commercial viability of many AI solutions remains uncertain. Furthermore, the power requirements and environmental impact of AI technologies present additional challenges.</p>

<p>For now, AI remains the hottest trend in technology, with Nvidia at the centre of this boom. But as history has shown with previous tech bubbles, rapid growth can sometimes be followed by an equally dramatic collapse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The mpox outbreak in Africa is yet another example of how infectious diseases perceived to be "someone elses problem", and affecting mainly poor, developing countries, may suddenly pose unexpected global threats.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-cdc-declares-mpox-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security-mobilizing-resources-across-the-continent/">mpox outbreak</a> in Africa is yet another example of how infectious diseases perceived to be “someone else's problem”, and affecting mainly poor, developing countries, may suddenly pose unexpected global threats.</p>

<p>Other examples of neglected diseases include the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html">West Nile</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus">Zika</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html#:%7E:text=Key%20points,is%20recommended%20for%20some%20travelers.">Chikungunya</a> viruses.</p>

<p>Mpox was discovered in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635111/">1958</a> (in captive monkeys, hence the original misnomer “monkeypox”) and the first human case was identified in <a href="https://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mpox-FAQ_May_24JW.pdf">1970</a>. Then for decades it was largely neglected by the scientific and public health communities, regarded as an uncommon infection in remote rural areas in tropical Africa without relevance for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>When a massive mpox outbreak hit developed countries in <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/monkeypox-oubreak-2022">2022</a>, increased research funding led to a surge in scientific studies. On just one medical search engine, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Pubmed&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enZA1069ZA1069&amp;oq=Pubmed&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg80gEJMTM2MWowajE1qAIIsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">there's been more research produced</a> since April 2022 than in the preceding 60 years.</p>

<p>The 2022-23 global mpox outbreak happened despite repeated calls from African researchers for increased global investment in diagnostic, therapeutic and infection prevention tools for mpox.</p>

<p>The WHO has now <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern">declared</a> the current upsurge of mpox in central Africa a public health emergency of international concern.</p>

<p>This is the highest alert level for events that constitute a public health risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.</p>

<p>We are infectious disease researchers who have worked on HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.</p>

<p>Mpox's recent history is yet another reminder that an infectious disease in one corner of the world should not be regarded as someone else's problem, as it can suddenly start to spread fast and far.</p>

<p>It also highlights global inequities in resource allocation and access to vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. These were made available in many industrialised countries and helped curb the global outbreak, but are still largely lacking in most of Africa.</p>

<h2>The 2022 outbreak: a total surprise</h2>

<p>The disease has been renamed “mpox” but the name of the virus, for now, remains “monkeypox” (MPXV). It is closely related to the smallpox virus.</p>

<p>MPXV was considered a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10257565/">zoonotic disease</a> endemic in parts of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9643038/">central and west Africa</a>. It was acquired mainly through close contact with wild mammals, especially handling bush meat, but there was no sustained human-to-human transmission.</p>

<p>Only very occasionally were cases seen outside the endemic areas, due to infected travellers or import of infected small mammals.</p>

<p>This changed abruptly in 2022: a massive, rapidly evolving global outbreak caused over <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153141">99,000</a> laboratory-confirmed cases in 116 countries. At its peak in August 2022, over 6,000 cases were reported each week.</p>

<p>This outbreak came as a total surprise: most cases were reported from non-endemic countries, mostly in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9264731/">men who have sex with men</a> who had become infected during recent sexual encounters.</p>

<p>Even though most cases were clinically not particularly severe and the death toll stands at just over <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/158322">200</a>, the global outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 23 July 2022.</p>

<p>Fortunately, case numbers soon plummeted due to a combination of behavioural changes and vaccination in at-risk groups.</p>

<p>Modern vaccines and antiviral drugs with activity against mpox were made available in many affected high-income countries.</p>

<p>These had been developed and stockpiled in the US and Europe, mostly in preparation for a potential bioweapon attack using a poxvirus.</p>

<p>The global outbreak in 2022 was caused by <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(24)00230-3/fulltext">clade II of MPXV</a>, which is endemic in west Africa and not as virulent as <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(24)00230-3/fulltext">clade I MPXV</a>, which so far has only been seen in the Congo Basin.</p>

<p>That first mpox public health emergency of international concern was declared over in May 2023.</p>

<p>Clade II MPXV infections are still occurring globally, but the worst seems over – for now.</p>

<p>Complacency would be misguided, as illustrated by the current mpox outbreak that is gathering steam.</p>

<h2>Upsurge in Africa</h2>

<p>The African region is experiencing an upsurge in mpox cases which started in 2023.</p>

<p>As the continent which includes the areas where mpox has been endemic for a long time, Africa now presents a complex mosaic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cases arising from the endemic, largely zoonotic, pattern that used to be predominant in the past</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cases linked to the 2022 global outbreak, for example in South Africa</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>most worryingly, ever increasing numbers of MPXV clade Ib infections reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>New, more dangerous strain</h2>

<p>The current clade I MPXV (formerly called Congo Basin strain) is more virulent than the clade II (west African) strain, resulting in a higher case fatality rate.</p>

<p>The ongoing outbreak has its epicentre in <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">South Kivu</a> province, eastern DRC, and has the potential to fuel a large pandemic.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>It has a distinct epidemiological pattern with sustained chains of human-to-human transmission, often via the sexual route.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It may have increased transmissibility (we don't know yet).</p>

	<p>The virus which causes it is the newly defined clade Ib lineage. It displays mutations that are the hallmark of human-to-human spread that is estimated to have been happening since September 2023.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Case numbers are rising rapidly, even though many suspected cases are likely not tested and thus not counted as confirmed. Complicating matters, a commonly used test was found to miss infections with this lineage of the virus.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It affects mostly adults.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The case fatality rate is higher than it was in the 2022 global outbreak.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Already, this outbreak has resulted in mpox cases occurring in several neighbouring countries, including some (like Kenya) with no previous record of mpox.</p>

<p>The challenge is enormous. The eastern DRC is an area beset by multiple problems. This <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/disease-outbreaks/outbreaks-and-other-emergencies-updates?page=0">includes</a> natural disasters, violence and infectious diseases including measles, cholera and poliomyelitis for the DRC.</p>

<p>In recent years the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/Ebola-2019-drc-">second-largest Ebola outbreak</a> ever took place in the wider area and, despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, posed considerable challenges.</p>

<h2>What needs to happen</h2>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00187-6/fulltext">article</a> we co-authored in The Lancet Global Health outlines what needs to be done to contain this outbreak and prevent it from turning into an epidemic, possibly even a pandemic.</p>

<p>Equitable access to diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral treatments requires political commitment and financial investments.</p>

<p>Scientific investigations are needed to learn more about exposure settings, transmission routes and clinical presentations.</p>

<p>It's important to find the best ways to make these interventions.</p>

<p>We have proposed the establishment of an African-led, multidisciplinary, multi-country Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa.</p>

<p>It should conduct research towards the elimination of mpox as a public health problem.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a disease in one corner of the world can suddenly become a global heath threat. It's time the global health system woke up to this reality.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>On Friday, Pakistan has confirmed its first <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-in-5-points-monkeypox-virus-infection-symptoms-and-prevention-6339236">monkeypox </a>case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus.</li>
	<li>Health officials have started to identify people who were in close contact with the man, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.</li>
	<li>In Pakistan, 11 cases have been reported since April 2023, with one resulting in death.</li>
	<li>Sweden announced that a person in Stockholm "has been diagnosed with mpox", marking the first case of the deadly strain to be diagnosed outside the African continent.</li>
	<li>WHO has warned more cases of the deadly variant will likely be confirmed in Europe soon, after Sweden.</li>
	<li>The deadly virus, which has killed 548 people since the start of the year in Congo, is a viral disease caused by a virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus.</li>
	<li>The new variant has caused outbreaks in refugee camps in Congo and has spread to Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Kenya.</li>
	<li>South Africa is also experiencing outbreaks but they are linked to a different strain of the virus.</li>
	<li>The virus can be transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</li>
	<li>The disease causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions which can last from 2 to 4 weeks.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/what-is-a-supermoon/">supermoon</a> may sound exciting, but it's a modest coincidence.</p>

<p>As the Moon orbits Earth, its distance from us varies from 357,000 to 407,000 kilometres. When the Moon and the Sun are in almost opposite directions from Earth, we get a full moon. A “supermoon” is a full moon where its position along its orbit is within 10% of its closest approach to Earth. That's it.</p>

<p>This means a supermoon has an apparent diameter that's 14% larger than the smallest possible full moon. That's not a lot. You can't really notice the difference by eye.</p>

<p>As an astronomer, I have a problem with supermoons. There are genuine wonders to see in the night sky, so don't be disappointed by a dull, overhyped supermoon.</p>

<h2>When is the best time to view the Moon?</h2>

<p>Articles hyping supermoons are easy. ChatGPT can do it. Say it's the first supermoon since whenever, add some superlatives, and throw in a telephoto lens photo of a full moon with a landmark. Perhaps the supermoon coincides with another otherwise normal full moon, so it can be a “<a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/">blue supermoon</a>” or a “<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/space-news/super-worm-moon-how-to-see-the-final-full-moon-of-winter/695656">worm supermoon</a>” or whatever.</p>

<p>It's still just a full moon.</p>

<p>If you do want to look at the Moon and it happens to be a supermoon, go for it. But there are better times to admire our only natural satellite, particularly with binoculars or a telescope.</p>

<p>The best time to look at the Moon is when its shadows, as seen from Earth, are longest. These long shadows help the craters and mountains stand out from the surrounding plains, so you can appreciate the dramatic landscape of our neighbouring world.</p>

<p>The shadows are longest when the Moon appears as a half moon in the night sky. During a full moon or a supermoon the shadows are at their shortest – not nearly as impressive.</p>

<p>In fact, astronomers prefer to avoid nights with supermoons and catch up on lost sleep. Full moons flood the night sky with light and make it harder to view more subtle and interesting sights.</p>

<p>Want to look at the grand expanse of the Milky Way with the unaided eye? Want to see a meteor shower, comet or aurora? Best done without a damn supermoon.</p>

<p>It can be fun to see something truly rare or unusual in the sky. But supermoons don't qualify for that either. Using the definition I mentioned earlier, there are typically three or four supermoons each year. More restrictive definitions give us one or two supermoons per year. Not only is that not rare, it still just looks like a full moon.</p>

<p>There are rarer celestial events that really can inspire. Millions of people across the globe saw <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/">bright auroras in May 2024</a>, including places where truly spectacular auroras are few and far between.</p>

<p>Comets can also be wonderful. Every decade or so, a comet swings into the inner Solar System and produces a bright tail, millions of kilometres long and visible from Earth. Back when I was a student, I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hyakutake">Comet Hyakutake's bright blue tail</a> stretch across a huge expanse of sky. Sometimes comets fizzle, but when they're great they are amazing.</p>

<h2>Want something impressive? Try an eclipse</h2>

<p>Auroras and comets can be fickle, but eclipses are predictable and put on a reliable show.</p>

<p>Take total solar eclipses, when the Moon covers the Sun and day turns briefly into night. Thousands travel across the globe to see them. I will be travelling to New South Wales for the <a href="https://eclipse.asa.astronomy.org.au/eclipse-australia-2028/">2028 eclipse</a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For more than a decade, researchers and journalists have relied on a digital tool called CrowdTangle to track and fight the spread of viral falsehoods online.</p>

<p>But earlier this week, the owner of CrowdTangle, Meta, <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/researchtools/other-datasets/crowdtangle/">shut the tool down</a>. The tech giant has replaced it with its new Content Library, which it says will serve the same purpose and be “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/new-tools-to-support-independent-research/">more user friendly</a>”.</p>

<p>As long-time users of CrowdTangle to track and analyse online misinformation campaigns, we are sceptical of this claim. We are also very concerned by the fact CrowdTangle's closure comes at a time when misinformation on social media is rife – and is bound to worsen in the lead up to the November presidential election in the United States.</p>

<p>So, why did Meta decide to close CrowdTangle now? And how will this affect the fight against the spread of misinformation and disinformation online?</p>

<h2>CrowdTangle: a tried and trusted tool</h2>

<p>Founded in 2011, CrowdTangle quickly gained popularity among media outlets which used it to track and analyse trending topics and articles on social media platforms for commercial purposes. Facebook (as Meta was then called) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle">purchased the company five years later</a>.</p>

<p>There were several reasons why CrowdTangle was a powerful tool for researchers like us who study the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. Firstly, we could download large datasets to use for computational modelling and other forms of analysis. The data was also easily searchable using keywords.</p>

<p>We could also use CrowdTangle to automatically analyse trends in large collections of data from multiple sources.</p>

<p>These features helped us <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19312">analyse the influence of far-right accounts</a> on Facebook during the COVID pandemic. They also helped us analyse the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of Meta's content moderation policies in <a href="https://theconversation.com/conspiracy-theorist-tactics-show-its-too-easy-to-get-around-facebooks-content-policies-226118">curbing the spread of vaccine misinformation</a>.</p>

<p>But CrowdTangle was not a vital tool only for researchers like us.</p>

<p>Journalists at the New York Times used it to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html">expose the influence of far-right accounts in the US</a>. Their peers at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation also used it to monitor <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-08-24/how-the-qanon-conspiracy-theory-is-affecting-australian-families/12564566">QAnon's growing influence during the pandemic</a>, and to track <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-14/meta-shuts-crowdtangle-as-disinformation-ai-runs-rampant/104214782">disinformation fuelling the recent race riots</a> in the United Kingdom.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AFMHi0EJutQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe></figure>

<h2>Why is Meta closing CrowdTangle?</h2>

<p>Given researchers and journalists used CrowdTangle to expose some of Meta's failings to the world, it's somewhat unsurprising the company would question why it was funding this largely free service. Keeping it operational, logic would dictate, would be bad for business.</p>

<p>But the reasons behind the closure of CrowdTangle are also more complicated.</p>

<p>One of the co-founders of the company, Brandon Silverman, told Wired the closure was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-kills-crucial-transparency-tool-worst-possible-time/">likely part of Meta's broader withdrawal</a> from the news business.</p>

<p>This withdrawal started in 2016 when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-users-profit">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> revealed news was bad for Meta's core business: selling ads.</p>

<p>While news might generate strong engagement on Meta's platforms, it is the wrong kind of engagement for advertisers. X (formerly Twitter) also recently discovered this, when technology giant IBM pulled its advertising from the platform after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67446797">its ads were placed next to posts by Nazis</a>.</p>

<p>Meta's policies aimed at reducing exposure to news content across its platforms make explicit its withdrawal from the news business.</p>

<p>In February, <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-approach-to-political-content-on-instagram-and-threads/">the company announced</a> it would stop “proactively recommending political content from accounts you don't follow” on Instagram. It also started <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-political-content/">de-ranking</a> political content on Facebook.</p>

<p>These announcements followed Meta's decision to pull out of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/02/update-on-facebook-news-us-australia/">stop paying for news content</a>.</p>

<p>However, while this redirection away from news may be commercially motivated, it is also about the particular news and information that spreads on Meta's products (for example, far-right influencers outperforming legacy news).</p>

<p>This brings Meta into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/25/how-the-eu-digital-services-act-affects-facebook-google-and-others">cross-hairs of international regulators</a> and threatens its ability to operate in key markets.</p>

<h2>An inferior new tool</h2>

<p>Meta has replaced CrowdTangle with its Content Library, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/new-tools-to-support-independent-research/">which it claims</a> will “provide researchers access to more publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram”. The new tool <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/meta-is-getting-rid-of-crowdtangle.php">will allow access to comments and short-form video</a>, which CrowdTangle did not.</p>

<p>But the new tool has major limitations.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the Coalition for Independent Technology Research published <a href="https://independenttechresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CrowdTangle-Survey-Report-Final.pdf">results of a survey</a> with 400 independent researchers and 50 research organisations. They indicated Meta's Content Library has reduced functionality, including an inability to export data and use external tools to analyse it. It also has reduced access to posts from public figures without a large number of followers.</p>

<p>Combined, these factors will greatly hinder research.</p>

<p>But the biggest issue with Meta's new Content Library is that it won't be freely available to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-to-replace-widely-used-data-tooland-largely-cut-off-reporter-access-43fc3f9d">journalists and newsrooms</a>.</p>

<p>The exact reasons for this are unclear. What is clear, however, are the implications of this reduced access.</p>

<p>Mozilla, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to making the internet free and open for all, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/open-letter-to-meta-support-crowdtangle-through-2024-and-maintain-crowdtangle-approach/">said in an open letter to Meta</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meta's decision will effectively prohibit the outside world, including election integrity experts, from seeing what's happening on Facebook and Instagram — during the biggest election year on record. This means almost all outside efforts to identify and prevent political disinformation, incitements to violence, and online harassment of women and minorities will be silenced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been countless research reports, news articles, inquiries and lawsuits regarding misuse of Meta's platforms.</p>

<p>Yet it seems the only lesson the company has learned is to be selective about which data it makes transparent – and to whom.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won the gold medal in boxing at the Paris Olympics, said that questions about her gender affected and hurt her a lot. From former US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk to British author JK Rowling and scores of others on social media targeted Ms Khelif following her first-round bout against Italy's Angela Carini that lasted 46 seconds.</p>

<p>“This thing that affected me, I'm not lying to you, it affected me,” Ms Khelif said in an interview with El Birad in Algeria. A translated video of the interview was posted on X by journalist Salaiman Ahmed.</p>

<p>"It affected me a lot, it hurt me a lot. I can't describe to you the amount of fear I had," Ms Khelif said.</p>

<p>She wondered why there was an uproar from big politicians around the world. "I was afraid, but thank God, I managed to overcome this phase, thanks to the specialists who helped me overcome this stage," she added.</p>

<p>“The scenario was very scary. Thank God, all the people of Algeria and the Arab world knew Imane Ms Khelif with her femininity, her courage, her will,” Ms Khelif said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Khelif's reaction came after Donald Trump repeatedly referred to her as a man during a campaign rally in Montana on August 9.</p>

<p>“Who wants men to participate in women's sports? I would like to congratulate the young woman who transitioned from a man into a boxer. He... She won the gold medal," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk, who has thrown his weight behind Trump for the November 5 Presidential polls, also took potshots at the Algerian boxer by indirectly referring to her as a man in a series of social media posts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imane Khelif along with Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan was&nbsp;subjected&nbsp;to trolling and intense criticism after it surfaced that the boxers were disqualified during the 2023 IBA World Boxing Championships for failing gender eligibility tests.</p>

<p>Ms Khelif, who defeated China's Yang Liu in the Paris Olympics 2024 for gold, has also filed a cyberbullying lawsuit naming Elon Musk and Harry Potter author J K Rowling over alleged "acts of aggravated cyber harassment", according to <a href="http://https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jk-rowling-elon-musk-imane-khelif-lawsuit-1236105185/">Variety.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit has been filed against X in France.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan has confirmed its first monkeypox case of the year after a man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, ARY News reported citing the Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old male resident of Mardan arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and developed symptoms shortly after arriving in Peshawar and reached out to the hospital for testing.</p>

<p>The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, as per ARY News.</p>

<p>His positive diagnosis was confirmed on August 13, marking the first reported case of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.</p>

<p>Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport.</p>

<p>The Director General Health told the media that all three passengers were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers have been admitted to the infectious disease hospital.</p>

<p>Monkeypox remains a significant global health issue, with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting 99,518 cases and 208 deaths across 122 countries.</p>

<p>According to ARY News, the virus, which spreads through close contact, presents with symptoms such as fever, rash, and body aches, typically lasting 2 to 4 weeks. Despite the spread, the WHO notes that 99 per cent of those infected survive.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, 11 cases have been reported since April 2023, with one resulting in death.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Health has issued an advisory outlining guidelines for managing and preventing the spread of monkeypox, urging continued vigilance and public health monitoring.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan, 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.</p>

<p>"I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier," Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.</p>

<p>"But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible."</p>

<p>Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity.</p>

<p>The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.</p>

<p>Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.</p>

<p>"This has led to a new trend of 'monsoon brides'," said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.</p>

<p>"Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money."</p>

<p>Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.</p>

<p>In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.</p>

<p>"Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area," said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.</p>

<p>"They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done".</p>

<p>Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.</p>

<p>Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.</p>

<h2>'I thought I would get lipstick'</h2>

<p>Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.</p>

<p>"My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now," she said.</p>

<p>"I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery," she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.</p>

<p>"Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat."</p>

<p>Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.</p>

<p>"We had lush rice fields where girls used to work," said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.</p>

<p>"They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022," she added.</p>

<p>"The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless."</p>

<h2>'I want to study'</h2>

<p>Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.</p>

<p>The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.</p>

<p>UNICEF has reported "significant strides" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.</p>

<p>"We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress," it said in a report after the 2022 floods.</p>

<p>Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.</p>

<p>"When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities'," the daily wage labourer told AFP.</p>

<p>Mehtab was just 10 years old.</p>

<p>"The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep," said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.</p>

<p>An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.</p>

<p>But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.</p>

<p>"I have told my father I want to study," she said. "I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of Congress on Thursday called on Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg to give them details regarding ads for opioids and other illicit drugs on the tech titan's platform.</p>

<p>A letter signed by 19 lawmakers pressed for details about such ads given disturbing reports by the Tech Transparency Project and the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>"Meta appears to have continued to shirk its social responsibility and defy its own community guidelines," the letter read.</p>

<p>"What is particularly egregious about this instance is that this was not user-generated content on the dark web or on private social media pages, but rather they were advertisements approved and monetized by Meta."</p>

<p>The Tech Transparency Project in March reported finding more than 450 ads on Instagram and Facebook selling an array of illegal drugs.</p>

<p>Many of the ads "made no secret of their intentions," showing photos of prescription drug bottles or bricks of cocaine, and encouraging people to place orders, according to the non-profit research group.</p>

<p>The investigation involved searching Meta's Ad Library for terms including "OxyContin," "Vicodin," and "pure coke," TTP reported.</p>

<p>The letter from Congress members to Zuckerberg asked for answers from Zuckerberg by Sept. 6.</p>

<p>Questions included how may illicit drug ads Meta has run on its platform, what it has done about them, and whether viewers were targeted for such ads based on personal health information.</p>

<p>Meta planned to respond to the letter.</p>

<p>"Drug dealers are criminals who work across platforms and communities, which is why we work with law enforcement to help combat this activity," a Meta spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry.</p>

<p>"Our systems are designed to proactively detect and enforce against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads for violating our drug policies."</p>

<p>Meta continues to invest in improving its ability to catch illicit drug ads, the spokesperson added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made an upbeat show of unity Thursday as they held their first joint public event since Harris replaced the president as the Democratic Party's candidate in November's election.</p>

<p>Chants of "Thank you Joe!" rang out from the audience at a community college in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington.</p>

<p>Biden announced a major deal to reduce medication prices for retirees on social welfare programs.</p>

<p>But the biggest star was Biden's vice president who has surprised many by uniting the Democratic Party and surging in the polls against Republican Donald Trump since her abrupt entry into the White House race.</p>

<p>"She can make one hell of a president," Biden said of Harris.</p>

<p>Shortly after the joint appearance, Trump delivered rambling and often angry remarks from his New Jersey golf club, before taking questions from a handful of journalists.</p>

<p>Harris has a "very strong communist lean" and will mean the "death of the American dream," he said.</p>

<p>The real estate billionaire and scandal-engulfed former president has struggled to pivot his campaign since Biden dropped out on July 21 amid Democratic concerns that he lacked the stamina at 81 to do the job.</p>

<p>Until then, Trump was rising steadily in the polls, in large part on his message that Biden was losing his mental acuity -- a charge that gained currency when the president badly flubbed a televised presidential debate against his predecessor.</p>

<p>At his golf club event, the 78-year-old Trump began by reading lengthy statements from a binder notebook.</p>

<p>Ostensibly scheduled to attack Harris on inflation, with household products piled high on a table next to him, he almost immediately veered off into a series of complaints about the media and insults at Harris, who he said is "not smart."</p>

<p>Regarding the Israeli war against Hamas in Gaza, Trump said he'd told Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a July meeting to "get your victory and get it over with... The killing has to stop."</p>

<p>Then at a later event with Jewish supporters, Trump turned his fire on Harris, claiming she has "maneuvered" to get support from "venomous anti-Semites in her party."</p>

<p>Harris is married to a Jew who, if she wins election, would make history as the first Jewish spouse of a US president -- as well as the first man in the role.</p>

<p>Using his trademark inflammatory language, Trump claimed that if Harris wins, "the radical left flag burners and Hamas sympathizers will not just be causing chaos on our streets. They'll be running US foreign policy in the White House, and Israel will be gone."</p>

<h3><strong>Biden lame duck&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For Biden, Thursday's event was half victory lap, half acknowledgment that he is entering his presidency's lame duck period.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is set to be crowned as Democratic nominee at the party convention in Chicago next week.</p>

<p>But she made a display of vice presidential deference, delivering only short remarks to introduce Biden and stressing that it has been her honor to serve under the "most extraordinary human being."</p>

<p>"There's a lot of love in this room for our president," she said to cheers.</p>

<p>Biden appeared energized, drawing cheers when he said the Democrats' plan was to "beat the hell out of" Republican opponents and he prompted laughter on pretending not to know Trump's name -- "Donald Dump or Donald whatever."</p>

<p>The drug prices deal will reduce costs for retirees on 10 key medicines, including treatments for diabetes, heart failure and blood clots.</p>

<p>Americans face the highest prescription drug prices in the world, leaving many people to pay at least partly out of their own pocket, despite already exorbitant insurance premiums.</p>

<p>On Friday, Harris will for the first time lay out details of her economic platform.</p>

<p>The United States' first female, Black and South Asian vice president is expected largely to stick to Biden's economic agenda while trying to differentiate herself, avoiding voter wrath over the post-Covid pandemic surge in inflation.</p>

<p>While Trump has long polled more strongly on the economy, a recent poll from the Financial Times and University of Michigan found voters trust Harris more on the issue, by 42 to 41 percent.</p>

<p>Trump, who survived an assassination attempt on July 13, is now the oldest presidential nominee in US history.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old woman named Jasveen Sangha is at the centre of the investigation around the shocking death of FRIENDS actor Matthew Perry.</p>

<p>The dual British and American citizen, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen of Los Angeles", has been charged for supplying the lethal dose of ketamine that killed 54-year-old American actor last year.</p>

<p>Sangha allegedly ran a drug empire out of her Hollywood home where she stored, packaged, and sold methamphetamines, cocaine and prescription drugs. When her house was raided, federal agents found 79 bottles of liquid ketamine and nearly 2,000 meth pills.</p>

<p>For Mr Perry, Sangha allegedly provided his assistant with 50 vials of the ketamine on two different occasions in October last year that he gave to Mr Perry.</p>

<p>Sangha first provided him with a sample of ketamine in an unmarked glass vial for Mr Perry to try on October 13. The next day he returned to buy 25 vials from her. A week after that he bought another 25 vials of the drug.</p>

<p>Sangha also offered "ketamine lollipops" to Mr Perry's assistant as a goodwill gesture for Mr Perry's large order.</p>

<p>Mr Perry took six doses a day for three days till the day his body was found floating face down in his indoor pool last year.</p>

<p>After Mr Perry's death, Sangha told his assistant to delete messages between them that allegedly show her asking for online payments and providing instruction on the strength of the drug dosage.</p>

<p>"Within days of receiving this text, defendant Sangha confirmed that ketamine can kill by conducting a Google search for 'can ketamine be listed as a cause of?'" the indictment alleges, adding that just two week after the actor's death, she took a trip to Tokyo.</p>

<p>Sangha is charged with conspiracy to distribute ketamine, maintaining a drug-involved premises, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and ketamine, and five counts of distribution of ketamine.</p>

<p>If convicted, she faces a minimum of 10 years behind bars and a maximum of life imprisonment.</p>

<p>Mr Perry, who gained fame worldwide for playing the sarcastic Chandler Bing in hit tv sitcom FRIENDS, never shied away from talking about his drug addiction and depression.</p>

<p>He had revealed that he used "ketamine therapy" to treat his depression". On the day of his death, the "17 Again" actor was found with 3.54 micrograms per milliliter of ketamine in his system - or nearly three times the normal amount.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Fabiola Thomas, 39, was discovered in a bathtub by her roommate in June 2019 in her Roswell, Ga., apartment.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Georgia man has been sentenced to life in prison for the 2019 murder of a woman he briefly met on a dating app, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/woman-unfriended-man-then-he-murdered-her-8683696"><em>The People</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fabiola Thomas, 39, was discovered in a bathtub by her roommate in June 2019 in her Roswell, Ga., apartment, according to reports from <em>WSB-TV, 11 Alive, </em>and <em>FOX 5 Atlanta</em>.</p>

<p>Antonio Wilson, then 38, was arrested and charged with her murder months later, as reported by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/man-charged-with-murder-death-roswell-woman-found-bathtub/nPIoQybamtbHNCtalSjIBM/"><em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em></a> and 11 Alive, citing Roswell Police.</p>

<p>The investigation began on June 8, 2019, when police received a frantic phone call from Ms Thomas' roommate, who reported finding her in the bathtub and feared "something bad had happened to her," according to FOX 5 Atlanta and 11 Alive.</p>

<p>Police found Ms Thomas unresponsive at the scene, and she was later pronounced dead at the hospital, as per FOX 5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>A medical examiner ruled her death a homicide several months later, according to FOX 5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>During the investigation, authorities discovered that Ms Thomas and Wilson had met on a dating app shortly before the murder, as reported by WSB-TV.</p>

<p>"Ms. Thomas did everything that you would think you should do," Assistant District Attorney Abigail Potter told WSB-TV. "She told her friends where she was going. She would only meet him in public places."</p>

<p>Prosecutors stated that when Ms Thomas expressed her desire to end the relationship, Wilson could not handle the rejection, according to WSB-TV.</p>

<p>In a text message sent before her death, Thomas asked Wilson to "stop claiming" her, authorities said.</p>

<p>"Keep your ring, I'm not your woman, never was, stop claiming me because I never claimed u," Ms Thomas wrote in a text, according to WSB-TV, citing prosecutors.</p>

<p>Senior Assistant District Attorney Nalda Charles told the outlet, that on the day she died, she 'unfriended'&nbsp;Wilson. It remains unclear which dating app they were using to communicate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wilson was arrested on October 25, 2019, after Ms Thomas' death was ruled a homicide. Five years later, following his trial, a jury took only 30 minutes to find him guilty, according to WSB-TV.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 23, a judge sentenced Wilson to life in prison without the possibility of parole for malice murder, as reported by WSB-TV from a Fulton County court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A United Airlines flight bound for Boston from Houston was forced to divert to Washington DC over a "biohazard" situation connected to a passenger that left crew members vomiting and other fliers onboard in distress.</p>

<p>The United Airlines flight UA2477 (Boeing 737-800) operating from Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport to Boston was diverted to the Dulles International Airport in Washington DC on July 28, the New York Post reported citing the airline.</p>

<p>The flight was cut short and forced to land at Dulles Airport, Washington DC to undergo a "deep clean", according to the airline.</p>

<p>The conversation between the captain and the air traffic control indicated a distressing situation in mid-air.</p>

<p>"I talked to the crew and it sounds like it's quite bad back there. The crew is vomiting, and passengers all around are asking for masks," a crew member was heard saying in audio from the flight as cited in the New York Post report.</p>

<p>The plane landed safely at Washington Dulles Airport, where none of the plane's 155 passengers or its six crew members required medical help, the US publication said.</p>

<p>"The aircraft is currently undergoing a deep clean and we are working to get customers on their way to Boston soon," the airline said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old Florida man, who miraculously survived a 244-day coma after a motorcycle crash years ago, was killed in another accident last week, reported <a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/drew-kohn-hit-and-killed-by-a-truck/77-c5f5a411-f7a0-4664-824a-e8b35f58eb33 ">WLTV News</a>.</p>

<p>Drew Kohn was 22 years old when he was involved in the crash in 2017, which left him with a traumatic brain injury and in a deep coma. At one point, his condition was so severe that doctors considered harvesting his organs, but his mother, Yolanda Osborne-Kohn, refused to give up hope.</p>

<p>Mr Kohn's mother recalled the miraculous moment her son first spoke to her after his long coma. "Yeah Mom, I'm OK," he said. "I love you, mom." After years of gruelling rehab, Mr Kohn managed to walk again, earning him the title of "modern-day miracle".</p>

<p>Mr Kohn eventually woke up after eight months and began the long recovery process. However, his life was cut short when he was struck and killed by a pickup truck on July 26.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Mr Kohn was walking on Collins Road in Jacksonville around 5:30 am on Friday when the accident occurred. The driver, who claimed not to have seen the victim, pulled over and called 911, but Mr Kohn was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>His mother said she was grateful for the seven extra years she had with her son. "I'm grateful for the borrowed time I had with him," she said. "God honoured my request, and I'm not mad. I'm not angry. I'm at peace," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Osborne-Kohn reflected on the moment she surrendered her son's fate to God, recalling a moment when she sat on his hospital bed and prayed, "Thy will be done."</p>

<p>She believes her son is now in a better place, free from suffering and pain. "Drew is healed, walking, not struggling to keep his balance," she said. "His arm is probably lifted so high saying 'Thank you, Jesus!' Drew probably has a football in one hand and a Bible in the other."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Experts measured the number of people who had died as a direct or indirect result of Covid and found the excess mortality rate was still higher than pre-pandemic levels.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Covid-19 is still driving Australia's above-average mortality rate, research showed on Monday, with experts predicting the disease's impact will continue to be felt for years to come.</p>

<p>The Australian Actuaries Institute found that five per cent more people died than would be expected in 2023, amounting to 8,400 excess deaths.</p>

<p>Experts measured the number of people who had died as a direct or indirect result of Covid and found the excess mortality rate was still higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>About 4,600 deaths were directly attributed to Covid-19, the ninth leading cause of death last year.</p>

<p>Non-Covid-19 excess deaths, meanwhile, were "particularly apparent" in Australians over 75 years old -- with previous infections and interruptions in healthcare related to Covid increasing risks related to heart disease, stroke, diabetes and dementia.</p>

<p>Delays in routine or emergency care and undiagnosed Covid-19 were cited as possible reasons for the higher-than-usual death rate.</p>

<p>Still, the excess mortality rate was lower in 2023 than it was in 2022, according to experts.</p>

<p>"It's encouraging that each successive Covid-19 wave has, so far, resulted in fewer deaths than the previous one," Actuary Institute spokeswoman Karen Cutter said.</p>

<p>"However, we think that Covid-19 is likely to cause some excess mortality for several years to come, either as a direct cause of death or a contributing factor to other causes such as heart disease."</p>

<p>She added the "new normal" level of mortality was likely higher than it would be had the pandemic not occurred.</p>

<p>The report also found Australia's excess mortality was lower than the global average -- with Ecuador, Mexico and Russia showing the highest rates of unexplained deaths.</p>

<p>New Zealand had the lowest excess mortality rate of the 40 countries for which data was available.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro won reelection with 51.2 per cent of votes cast Sunday, the electoral council announced, after a campaign tainted by claims of opposition intimidation and fears of fraud.</p>

<p>Elvis Amoroso, president of the CNE electoral body, in its majority loyal to the government, told reporters that 44.2 per cent of votes had gone to opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia who had been leading in polls.</p>

<p>Maduro, 61, won a third six-year term at the helm of the once wealthy petro-state where GDP dropped by 80 per cent in a decade, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.</p>

<p>In office since 2013, he is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Independent polls had suggested Sunday's vote could bring an end to 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Maduro's socialist predecessor and mentor, the late Hugo Chavez.</p>

<p>Gonzalez Urrutia replaced popular opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on the ticket after authorities loyal to Maduro excluded her from the race.</p>

<p>Machado, who campaigned far and wide for her proxy, urged voters late Sunday to keep "vigil" at their polling stations in the "decisive hours" of counting amid widespread fears of fraud.</p>

<p>Maduro counts on a loyal electoral apparatus, military leadership and state institutions in a system of well-established political patronage.</p>

<p>Sunday's election was the product of a mediated deal reached last year between the government and the opposition.</p>

<p>The agreement led the United States to temporarily ease sanctions imposed after Maduro's 2018 reelection, which was rejected as a sham by dozens of Western and Latin American countries.</p>

<p>But the sanctions were snapped back after Maduro reneged on the agreed condition</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Megyn Kelly accused the actress of being hypocritical for not speaking out against gender ideology and transgender issues.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US journalist Megyn Kelly has defended JD Vance, the Republican nominee for Vice President, and slammed actor Jennifer Aniston after she criticised his comments on childless women.</p>

<p>The controversy stems from a 2021 Fox News interview in which Vance stated that “childless cat ladies,” including politicians like Kamala Harris, the Democrat running for the White House, have no “direct stake” in the country.</p>

<p>The comment recently resurfaced, drawing a sharp rebuke from Aniston.</p>

<p>Aniston, who has been vocal about her struggles with infertility, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/jennifer-aniston-slams-donald-trumps-running-mate-jd-vance-over-childless-cat-ladies-remark-6191543">responded to Vance's remarks</a> by sharing a screenshot of the interview on Instagram. In her post, she mentioned Vance's 2-year-old daughter, saying she hopes the child will be able to have children of her own one day and won't need to rely on IVF, a service Vance has opposed in legislation. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option because you are trying to take that away from her, too,” the <em>Friends </em>star wrote.</p>

<p>Megyn Kelly, a former Fox News host, has now slammed the actress for her response.</p>

<p>“Well, now, all this s*** has run, has rained down on him like he hates women and he hates people who have no children, and that's not true,” Kelly said.</p>

<p>However, Vance's record suggests otherwise. In June, he voted against the Right to IVF Act, which would have protected the accessibility and affordability of IVF services across the US.</p>

<p>Kelly also accused the actress of being hypocritical for not speaking out against gender ideology and transgender issues.</p>

<p>She asked where Aniston was when it came to standing up for little girls who were "getting their breasts chopped off" for political purposes by people who were "shoving this gender ideology down their throats without figuring out that they might just be temporarily depressed" or being forced to compete against boys in high school sports, which left them "partially paralysed and permanent nerve damage."</p>

<p>Kelly further criticised Aniston for her selective activism, saying she was happy to see Aniston on board with women's rights but didn't see her actively engaged on these specific issues before.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/disgusting-jd-vance-slams-jennifer-anistons-remarks-on-his-daughter-6206824">JD Vance also responded to Aniston's criticism</a>, calling her comments "disgusting". He pointed out his daughter was only two years old, and if she were to face fertility issues in the future, he “would try everything I could to try to help her because I believe families and babies are a good thing.”<br />
<br />
Vance also clarified his previous “childless cat ladies” remark, explaining it was meant to be sarcastic and not taken literally. He said people were focusing on the tone rather than the substance of his argument and reiterated that his criticism was aimed at the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child, not “about criticising people who, for various reasons, don't have kids."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mumbai-born author Salman Rushdie has endorsed Kamala Harris's candidacy for the US presidency and said he believes she is the person who can prevent former president Donald Trump from dragging the country towards authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Rushdie on Sunday extended his support and endorsement of US Vice President Harris during a virtual 'South Asian Men for Harris' event attended by scores of leading names from the Indian-American community, including prominent lawmakers, authors, policy experts, entrepreneurs and diaspora organisations.</p>

<p>"It's a critical moment. I'm a boy from Bombay and it's great to see an Indian woman running for the White House. And my wife is African-American, so we like the fact that a Black and Indian woman is running for the White House," Rushdie said.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. She officially declared her candidacy after incumbent President Joe Biden withdrew from the race for a second term on July 20. She is expected to be officially declared as the presidential candidate by the Democrats next month.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old British-American novelist also noted that ethnicity itself is not enough. "We would not be gathering in this way let's say for Usha Vance or Nikki Haley," he said, referring to the Indian-American wife of Republican Vice Presidential nominee J D Vance and the Indian-American former South Carolina governor.</p>

<p>Rushdie emphasised that the momentum is because something "very extraordinary, transformative has happened in American politics" in just under one week.</p>

<p>"The conversation has entirely changed with the arrival of Kamala Harris's candidacy and it's changed most joyfully, a way of optimism and positive, forward-thinking," he said.</p>

<p>Rushdie underscored that the community has to make that work because "we can't allow the alternative to happen".</p>

<p>"This hollow man without a single noble quality, trying to drag this country towards authoritarianism. That cannot happen," he said, referring to 78-year-old Trump, a Republican.</p>

<p>Rushdie voiced his confidence that Harris "is the person who can prevent it. And so I'm right in 1,000 per cent in for her." He added that star power matters in America and one could argue that Trump's celebrity status from being on TV for many years helped him get elected to the White House in 2016.</p>

<p>"Well, right now, he doesn't look like the star. He looks like the old, fat guy. Kamala looks like the superstar. And I think the charisma she brings to the campaign could be critical in the weeks ahead," he said.</p>

<p>In response to a question that there are sceptics in the country who believe that America would not elect a woman with Black and Indian heritage as President, Rushdie said this may well have been an argument even as recently as maybe a decade but the times have changed.</p>

<p>"I think the way in which women's leadership is viewed now is different. The way in which the race issue can be made a positive is a new thing. And so I think there's absolutely no reason why Kamala Harris should not win and actually win it quite handily," Rushdie said.</p>

<p>Underlining that the tide is turning, Rushdie cited recent media polls that put Harris neck and neck with Trump, "which is a pretty big bounce from the last Biden poll".</p>

<p>"And it's not even a week. We can do this. We just have to believe it." Rushdie called on people across the country, including the writer community, to "use every power we have, whether it's speaking out, writing, arguing, we've got to win this argument. And writers are pretty good at arguing. So I think we're going to do our best." Noting that the November 5 presidential election is just 100 days away, Rushdie said: "There's not a minute to lose," as he urged "aunties" and extended families to mobilise and come out and vote in large numbers for Harris.</p>

<p>With communities ranging from South Asian to Indo-Carribean coming together and galvanising for Harris, Rushdie described their support as very moving.</p>

<p>"It's moving in the way that in recent days these great assemblies of people have been moving. The gathering of Black women, the gathering of White women, the gathering of Asian women, and now this event. It just shows that there is enormous power in our coming together," he said.</p>

<p>Rushdie underscored that "we cannot be complacent. We have to fight this down to the wire because it's probably going to go down to the wire, but that doesn't mean we can't be the first pass the post. I believe we can".</p>

<p>The event called on all South Asian men and women to rally, fundraise and get out to vote for "our first female president, Kamala Harris!" The event, co-hosted by CEO and Co-founder of full-service digital agency Digimentors Sree Sreenivasan, featured prominent names including Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi from Illinois, co-founder of South Asians for Harris Harini Krishnan and Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Monday attacked Sundar Pichai-run Google, saying if the search giant is interfering with the US Presidential election, they are going to face "a lot of trouble".</p>

<p>Sharing a screenshot where a Google search on “president Donald” resulted in “president Donald Duck” and “president Donald Regan,” the tech billionaire asked if the tech giant has placed a search ban on the former US president and Republican presidential nominee.</p>

<p>“Wow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump! Election interference?” asked the X owner.</p>

<p>Musk further said Google is “getting themselves into a lot of trouble if they interfere with the election”.</p>

<p>An X user posted that “Google is owned by Democrats”.</p>

<p>Another Musk follower commented: “Elon, I'm sure they'll claim you're suppressing the Democrats, but my algorithm shows me both parties posting their thoughts and opinions. Under the previous management, anyone who didn't share the same views as the left was limited or banned”.</p>

<p>However, some X users also slammed Musk, saying “You have a search ban on so many accounts you don't like. What's the difference?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Trump is incredibly close, according to a new media poll, revealing a surge in support for Harris among non-white voters and a significant rise in enthusiasm among Democrats for her campaign.</p>

<p>Trump maintains a slight lead, garnering 49 per cent of the vote compared to 47 per cent for Harris, according to the Wall Street Journal poll.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-calls-kamala-harris-crazy-liberal-she-calls-out-his-wild-lies-6206955" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> has praised the woman Secret Service agent for protecting him during an assassination attempt on him at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>His remarks came days after female US Secret Service agents, who were on stage with Trump during the shooting at his rally on July 13, were criticized for not "properly" protecting someone bigger and taller than themselves, and for not acting in a "professional manner".</p>

<p>"Beautiful person - she was shielding me, everything she could. And she got crushed. And she got criticized by the fake news because she wasn't tall enough," Trump told his supporters at a Minnesota rally on Sunday, Fox News reported.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, she wasn't tall enough. Because I'm tall, and she wasn't tall enough. And she was criticized - she was so brave, she was shielding me with everything, and she wanted to take a bullet because the bullets were flying. Incredible," the Republican presidential candidate was quoted as saying by Fox News.</p>

<p>He called her "so brave" and said she "wanted to take a bullet" for him.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-refused-to-be-put-on-stretcher-after-shooting-reveals-why-6169675" target="_blank">Secret Service</a>, which is responsible for the protection of current and former US presidents, was under fire after a gunman, identified as 20-year-old nursing home aide Thomas Crooks, opened first at Trump from a roof overlooking the outdoor rally in Butler.</p>

<p>He was shot dead by Secret Service snipers shortly after his bullet injured Trump's right ear.</p>

<p>Secret Service Director <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-secret-service-director-quits-days-after-shooting-at-trumps-rally-6172169" target="_blank">Kimberly Cheatle</a> last week resigned after the agency failed to stop the would-be assassin from wounding Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel attacked Hezbollah targets and threatened further retaliation for a rocket strike that resulted in the death of 12. But Israel has also signaled openness to a proposed Gaza truce that could also calm the combustible front with Lebanon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>In the worst single-incident of civilian losses for Israel since Hamas stormed into its southern villages and army bases on October 7, a rocket exploded in Golan Heights on Saturday, killing 12.</li>
	<li>The rocket strike hit a football pitch and killed children who local authorities said were aged 10 to 16.</li>
	<li>While Israel claims Hezbollah fired a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket at them, the Iran-backed group said it had "no connection" to the incident. The rocket strike has raised fears of a wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.</li>
	<li>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to exact a "heavy price" from Hezbollah. He has held several meeting with his security cabinet and military chiefs to decide on the next course of action. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>The US has condemned the rocket attack and called for restraint from all parties.</li>
	<li>But Iran issued a warning saying that any new military "adventures" by Israel in Lebanon could lead to "unforeseen consequences".</li>
	<li>Israel says it can't compromise with enemies sworn to its destruction and blacklisted as terrorists in the West. But domestic pressure for a hostage recovery is growing, and the IDF, which leans on conscripts and reservists, is fatigued.</li>
	<li>Reports state that some senior officials within Israel are in favour of a ceasefire within Gaza, after which Hezbollah has assured to not attack Israel.</li>
	<li>Israel launched its war against Hamas after the October 7 attacks in which 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage to Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 39,000.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah is far stronger than Hamas was before October 7, with more fighters, missiles and drones. A war would probably be devastating for both Lebanon and Israel, officials from both countries have said.</li>

       <description><![CDATA["They talk a good game, but it's all talk," Mr Trump said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump recently revealed that he once offered United States President Joe Biden $1 million if he could "he could break 100 in a game of golf." The former President was speaking at a rally in St Cloud, Minnesota. "I said I will take you to any course you want...I would give you $1 million if you could break 100 in a game of golf," Mr Trump told the audience. He continued, "He turned me down."</p>

<p>The real estate tycoon added that he changed his offer. "Then I said, I'll give you ten strokes a side...I'll give you one million dollars if you could beat me. He had no chance," he stated. "They talk a good game, but it's all talk," Mr Trump added.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Donald Trump talks about his video playing golf with <a href="https://twitter.com/b_dechambeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@b_dechambeau</a> Trending #1 on YouTube and then brings up how Joe Biden challenged him to a round of golf but then chickened out. <a href="https://t.co/ualDgiNa1O">pic.twitter.com/ualDgiNa1O</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Notably, the discussion around golf began early in June, during Mr Biden and Mr Trump's first presidential debate. Mr Trump said that he had won two club championships and two regular club crowns, despite doubts about his age and level of physical fitness. He claimed that to do so, one must be "very smart" and capable of long-range hitting. "I just won two club championships - not even senior. Two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart, and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. He doesn't do it. He can't hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match; he can't hit a ball 50 yards," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to the same, Mr Biden said, "I'd be happy to have a driving contest. I got my handicap when I was vice president down to a six. By the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf with you if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?"</p>

<p>The 45th President of the US then went on to mock Mr Biden and said that it was a "lie." "That's the biggest lie - that he was a six handicap - of all," he said.</p>

<p>When confronted, Mr Biden withdrew his statement and admitted that he was actually eight handicap. However, Mr Trump did not take his remarks at their value and said, "I've seen your swing. I know your swing. Let's not act like children."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a week after US President Joe Biden exited the presidential race and endorsed his deputy Kamala Harris as his successor, the Vice President's campaign has raised USD 200 million, Al Jazeera reported.</p>

<p>The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations -- 66 per cent -- came from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle.</p>

<p>Additionally, over 1,70,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.</p>

<p>"The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real -- and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states," Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, wrote in a memo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign said in early July that it raised USD 331 million in the second quarter, topping the USD 264 million that Biden's campaign and its Democratic allies raised in the same period.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign had USD 284.9 million in cash on hand at the end of June, while the Democratic campaign had USD 240 million in cash on hand at the time.</p>

<p>Harris quickly coalesced Democratic support after Biden, whose candidature fizzled following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump, exited the race.</p>

<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were quick to announce their support.</p>

<p>Prodigious Democratic fundraisers, former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama, also announced their endorsement on Friday.</p>

<p>The Democratic National Convention next month will, however, decide if Harris will become the party's nominee, Al Jazeera reported.</p>

<p>Harris, at her fundraiser on Saturday, said she remained the "underdog" in the race but that her campaign was picking up steam.</p>

<p>Her takeover has re-energised a campaign that had faltered badly, as Democrats were left in doubt about Biden's chances of defeating Trump or his ability to continue in the White House if he had won.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in his campaign appearance in St Cloud, Minnesota, on Saturday, Trump called Harris a "crazy liberal," accused her of wanting to "defund the police," and said she was an "absolute radical" on abortion.</p>

<p>As 100 days are left until the elections, polls over the past week have shown Harris and Trump essentially tied, setting the stage for a close-fought campaign, Al Jazeera reported.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Mitch Landrieu, a campaign co-chair, said on MSNBC that Harris "had one of the best weeks that we've seen in politics in the last 50 years."</p>

<p>"This is going to be a very close race," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Television broadcaster Eurosport on Sunday removed a commentator from its Paris Olympics coverage after he made a sexist remark during the swimming competition.</p>

<p>Bob Ballard made the comment about Australia's swimmers after they won the women's 4x100m freestyle relay gold on Saturday.</p>

<p>In a clip which went viral on social media, Ballard said: "Well, the women just finishing up. You know what women are like... hanging around, doing their make-up."</p>

<p>Ballard's co-commentator Lizzie Simmonds called the remark "outrageous".</p>

<p>"During a segment of Eurosport's coverage last night, commentator Bob Ballard made an inappropriate comment," Eurosport said in a statement.</p>

<p>"To that end, he has been removed from our commentary roster with immediate effect."&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tributes poured in on Sunday for Edna O'Brien, the radical Irish writer whose groundbreaking first novel "The Country Girls" was burned and banned in her native country, after her death at 93.</p>

<p>"She died peacefully on Saturday 27 July after a long illness," said a statement from her publishers Faber Books posted on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>Irish prime minister Simon Harris said the country had "lost an icon" and "a brave, gifted, dignified and magnetic person".</p>

<p>"Most people would have stopped and hidden away with the misogyny she faced but Edna O'Brien kept working on her artistry and became one of modern Ireland's most celebrated and honoured writers," he said in a statement on social media.</p>

<p>"It is for all of us to reflect upon, and never forget, that to reach her potential Edna would leave Ireland and make London her home."</p>

<p>Irish President Michael D. Higgins said he had learned of the death of his "dear friend" O'Brien with "great sorrow".</p>

<p>She was "one of the outstanding writers of modern times" and "a fearless teller of truths", he said in a statement.</p>

<p>He added: "While the beauty of her work was immediately recognised abroad, it is important to remember the hostile reaction it provoked among those who wished for the lived experience of women to remain far from the world of Irish literature, with her books shamefully banned upon their early publication."</p>

<p>Micheal Martin, former Irish premier and current foreign and defence minister, hailed O'Brien on X as a "pioneer, never afraid to push boundaries through her work" who helped "usher in a new era in literature and in modern Ireland".</p>

<p>Culture Minister Catherine Martin described O'Brien as "a modernising force in Irish society who fearlessly advanced the cause of equality".</p>

<h2>Breaking barriers</h2>

<p>The honours she eventually received from her native Ireland included the Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2018.</p>

<p>"The Country Girls" (1960), about the sexual initiation of rebellious Catholic girls, drawn from O'Brien's childhood experiences, is now a marker in modern Irish literature for its breaking of social and sexual taboos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>O'Brien was born in 1930 into a strict Catholic farming family in west Ireland's County Clare.</p>

<p>She was educated at a convent school and then in Dublin where she graduated with a pharmacist's licence in 1950, around the time she was discovering a passion for Leo Tolstoy, F. Scott Fitzgerald and T.S. Eliot.</p>

<p>In 2018, she won the prestigious PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, honoured for having broken down "social and sexual barriers for women in Ireland and beyond".</p>

<p>In 2021, France made her a Commander in the "Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", the nation's highest cultural distinction.</p>

<p>She received France's Prix Femina special prize in 2019, honouring the ensemble of her work.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkey might enter Israel as it had done in the past in Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, though he did not spell out what sort of intervention he was suggesting.</p>

<p>Erdogan, who has been a fierce critic of Israel's offensive in Gaza, started discussing that war during a speech praising his country's defence industry.</p>

<p>"We must be very strong so that Israel can't do these ridiculous things to Palestine. Just like we entered Karabakh, just like we entered Libya, we might do similar to them," Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling AK Party in his hometown of Rize.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why we cannot do this ... We must be strong so that we can take these steps," Erdogan added in the televised address.</p>

<p>AK Party representatives did not respond to calls asking for more detail on Erdogan's comments. Israel did not immediately make any comment.</p>

<p>The president appeared to be referring to past actions by Turkey.</p>

<p>In 2020, Turkey sent military personnel to Libya in support of the United Nations-recognised Government of National Accord of Libya.</p>

<p>Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, who heads the Government of National Unity in Tripoli, is backed by Turkey.</p>

<p>Turkey has denied any direct role in Azerbaijan's military operations in Nagorno-Karabakh, but said last year it was using "all means", including military training and modernisation, to support its close ally.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian links of some US presidential election contenders probably mean little additional benefit for ties, experts said, against the backdrop of bipartisan support for closer relations with New Delhi to counter an assertive China.</p>

<p>Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of Republican Donald Trump's running-mate, have rarely visited the birthplace of one or both of their parents, although Indians take pride in their success.</p>

<p>"Either way, from India's perspective, whether it is Republican or Democrat, that relationship enjoys bipartisan support and should not be affected," said Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former Indian ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>"It can only benefit," he said of the India links, adding, "(It) cannot be affected adversely."</p>

<p>Since ties with New Delhi are viewed favourably by both parties in Washington, there will be little impact on relations, regardless of which party wins, or the candidate's Indian roots, a government official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Both President Joe Biden and Trump, his predecessor in office, sought to woo India, not just to challenge China in the region, but also to wean New Delhi from a traditional dependence on Russian weapons.</p>

<h3>ROLE MODEL</h3>

<p>Both Harris and Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential candidate, JD Vance have links to southern India. Vance belongs to a family of renowned academics.</p>

<p>Harris, who has garnered the backing of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, is viewed as role model in her mother's ancestral village of Thulasendrapuram.</p>

<p>She has "proven how young women, previously confined to their homes, can reach such heights, becoming a public figure in the world's No. 1 country," said J Sudhakar, a resident of the village where Harris' maternal grandfather was born.</p>

<p>"How big an achievement is that?"</p>

<p>Harris, who visited the village as a five-year-old, has recalled walks with her grandfather on the beach of the city of Chennai where the family later lived, about 320 km from the village of roughly 2,000 people.</p>

<p>But she has not been back since becoming US vice president.</p>

<p>"Residents expected a visit, a statement or at least a mention of the village, but that didn't happen," said shopkeeper G. Manikandan.</p>

<p>"But we will invite her when she wins and organise a grand celebration and welcome for her," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's security cabinet on Sunday authorized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to decide on the "manner and timing" of a response to a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 teenagers and children, and which Israel and the United States blamed on Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams on Saturday, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Palestinian militant group Hamas' Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza. That conflict has spread to several fronts and risks spilling into a wider regional conflict.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon during the day on Sunday.</p>

<p>But there were expectations a stronger response could follow the security cabinet meeting convened by Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>After the meeting ended, Netanyahu's office said the cabinet "authorized the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister to decide on the manner and timing of the response."</p>

<p>The White House on Sunday also blamed Hezbollah for the Majdal Shams strike. "This attack was conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah. It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said through her national security adviser that her "support for Israel's security is ironclad,"</p>

<p>The U.S. said Washington has been in discussions with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts since Saturday's "horrific" attack and that it was working on a diplomatic solution.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington did not want further escalation of the conflict, which has seen daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and Hezbollah along the border.</p>

<p>Britain expressed concern at further escalation while Egypt said the attack could spill "into a comprehensive regional war."</p>

<p>On the ground, thousands of people gathered for funerals in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.</p>

<p>Members of the Druze faith, which is related to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, make up more than half the 40,000-strong population of the Golan Heights. Large crowds of mourners, many in traditional high white and red Druze headwear, surrounded the caskets as they were carried through the village.</p>

<p>"A heavy tragedy, a dark day has come to Majdal Shams," said Dolan Abu Saleh, head of the Majdal Shams local council, in comments broadcast on Israeli television.</p>

<p>Hezbollah initially announced it fired rockets at Israeli military sites in the Golan Heights, but said it had "absolutely nothing" to do with the attack on Majdal Shams.</p>

<h2>ISRAEL SAYS ROCKET IRANIAN-MADE</h2>

<p>However, Israel said the rocket was an Iranian-made missile fired from an area north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon, placing the blame squarely on Iranian-backed Hezbollah.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the children and teenagers killed were Israeli citizens.</p>

<p>"The rocket that murdered our boys and girls was an Iranian rocket and Hezbollah is the only terror organization which has those in its arsenal," Israel's foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>Two security sources told Reuters that Hezbollah was on high alert and had cleared some key sites in both Lebanon's south and the eastern Bekaa Valley in case of an Israeli attack.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Middle East Airlines said it was delaying the arrival of some flights from Sunday night to Monday morning, without stating why.</p>

<p>Israeli forces have been exchanging fire for months with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon, but both sides have appeared to be avoiding an escalation that could lead to all-out war, potentially dragging in other powers including the United States and Iran.</p>

<p>However, Saturday's strike threatened to tip the standoff into a more dangerous phase. United Nations officials urged maximum restraint from both sides, warning that escalation could "engulf the entire region in a catastrophe beyond belief."</p>

<p>Lebanon has asked the U.S to urge restraint by Israel, Lebanon's foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told Reuters. Bou Habib said the U.S. had asked Lebanon's government to pass on a message to Hezbollah to show restraint as well.</p>

<h2>ALL-OUT WAR FEARED</h2>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry warned Israel on Sunday against what it called any new adventure in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Syria's foreign ministry said it held Israel "fully responsible for this dangerous escalation in the region" and said its accusations against Hezbollah were false.</p>

<p>The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East and opened a second front against Israel shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on Israel.</p>

<p>Druze communities live on both sides of the line between southern Lebanon and northern Israel as well as in the Golan Heights and Syria. While some serve in the Israeli military and identify with Israel, many feel marginalized in Israel and some also reject Israeli citizenship.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soon after former US President Donald Trump delivered a final pitch to the Christian conservative crowd, saying if they vote for him on Election Day, they would never be obligated to vote again, Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris campaign team hit back at Trump, saying he intends to end democracy, US-based ABC News reported.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign termed Trump's comment that if Christians vote this one time they won't have to do it anymore as an attempt by Trump "to end democracy."</p>

<p>"I don't care how, but you have to get out and vote. Christians, get out and vote just this time. You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed," ABC News reported, quoting Trump.</p>

<p>Trump asserted that he loved the Christians as he is also one.</p>

<p>"I love you, Christians. I'm a Christian. I love you, get out, you gotta get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again, we'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote," ABC News reported, quoting Trump.</p>

<p>When Vice President Harris says this election is about freedom she means it. Our democracy is under assault by criminal Donald Trump," Harris for President Spokesperson James Singer said.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump wants to take America backward, to a politics of hate, chaos, and fear - this November, America will unite around Vice President Kamala Harris to stop him."</p>

<p>Trump reiterated the power of prayers which saved his life two weeks back in his assassination attempt, ABC News reported.</p>

<p>"We want to thank each and every one of the believers in this room for your prayers and your incredible support. I really did appreciate it. Something was working, that we know, something was working. I stand before you tonight, thanks to the power of prayer and the grace of Almighty God," he said.</p>

<p>Several people alluded his remarks to the time when Trump said that he will be a dictator but just on "day one". People said the Trump said he will never leave the White House.</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump ramped up his attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democrative nominee for the US presidential poll, in front of a conservative audience in Florida, claiming that she doesn't like Jews and Israel.</p>

<p>Trump criticised Harris for declining to attend Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu's recent address to Congress."She doesn't like Jewish people, she doesn't like Israel," he alleged about Harris whose husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish.</p>

<p>In his Friday's address at the Turning Point USA's Believers' Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump asked the crowd, "Does everyone here understand the radical left ideology Kamala supports is really militantly hostile towards Americans of faith?"Trump termed Harris as "the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.</p>

<p>"The Republican nominee also called Harris a "bum".</p>

<p>"She was a bum three weeks ago," Trump said adding. "She was a bum, a failed vice president."Kamala Harris's campaign immediately responded to "Trump's strange speech."</p>

<p>"Donald Trump... insulted the faith of Jewish and Catholic Americans, lied about the election (again)... bragged about repealing Roe, proposed cutting billions in education funding, announced he would appoint more extremist judges, revealed he planned to fill a second Trump term with more criminals like himself, attacked lawful voting," read a statement put out by her campign.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Tuesday said he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas after a California law blocked schools from forcing teachers to notify parents about changes to a student's gender identity.</p>

<p>"This is the final straw," Musk said on X.</p>

<p>"Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."</p>

<p>The multi-billionaire also said that he is transferring X from its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco to Austin, a threat he has made before but never saw to completion.</p>

<p>Musk has already moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>"I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children," Musk wrote.</p>

<p>Musk has expressed deep disdain about the use of preferred pronouns, often mocking the practice on social media and dismissing it as part of a "woke" agenda that was dangerous for society.</p>

<p>Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday signed the bill after a contentious legislative process that pitted a handful of school boards fighting for parental rights against LGBTQ activists concerned about the welfare of vulnerable students.</p>

<p>The law reversed decisions in conservative school districts that ordered teachers to notify parents if a student changed their name or pronouns or requested to use facilities or participate in programs that didn't match their official gender.</p>

<p>Newsom, who is seen as a potential alternative to President Joe Biden as candidate for the White House, has often exchanged fire with conservatives over gender issues at state schools.</p>

<p>Last year, he signed a law that sets fines for school districts that ban textbooks portraying LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups.</p>

<p>The latest law came after Newsom fought bitterly with a conservative school board over its opposition to the study of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a San Francisco public official who was assassinated.</p>

<p>Musk has previously sparred with Newsom, who is a former San Francisco mayor, during the deadliest stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when he challenged the decisions of city and state health officials.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans fear their country is spiraling out of control following an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, with worries growing that the Nov. 5 election could spark more political violence, a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Tuesday found.</p>

<p>The two-day poll found Republican presidential candidate Trump opening a marginal lead among registered voters - 43% to 41% - over Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, an advantage that was within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error, suggesting the attempt on Trump's life had not sparked a major shift in voter sentiment.</p>

<p>But 80% of voters - including similar shares of Democrats and Republicans - said they agreed with a statement that "the country is spiraling out of the control."&nbsp; The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,202 U.S. adults nationwide, including 992 registered voters.</p>

<p>Trump narrowly avoided death on Saturday when a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his ear as he spoke at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Blood trickled across his face and he defiantly pumped his fist in the air, mouthing the words "Fight! Fight! Fight!" as he was rushed offstage. A rally attendee was slain and two others seriously injured.</p>

<p>The shooting brought back memories of turbulent political periods such as the 1960s, when Democratic President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, followed by the killing of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.</p>

<p>Some 84% of voters in the poll said they were concerned that extremists will commit acts of violence after the election, an increase from the results of a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in May that showed 74% of voters having that fear.</p>

<p>Fears of political violence became more prominent in America after thousands of Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn Trump's election loss to Biden. Four people died on the day of the attack, and one Capitol Police officer who fought against the rioters died the next day.</p>

<p>While Americans said they feared violence, few condoned it. Just 5% of respondents said it was acceptable for someone in their political party to commit violence to achieve a political goal, down from 12% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll from June 2023.</p>

<p>The attempt on Trump's life has dominated media headlines and fueled discussion among some of his conservative Christian supporters that he was protected by God.</p>

<p>In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, 65% of registered Republicans said Trump was "favored by divine providence or God's will." Eleven percent of Democrats agreed.</p>

<p>The United States stands out among rich nations for its embrace of religion, with evangelical Christians largely aligned with the Republican Party in recent decades. Some 77% of Americans surveyed in 2022 said they believed in God, compared to 56% of Canadians and 39% of British respondents, according to a poll by the Gallup International Association.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has voiced "concern" over the Pakistan government's move to ban jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party and emphasised that Washington would continue to "monitor these decisions and further decisions by the courts".</p>

<p>In its latest attempt to suppress jailed former Prime Minister Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government on Monday announced that it has decided to ban the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and seek Article 6 proceedings against Imran Khan, 71, and ex-president Arif Alvi, 78, among others.</p>

<p>The government led by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party also said Imran Khan's party illegally received foreign funds, involved in riots as well as "anti-state" activities.</p>

<p>US Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller during the daily briefing on Monday said: "Our understanding is that this is the beginning of what will be a complex political process." "Certainly banning a political concern is something -- or a political party is something that would be of great concern to us," Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington in response to questions.</p>

<p>Matthew Miller said the US supported "the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles, including respect for human rights and freedom of expression".</p>

<p>He said the US supported democratic processes such as the rule of law and equal justice under the law, adding that Washington would continue to "monitor these decisions and further decisions by the courts".</p>

<p>Matthew Miller also discussed political violence, given the recent attempt to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and said the US abhors "political violence in any country, including Pakistan, and have spoken out against it and condemned it".</p>

<p>Matthew Miller was responding to a question comparing the recent assassination bid on Trump with a similar attack on incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan in November 2022.</p>

<p>"We support the rule of law in Pakistan and every country in the world, and we want to see respect for democratic principles and people's fundamental human rights and democratic rights upheld," he added.</p>

<p>The move to ban Imran Khan's party appeared to be the government's attempt to prevent the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf from becoming the single largest party in the national assembly as the announcement was made on the heels of relief given to the party by the Supreme Court in the reserved seats case as well as to the party chief in the Iddat case.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf last week got a major boost via the Supreme Court ruling declaring them eligible for reserved seats, depriving the ruling coalition of a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.</p>

<p>The move drew a strong reaction from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf which in return has also demanded invoking Article 6 of the Constitution against those who undertook the unconstitutional steps even though there is a Constitution in the country.</p>

<p>Besides the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, leaders from other parties including the Pakistan Peoples Party, Awami National Party, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, and Jamaat-i-Islami have criticised the decision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jurors found a powerful US senator guilty on all counts of corruption Tuesday after gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found at his home, prosecutors said, sparking calls for his resignation.</p>

<p>Robert Menendez, a 70-year-old Democrat from New Jersey, was charged with extortion, obstruction of justice and accepting bribes to perform favors for businessmen with connections to Egypt and Qatar and will be sentenced on October 29.</p>

<p>"The total combined charges carry a maximum potential sentence of 222... years in prison," a spokesman for the Southern District of New York prosecutor's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>The counts on which Menendez was convicted by the jury after less than three days of deliberations included conspiracy to commit bribery, acting as a foreign agent while a public official, and obstruction of justice.</p>

<p>Menendez, who said in June he would run as an independent in November's election, is a career politician and led the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee until the charges were filed. He remains a sitting senator.</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow Democrat, called on Menendez to step down.</p>

<p><strong>Senator 'for sale'</strong></p>

<p>"In light of this guilty verdict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign," Schumer said.</p>

<p>Menendez shook his head from side to side as the verdict was read out, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have alleged Menendez put his power as a top US senator "up for sale."</p>

<p>In a raid on his New Jersey home, FBI agents were said to have found nearly $500,000 in cash hidden around the house, as well as gold bars worth around $150,000 and a luxury Mercedes-Benz convertible.</p>

<p>His wife Nadine Menendez, to whom defense lawyers are seeking to shift the blame, has also been charged but will be tried separately as she is receiving treatment for breast cancer.</p>

<p>He was convicted alongside two of the businessmen he allegedly helped -- Egyptian-American Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, a real estate developer.</p>

<p>A third businessman, insurance broker Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to bribery charges in March and assisted investigators.</p>

<p>Menendez is said to have interfered in the nomination of New Jersey's prosecutor in a bid to ensure that proceedings were dropped against Daibes and Uribe.</p>

<p>He is also accused of accepting bribes to use his power and influence to enrich his co-conspirators and benefit the government of Egypt, including by helping Hana protect his monopoly on US exports of halal food products to the country.</p>

<p>Hana and Daibes face 85 years and 100 years imprisonment respectively, prosecutors said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled a Minnesota law requiring a person to be at least 21 years old before obtaining a permit to carry a handgun in public for self-defense is unconstitutional.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled a Minnesota law requiring a person to be at least 21 years old before obtaining a permit to carry a handgun in public for self-defense is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with gun rights groups in finding the state's ban violated the rights of 18- to 20-year-olds under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment to keep and bear arms.</p>

<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton, writing for a panel of three judges all appointed by Republican presidents, held that under recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings that have expanded gun rights, the state's 2003 law could not be deemed valid.</p>

<p>"Importantly, the Second Amendment's plain text does not have an age limit," he wrote.</p>

<p>The panel upheld a lower-court judge's ruling last year in favor of the Second Amendment Foundation, the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, gun rights groups which had sued alongside some of their members.</p>

<p>Gun rights groups have filed similar lawsuits challenging age-based restrictions on carrying firearms in other states, including in Georgia, Illinois and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Benton cited a landmark 2022 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority called New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen that changed the landscape of firearms regulation.</p>

<p>That ruling established a new test for assessing firearms laws, saying restrictions must be "consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation."</p>

<p>In June, the Supreme Court in an 8-1 decision in United States v. Rahimi clarified that standard when it upheld a federal ban on people under domestic violence restraining orders from having guns, saying a modern firearms restriction did not need a "historical twin" law.</p>

<p>Citing that decision, Benton said a regulation disarming people who pose a credible threat to others' physical safety could be upheld, but Minnesota had not established why 18- to 20-year-olds posed particular risks that justified its law.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat whose office defended the law, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden hits the campaign trail Tuesday for the first time since the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, seeking a balance between criticizing his rival while heeding his own calls to cool down American politics.</p>

<p>As Trump rides a wave of support at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Democrat Biden -- who is trying to salvage his reelection bid -- is in Las Vegas to reach out to a key constituency of Black voters at the NAACP advocacy group.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old president will also record an interview with Black broadcaster BET, the latest in a series of one-on-ones as he works to ease concerns over his age and mental acuity following his dismal debate performance against Trump last month.</p>

<p>Amid calls for Americans to "lower the temperature" of politics in the wake of the attempt on Trump's life, Biden canceled a campaign trip to Texas on Monday but continued with his Nevada visit.</p>

<p>Biden narrowly won Nevada in his 2020 election victory over Trump.</p>

<p>The trip comes as Democrats push ahead with plans to rush through Biden's own nomination ahead of the party's conference in August, despite calls to postpone it while the party remains torn over his candidacy.</p>

<p>While the attempt on Trump's life has briefly silenced the drumbeat of Democrats who called on Biden to step aside, tensions are still bubbling beneath the surface as the president trails in the polls.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign insisted the virtual roll-call was necessary before the August 19 convention as Republican-led Ohio had moved its filing date to August 7, otherwise Biden risked not appearing on the ballot.</p>

<p><strong>'Play games'</strong></p>

<p>"There have been virtual roll calls in previous presidential elections" Democratic deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told a press conference on the sidelines of the Republican gathering in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>"Ohio Republicans decided to play games... it is our obligation as a campaign to make sure that President Biden is on the ballot."</p>

<p>The move is however only likely to fuel questions about whether Biden can win a second term after a faltering showing at the debate where he mangled his words and lost his train of thought.</p>

<p>Biden, who says he "screwed up" due to jet lag and illness, forcefully defended his fitness for the job in a second major US network interview on Monday night.</p>

<p>"I'm old," Biden told NBC. "But I'm only three years older than Trump, number one. And number two, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good."</p>

<p>Biden also defended his rhetoric about Trump after Republicans accused him of stocking divisions ahead of the shooting in which the former president's ear was hit.</p>

<p>FBI investigators are still probing 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks' motivation for the attack on a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bystander was killed and Crooks was shot dead.</p>

<p>Biden admitted it was a "mistake" to tell donors in a call last week that it was "time to put Trump in the bullseye" of his election campaign.</p>

<p>But Biden doubled down on what he said was the need to "talk about the threat to democracy" posed by former president Trump.</p>

<p>Trump was impeached and faces criminal charges over the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by supporters seeking to overturn his election loss to Biden.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday to step up pressure on Hamas in war-torn Gaza, after the United States criticised the high civilian death count in recent attacks.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, in remarks during a state commemorative event, defended Israel's approach during the more than nine-month war, saying "Hamas is under pressure".</p>

<p>"They are under increasing pressure because we are hurting them, eliminating their top commanders and thousands of terrorists.</p>

<p>"They are under pressure because we are remaining firm in our demands, despite all the pressure," he added, in an apparent reference to a chorus of international concern over the death count in the war since Hamas's October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>"This is exactly the time to increase the pressure even more, to bring home all the hostages -- the living and the dead -- and to achieve all the war objectives," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>His comments come as Israel has stepped up attacks on the besieged Palestinian territory, with Gazan rescuers saying three air strikes in one hour killed more than 40 people on Tuesday.</p>

<p>At the weekend, more than 90 people were killed in a huge Israeli bombing raid on a safe zone, an operation Netanyahu said was targeting the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif and one of his deputies.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told the ceremony that Israel's military pressure "forces the leaders of the terrorist organisation still alive to only take care of their own survival.</p>

<p>"Without the capacity to command, control and lead, the Hamas organisation becomes a group of terrorist gangs without a direction or a future," Gallant said.</p>

<p>The Hamas October 7 attacks on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive has killed at least 38,713 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Kenyan court on Tuesday ordered a man who police said has confessed to murdering and dismembering 42 women to be detained for 30 days as they pursue their investigations.</p>

<p>Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, described by police as a "vampire, a psychopath", was arrested in the early hours of Monday following the horrific discovery of mutilated bodies in a Nairobi garbage dump.</p>

<p>He appeared in a court in the Kenyan capital where the magistrate approved a police request for him to be held for 30 days to enable them to complete their probe.</p>

<p>Since Friday, 10 butchered female bodies trussed up in plastic bags have been hauled from the site of an abandoned quarry in the Nairobi slum of Mukuru, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.</p>

<p>The head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Mohamed Amin, said Monday that Kalusha had confessed to murdering 42 women over a two-year period from 2022, and that his wife had been his first victim.</p>

<p>The DCI said in a statement Tuesday that investigators were holding another two "persons of interest", one of whom was allegedly found with the phone of one of the victims.</p>

<p><strong>Caught 'luring another victim'</strong></p>

<p>Kalusha was detained in the early hours of Monday near a bar where he had been watching the Euro 2024 football match, after officers analysed the phone of one of his alleged victims.</p>

<p>As officers swooped in, "he was in the process of luring another victim", Amin told reporters.</p>

<p>"We are dealing with a vampire, a psychopath," Amin said.</p>

<p>The grisly discoveries were made just 100 metres (yards) from a police station and the officers there have been transferred to ensure an unbiased investigation, acting national police chief Douglas Kanja said on Monday.</p>

<p>The area -- including Kalusha's home, also about 100 metres from where the bodies were found -- will remain "active crime scenes", Amin said.</p>

<p>The dumped bodies have thrown a spotlight on Kenyan police and added more pressure on President William Ruto, who is already confronting a crisis over protests that saw dozens of demonstrators killed and officers accused of using excessive force.</p>

<p>The state-funded KNCHR said it was carrying out its own investigations into the Mukuru case because "there is a need to rule out any possibility of extrajudicial killings".</p>

<p>Amnesty International said it had been directly involved in the retrieval of some of the bodies and had sent independent pathologists to attend postmortems of the victims.</p>

<p>"While it is the case that a multiple homicide crime has taken place, only completing these autopsies will confirm the ongoing investigation into the perpetrator of these murders," Irungu Houghton, executive director of Amnesty's Kenya branch, told AFP.</p>

<p>Kenya's police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority, had also said Friday it was looking into whether there was any police involvement or a "failure to act to prevent" the killings.</p>

<p>Tensions had run high at the crime scene over the weekend, as volunteers combed through the vast piles of rubbish in search of more victims with officers briefly firing tear gas to disperse the crowds.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of carrying out unlawful killings or running hit squads, but few have faced justice.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The circuit from New York to Bermuda, Lisbon, Portugal, Marseille, France, London, England and Foynes, Ireland, are among the locations on the "Tracing the Transatlantic" itinerary.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pan Am, an airline which is synonymous with glamorous and comfortable travel, is making a comeback in 2025. Even though the airline ceased operations in 1991, the name nevertheless evokes nostalgia and represents a time when the terms "selfie stick" and "overtourism" did not exist.The airline has announced a special, 12-day comeback journey next year from New York and it is priced at $65,500 (approximately Rs 54 lakh) for an individual ticket. A double occupancy ticket is available at a slight discount.</p>

<p>This amount includes a free "swag bag" and covers "most meals and beverages," as stated on the company's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.criteriontravel.com/panam/index.html">website</a>. There are only 50 seats available and participants can reserve their spots by paying $5000.</p>

<p>The circuit from New York to Bermuda, Lisbon, Portugal, Marseille, France, London, England and Foynes, Ireland, are among the locations on the "Tracing the Transatlantic" itinerary that had special meaning for Pan Am and were once part of the airline's previous routes.</p>

<p>Passengers will board a Boeing 757-200 that has been privately chartered and is designated as "all business class." It will include "upscale catering featuring continental cuisine and an open bar on all flight legs," in addition to dedicated seats designed for "gathering/socializing."</p>

<p>As per a report in the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/lifestyle/panam-is-bringing-luxury-back-at-65000-per-ticket/">New York Post</a></em>, the guests would spend their nights in some of the best hotels each destination has to offer, such as the Four Seasons Lisbon and NYC's Waldorf-Astoria, which will be throwing "gala evenings" both before and after the journey. A fancy dinner at Ireland's Flying Boat and Maritime Museum and a night of fado music in Portugal are the next two unique stops on the itinerary. Notably, the sole replica of Pan Am's Boeing 314 Clipper from the 1930s is housed at the museum.</p>

<p>Craig Carter, CEO of Pan American World Airways and host of the flight experience said, "Relaunching Pan Am requires a careful balance of honouring its storied past while innovating for the future." Mr Carter wants to provide an experience that "resonates with both our longtime fans and new customers."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, the India-descent biotech entrepreneur, has thrown his hat into the ring for the US Senate seat that will fall vacant if former President Donald Trump wins the presidential polls, taking away its current occupant J.D. Vance, the Republican nominee for Vice-President.</p>

<p>"To be frank, I would strongly consider it if I were asked to serve," Mr Ramaswamy told NBC News.</p>

<p>"I have not discussed this with Governor DeWine, but, you know, I look forward to evaluating what the future holds in store. I would strongly consider it if asked," he added.</p>

<p>Under US rules, Ohio Governor Mike DeWin will nominate someone to complete Vance's six-year term that started in January 2023, after which that person will have to run for the seat or leave it for others to fight for it.</p>

<p>Mr DeWine is a Republican like Vance and Ramaswamy is from Ohio state which Vance represents in the US Senate.</p>

<p>Mr DeWine has said "it's much too early" to name a replacement.</p>

<p>If Mr DeWine picks him, Mr Ramaswamy will become the only Indian-descent member of the current Senate and only the second of Indian-descent.</p>

<p>The first Indian American in the US Senate was Vice-President Kamala Harris. But when she was elected as V-P along with President Joe Biden, her Senate seat fell vacant and because she represented California in the Senate, it fell to the state's Governor Gavin Newsom to name her replacement. Newsom picked Alex Padilla.</p>

<p>This practice landed a Governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, in jail when he tried to auction the seat vacated by Senator Barack Obama on his election to the White House in 2008.</p>

<p>Mr Ramaswamy may even land a position in a second Trump administration if the former President wins. He has impressed Trump with his complete embrace of the latter's MAGA agenda and for forcefully defending him from attacks by critics such as former Governors Chris Christie and Nikki Haley during the Republican primaries; Trump had ignored the primaries while staying miles ahead in polls.</p>

<p>Mr Ramaswamy had quit the race endorsing Trump and had been a part of the starting line of contenders who auditioned for the V-P slot on Trump ticket, but did not make it.</p>

<p>But Trump went on to indicate, according to reports, that if elected, he might name Ramaswamy to head the powerful Department of Homeland Security, which runs, among other things, the country's immigration services.</p>

<p>So, even as he eyes Vance's vacated Senate seat, Mr Ramaswamy is keeping his options open.</p>

<p>"I would also want to have a serious conversation with President Trump about the other ways I could have an impact on the country," he said, adding, "My top passion is taking on the regulatory state."</p>

<p>He added, "There are ways to address that from the executive branch. Some things need to be done by Congress and the Senate too. So, I look forward to those conversations after President Trump is successfully reelected with J.D. Vance."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Controversial influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have to remain within Romania while awaiting trial over human trafficking and rape charges, a Bucharest court ruled on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Bucharest Court of Appeal overturned a previous decision from July 5 that eased travel restrictions on the former professional kickboxer, allowing him and his brother to travel within the European Union.</p>

<p>The final ruling came following an appeal lodged by prosecutors.</p>

<p>The court "dismisses as unfounded the request of the defendants to replace the obligation not to leave the territory of Romania with an obligation not to leave the territorial limit of the European Union", according to the decision delivered on Tuesday.</p>

<p>While awaiting trial over human trafficking and rape charges, the Tate brothers are under judicial supervision in Romania, which is reviewed every 60 days.</p>

<p>Their lawyer Eugen Vidineac announced in a press statement Andrew and Tristan "will fully comply" with the court ruling.</p>

<p>US-born Briton Tate and his brother Tristan, who say they are innocent, are accused of having formed an organised criminal network in early 2021 in Romania and in Britain.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege that 37-year-old Tate, his brother and two women set up a criminal organisation and sexually exploited several victims.</p>

<p>A trial date has not yet been set.</p>

<p>The Tates also face rape and assault allegations in separate cases in Britain, where they have also been accused of tax evasion last week.</p>

<p>Andrew Tate moved to Romania years ago after first starting a webcam business in the UK.</p>

<p>In 2016, Tate appeared on the "Big Brother" reality television show in Britain but was removed after a video emerged showing him attacking a woman.</p>

<p>He then turned to social media platforms to promote his divisive views.</p>

<p>Giving tips on how to be successful, along with misogynistic and sometimes violent maxims, his videos have made him one of the world's best-known influencers.</p>

<p>Andrew Tate made a brief appearance last weekend on a stage of a seaside festival in Romania, as a guest of the US rapper French Montana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Shiites make up a small minority of Oman's overwhelmingly Muslim population. Most Omanis follow the Sunni or Ibadi branches of the faith.</p>

<p>Monday's mosque attack, which has yet to be claimed, came as Shiites this week mark Ashura, an annual day of mourning that commemorates the seventh-century death in battle of Imam Hussein, regarded by the sect as the rightful successor to the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>While several mosque attacks have roiled the Gulf in recent years, Monday's shooting is a first for Oman.</p>

<p>Police said "all necessary security measures and procedures have been taken to handle the situation" following the attack.</p>

<p>"The authorities are continuing to gather evidence and conduct investigations to uncover the circumstances surrounding the incident," police added on X.</p>

<p>Oman has a population of over four million, more than 40 percent of whom are expatriate workers, according to government figures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India, Indonesia and Australia on Tuesday reaffirmed their commitment to work towards a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>The overall situation in the Indo-Pacific came up for review at a 'focal points' meeting of the India-Indonesia-Australia trilateral dialogue.</p>

<p>"The three sides held discussions to explore opportunities for collaboration including under the framework of Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) mechanisms, maritime domain awareness, marine pollution and blue economy cooperation," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>It said the three sides noted convergence between India's Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>India has consistently been supporting ASEAN's centrality in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is considered one of the most influential groupings in the region.</p>

<p>"India, Indonesia and Australia reaffirmed their commitment to advancing their shared values and working together towards a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific," the MEA said in a statement.</p>

<p>At the East Asia Summit in Bangkok in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had proposed the setting up of the Indo-Pacific Ocean's Initiative (IPOI) to conserve and sustainably use the maritime domain and to make meaningful efforts to create a safe and secure maritime domain.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six people including four Pakistanis were killed and nearly 30 wounded in a shooting near a Shiite mosque in the Omani capital Muscat, officials said Tuesday, a rare attack in the otherwise stable Gulf sultanate.</p>

<p>Monday's mosque attack, which has yet to be claimed, came as Shiites this week mark Ashura, an annual day of mourning that commemorates the seventh-century death in battle of Imam Hussein, regarded by the sect as the rightful successor to the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>"The Royal Oman Police have responded to a shooting incident that occurred in the vicinity of a mosque in the Al-Wadi Al-Kabir area" of the capital, a police statement said.</p>

<p>The three gunmen behind the attack were killed and police officers have "concluded the procedures for dealing with the shooting," it said.</p>

<p>It gave a death count of six killed, including a police officer. It said 28 people "from various nationalities" were wounded, including rescuers and paramedics.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry in Islamabad said at least four Pakistanis were killed.</p>

<p>"Four Pakistanis were martyred as a result of gunshots in the dastardly terrorist attack on the Ali bin Abi Talib mosque," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Another 30 Pakistanis are under treatment in hospitals."</p>

<p>Footage verified by AFP shows people fleeing the Imam Ali Mosque, its minaret visible, as gunshots ring out.</p>

<p>A voice can be heard saying "oh God" and repeating "oh Hussein".</p>

<p>Speaking to AFP, Pakistan's ambassador to Oman Imran Ali said the mosque was mostly frequented by south Asian expatriates. Oman is home to at least 400,000 Pakistanis, he said.</p>

<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was "deeply saddened by the terrorist attack".</p>

<p>In a statement on social media platform X, he said: "Pakistan stands in solidarity with the Sultanate of Oman and offers full assistance in the investigation."</p>

<p><strong>Held 'hostage'</strong></p>

<p>Pakistan's ambassador said the attack started with gunfire from a building adjacent to the mosque as hundreds of people gathered for prayers.</p>

<p>The worshippers were held "hostage" by militants before "they were later freed by Omani forces", Ali told AFP.</p>

<p>He said there was little information on the perpetrators of the attack or their possible motive.</p>

<p>"Everyone is being tight-lipped about this," he said, adding that the attack created a "difficult situation".</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Ali toured hospitals treating the wounded.</p>

<p>In a video message on X, he urged Pakistanis in Oman to cooperate with the authorities and avoid the area around the mosque.</p>

<p>"We are in touch with Omani authorities as well as hospitals. Our officers are on standby for emergency blood donations in the embassy," he said, adding that a hotline has been set up to assist the wounded and their relatives.</p>

<p>The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert following the shooting and cancelled all visa appointments for Tuesday.</p>

<p>"US citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities," it posted on X.</p>

<p><strong>Investigations underway</strong></p>

<p>Police said "all necessary security measures and procedures have been taken to handle the situation" following the attack.</p>

<p>"The authorities are continuing to gather evidence and conduct investigations to uncover the circumstances surrounding the incident," police added on X.</p>

<p>The area remained cordoned off on Tuesday, with journalists unable to access the mosque, an AFP photographer reported.</p>

<p>Oman has a population of more than four million, of whom upwards of 40 percent are expat workers, mostly from south Asia, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Shiites make up a small minority of Oman's overwhelmingly Muslim population. Most Omanis follow the Sunni or Ibadi branches of the faith.</p>

<p>While several attacks on Shiite mosques have roiled the Gulf in recent years, Tuesday's attack is a first for Oman.</p>

<p>A 2015 suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kuwait killed at least 27 worshippers and wounded more than 200. It was claimed by the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The same year, Saudi Arabia saw two attacks on Shiite mosques in the space of a week, with at least 25 people killed. The attacks were again claimed by IS, which regards Shiites as heretics.</p>

<p>In 2005, a former teacher opened fire inside a government building in Muscat, killing two people and wounding several others, before shooting himself.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The health ministry said an Israeli strike on a fuel station in Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza killed 17 people and wounded at least 26. The Palestinian Red Crescent initially gave a death count of eight dead in a separate strike at almost the same time on the UN-run Al-Razi School in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, but this was quickly revised down to five dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video circulating on social media appears to show former US President Donald Trump dozing off during the Republican National Convention on Monday. According to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/did-trump-fall-asleep-rnc-convention-1925683"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, the now-viral clip was shot during Harmeet Dhillon's address. Mr Trump can be seen nodding off while JD Vance, his running mate, is seen next to him with his eyes open. Notably, the event marked his first public appearance since the assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>The footage was shared by several users on X (formerly Twitter). Since being shared, the post has amassed over 2.5 million views and 34,000 likes.</p>

<p>"Sleepy Don," said a user.</p>

<p>Another commented, "wakey wakey donald!"</p>

<p>A third person said, "Bro really? How much sleep you think this man has gotten in 48 hours?"</p>

<p>An X user stated, "He literally just, by the grace of God, lived through an assassination attempt.. he then flew out to see his doctors and family, met with politicians, flew back for the RNC (let alone everything we don't see in the background he has had to do to ensure another attempt isn't made)"</p>

<p>"He's probably on super strong pain pills. Just a thought," remarked a user.</p>

<p>As per <em>CBS News</em>, Donald Trump's eyes were closed, not because he was asleep, but because the video was apparently taken during Pastor James Roemke's prayer. Mr Trump and JD Vance were among the large number of people in the crowd who had their eyes closed throughout the pastor's prayer. Some individuals uploaded Roemke's prayer video incorrectly, saying that Mr Trump was sleeping at the moment by editing out other audience members whose eyes were also closed.</p>

<p>The event has sparked a debate as Mr Trump frequently mocks US President Joe Biden, referring to him as "Sleepy Joe," to question his fitness for office. Notably, Mr Biden is the oldest president in American history at 81. Donald Trump said that the POTUS "almost fell asleep" on stage after his heavily criticised performance at the first presidential debate in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in April, several journalists stated that the 78-year-old appeared to doze off several times during his criminal trial in New York, prompting Mr Biden to call him "Sleepy Don." However, Mr Trump denied falling asleep in the courtroom. The campaign told the <em>Independent</em>, "This is 100% Fake News coming from 'journalists' who weren't even in the court room."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, has the support of former Trump presidential primary rival Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>

<p>Reminiscing the days of his law school, Mr Ramaswamy, an Indian-American entrepreneur, underscored how impressed he is with his "classmate" JD Vance getting the "strongest presidential ticket."</p>

<p>"So proud of my friend, classmate, and fellow southwest Ohioan today. We used to watch Bengals games at the bar in law school, it's awesome we're now here a decade later with JD joining the strongest presidential ticket in our lifetime," said Mr Ramaswamy.</p>

<p>"He'll be an outstanding Vice President and I look forward to everything ahead for him and for our country," Mr Ramaswamy added, who dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses earlier.</p>

<p>Donald Trump won the formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for his running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of the weekend's failed assassination attempt.</p>

<p>A White House candidate often chooses a vice presidential running mate who can appeal to new categories of voters or compensate for acknowledged weaknesses in terms of image or policy.</p>

<p>Even if his octogenarian rival Joe Biden appears to be suffering more than him from advanced age, Trump knows he is no spring chicken at 78.</p>

<p>By picking Mr Vance, who at 39 is barely half Trump's age -- and the first millennial on a major US party presidential ticket -- he could neutralize what had been the relatively youthful advantage of Biden's vice president, 59-year-old Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Mr Vance, who was once a fierce Trump antagonist, has made a U-turn to establish himself as one of the billionaire's most ardent defenders.</p>

<p>He has deleted earlier tweets critical of Trump and instead passionately embraced his ideas, advocating a radical anti-immigration fight and uncompromising economic protectionism.</p>

<p>Vance's 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" was extolled by some as a window into the lives and troubles of the white working class -- and their support for Trump.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ian Cameron, former Rolls-Royce head designer and vintage car expert, was killed at his $3 million mansion in Germany after getting stabbed by a man during a robbery attempt.</p>

<p>The 74-year-old British national was living with his wife Verena Kloos in Germany's Herrsching at Lake Ammersee during the incident. Ms Kloos escaped the attack by scaling a wall and landing in her neighbour's house, from where she informed the cops.</p>

<p>The power cables to the garage of Ian Cameron's house, where valuables were kept, had been purposefully cut off, according to CCTV evidence.</p>

<p>"The investigation suggests that this was a violent crime," said police officials.</p>

<p>Ian Cameron played a "significant" role in the designing of iconic Rolls-Royce vehicles like the Ghost, Phantom, and 3 Series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ian Cameron undertook the role of leading the Rolls-Royce design team after BMW acquired Rolls-Royce's automotive business in 1998.</p>

<p>"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news about our former Rolls-Royce designer. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during these difficult hours," said BMW in a statement to Automotive News. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ian played a significant role in shaping Rolls-Royce from when it was first acquired by BMW Group and moved to its home at Goodwood, West Sussex. During Ian's tenure, he led the design team for all Phantom family and Ghost models, creating thoroughly contemporary motor cars that remained sympathetic to the marque's design lineage," the automaker added.</p>

<p>The suspect's height is estimated to be between 180 and 190 cm (5 ft 9 in to 6 ft 2 in). He is wearing light-colored pants, a dark-blue sweatshirt, yellow-green gloves, and a red backpack, according to a description by police officials.</p>

<p>A manhunt has been launched to locate the suspect who is currently on the run. Dogs and a helicopter are helping search teams thoroughly examine the area to catch the murderer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration is convinced that Iran will attack Israel in the coming days and is preparing to help it repel it , three American sources told Axios, according to which the Iranian attack - in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran - could follow the same pattern as the one conducted on April 13, but potentially larger, could involve the Lebanese Hezbollah.</p>

<p>But the administration fears that, unlike four months ago, it may be more difficult to mobilise the same regional and international coalition that helped Israel defend itself from the swarm of drones and missiles launched in April, reports Adnkronos news agency.</p>

<p>The killing of Ismail Haniyeh "does not help" efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza with Hamas, US President Joe Biden admitted, speaking to reporters at the Andrews air base where he went to welcome prisoners exchanged with Russia.</p>

<p>Biden - who yesterday had a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - said he was "very concerned" about the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"We have a ceasefire base, it has to go forward and they have to go forward," the president urged again, in a reference to the phone call with Netanyahu, which he called "very direct."</p>

<p>Ismail Haniyeh will be buried in Qatar today. The body of the Hamas political leader arrived in Doha yesterday from Iran, after thousands of people attended his funeral in Tehran.</p>

<p>According to Hamas and Qatari state media, the funeral prayer will be held after the Friday prayer at Qatar's national mosque, followed by burial in the city of Lusail.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

</div>

<p>While <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-was-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-leader-killed-in-iran-6228475">Hamas Politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh's</a> assassination in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-irans-capital-report-6228024">Iran's capital Tehran</a> mere hours after the swearing-in ceremony of President Masoud Pezeshkian has created shockwaves across the world, the response to the killing is expected to be imminent, and, possibly, tectonic.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was, after all, the political chief of a group labelled a terror entity by the US and many others. In fact, some had designated the group so long before they listed Al Qaeda in the same bracket. The likes of Al Qaeda saw a more rapid ascent in using violence globally, culminating with the 9/11 terror attacks in the US, which also launched a two-decade-long 'war on terror'. The likes of Hamas, on the other hand, confined themselves around the issue of both the sovereignty of Palestine and a fundamental ideological aversion to the state of Israel.</p>

<h2><strong>'Axis of Resistance' At Iranian President's Swearing-In Ceremony</strong></h2>

<p>The killing of Haniyeh is shocking but not unexpected. In November 2023, a month after Hamas orchestrated the terror attack against Israel - from which the group continues to hold hostages - the Israeli establishment had made it clear that it would go after the leadership of the likes of Hamas in Gaza, the Hezbollah in Lebanon, and others. Back then, the Yemen-based Ansrallah (more popularly known as the Houthis) was not as big an actor as it has today become, specifically in the Red Sea theatre. At Pezeshkian's swearing-in, the leadership of all these groups, known more formally as the 'Axis of Resistance', were in attendance.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-what-hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-was-doing-hours-before-his-assasination-6231404">Watch | What Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh Did Hours Before His Assassination</a></strong></p>

<p>The fact that Haniyeh was killed in the middle of Tehran at a time when it was teeming with military personnel sends out a strong message of both access to and the compromise of Iranian security and polity infrastructure. This further underscored the fact that a narrative was built to showcase where groups like Hamas gain their strength from (although this has not been an area of question or contention). While Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack, Iran blames the Jewish state for the same. However, Israel has, in the meantime, taken responsibility for the killing of top Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur in a strike on the Lebanese capital of Beirut, and the elimination of Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif in Gaza, known to be a key architect of the October 7 terror strike.</p>

<h2><strong>What Next?</strong></h2>

<p>The big question at this juncture is, what next? In April, Iran retaliated against Israel after the latter targeted what Tehran claimed was part of its diplomatic mission in Damascus, Syria. This event set forth an escalation ladder where Iran could not be seen as being unable or incapable of directly responding militarily and not just via its knitting of proxy groups spread across the region. While Tehran for long has sought to create a level of strategic ambiguity, where attacks by proxy groups that receive material and political support from the country's all-powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its elite clandestine foreign wing, the Quds Force, gave it a level of deniability, Haniyeh's assassination may in part be designed to reverse this blueprint and pull Iran out of its own shadows, into a more direct, visible, and public confrontation.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/irans-supreme-leader-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-orders-attack-on-israel-for-hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killing-report-6235614">Also Read |&nbsp;Iran's Leader Orders Attack On Israel After Hamas Chief's Killing: Report</a></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Even if Iran would for the moment want to hold back, the rhetoric and expectation from its Axis partners may not allow it to do so. If by way of argument, Israel is goading a response from Tehran, a speech given by Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Thursday found itself in the same space as Israel, looking for an active response from the Iranian side. "Do those people think they can kill a commander like Ismail Haniyeh and Iran will remain silent?" Nasrallah said as he laid out a requirement for avenging Haniyeh's death. For long, the Iran-backed Axis has fought for its own ideological and political aims that feed into a larger construct, in way of providing manpower and geography alike. During this, they have also absorbed tremendous loss. This is especially true for the Hamas in Gaza. It may become hard for Iran now to exercise strategic restraint, even though the likes of Hezbollah may well do so themselves in the long term, despite the rhetoric.</p>

<h2><strong>Some Forced To Find A Middle Path</strong></h2>

<p>For others in the region, specifically in the Arab Gulf, the current trajectory of escalation remains worrying. Many top Arab representatives, including from the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other countries, were present at Pezeshkian's inauguration. The likes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the recent past have increased their engagement with Iran in a bid to course-correct the long-standing narrative of Shia-Sunni confrontations. While sectarian issues remain mostly entrenched, geopolitical and geoeconomic realities have forced those like Saudi Arabia, for example, to find a middle path with the Houthis in Yemen via dialogue, a group with which they technically have been at war since 2015.</p>

<p>For Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and so on, reconstructing this crisis first as one between Israel and Iran, and then, as a longer and larger battle for Palestinian self-determination, may well be crucial to secure their own neutrality.</p>

<h2><strong>Region Remains Sensitive</strong></h2>

<p>The US, a core security player in the region, has been relatively silent since Haniyeh's death. US President Joe Biden has said that Haniyeh's killing will not help the ceasefire and a negotiated deal with Hamas over the release of Israeli hostages. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, himself facing severe political headwinds, seems to have chosen the popular demand to eliminate figureheads such as Haniyeh at a time when, even if a deal was brokered, he would have had to release in exchange hundreds of Hamas members who are currently being held in Israeli prisons.</p>

<p>Finally, regional tensions are expected to remain significantly high in the days to come as Iran and its proxies decide upon a response. In April, there were hints that the escalation between Iran and Israel was at some level mitigated and managed, perhaps via indirect communication or some kind of mediation. This time, the region may well not be so lucky unless a regional and global effort to calm the situation down is mobilised immediately.</p>

</div>

<p>US Vice-Presidential candidate J.D. Vance's 2021 comment about "childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made'' has set the cat among the pigeons. Well, not so much among pigeons, but certainly among a lot of women who have come out breathing fire that he dared to make such a disparaging remark about women who do not have children. They have slammed his misogyny, his contempt for the choices that women make, and his portrayal of women without children as joyless creatures who try to fill their empty lives with their cats. (Clearly, Vance thinks that a mewling cat fits his vision of a pathetic childless woman much better than a barking dog).</p>

<p>Vance's remark was, of course, a political one, meant to belittle women leaders in the liberal Democratic fold - women like Vice-President Kamala Harris, for instance - who do not have biological children. Nevertheless, there's no doubt that it sprang from his deeply held belief that there is something lacking in women who are childless. That they are incomplete, incompetent, socially detached, and, hence, unworthy of respect.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Only Contempt, Pity For Childless Women</strong></h2>

<p>Sounds familiar? Of course, it does! We Indian women are all too acquainted with this belief system. So much so that we could be forgiven for wondering what the caterwaul over Vance's comment is all about. Heck, the guy merely verbalised his belief as offensively as he could, but isn't this hostility exactly what childless women in our society are subjected to? Which makes one wonder if Vance's sterling opinion about childless women was also bolstered by his Indian wife Usha, who is a serious procreator and has produced three children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But let us not speculate. Let us stick to facts. And the fact is that every Indian woman who has not had a child - whether by choice or for medical issues or for any other reason, whether she is affluent or underprivileged, stays in an urban high-rise or a rural hovel - is treated with contempt, pity and, in some cases, murderous cruelty. (We are talking about married women here, because, <em>chhi chhi</em>, no one expects unmarried women to have children. Besides, single women face another level of derision altogether).</p>

<h2><strong>'Born A Woman, Suffer Like One'</strong></h2>

<p>Sure, child-bearing is a perfectly natural life choice. But for some weird reason, not having a child is considered monstrously unnatural. Try telling your officious aunt or over-friendly female neighbour that you have seen the misery and exhaustion of your friends who were new mothers, their eyes hollowed from sleeplessness; you've seen them give up their careers for their children, or be torn with guilt because they have gone back to their jobs. And, no, thank you, that life is not for you - you'd rather be childfree and carefree. Said aunt and neighbour will be horrified by your perversity, your unfeminine rejection of the reproductive instinct. You were born a woman, dammit, you should jolly well go through the pain of being one!</p>

<p>If you want to shock them some more, you could say that you prefer to spend the money that you earn on yourself, go on holidays, and be able to afford a better lifestyle than you could if you had a child. After this brazen expression of sinful self-centredness, they will probably shun you altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a childfree woman, I can tell you that should you wish to not have a baby, your reproductive years will be signposted thus: First, gentle questions from female relatives about when you will give them the "good news''. Second, less gentle questions about why the "good news'' is not forthcoming. Third, reassurances that you still have plenty of time to become a mother - and why not check out this fertility doctor, in case, you know, that is the problem. And finally, the stage when friends and relatives realise that you really have no intention of reproducing and, improbable as it may be, are happy with the choice you have made.</p>

<h2><strong>If Anything, Childless Women Should Get Tax Breaks</strong></h2>

<p>But wait, remaining child-free does not mean that you will be free from pitying looks and insinuations that you are a luckless woman who failed to achieve the true fulfilment of your womanhood by not producing a baby. Depending on your social, cultural and economic milieu, the reactions could range from being dismissed as a <em>baanjh </em>(barren woman), to melting commiseration over your so-called misfortune, to glowering resentment if you were so bold as to declare that you are not sorry that you are childless, that you enjoy your unencumbered status and thank your lucky stars that you don't have to spend an arm and a leg on sending your child (or children) abroad to study, nor leave them to a world lurching towards a climate catastrophe.</p>

<p>With birth rates going down drastically in the West (the share of US adults under 50 who do not have children and are unlikely to ever have children rose from 37% in 2018 to 47% in 2023), one could argue that some folks there have reason to be worried about more and more women not going down the path of procreation. But no such problem exists in India. True, here, too, overall fertility rates are on the decline, but we are still a very long way from making a dent in our population burden and reaching a point when, say, 2 crore people do not apply for 60,000 railway jobs. Really, what women without children in this country ought to get is not hostility, but tax breaks for not adding to the population swell!</p>

<p>But fat chance of that happening - even if the current finance minister is replaced by another. Still, people like Vance in this country will have to get used to the idea that as women attain greater levels of education and financial independence, many more will choose not to have babies. Yes, it's fun to blame women for everything they do or not do, but we are fast reaching a stage when we don't give a damn. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hold my uterus - I'm off to a pet shop to get myself a cat.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The decision to strike follows months of negotiations with major videogame companies including Activision Productions, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take-Two Interactive, Disney Character Voices and Warner Bros Discovery's WB Games.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Striking video game voice actors and motion-capture performers held their first picket on Thursday in front of Warner Bros. Games and said artificial intelligence was a threat to their professions.</p>

<p>"The models that they're using have been trained on our voices without our consent at all, with no compensation," "Persona 5 Tactica" voice actor and video game strike captain, Leeanna Albanese, told Reuters on the picket line.</p>

<p>Video game voice actors and motion-capture performers called a strike last week over failed labor contract negotiations focused on AI-related protections for workers.</p>

<p>This marks the latest strike in Hollywood after union writers and actors marched on the picket lines last year with AI also being a major concern.</p>

<p>"I think when you remove the human element from any interactive project, whether it be a video game or TV show, an animated series, a movie, and you put AI in replacement for the human element, we can tell! I'm a gamer, I'm a digester of this content," British "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare &amp; Warzone" actor Jeff Leach said.</p>

<p>The decision to strike follows months of negotiations with major videogame companies including Activision Productions, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take-Two Interactive, Disney Character Voices and Warner Bros Discovery's WB Games.</p>

<p>However, major video game publishers including Electronic Arts and Take-Two will likely stave off a big hit from the strike due to their in-house studios and the lengthy development cycles for games, analysts have said.</p>

<p>The strike also brings with it a larger call to action across Hollywood as people in the industry advocate for a law that can protect them from AI risks as well.</p>

<p>"There's not a larger national law to protect us, so the NO FAKES Act is basically legislation with the goal of protecting our identities, protecting our personhood on a national scale as opposed to on a state level," Albanese said.</p>

<p>The NO FAKES Act, a bipartisan bill in Congress which would make it illegal to make an AI replica of someone's likeness and voice without their permission, has gained support from the SAG-AFTRA performers union, the Motion Picture Association, The Recording Academy and Disney.</p>

<p>From Grammy-winning artist Taylor Swift to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running in the 2024 presidential election, leaders in entertainment and beyond say deep fakes created from AI are a pressing policy matter.</p>

<p>"Everybody in this country needs protection from the abusive use of AI," Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA told Reuters at the picket line.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

	<li>At the age of 21, Lin Yu-ting bagged a gold medal at the Asian Championships, held in Ho Chi Minh City in 2017. She beat Vietnam's Le Thi Bang in the bantamweight division to earn the prized medal.</li>
	<li>A year later, Lin Yu-ting secured a bantamweight <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/paris-olympic-games-2024-day-6-live-20km-race-walk-final-hockey-and-lakshya-vs-prannoy-6236701">gold medal</a>.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Algerian boxer <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/imane-khelif-angela-carini-olympics-paris-2024-shocking-unfair-outrage-after-algeria-boxers-olympics-win-over-italian-6245673">Imane Khelif's </a>Olympic bout against Angela Carini ended in just 46 seconds after the Italian fighter withdrew from the match. She was seen sobbing in the middle of the ring. However, the match result led to massive outrage on social media, a debate about Khelif's gender and whether or not she should have been allowed to compete in the women's category. Khelif, a biological woman, has lost on several occasions, including at the Tokyo Olympics<br />
<br />
It has also led to many asking what gender testing exactly is. The procedure of identifying whether a person is male or female is known as gender testing. It is often implemented to find out the sex of your unborn kid. In the sports circuit, gender tests are employed to ascertain an athlete's sex because there have been instances of men competing as women and getting undue advantage from it.</p>

<p><strong>How Does Gender Testing Work</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/blood-test-for-gender#other-methods">Healthline</a>, gender tests are evaluated by specialists in internal medicine, gynaecology, endocrinology, and psychology. The ones opting for gender verification undergo blood tests that determine their chromosomes, sex hormones, and genes. If the results obtained from the blood sample show that the person has the Y chromosome, it indicates that they are a male. If the Y chromosome is absent, it reveals that the person is a female.</p>

<p>A somewhat less invasive test is known as cell-free DNA screening, in which a patient provides a blood sample at a local lab or the doctor's office, according to Healthline. There are home DNA kits available as well. These tests function similarly to lab tests, with the only exception being that they search for male chromosomes rather than screening the person's blood.<br />
<br />
<strong>History Of Gender Testing</strong><br />
<br />
According to <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/gender-test.htm#:~:text=Gender%20testing%20is%20the%20process,the%20sex%20of%20your%20child.">Topend Sports</a>, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) launched the very first gender verification testing in sports in 1996. Concerns that men with a physical advantage in strength and muscle mass were cheating by masquerading as women in female-oriented competitions led to the implementation of gender testing. Although the IAAF abandoned it in 1991, women athletes were tested at the Olympic Games at Albertville and Barcelona using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey on Friday blocked access to the Instagram social media network, the national communications authority said without explanation, following censorship accusations against the US company by a high-ranking Turkish official.</p>

<p>The BTK communications authority said in a post on its website that "instagram.com has been blocked by a decision on the date of 02/08/2024", without adding further details.</p>

<p>Many users living in Turkey complained on the X platform that they could not refresh their Instagram feed, an issue verified by AFP journalists.</p>

<p>The Turkish presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun on Wednesday hit out at Meta-owned Instagram, accusing the platform of "impeding people from publishing messages of condolence for the martyr Haniyeh".</p>

<p>Ismail Haniyeh, the political chief of the armed Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was killed in Tehran on Wednesday in an attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>"This is a very clear and obvious attempt at censure," Altun said on X.</p>

<p>According to Turkish media, there are more than 50 million users signed up to Instagram in Turkey, out of a population of 85 million.</p>

<p>The decision sparked mockery on other social media networks such as X.</p>

<p>A meme showing a congested metro station with the tagline: "X when Turks wake up to find that Instagram is blocked", began trending on the platform.</p>

<p>"Instagram is blocked in Turkey, life is over", wrote user "CringeOfMaster" alongside a picture of a grieving man.</p>

<p>Others mockingly asked Instagram users where they could see their doctored images now.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have blocked access to social media sites.</p>

<p>Wikipedia was blocked between April 2017 and January 2020 over two articles that alleged a link between the presidency and extremism.</p>

<p>That caused shock in a country where Erdogan's government is often accused of attacking civil freedoms due to the amount of online information that became inaccessible.</p>

<p>In April, Facebook owner Meta suspended its Threads social network in Turkey following a decision by authorities there to prevent it from sharing information with Instagram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/cnm4v45o_prisoner-swap_625x300_02_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In a high-profile prisoner swap that is being hailed by Biden supporters as a major victory for the administration, Russia released <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan, along with 14 others.</p>

<p>In a press statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, "Under President Biden's leadership, we have secured the release of dozens of Americans who were held hostage or wrongfully detained." This set the tone for a political show of strength by the Democrats in the upcoming days as the party prepares for its big event in Chicago, the Democratic National Convention on August 19, where President Biden will be making his baton-handing speech.</p>

<h2><strong>A Win To Show</strong></h2>

<p>The prisoner swap provides him with the perfect opportunity to show that his administration got work done while the Republican nominee Donald Trump made false claims. What gives Biden a shot in the arm is that Trump had claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would release Evan Gershkovich for him but not for anyone else (by which he meant President Biden, who was still running for a second term in May when Trump made this claim). He has been proven wrong in less than three months.</p>

<p>Social media was abuzz with celebratory notes around the release of Gershkovich, and it was Eric Columbus, litigator for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose X post drew attention to the comparison between Biden and Trump when he said, "Trump loses his hostage as Evan Gershkovich is released."</p>

<h2><strong>Trump's Response</strong></h2>

<p>However, Trump remained at his combative best, asking why details of the prisoner swap were not shared yet. He wrote on Truth Social - "How many people do we get versus them? Are we also paying them cash? Are they giving us cash (Please withdraw that question, because I'm sure the answer is NO)? Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. "</p>

<p>Trump also claimed that he got back many hostages and gave the other country "NOTHING - and never any cash". He also played on the point that releasing, what may be called prisoners convicted of serious crimes, would set a "bad precedent for the future".</p>

<p>Among those released as part of the deal by the Western governments - US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia - is convicted murderer Vadim Krasikov from a German prison. Krasikov was convicted for killing a Georgian asylum seeker who fought in Chechnya against the Russians. He was killed just meters away from the office of the then-German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin in 2019. Germany has called the announcement to allow the swap for Krasikov "not an easy decision".</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's 'Man Of Action' Moment</strong></h2>

<p>Some US media quoted senior administration officials to say that German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz had told President Biden in February in the White House that he would agree to the difficult swap only for Biden. In his announcement after the swap was publicly announced, Biden thanked the allies including Turkey, which played a vital role in facilitating the release. He said, "This would not have been possible without our allies... Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world."</p>

<p>The biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War with Russia would also help Biden leave office asserting his diplomatic prowess, that he is a man who had the skill to be able to bring together American allies and partners in tough times. The Democrats would hope that for Biden, who is under the scanner for his stand in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict and the botched-up Afghan withdrawal, the prisoner swap that is being termed "historic" by the US media would turn the attention to the bigger American issue around Russia. And even as Biden bows out of the race making way for Harris, his diplomatic legacy would not end up being a baggage too heavy for Harris to carry into November.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli air strikes that killed international aid workers in Gaza in April were the result of serious operational failures but were not intentional, according to an Australian government review of the incident released on Friday.</p>

<p>Three Israeli air strikes hit the convoy of aid vehicles travelling through Gaza on April 1, killing seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) staff, including Australian team leader Zomi Frankcom. Palestinians and citizens of the United States, Britain and Poland were also among those killed.</p>

<p>The killings drew widespread condemnation from Israel's allies as well as accusations by some that Israel had deliberately targeted the aid workers, a claim it rejected.</p>

<p>An Australian review into the deaths said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) decided to launch missiles at the convoy after mistakenly believing it was being hijacked by Hamas fighters, who were in fact locally contracted security guards.</p>

<p>In addition, information about the WCK convoy's movements had not reached the IDF team behind the strike, it said. This confusion was compounded because Israeli officials could not directly communicate with the aid convoy, the review added.</p>

<p>IDF staff also violated standard procedures in ordering the second and third strikes on the convoy without carrying out another identification process, it said.</p>

<p>"In this incident, it appears that the IDF controls failed, leading to errors in decision making and a misidentification, likely compounded by a level of confirmation bias," according to Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, who travelled to Israel to investigate the deaths.</p>

<p>"Based on the information available to me, it is my assessment that the IDF strike on the WCK aid workers was not knowingly or deliberately directed against the WCK."</p>

<p>Israel's investigation into the deaths had been "timely, appropriate and, with some exceptions, sufficient," he said.</p>

<p>Binskin said an apology and compensation for the families were important considerations for Israel but stopped short of recommending Australia demand either of Israel.</p>

<p>The IDF has apologised and dismissed two senior commanders involved in the strikes. Three other commanders were formally reprimanded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes were unintended and tragic.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia wanted those accountable to be held responsible, including criminal charges if appropriate.</p>

<p>Wong said she had written to her Israeli counterpart calling for greater protection for humanitarian workers.</p>

<p>"This is not an isolated incident," she said. "We have seen 250 aid workers killed during this conflict and we have also seen recent events where UN vehicles have been fired upon and it is clear that more needs to be done."</p>

<p>The family of the killed aid worker Frankcom called the Australian review an important first step and said they hoped Israel would conduct further investigations followed by appropriate action.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter creator JK Rowling has courted controversy after she referred to Algerian boxer Imane Khelif as a man. Ms Rowling's comment came after Khelif defeated Italian boxer Angela Carini at the ongoing Paris Olympics 2024.<br />
<br />
The Carini-Khelif fight lasted 46 seconds after the Italian boxer decided to abandon the bout to "preserve her life". Soon after, she fell to her knees sobbing and even refused to shake hands with Khelif. The Algerian boxer was announced as the winner.<br />
<br />
"I am heartbroken... I went to the ring to honour my father. I was told a lot of times that I was a warrior but I preferred to stop for my health. I have never felt a punch like this," Carini said.</p>

<p>Reacting to Carini's defeat, Ms Rowling posted on X, "Watch this (whole thread), then explain why you're OK with a man beating a woman in public for your entertainment. This isn't sport. From the bullying cheat in red all the way up to the organisers who allowed this to happen, this is men revelling in their power over women."<br />
<br />
She also shared a video clip of the fight.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br />
Next, she shared a post by Kirsty Burrows, Head of the Safe Sport Unit at the International Olympic Committee (IOC), slamming them for allowing "a male to get in the ring with her (Carini)."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You're a disgrace, your ‘safeguarding' is a joke and #Paris24 will be forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini," she added.</p>

<p>In another post, Rowling shared a photograph of Carini crying and Khelif looking at her. "Could any picture sum up our new men's rights movement better? The smirk of a male who's knows he's protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he's just punched in the head, and whose life's ambition he's just shattered."<br />
<br />
However, Rowling's post has been criticised by many stating that Khelif was raised and identified as a female, and she is not a transgender. A user also pointed out that Algeria was a "Fundamentalist country where homosexuality and sex change are illegal and she had to go past the obstacles of her father's disapproval to be able to do Boxing."&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
As per the rules, athletes with Differences in Sex Development (DSD) are currently eligible to compete in women's competition at the Olympics.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is DSD?</strong><br />
<br />
These are a group of rare conditions that involve genes, hormones and reproductive organs. Some of the people with DSDs are raised as female, however, they have XY sex chromosomes, while their blood testosterone levels are in the male range.</p>

<p>Last year, Algeria's Khelif was disqualified hours before her gold-medal bout in the world championships in New Delhi as she fell foul of International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules, which do not allow athletes with XY chromosomes to compete in women's events.</p>

<p>Why she's been allowed to compete at the Paris Olympics 2024</p>

<p>In June last year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped the International Boxing Association (IBA) of its status as the global governing body for boxing as it failed to complete reforms on governance, finance and ethical issues, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>As a result, IOC is now running the boxing competition at the Paris Games and its rules on inclusion of the athletes with DSDs as well as gender diversity in the women's competition apply.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Imane Khelif?</strong><br />
<br />
The 25-year-old hails from the Tiaret city of Algeria and is also the UNICEF ambassador at present. While her father did not "approve of boxing for girls," she decided to inspire the next generation by winning a gold medal on grand stages.</p>

<p>She made her debut as a professional in the 2018 World Championships and finished 17th. During the 2019 edition of the event, she came in 19th position. In the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, she was knocked out by Ireland's Kellie Harrington in the quarter-finals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid social media outrage over her eligibility, the IOC defended Khelif and said, "All athletes participating in the boxing tournament of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations set by the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU). As with previous Olympic boxing competitions, the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passports."</p>

<p>Khelif is competing in the women's category in the 66kg division.</p>

Imane Khelif is an amateur boxer who clinched a silver medal at the International Boxing Association's 2022 World Championships. Khelif is one of the two boxers permitted to fight at the Olympics despite being disqualified from the women's world championships last year for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests.<br />
<br />
According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-boxing-gender-4b6eb881cce9c34484d30c68ad979127">Associated Press</a>, the International Boxing Association disqualified Imane from last year's championships right before the Algerian's gold-medal bout because of elevated levels of testosterone. Khelif will next feature in a quarterfinal bout against Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori on Saturday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US appeals court on Thursday blocked the Federal Communications Commission's reinstatement of landmark net neutrality rules, saying broadband providers are likely to succeed in a legal challenge.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US appeals court on Thursday blocked the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) reinstatement of landmark net neutrality rules, saying broadband providers are likely to succeed in a legal challenge.</p>

<p>The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume regulatory oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open internet rules adopted in 2015 that were rescinded under then-President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals, which had temporarily delayed the rules, said on Thursday it would temporarily block net neutrality rules and scheduled oral arguments for late October or early November on the issue, dealing a serious blow to President Joe Biden's effort to reinstate the rules.</p>

<p>"The final rule implicates a major question, and the commission has failed to satisfy the high bar for imposing such regulations," the court wrote. "Net neutrality is likely a major question requiring clear congressional authorisation."</p>

<p>The court on July 12 had temporarily placed the net neutrality rules on hold until August 5 as it considered industry legal challenges.</p>

<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said: "The American public wants an internet that is fast, open, and fair. Today's decision by the Sixth Circuit is a setback but we will not give up the fight for net neutrality."</p>

<p>Net neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users. The rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or access to favoured users.</p>

<p>The rules would bar internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic to certain websites, or engaging in paid prioritisation of lawful content, as well as give the FCC new tools to crack down on Chinese telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet service outages.</p>

<p>Reinstating net neutrality has been a priority for Biden, who signed a July 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules adopted in 2015 under President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat.</p>

<p>Under Trump, the FCC had argued that net neutrality rules were unnecessary, blocked innovation and resulted in a decline in network investment by internet service providers, a contention disputed by Democrats.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has backed Italian boxer Angela Carini after her loss to Algerian fighter Imane Khelif at the Paris Olympics 2024 on Thursday. The bout lasted only 46 seconds as Carini withdrew from the contest after she was struck multiple times in the face. The Italian boxer, on her knees, sobbed in the middle of the ring after the defeat. She did not shake hands with Khelif, who made her place in the quarterfinals of the category following the match.</p>

<p>Musk retweeted an X post by American swimmer Riley Gaines who wrote, "Men don't belong in women's sports #IStandWithAngelaCarini.”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely,” Musk wrote in a retweet of Gaines' initial message.</p>

Italy's Prime Minister Georgian Meloni also reacted to Angela Carini's defeat and said that it "was not an even contest".<br />
<br />
"I have a big pain in my nose and I said, 'Stop'. It's better to avoid keeping going. My nose started dripping (with blood) from the first hit," Carini said.<br />
<br />
Khelif was cleared to take part in the Olympics despite getting disqualified from the 2023 women's world championships after she reportedly failed the <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-womens-boxing-match-at-paris-olympics-sparks-gender-row-6241881">gender eligibility tests.</a><br />
<br />
The International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s decision to permit Khelif to compete has led to criticism from former female boxing champions, including Claressa Shields and Ebanie Bridges.<br />
<br />
The IOC allowed two boxers to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics despite failing the gender eligibility tests for the World Boxing Championships last year.<br />
<br />
In 2023, the Algerian boxer suffered disqualification hours before the gold medal match at the women's World Championships. Khelif was reportedly disqualified for a high level of testosterone in her system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey man has been arrested for his alleged disruptive and life-threatening behaviour on an American Airlines flight. Twenty-six-year-old Eric Nicholas Gapco, travelling on flight 2101 from Seattle to Dallas on July 18, exhibited what authorities described as "unruly" behaviour.</p>

<p>Apart from propositioning a female crew member for sex, Gapco also attempted to open the plane's door mid-flight multiple times, forcing the emergency landing, the New York Post reported. The US Attorney's Office for the District of Utah said that Gapco removed his shirt mid-flight and began inhaling on a vape pen while cursing and hitting on a crew member, proposing to her for sex. The passenger also allegedly assaulted a flight attendant.</p>

<p>The Delanco man ate too many marijuana edibles before flight leading to his obnoxious behaviour on the plane.</p>

<p>Chaotic camera footage shows Gapco bare-chested and shouting "I am sane!" as crew members attempted to calm him near the plane's lavatory. A second video shows other passengers assisting the flight crew after tying up Gapco's hands and feet to get him to sit in the rear seat while the<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/flight-from-hell-plane-makes-emergency-landing-after-fliers-break-into-fight-6062125"> plane diverts</a> to Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Police arrested the Delanco resident at Salt Lake City International Airport around 11 a.m., local time. According to a criminal complaint, Gapco's hands and feet were restrained by passengers and crew after he "failed to follow instructions from <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dubai-bound-plane-makes-emergency-landing-at-nagpur-airport-due-to-engine-glitch-5934118">flight </a>crew to remain in his seat, used a vape pen on board in contradiction of crew instructions, locked himself in a lavatory for a time, screamed, and attempted to open the aircraft exterior doors (forward and aft)" while the plane was in the air.</p>

<p>A federal grand jury indicted Gapco on counts of interfering with a flight crew and attempting to harm an <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bengaluru-bound-air-india-express-plane-make-emergency-landing-in-tamil-nadu-5691430">aircraft </a>under the United States' special aircraft jurisdiction. His initial court appearance is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday that Washington is committed to defending Israel's security "against all threats from Iran," the White House said, after the assassination of a top Hamas leader in Tehran.</p>

<p>Biden, who was joined on the call by Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, also emphasized the "ongoing efforts to de-escalate broader tensions in the region," the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>The call between the leaders also came after Israel announced it had "eliminated Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's government has not commented on the slaying of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but the Palestinian militant group has blamed Israel.</p>

<p>Biden "reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Huthis," the White House said in a readout of the president's call with Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"The president discussed efforts to support Israel's defence against threats, including against ballistic missiles and drones, to include new defensive US military deployments," it said.</p>

<p>Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen's Huthi rebels all receive backing from Iran.</p>

<p>Israel has been battling Hamas in the Gaza Strip since the group's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Israel has said the assassination of Shukr was a response to deadly rocket fire from the Lebanese group last week on the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel in south Lebanon since the Gaza war began.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Qatar on Friday is due to hold funeral ceremonies for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after his killing in Tehran, an attack blamed on Israel that has deepened fears of a regional escalation.</p>

<p>Haniyeh, the Palestinian armed group's political chief, had resided in Doha along with other members of the Hamas political office.</p>

<p>He will be buried at a cemetery in Lusail, north of the Qatari capital, following funeral prayers at the Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab mosque, the gas-rich emirate's largest.</p>

<p>His killing sparked calls for revenge and is among several incidents that have inflamed regional tensions during the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas which has drawn in Iran-backed militant groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Hamas has said that "Arab and Islamic leaders" as well as representatives of other Palestinian factions and members of the public would attend the events.</p>

<p>Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in the pre-dawn attack on their accommodation in Tehran early on Wednesday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said.</p>

<p>He had travelled to Iran to attend Tuesday's swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of the attack, has not directly commented on it.</p>

<p>The Hamas leader's assassination came just hours after Israel struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Hamas-allied Lebanese group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In Tehran on Thursday, crowds of mourners paid their respects during a public funeral ceremony for Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led the prayers, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.</p>

<h3><strong>'Rage'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday in honour of Haniyeh, while Hamas has called for a "day of furious rage" to coincide with the burial.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group encouraged "roaring anger marches... from every mosque" following Friday prayers to protest Haniyeh's killing as well as the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack on Israel that ignited the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'High price'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Haniyeh's coffin arrived in Doha on Thursday afternoon, Qatar-based network Al Jazeera reported, broadcasting images of a convoy including internal security force vehicles travelling down Doha's shore-hugging corniche road.</p>

<p>Qatar has hosted Hamas's political bureau with the blessing of the United States since 2012 following the Palestinian operatives group's closure of its office in Damascus.</p>

<p>Haniyeh had played a key role in talks for a potential truce in Gaza, liaising with mediators Qatar, which has led months of behind-the-scenes negotiations alongside Egypt and the United States.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said late on Thursday that he was "very concerned" about rising tensions in the region and added that the killing of Haniyeh had "not helped" the situation.</p>

<p>The White House said Biden spoke with Netanyahu by telephone on Thursday, promising to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran".</p>

<p>"We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it and they should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call.</p>

<p>Reacting to Haniyeh's death, Qatar's prime minister said the killing had thrown the Gaza war mediation process into doubt.</p>

<p>"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on social media site X.</p>

<p>The international community called for calm and a focus on securing a ceasefire in Gaza -- which Haniyeh had accused Israel of obstructing.</p>

<p>Israel warned its adversaries on Thursday that they would "pay a very high price" for any "aggression".</p>

<p>"Israel is at a very high level of preparation for any scenario, both defensive and offensive," Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Those who attack us, we will attack in return."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russia freed Gershkovich, ex-U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and others on Thursday as part of the elaborate multi-country exchange that the White House said involved 24 prisoners, including Russian hitman Vadim Kasikov, released by Germany.</p>

<p>"Every parent, child, spouse and loved one who joined me in the Oval Office today has been praying for this day for a long time," Biden posted about the deal, which was negotiated in secrecy for more than a year.</p>

<p>In the video, Biden tells family members the detainees have been released and are heading to board the plane that will take them from Russia to the United States.</p>

<p>"No word is strong enough for this. I was sure I was going to die in prison," Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza tells his family as they weep.</p>

<p>"I still think I am sleeping in my prison cell in Omsk instead of hearing your voice."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid celebrations at getting a slew of US citizens and Kremlin opponents out of Russian prisons, the White House had one public regret Thursday: failure to get out an even bigger name -- Alexei Navalny.</p>

<p>"We had been working with our partners on a deal that would have included Alexei Navalny and, unfortunately, he died,"&nbsp; US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan revealed.</p>

<p>In the White House's plans, the last truly high-profile political opponent of President Vladimir Putin should have been included in the historic swap that saw 16 people -- including three US citizens and a US resident -- freed in return for 10 Russians chosen by the Kremlin, including two minors.</p>

<p>But in February 2024, just as the secret international talks were at a crucial stage, Navalny was pronounced dead at a notoriously brutal Russian Arctic prison, where he was serving a 19-year sentence after exposing Kremlin corruption.</p>

<p>Navalny was a larger-than-life figure whose bravery in confronting Putin, despite the deaths of multiple other Kremlin opponents over the years, amazed Russia watchers around the world.</p>

<p>After surviving an assassination attempt in which he was poisoned with a rare, Soviet-designed nerve agent, and then daring to return from safety in Germany to certain arrest in Russia, Navalny took on an aura of near-invincibility.</p>

<p>His sudden death behind bars shocked the White House team who had been trying to get the other prisoners home.</p>

<p>"The team felt like the wind had been taken out of our sails," a senior US official told reporters.</p>

<p>When the news broke, national security chief Sullivan said he happened to be with the parents of one of the other key targets in the prisoner swap plan: Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter arrested in Russia in March 2023.</p>

<p>"On the very day that he died, I saw Evan's parents," Sullivan said.</p>

<p>"I told them that the president was determined to get this done, even in light of that tragic news, and that we were going to work day and night to get to this day."</p>

<p>And the plan worked.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Western-chosen prisoners -- including Gershkovich and a veteran Russian human rights campaigner -- were flown to Turkey and then home.</p>

<p>They also included two former aides to Navalny: Lilia Chanysheva, 42, and Ksenia Fadeyeva, 32.</p>

<p>The Russian-chosen prisoners -- including a hitman and accused deep-cover spies -- were flown to Moscow.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris gave Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, a call.</p>

<p>Harris, who is running to replace Biden in November, called "to dicuss the exchange and express her support," Navalnaya spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on X.</p>

<p>And the Russian opposition figure's widow urged efforts to get others out continue.</p>

<p>She "called on the international community to facilitate the release of other Russian political prisoners," Yarmysh said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a customer wrote a homophobic slur on his receipt rather than leaving a tip, a young waiter at a restaurant in Kansas was left in tears.</p>

<p>Noah Bierig, 19, was serving a group of customers who were aggressive from the very start earlier this month at the well-known fast-food restaurant Bubba's 33 in Wichita, Kansas. They were staring at his manicured nails and a Pride bracelet he got from his mother six years ago when he came out as homosexual. Bierig noticed.</p>

<p>"That hurt me a lot. I'm not the type to cry at work, but I gotta say, that was definitely the first time that had happened to me," Noah Bierig told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kake.com/home/wichita-server-turning-homophobic-slur-left-in-place-of-tip-into-powerful-anti-bullying-message/article_6c940cb6-4966-11ef-9e65-a764b9129b9d.html"><em>KAKE TV.</em></a></p>

<p>"I'm not used to sort of blatant homophobia like that," said Bierig.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Instead of a tip, a customer recently wrote a homophobic slur on this server's receipt. Tonight, we'll hear how he's trying to turn the hurtful act into a powerful anti-bullying message. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KAKENews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KAKENews</a> <a href="https://t.co/bUFxeiCQ60">pic.twitter.com/bUFxeiCQ60</a></p>

<p>"The first time I went up to the table, they were just shooting me a couple dirty looks. And every time I would walk away, they would kind of just start laughing a little bit," said Bierig.</p>

<p>The teenager chose to overlook the group's taunts and provided them with the same level of service as he would any other customer.</p>

<p>In return, the group left a hurtful message instead of a tip. Instead of adding a tip, the customer wrote a homophobic slur in the designated tip area on the receipt.</p>

<p>"I looked at one of their receipts, and I noticed that it had a certain three-letter derogatory term written on it," Bierig explained.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kake.com/home/wichita-server-turning-homophobic-slur-left-in-place-of-tip-into-powerful-anti-bullying-message/article_6c940cb6-4966-11ef-9e65-a764b9129b9d.html"><em>KAKE TV</em></a>, after the receipt got posted online, with the customer's name signed and printed just below the slur, people flooded him with comments and shares.</p>

<p>The customer posted an apology on Facebook, saying, in part:</p>

<p>"I know it was wrong of me to write what I did, and for that, I am very sorry. The overall dining experience wasn't that great, and I shouldn't have dealt with it by saying what I did."</p>

<p>The post and the customer's social media pages have since disappeared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

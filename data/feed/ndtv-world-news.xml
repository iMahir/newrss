       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier three times over Beirut in less than 30 minutes on Tuesday, leading to loud booms that sent people in the city running for cover just ahead of a speech by the head of the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israeli warplanes flew low over the Lebanese capital, with witnesses saying they could see the planes with the naked eye. The booms were the loudest heard in Beirut in years.</p>

<p>One Reuters reporter saw people at a cafe in Beirut's Badaro district scatter as the sound reverberated through the city.</p>

<p>Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was set to begin an address at around 5 p.m. (1400 GMT) to mark one week since the killing of the Lebanese armed group's top military commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has promised to respond to the killing, which came just hours before the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in an operation blamed on Israel but which Israel has not confirmed or denied undertaking.</p>

<p>The twin killings have pushed the region to the brink of war, with Iran also vowing a painful response.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK government said on Tuesday that 6,000 specialist police were ready to deal with far-right rioting after another night of destructive troubles in English cities.</p>

<p>There has been a week of nightly riots in various cities since three children were killed in a mass stabbing.</p>

<p>On Monday, six people were arrested and several police officers injured when they were attacked by rioters hurling bricks and fireworks in Plymouth, southern England.</p>

<p>Officers in Belfast, Northern Ireland, were attacked as rioters attempted to set fire to a shop owned by a foreign national. Police said a man in his 30s was seriously assaulted and that they are treating the incident as a racially motivated hate crime.</p>

<p>A group of men who gathered in Birmingham, central England, to counter a rumoured far-right demonstration, forced a Sky News reporter off air shouting: "Free Palestine". She was then followed by a man in a balaclava holding a knife.</p>

<p>Another reporter said he was chased by members of the group "with what looked like a weapon", while police said there had also been incidents of criminal damage to a pub and a car.</p>

<p>Unrest broke out last Tuesday after three children were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, northwest England.</p>

<p>There have been hundreds of arrests around riots that have flared up since.</p>

<p>Justice minister Heidi Alexander told BBC Radio 4 &nbsp;that the government had freed up an extra 500 prison places and drafted in 6,000 specialist police officers to deal with the violence.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer again sought to reassure the nation that action was being taken.</p>

<p>He said after a cabinet meeting: "99.9% of people across the country want their streets to be safe and to feel safe in their communities, and we will take all necessary action to bring the disorder to an end."</p>

<h3><strong>False rumours</strong></h3>

<p>Mobs threw bricks and flares, attacked police, burnt and looted shops, smashed the windows of cars and homes and targeted at least two hotels housing asylum seekers at the weekend.</p>

<p>The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said Monday that 378 people had so far been arrested. </p>

<p>Clashes broke out in Southport the day after three young girls were killed and five more children critically injured during the knife attack there.</p>

<p>False rumours initially spread on social media saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker.</p>

<p>The suspect was later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales. UK media reported that his parents are from Rwanda.</p>

<p>That has not stopped mosques from being targeted by rioters and the government has offered extra security to Islamic places of worship.</p>

<p>In Burnley, northwest England, a hate crime investigation was underway after gravestones in a Muslim section of a cemetery were vandalised with grey paint.</p>

<p>"What type of evil individual(s) would undertake such outrageous actions, in a sacrosanct place of reflection, where loved ones are buried, solely intended to provoke racial tensions?", local councillor Afrasiab Anwar said.</p>

<p>The government, only one month old, has vowed to take a tough line on the unrest.</p>

<p>The prime minister warned rioters on Sunday that they would "regret" participating in England's worst disorder in 13 years.</p>

<p>Interior minister Yvette Cooper said "there will be a reckoning".</p>

<p>Cooper also said that social media put a "rocket booster" under the violence.</p>

<p>Starmer stressed that "criminal law applies online as well as offline", with arrests already being made in relation to posts made on Facebook and Snapchat.</p>

<p>Police have blamed the violence on people associated with the now-defunct English Defence League, a far-right Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago, whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.</p>

<p>The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel winner Muhammad Yunus said on Tuesday he was ready to head an interim government in Bangladesh after mass demonstrations forced longtime ruler Sheikh Hasina to flee the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh Nobel winner Muhammad Yunus said Tuesday he is ready to head a caretaker government, a day after the military took control as mass protests forced longtime ruler Sheikh Hasina to flee.</p>

<p>Microfinance pioneer Yunus, 84, is credited with lifting millions out of poverty -- earning the enmity of ousted Hasina and the wide respect of millions of Bangladeshis.</p>

<p>"If action is needed in Bangladesh, for my country and for the courage of my people, then I will take it," he told AFP in a statement, also calling for "free elections", after student leaders called for him to lead an interim government.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, had been in power since 2009 but was accused of rigging elections in January and then watched millions of people take to the streets over the past month demanding she quit.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people were killed as security forces sought to quell the unrest but the protests grew and Hasina finally fled aboard a helicopter on Monday after the military turned against her.</p>

<p>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Monday the military would form an interim government, saying it was "time to stop the violence".</p>

<p>The president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the student leaders and the major opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP), which has demanded elections within three months.</p>

<h3><strong>'In Dr. Yunus we trust'</strong></h3>

<p>"In Dr. Yunus, we trust," Asif Mahmud, a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>The military on Tuesday reshuffled several top generals, demoting some seen as close to Hasina, and sacking Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared and US-sanctioned Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.</p>

<p>Ex-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, a presidential statement and her party said.</p>

<p>Streets in the capital were largely peaceful on Tuesday -- with traffic resuming, shops opening and international flights resuming at Dhaka's airport -- but government offices were mainly closed a day after chaotic violence in which at least 122 people were killed.</p>

<p>Millions of Bangladeshis flooded the streets of Dhaka to celebrate after Waker's announcement on Monday -- and jubilant crowds also stormed and looted Hasina's official residence.</p>

<p>"We have been freed from a dictatorship", said Sazid Ahnaf, 21, comparing the events to the independence war that split the nation from Pakistan more than five decades ago.</p>

<h3><strong>Deadliest day</strong></h3>

<p>Police said mobs had launched revenge attacks on Hasina's allies and their own officers, as well as broke into a prison, releasing more than 500 inmates.</p>

<p>Monday was the deadliest day since protests began in early July, with a further 10 people killed on Tuesday, taking the total toll overall to at least 432, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.</p>

<p>Protesters broke into parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's independence hero.</p>

<p>Some businesses and homes owned by Hindus -- a group seen by some in the Muslim-majority nation as close to Hasina -- were also attacked, witnesses said.</p>

<p>Bangladeshi rights groups, as well as US and European Union diplomats, said Tuesday they were "very concerned" about reports of attacks on religious, ethnic and other minority groups.</p>

<p>Key police unions said their members had declared a strike "until the security of every member of the police is secured", offering their "apology" for police actions against the protesters.</p>

<p>Key regional allies of Bangladesh, neighbouring India and China, both called for calm on Tuesday.</p>

<p>China hopes that "social stability can be restored in Bangladesh" soon, the foreign ministry in Beijing said on Tuesday, while Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar said he was "deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored".</p>

<h3><strong>Political prisoners freed</strong></h3>

<p>The unrest began last month with protests against civil service job quotas and escalated into wider calls for Hasina to stand down.</p>

<p>Her government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>Mothers of some of the hundreds of political prisoners secretly jailed under Hasina's rule waited outside a military intelligence building in Dhaka on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We need answers," said campaigner Sanjida Islam Tulee.</p>

<p>The fate of Hasina, now in India, is also uncertain.</p>

<p>A source had said she wanted to go to London but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into the "unprecedented" violence put that in doubt.</p>

<p>Thomas Kean from the International Crisis Group said the new authorities faced a daunting challenge.</p>

<p>"The interim government that will now assume power... needs to embark on the long task of rebuilding democracy in Bangladesh, which has been so badly eroded in recent years," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Making one of the most consequential decisions of her campaign, the US Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, reports have said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Born in Nebraska, the 60-year-old Minnesota Governor is a US Army National Guard veteran and has also been a teacher.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A former member of Congress who was elected from a Republican-leaning district, polls have shown that Tim Walz appeals to rural, white voters. He is also known for advancing progressive policies as the Minnesota governor, including paid worker leave and free meals in schools.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Walz taught in China's Guangdong province around the time of the 1989 unrest in Tiananmen square. He has taught geography, coached a school's football team in Minnesota and, in 1999, was also reportedly the faculty adviser for the school's first gay-straight alliance chapter.</li>
	<li>Ms Harris' vice-presidential pick enlisted in the US Army National Guard at the age of 17 and served for 24 years. He first ran for office in 2006 and won the gubernatorial elections in 2018 and 2022. He is now the chair of the Democratic Governors Association.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Minnesota Governor is also credited with calling the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance "weird". This was picked up by other Democrats and eventually by Ms Harris as well. The label has been used frequently and Mr Trump and the Republicans have not been able to come up with a hard-hitting response. &nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A war of words broke out between Elon Musk and the prime minister Keir Starmer over riots gripping the UK. In his recent tweet, Musk, the billionaire owner of X, slammed the UK government again with a 'Family Guy' meme and wrote, "In 2030 for making a Facebook comment that the UK government didn't like."</p>

<p>The picture shows the main character of Family Guy, Peter Griffin, getting the death penalty for cracking a joke.</p>

<p><strong>See the post here:</strong></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In 2030 for making a Facebook comment that the UK government didn't like <a href="https://t.co/UhKDLeCPJb">pic.twitter.com/UhKDLeCPJb</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1820799076310352124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>The internet users were quick to react to the meme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A user wrote, "The UK is quickly becoming Communist China."</p>

<p>Another user commented, "In 2040 just for existing."</p>

<p>"The UK has officially fallen," the third user commented.</p>

<p>Earlier, Mr. Musk sparked a dispute with Downing Street over UK riots, amid concerns that online disinformation is fueling the unrest.</p>

<p>Commenting on his social media site under a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police, Musk stated, "Civil war is inevitable."</p>

<p>The prime minister's spokesperson quickly dismissed Musk's comment, asserting there is "no justification for comments like that" and warning that "anyone who is whipping up violence online will face the full force of the law."</p>

<p>Musk later responded to a social media post from Sir Keir Starmer that condemned violence against Muslims. Mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers have been among the targets of far-right demonstrations.</p>

<p>Sir Keir declared that the unrest "is not protest, it is pure violence," and emphasized, "We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or Muslim communities."</p>

<p>Musk replied: "Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?"</p>

<p>The dispute risks undermining government efforts to hold social media companies accountable for removing harmful online content believed to be inciting some of the violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US man, who convinced his girlfriend to drive to a desert, where he then tied her to a post and watched her die, has been sentenced to life in prison. According to <em>People</em>, the incident took place in 2019. On Friday, John Matthew Chapman, 44, was convicted on one count of kidnapping resulting in the death of the woman, identified as 33-year-old Jaime Feden. He was arrested in November 2019, following which he admitted to killing his girlfriend for money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The defendant violated the victim's trust by luring her away from her family and friends in Pennsylvania and out into the Nevada desert where he viciously killed her," said US Attorney Jason M Frierson in a statement. "This sentence should send a clear message to others that kidnapping and killing another person will result in a substantial prison sentence," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Citing a federal criminal complaint, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/man-lured-girlfriend-desert-bondate-photo-shoot-tied-post-watched-die-8690556">outlet </a>reported that the 44-year-old initially told Ms Feden they were driving to Nevada from Pennsylvania to potentially buy a home in Las Vegas in September 2019. While in Nevada, he then convinced Ms Feden to drive into the desert to participate in a "bandage photoshoot".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once there, prosecutors said that Chapman zip-tied Ms Feden's hands and feet to a signpost before covering her nose and mount with duct tape. He watched Ms Feden suffocate, and then after she had died, he removed the tape, zip ties and her clothes and left her body in the desert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prosecutors said that Chapman had a plan to kill Ms Feden before they went on the trip. Ms Feden's body was found in the desert in October 2019. According to prosecutors, after committing the crime, Chapman drove back to Pennsylvania, discarding Ms Feden's clothes along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In November 2019, Ms Feden's friend requested a welfare check. Neighbours told the cops they hadn't seen the 33-year-old for months, but they also said that had seen someone they believed to be her boyfriend coming in and out of her home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the woman's house, cops found Chapman's ID, Ms Feden's cell phone and multiple rolls of duct tape and zip ties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following his arrest, prosecutors said Chapman admitted to killing Ms Feden for money.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mohammed Shahabuddin, the president of Bangladesh since <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mohammad-shahabuddin-takes-oath-as-bangladeshs-new-president-3974077" target="_blank">April 2023</a>, is the country's sole top constitutional authority since Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India on Monday.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Shahabuddin dissolved parliament and paved the way for the formation of an interim government and new elections, with army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman scheduled to meet student leaders to discuss further steps.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are five facts about Shahabuddin:</strong></h3>

<p>* Born in 1949 in Pabna in what was East Pakistan before it won independence and Bangladesh was born. As a student, he actively participated in the fight for independence from Pakistan in 1971.</p>

<p>* Independence leader and Sheikh Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made Shahabuddin a district joint secretary in the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League, a political front of farmers and workers which included the Awami League party, in 1975.</p>

<p>* Shahabuddin spent three years in jail after Rahman's assassination in 1975.</p>

<p>* A former district judge, Shahabuddin headed a investigation panel that probed violence against Awami League members and supporters when the party was in the opposition.</p>

<p>* With Ms Hasina as prime minister, Shahabuddin was elected unopposed as the country's president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel-winning microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus has been asked by Bangladeshi protest leaders to helm an interim government to replace ousted premier Sheikh Hasina, who had hounded him in speeches and through the courts.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old, known as the "banker to the poorest of the poor", was awarded the Peace Prize in 2006 for his work loaning small cash sums to rural women, allowing them to invest in farm tools or business equipment and boost their earnings.</p>

<p>Grameen Bank, the microfinance lender he founded, was lauded for helping unleash breakneck economic growth in Bangladesh, and its work has since been copied by scores of developing countries.</p>

<p>"Human beings are not born to suffer the misery of hunger and poverty," Yunus said during his Nobel lecture, daring his audience to imagine a world where deprivation was confined to history museums.</p>

<p>But his public profile in Bangladesh earned him the hostility of Hasina, who once accused him of "sucking blood" from the poor.</p>

<p>Before her hurried resignation and departure from Bangladesh on Monday, Hasina's 15-year tenure was characterised by a growing intolerance of dissent, and Yunus's popularity marked him as a potential rival.</p>

<p>In 2007, Yunus announced plans to set up his own "Citizen Power" party to end Bangladesh's confrontational political culture, which has been punctuated by instability and periods of military rule.</p>

<p>He abandoned those ambitions within months, but the enmity aroused by his challenge to the ruling elite has persisted.</p>

<p>Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.</p>

<p>The government unceremoniously forced him out of Grameen Bank in 2011 -- a decision fought by Yunus but upheld by Bangladesh's top court.</p>

<p>In January he and three colleagues from one of the companies he founded were sentenced to jail terms of six months -- but immediately bailed pending appeal -- by a Dhaka labour court which found they had illegally failed to create a workers' welfare fund.</p>

<p>All four had denied the charges and, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by Hasina's government, the case was criticised as politically motivated by watchdogs including Amnesty International.</p>

<p>Student leaders whose protest campaign culminated in Hasina's ouster on Monday were expected to meet with the military to demand Yunus lead a caretaker government.</p>

<p>Yunus has not commented on the call for him to lead but he said in an interview with India's The Print that Bangladesh had been "an occupied country" under Hasina.</p>

<p>"Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated," it quoted him as saying.</p>

<h3><strong>'Poverty was all around me'</strong></h3>

<p>Yunus was born into a well-to-do family -- his father was a successful goldsmith -- in the coastal city of Chittagong in 1940.</p>

<p>He credits his mother, who offered help to anyone in need who knocked on their door, as his biggest influence.</p>

<p>Yunus won a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States and returned soon after Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan in a brutal 1971 war.</p>

<p>When he returned, he was chosen to head Chittagong University's economics department, but the young country was struggling through a severe famine and he felt compelled to take practical action.</p>

<p>"Poverty was all around me, and I could not turn away from it," he said in 2006.</p>

<p>"I found it difficult to teach elegant theories of economics in the university classroom... I wanted to do something immediate to help people around me."</p>

<p>After years of experimenting with ways to provide credit for people too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans, he founded Grameen Bank in 1983.</p>

<p>The institution now has more than nine million clients on its books, according to its most recent annual report (2020), and more than 97 percent of its borrowers are women.</p>

<p>Yunus has won numerous high honours for his life's work, including a US Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by Barack Obama.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, choosing a progressive policy champion and a plain speaker from America's heartland to help win over rural, white voters.</p>

<p>Harris announced the selection in a text message to supporters.</p>

<p>"I'm pleased to share that I've made my decision: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will join our campaign as my running mate," she said. "Tim is a battle-tested leader who has an incredible track record of getting things done for Minnesota families. I know that he will bring that same principled leadership to our campaign, and to the office of the vice president."</p>

<p>Walz, a 60-year-old U.S. Army National Guard veteran and former teacher, was elected to a Republican-leaning district in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 and served 12 years before being elected governor of Minnesota in 2018.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am proud to announce that I've asked <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Tim_Walz</a> to be my running mate.<br />
<br />
As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his.<br />
<br />
It's great to have him on the team.<br />
<br />
Now let's get to work. Join us:<a href="https://t.co/W4AE2WlMTj">https://t.co/W4AE2WlMTj</a></p>
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1820828396298879294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>As governor, Walz has pushed a progressive agenda that includes free school meals, goals for tackling climate change, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz has long advocated for women's reproductive rights but also displayed a conservative bent while representing a rural district in the U.S. House, defending agricultural interests and backing gun rights.</p>

<p>Harris, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, is adding a popular Midwestern politician whose home state votes reliably for Democrats in presidential elections but is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds.</p>

<p>Such states are seen as critical in deciding the Nov. 5 election, and Walz is widely seen as skilled at connecting with white, rural voters who in recent years have voted broadly for Republican Donald Trump, Harris' rival for the White House.</p>

<p>Harris chose Walz over Josh Shapiro, the popular governor of Pennsylvania, who had been seen as helpful to delivering his crucial battleground state.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, became the Democratic Party's standard bearer after President Joe Biden, 81, ended his reelection campaign under party pressure last month. Since then, she has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and recast the race against Trump with a boost of energy from her party's base.</p>

<p>Harris was expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign hopes Walz's extensive National Guard career, coupled with a successful run as a high school football coach, and his Dad joke videos will attract rural voters who are not yet dedicated to a second Trump term in the White House.</p>

<p>Walz was a relative unknown nationally until the Harris "veepstakes" heated up, but his profile has since surged. A popular member of Congress, he reportedly had the backing of powerful former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to leave the race. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris and Walz will face Trump and his running mate JD Vance, also a military veteran from the Midwest, in the November election.</p>

<h3><strong>The George Floyd Factor In Walz's Tenure</strong></h3>

<p>Walz's tenure as governor was marked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder. Walz assigned the state's attorney general to lead the prosecution in the case, saying people "don't believe justice can be served."</p>

<p>Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of National Action Network, said Walz had heard calls for justice for Floyd by tapping the attorney general.</p>

<p>"I learned then that he was a man who will listen and do what is right by those he represents," Sharpton said in a statement. "We can count on Governor Walz to take that same kind of open approach as Kamala Harris' vice president."</p>

<p>Trump campaign officials and surrogates quickly went to work trying to define Walz as a hardcore leftist whose values are out of touch with most Americans.</p>

<p>They criticized his handling of violent riots in Minneapolis following Floyd's death.</p>

<p>"It's no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate - Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State," the Trump campaign said in a statement, a reference to California, Harris' home state.</p>

<h3><strong>Walz On The Attack</strong></h3>

<p>Walz has attacked Trump and Vance as "weird," a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists.</p>

<p>Walz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: "These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room," referring to book bans and women's reproductive consultations with doctors.</p>

<p>Walz has also assailed claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They don't know who we are," Walz said in an MSNBC interview.</p>

<p>That approach has struck a chord with the young voters Harris needs to reengage. David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a "great communicator."</p>

<p>Walz is "somewhat of a unicorn," said Ryan Dawkins, a political science professor at Minnesota's Carleton College - a man born in a small town in rural Nebraska capable of conveying Harris' message to core Democratic voters, and those that the party has failed to reach in recent years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dawkins praised his ability to connect with rural voters. It is a group the Biden administration has tried to reach with infrastructure spending and other pragmatic policies, but with little show of messaging success so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 2016 election, Trump won 59% of rural voters; in 2020 that number rose to 65% even though Trump lost the election, according to Pew Research. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 2022 governor's race, Walz won with 52.27% to his Republican opponent's 44.61%, although swaths of rural Minnesota voted for the opponent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Walz has supported Democratic Party orthodoxy on issues ranging from legalized abortion and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, he also racked up a centrist voting record during his congressional career.</p>

<p>He was a staunch defender of government support for farmers and military veterans, as well as gun-owner rights that won praise from the National Rifle Association, according to The Almanac of American Politics.</p>

<p>He subsequently registered a failing grade with the NRA after supporting gun-control measures during his first campaign for governor.</p>

<p>Walz's shift from a centrist representing a single rural district in Congress to a more progressive politician as governor may have been in response to the demands of voters in major cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul. But it leaves him open to Republican attacks, Dawkins said in a telephone interview.</p>

<p>"He runs the risk of reinforcing some of the worst fears people have of Kamala Harris being a San Francisco liberal," Dawkins said.</p>

<p>Walz has a ready counter-attack.</p>

<p>"What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies, so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions," Walz said in a July CNN interview. "So if that's where they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label."</p>

<p>As the state's top executive, Walz mandated the use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a law making marital rape illegal. He presided over several years of budget surpluses in Minnesota on the road to his 2022 reelection.</p>

<p>During that campaign, Walz touted the backing of several influential labor unions, including the state AFL-CIO, firefighters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), teachers and others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon.com India's country head Manish Tiwary has resigned after an eight-year stint and will leave the e-commerce giant in October, the company said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>His resignation comes as Amazon is fast expanding in India where it plans to invest $26 billion by 2030, but also faces a strict regulatory environment that forces it to run only a marketplace.</p>

<p>Tiwary has decided to pursue an opportunity outside of the company, Amazon said, without elaborating, and will stay at the company until October to ensure a smooth transition. Tiwary did not immediately respond to a query seeking comment.</p>

<p>Reuters was first to report about Tiwary's departure earlier on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Amazon has not immediately named a successor for the top job in India, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>Amit Agarwal, senior vice president for emerging markets, will remain closely involved with the India team, Amazon said in its statement, noting "India is an important priority".</p>

<p>The e-commerce giant is currently facing an antitrust investigation for favouring select sellers on its India website, an allegation it denies.</p>

<p>In 2021, Reuters reported that the company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoff goods and manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in India - practices it has denied engaging in.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces backed by drone strikes killed at least 12 people in the occupied West Bank, medics said on Tuesday, after raids around two flashpoint cities in the north led to gunbattles with Palestinian operatives.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it conducted two separate air strikes in the volatile city of Jenin, hitting armed cells, but gave no details.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry said five people were killed in the strikes against two vehicles in Jenin, one of the most turbulent centres of armed activity in the West Bank. Another person was critically wounded.</p>

<p>The strikes came during an Israeli military operation in Jenin in which footage shared on social media showed a column of armoured personnel carriers entering the city and armoured bulldozers digging up roads.</p>

<p>In the wake of that raid, Israeli forces surrounded a house in the village of Kafr Qud, close to Jenin. Local Palestinian medical workers said three people were killed in the ensuing shootout, with another two wounded.</p>

<p>There were no details on the identity of the dead and it was not immediately clear whether they were members of any of the armed factions.</p>

<p>With Israel bracing for an expected Iranian response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, the West Bank violence underscored the multi-front security challenge facing Israeli forces, 10 months after the start of the war with Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Overnight, the Palestinian health ministry said at least four Palestinians were killed and seven others injured by Israeli fire in the West Bank town of Aqaba, close to the city of Tubas. Two of the injured were in critical condition.</p>

<p>The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said the clashes occurred after Israeli forces surrounded a house in Aqaba and clashed with a group of young men.</p>

<p>Israeli forces have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the start of the Gaza war, many of them armed fighters but many also stone-throwing youths or uninvolved civilians.</p>

<p>At the same time, at least 13 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks. On Tuesday a female border guard was wounded in a stabbing by a Palestinian man using a screwdriver during a bus inspection at a checkpoint on Jerusalem's outskirts.</p>

<p>The attacker was shot dead, the police said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air France said Tuesday that its flights and that of its low-cost subsidiary Transavia to Beirut will be suspended through at least Thursday because of fears that the Gaza war could spread.</p>

<p>The resumption of flights to Lebanon's capital, which have been <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/air-france-transavia-halt-beirut-flights-until-tuesday-over-security-concerns-6254810" target="_blank">halted since July 29</a>, "will be subject to a new assessment of the local situation," the airline told AFP.</p>

<p>The two French airlines first stopped servicing the route after Israel vowed to retaliate following rocket fire from Lebanon that killed 12 people in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Tensions have soared further in the past week as Iran and its allies vowed revenge for the high-profile killings of Hezbollah's top military commander Fuad Shukr in Lebanon and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, both blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces across the border between Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>Air France said it "is constantly monitoring developments in the geopolitical situation of the territories served and overflown by its aircraft, to ensure the highest level of flight safety and security."</p>

<p>The airline added "the safety of its customers and crews is its number one priority."</p>

<p>Air France said customers with reservations for flights to or from Beirut scheduled before and including August 18 to postpone or cancel their trip free of charge.</p>

<p>German carrier Lufthansa has suspended flights to Beirut, Tehran and Tel Aviv until August 12.</p>

<p>Air France said its flights to and from Tel Aviv are operating normally.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The unrest has prompted India, Australia, Nigeria and other countries to warn their citizens to stay vigilant.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government has increased its prison capacity to help tackle violent, week-long anti-immigrant riots that have prompted a growing number of countries to warn their citizens about the dangers of travelling in Britain.</p>

<p>Riots across a number of towns and cities have erupted following the murder of three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed event in Southport, a seaside town in northern England, after false messaging on social media wrongly identified the suspected killer as an Islamist migrant.</p>

<p>The Justice department, which is being forced to release some prisoners early as it battles a jail overcrowding crisis, said nearly 600 prison places had been secured to accommodate those engaged in violence.</p>

<p>About 400 people have been arrested so far.</p>

<p>"My message to anyone who chooses to take part in this violence and thuggery is simple: the police, courts and prisons stand ready and you will face the consequences of your appalling acts," Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said.</p>

<p>The unrest has prompted India, Australia, Nigeria and other countries to warn their citizens to stay vigilant.</p>

<p>Riva Peacock, a 22-year-old retail worker in Liverpool, where rioters clashed with police over the weekend, said the violence was shocking.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of people that blame immigrants for the state of this country," she told Reuters. "It's just a real shame that some of the most vulnerable people in our society have been used as a scapegoat for these issues."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed a reckoning to those who have attacked Mosques and hotels holding migrants, hurled bricks at the police and counter protesters, and looted shops and burnt cars.</p>

<p>Police on Tuesday charged a 28-year-old man with stirring up racial hatred over Facebook posts linked to the disorder. A 14-year-old pleaded guilty to violent disorder.</p>

<p>On Monday night trouble flared in Plymouth, southern England, and again in Belfast in Northern Ireland, where hundreds of rioters threw petrol bombs and heavy masonry at officers, and set a police Land Rover on fire.</p>

<p>A message online says immigration centres and law firms aiding migrants would be targeted on Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong>WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE</strong></p>

<p>In the first widespread outbreak of violence in Britain for 13 years, hundreds of men, some women and children have attacked hotels housing asylum-seekers from Africa and the Middle East, chanting "get them out" and "stop the boats," in reference to asylum seekers arriving in southern England on small dinghies.</p>

<p>They have also pelted mosques with rocks, unverified videos online have shown some ethnic minorities being beaten up and one man photographed at a protest in Sunderland on Friday had a swastika tattooed on his back.</p>

<p>In Birmingham, Britain's second largest city, videos online on Monday evening showed a group of Asian men gathering with Palestinian flags after reports that anti-migrant protesters may target the area.</p>

<p>Reporters on the scene said they were met with hostility and videos appeared to show one white man being attacked in a pub.</p>

<p>The prospect of clashes between white and ethnic minority groups revived memories of race riots that broke out in Oldham and other northern English towns in 2001 - which an official report later attributed to a lack of social cohesion, with two communities living parallel lives.</p>

<p>The government has said riots in recent days were not a proportionate response to concerns about immigration, but violence whipped up by far-right agitators and supported by football hooligans and young people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday as violence raged across the Bangladeshi capital - shocking videos shared online showed vehicles set ablaze and homes of ruling Awami League leaders vandalised - a mob set fire to the cultural centre and Bangabandhu Bhaban, which is a museum dedicated to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sheikh-hasina-bangladesh-protests-sheikh-rehana-49-years-apart-sheikh-rehanas-second-fateful-flight-with-sister-hasina-6275820#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories_lastestImg" target="_blank">Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Mrs Hasina's father and the country's tallest leader</a>, who was assassinated in 1975.</p>

<p>The video, sourced from Reuters and shared online by ANI, shows the building's charred exterior of and the contrast between the scorch marks and verdant green of the lawns paint a stark image. On the front, where once the sign read Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, now only the letters 'G', 'N', 'A' remain, with broken windows and twisted metal rods from an awning staring mournfully.</p>

<p>The ground at the front entrance to the centre is covered with debris.</p>

<p>The video also shows several young men - it is unclear who they are - wandering around the centre's grounds. They seem to be carrying away debris, including what seems to be large pipes. It also shows half-burnt bags, possibly items from the gift shop inside the cultural centre, lying on the ground.</p>

<p>The violence that consumed the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre and Bangabandhu Bhaban extended across large parts of Dhaka over the past few days, including the Prime Minister's residence, which was overrun and ransacked by protesters shortly after Sheikh Hasina quit and fled the nation.</p>

<p>Protesters reportedly also damaged four Hindu temples.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina, 76, escaped on a military aircraft. She is now at an unspecified location in India. Sources said Mrs Hasina expressed a desire to stay but New Delhi made it clear it cannot be a long-term host.</p>

<p>The ousted leader has reportedly applied to the United Kingdom for asylum.</p>

<p>Earlier today External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar addressed Parliament on the Bangladesh issue and said the Indian government is keeping a close eye on developments across the border.</p>

<p>Briefing the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the "still evolving" situation, India's response, and the status of an estimated 19,000 nationals in that country, Mr Jaishankar said the government is in "close and continuous touch" with the Indian community and called on the host nation to provide security.</p>

<p>On the question of minorities (over 90 per cent of Bangladeshis are Muslims), he said, "We are monitoring the situation with regard to minorities. There are reports of initiatives to ensure their protection. We welcome that... but will remain deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored."</p>

<h3><strong>What Next For Bangladesh?</strong></h3>

<p>A new "interim government" - to be advised, most likely, by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - is believed to be taking shape in the crisis-hit country. This follows the release from jail - ordered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin - of former PM Khaleda Zia, who was convicted of corruption.</p>

<p>In speculation that has emerged (inevitably so) since Mrs Hasina quit, three key names or groups are at the forefront, two of whom are the Army, which took charge after Mrs Hasina quit, and which may have given her a 45-minute ultimatum; and her nemesis and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was jailed in 2018 for corruption and whose release was ordered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Rights groups accused Hasina's security forces of abducting and disappearing some 600 people -- including many from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Families of political prisoners secretly jailed in Bangladesh under the autocratic rule of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina waited desperately Tuesday for news of their relatives, as some of those missing were released.</p>

<p>"We need answers," said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a coordinator of Mayer Daak, meaning "The Call of the Mothers", a group campaigning for the release of people detained by Hasina's security forces.</p>

<p>Rights groups accused Hasina's security forces of abducting and disappearing some 600 people -- including many from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist party.</p>

<p>Tulee told AFP that at least 20 families gathered outside a military intelligence force building in a northern Dhaka neighbourhood, waiting for news of their relatives.</p>

<p>Former prime minister Khaleda Zia, a bitter rival of Hasina, was also released from years of house arrest.</p>

<p>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Monday that Hasina had resigned after weeks of deadly protests, and the military would form a caretaker government.</p>

<p>Hours later President Mohammed Shahabuddin -- after a meeting with the army chief -- said it had been decided to free all those arrested during the student protests, as well as key opposition leader Zia.</p>

<p>"People who were detained between July 1 and August 5 as part of the anti-discrimination protests are being freed, and already many have been freed," Shiplu Zman, a press secretary of the president, said.</p>

<p>Former premier Zia, 78, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is in poor health and was largely under house arrest after being sentenced to 17 years in prison for graft in 2018.</p>

<p>"She is now free," A.K.M Wahiduzzaman, a BNP spokesman, told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>What happened to others?</strong></h3>

<p>Among the most high profile of those released on Tuesday was opposition activist and lawyer Ahmad Bin Quasem, son of Mir Quasem Ali, the executed leader of Jamaat-e-Islami.</p>

<p>"He was released from secret detention this morning," family friend and relative Masum Khalili told AFP. "He had a medical check-up, his condition is stable."</p>

<p>Quasem, a British-educated barrister, was abducted -- allegedly by security forces in plainclothes -- in August 2016.</p>

<p>Others released include former brigadier-general Abdullahil Aman Azmi, abducted in 2016, Jamaat-e-Islami said in a statement.</p>

<p>His father Ghulam Azam, the former head of Jamaat-e-Islami, died in prison in 2014.</p>

<p>Security forces during Hasina's rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed "over 600 enforced disappearances" since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 remain unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Hasina's government denied the allegations of disappearances and extrajudicial killings, saying some of those reported missing drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe.</p>

<p>"We heard Ahmad Bin Quasem has been released," Tulee said. "But what happened to others?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Lebanese security source said an Israeli strike killed five Hezbollah fighters in the south on Tuesday, with the group claiming attacks on northern Israel, including one with explosive drones.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israel in support of its ally Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Tensions have soared in the past week as Iran and its allies vowed revenge for the high-profile killings of Hezbollah's top military commander Fuad Shukr and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, both blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said an "Israeli enemy raid on a house in the town of Mayfadun", near the southern city of Nabatiyeh, killed five people.</p>

<p>The dead "were all Hezbollah fighters", a security source told AFP, requesting anonymity because the matter is sensitive.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its air force "struck a Hezbollah military structure in the area of Nabatiyeh" that was being used "to advance terror attacks" against Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah claimed several attacks on Israel on Tuesday, including one with "explosive-laden drones" targeting a barracks north of the coastal town of Acre.</p>

<p>Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service said paramedics were treating "a 30-year-old male in serious condition and a 30-year-old woman in mild to moderate condition with shrapnel injuries... and evacuating them to the Galilee Hospital in Nahariya", near Acre.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its latest attacks were in response to an air strike on the southern village of Ebba on Monday that the Israeli military said targeted a commander in the group's elite Radwan Force.</p>

<p>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is set to give a televised speech at 5:00 pm (1400 GMT).</p>

<p>The cross-border violence since October has killed at least 555 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 25 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheikh Hasina resigned as Bangladesh's prime minister and fled the country on Monday following weeks of deadly protests that began as demonstrations by students against government job quotas but surged into a movement demanding her resignation.</p>

<p>Here are details of the protests that led to end of Hasina's long reign as Bangladesh prime minister:</p>

<h3><strong>Sheikh Hasina Resigns And Flies To India</strong></h3>

<p>Hasina, 76, left Dhaka on Monday in a military aircraft and landed at an airfield at Hindon near Delhi in the evening, two Indian government officials told Reuters.</p>

<p>India's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Hasina apparently decided to resign after a meeting with the leaders of the security forces. At a short notice she requested New Delhi for permission to come to India while Bangladesh authorities simultaneously sought flight clearance.</p>

<p>According to the latest information, she is still in India.</p>

<h3><strong>Bangladesh President Dissolves Parliament</strong></h3>

<p>President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following Hasina's resignation. The president also freed Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, a former prime minister and Hasina's arch rival, from house arrest.</p>

<p>Student leaders who spearheaded the movement that led to Hasina's overthrow said they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus to be chief adviser of the interim government.</p>

<h3><strong>Calls For Sheikh Hasina To Step Down</strong></h3>

<p>The Students Against Discrimination group, which was at the forefront of last month's job quota protests, led the latest demonstrations.</p>

<p>The protests to reform the quota system paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most of them on July 21. Protesters, however, returned last week demanding a public apology from Hasina for the violence, restoration of internet connections, reopening of college and university campuses and release of those arrested.</p>

<p>By the weekend, the demonstrations spiralled into a campaign seeking Hasina's overthrow as demonstrators demanded justice for people killed last month.</p>

<p>The students' group called for a nationwide non-cooperation movement starting Sunday with a single-point agenda - Hasina must resign.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Did Protesters Want Sheikh Hasina's Resignation?</strong></h3>

<p>The protesters blame Hasina's government for the violence during the protests in July. Hasina's critics and rights groups have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge the government denied.</p>

<h3><strong>What Did Sheikh Hasina Say About The Protests?</strong></h3>

<p>Hasina and her government initially said students were not involved in the violence during the quota protests and blamed the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for the clashes and arson.</p>

<p>But after violence erupted again on Sunday, Hasina said that "those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation".</p>

<p>The students' group declined Hasina's offer for talks to resolve the crisis.</p>

<h3><strong>What Triggered The Job-Quota Protests?</strong></h3>

<p>Demonstrations started at university campuses in June after the High Court reinstated a quota system for government jobs which favoured relatives of veterans of Bangladesh's war of independence, overturning a 2018 decision by Hasina's government to scrap it.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court suspended the high court order after the government's appeal and then dismissed the lower court order last month, directing that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.</p>

<h3><strong>Flagging Economy, Unemployment</strong></h3>

<p>Experts also attribute the current unrest in Bangladesh to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making public sector jobs, with their accompanying regular wage hikes and privileges, very attractive.</p>

<p>The quotas sparked anger among students grappling with high youth unemployment, as nearly 32 million young people are out of work or education in a population of 170 million.</p>

<p>The flagging economy, once among the world's fastest growing on the back of the country's booming garments sector, has stagnated. Inflation hovers around 10% per annum and dollar reserves are shrinking.</p>

<h3><strong>Hasina Won January Election</strong></h3>

<p>Hasina retained power for a fourth straight term in an election in January boycotted by the BNP, which accused her Awami League of trying to legitimise sham elections.</p>

<p>BNP said 10 million party workers were on the run ahead of the election with nearly 25,000 arrested following deadly anti-government protests on Oct. 28. Hasina blamed the BNP for instigating anti-government protests that rocked Dhaka ahead of the election and left at least 10 people dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 23-year-old man in the United States has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for the horrific murder and beheading of his newlywed wife. According to the<em> New York Post</em>, Jared James Dicus' trial concluded on Wednesday, more than a year after he brutally murdered his wife, 21-year-old Anggy Diaz, in their home near Houston. He pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to four decades in prison with his earliest parole date not until 2043.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/jared-james-dicus-pleads-guilty-to-murder-of-wife-anggy-diaz/"><em>Post</em></a>, the pair had only tied the knot in October 2022. Officials revealed that in January 2023 Mr Discus' parents made a frantic call, reporting a possible death at their property. On arrival, police found Ms Diaz's body in a pool of blood after she was stabbed multiple times. Her severed head was discovered in the shower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 23-year-old was later nabbed by police and admitted to detectives that he had murdered his new wife. The reason behind the gruesome act hasn't been made public, but cops have revealed that they had previously responded to domestic violence-related calls at the couple's home. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Waller County does not tolerate domestic violence. Heinous crimes like this one will not go unanswered," Waller County District Attorney Sean Whittmore said in a statement last week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will seek justice for the victims of domestic violence and send a message to the perpetrators that here, we fight for our victims," he added.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/jared-dicus-waller-county-sentenced-decapitation-wife-leaving-head-shower.amp"><em>Fox26 Houston</em></a>, police said Mr Discus used a kitchen knife to commit the murder. "Everything happened on the property. And all parts and pieces were recovered and submitted for evidence," Sheriff Troy Guidry said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Mr Whittmore pointed out that potential mental health issues were raised during the pretrial phase of the case. However, a psychiatrist declared Mr Dicus fit to stand trial.</p>

<p>Now, the plea agreement prevents Jared James Dicus from appealing the verdict and sentence. The pre-trial deal was also struck after Mr Discus was deemed competent for trial amid questions over his mental capacity. The District Attorney's Office consulted with the victim's family before finalizing the agreement and sentencing.</p>

<p>Mr Whittmore also expressed gratitude to the Waller County Sheriff's Office for their thorough investigation and service to the victim's family and the community.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK government minister on Tuesday slammed American tech billionaire Elon Musk for his "unacceptable" comments on social media about far-right riots gripping England and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The owner of X drew criticism for writing on the site on Sunday that a British "civil war" was inevitable. He sparked further ire on Monday with a provocative reply to a tweet by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>"Use of language such as a 'civil war' is in no way acceptable," said justice minister Heidi Alexander, branding Musk's comments "deeply irresponsible".</p>

<p>"We are seeing police officers being seriously injured, buildings set alight, and so I really do think that everyone who has a platform should be exercising their power responsibly," she told Times Radio.</p>

<p>Riots by anti-immigrant demonstrators have spread across England following the murder of three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, northwest England, on Monday last week.</p>

<p>They have been fuelled by online disinformation that the stabbing suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker. He is 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who was born in Britain.</p>

<p>The rioters have targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers, forcing the government to provide emergency security to Islamic places of worship.</p>

<p>In a post on X on Monday, Starmer vowed to apply "criminal law online as well as offline", adding that "we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities".</p>

<p>Musk replied: "Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?"</p>

<p><strong>'No justification'</strong></p>

<p>His original "civil war" post came in a reply to another X user blaming the riots on "the effects of mass migration and open borders".</p>

<p>Starmer's spokesperson said Monday there was "no justification" for the comment.</p>

<p>Influencer Andrew Tate and far-right, anti-Islam figurehead Tommy Robinson are among people promoting false claims about Rudakubana on X.</p>

<p>Starmer's spokesperson also blamed "bot activity online", suggesting that the false rumours could have been "amplified with the involvement of state actors".</p>

<p>EuropeInvasion, an anti-immigrant X account with hundreds of thousands of followers, still has a post up falsely claiming that the attacker was "confirmed to be Muslim".</p>

<p>An AI-generated image depicting Muslim men chasing a child wearing a British flag has over 900,000 views.</p>

<p>Technology minister Peter Kyle met representatives from TikTok, Meta, Google, and X on Monday and warned that social media users spreading misinformation will have "nowhere to hide".</p>

<p>Musk -- who has reduced content moderation on the platform since taking over Twitter, instead relying on user-written "community notes" -- regularly voices support for right-wing causes and politicians like Donald Trump in the US and Javier Milei in Argentina.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's former Information and Technology Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak was detained at the Dhaka International Airport today while he was trying to leave the country. The military, which has formed an interim government in the violence-hit country, detained the former minister a day after the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Mr Ahmed was approached by airport officials while he was waiting at the VIP lounge of the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, as per reports. He was later detained by Air Force officials.</p>

<p>He was trying to fly to India, where Ms Hasina also fled to on Monday as protesters forced their way into her palace, according to several reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bangladesh witnessed scenes of chaos and anger yesterday, its deadliest day since anti-government protests began in early July, with police reporting mobs launching revenge attacks on Sheikh Hasina's allies.</p>

<p>Offices of her party Awam League across the country were torched and looted.</p>

<p>Protesters stormed parliament and burnt TV stations. Footage showed some smashing the statue of Ms Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina landed at a military airbase near New Delhi on Monday evening. As per sources, she wanted to transit on to London. However, there has been no confirmation of the former Prime Minister's schedule or, about her location since then.</p>

<p>The UK government, meanwhile, has said their immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to their country to seek asylum or temporary refuge. "Individuals seeking asylum must do so in the first safe country they reach," the UK Home Office told NDTV.</p>

<p>The unrest in Bangladesh began last month against civil service job quotas. What started as protests later escalated into wider calls for Sheikh Hasina to stand down. She was made to resign by the military that, as per sources, gave her a "45-minute ultimatum".</p>

<p>The army chief met President Mohammed Shahabuddin late Monday, alongside key opposition leaders, with the president's press team saying it had been "decided to form an interim government immediately".</p>

<p>Shahabuddin also ordered the release of prisoners from the protests, as well as former prime minister and a bitter rival of Ms Hasina, Khaleda Zia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muhammad Yunus was on Sunday acquitted in a graft case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission, three days after he took oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government, according to a media report.</p>

<p>Judge Md Rabiul Alam of the Special Judge's Court-4 of Dhaka accepted the Anti-Corruption Commission's application which was filed with the court, seeking withdrawal of prosecution of the case, following section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an official of the anti-graft agency was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.</p>

<p>On August 7, a Dhaka court acquitted Yunus and three top officials of Grameen Telecom - Ashraful Hassan, M Shahjahan and Nurjahan Begum - in a labour law violation case.</p>

<p>Yunus, the 84-year-old economist, on Thursday took oath as the chief adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>Nurjahan Begum, who was also an accused in the graft case, is a member of the 16-member Council of Advisers which will assist Yunus in running the state's affairs.</p>

<p>Yunus had been in a protracted row with the Sheikh Hasina government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.</p>

<p>Bangladesh authorities launched a review of the statutory Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.</p>

<p>Yunus was charged under dozens of cases during Hasina's regime.</p>

<p>In January, a court sentenced Yunus to six months in jail on charges of labour law violation.</p>

<p>Many people believe Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced that he would form a political party in 2007 when a military-backed government ran the country and Hasina was in prison.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of mourners gathered Sunday in Southport, northwest England, for the funeral of a nine-year-old girl killed in last month's knife attack, which sparked more than a week of nationwide disorder.</p>

<p>Family, friends, community leaders and emergency responders all joined Alice da Silva Aguiar's parents for an emotional ceremony at a Catholic church in the seaside town, nearly two weeks after the mass stabbing that shocked the country.</p>

<p>Attendees had been asked to wear white, a tradition for some in Portugal, where Alice's parents hail from.</p>

<p>Locals lining the main road clapped as the funeral cortege -- bearing a small white coffin, resting on a carriage pulled by two white horses with colourful feathers -- passed by.</p>

<p>"Of course we're here -- it's the Southport spirit," said one man who turned out. "We're here to pay our respects."</p>

<p>Pink ribbons and balloons had been tied to lampposts and garden walls near the church.</p>

<p>Several hundred people packed inside the venue for the service -- featuring short addresses, readings, prayers and hymns -- which was relayed on loudspeakers to those who had gathered outside.</p>

<p>Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of the primary school the nine-year-old attended, was among those to speak movingly.</p>

<p>"Alice, you will forever be in our hearts," she told the congregation.</p>

<p>The July 29 mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class killed two other girls -- Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven -- and injured 10 others including eight children.</p>

<p>Those wounded have all since been released from hospital.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unimaginable violence'</strong></h3>

<p>Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, described Saturday how their "world was shattered by the loss of our precious daughter".</p>

<p>"She was taken from us in an unimaginable act of violence that has left our hearts broken beyond repair," they said in a statement released through police, adding she was "full of joy, light, and love".</p>

<p>The couple also revealed their elder daughter, Genie, witnessed the attack and managed to escape.</p>

<p>The stabbings sparked a riot in Southport the following evening, on July 30, and violence in more than a dozen English towns and cities as well as Northern Ireland over the ensuing week.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed the violence on far-right agitators and opportunist "thugs" accused of using the tragedy to further their anti-immigration, anti-Muslim agenda.</p>

<p>Misinformation spread online in the immediate aftermath of the stabbing spree claimed that the perpetrator was a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>British-born Axel Rudakubana has been charged with murder and attempted murder over the attack. His parents hail from Rwanda, which is overwhelmingly Christian.</p>

<p>A motive for the attack has not been disclosed, but police have said it is not being treated as terrorism-related.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian courts have reduced jail terms for two female journalists charged with collaborating with the United States, their lawyers told reformist newspapers on Sunday.</p>

<p>Elaheh Mohammadi, 37, and Niloufar Hamedi, 31, are out on bail after more than a year in Tehran's Evin prison for their coverage of the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini which had sparked nationwide protests.</p>

<p>In January, Iran's judiciary said it had launched new proceedings against the two women for posing for pictures without the mandatory headscarf upon their release that month.</p>

<p>Two separate appeals courts in Tehran ruled to acquit the women of the charge of collaboration with the United States, the lawyers were quoted as saying by Shargh and Ham Mihan dailies.</p>

<p>Originally, Mohammadi had been sentenced to six years in jail while Hamedi had been handed a seven-year sentence, according to the judiciary.</p>

<p>The pair were also each given five-year sentences for collusion and conspiring against state security and one year for propaganda against the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>The lawyers said these sentences were upheld by the appeals court and would be served concurrently, adding, however, that they hope the journalists would be freed under an amnesty announced last year by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>"Considering that the remaining two accusations meet the full conditions of the amnesty directive of 2023, we hope that Elaheh Mohammadi will be pardoned, and this case will be closed by issuing a suspension of execution order," Mohammadi's lawyer Shahab Mirlohi told Ham Mihan newspaper.</p>

<p>Hamedi's lawyers issued a similar statement.</p>

<p>Hamedi, a photographer for Shargh, was arrested less than a week after Amini's death after posting a picture of the young woman's grieving family on social media.</p>

<p>Ham Mihan reporter Mohammadi was arrested after going to Amini's hometown of Saqez, in the western Iranian province of Kurdistan, to cover her funeral which turned into a demonstration.</p>

<p>Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for an alleged breach of strict dress rules for women, in place since shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>

<p>Following her death, months-long protests shook Iran, with hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, killed in the unrest, and thousands of demonstrators arrested.</p>

<p>Nine men were executed in cases related to the protests which Iranian authorities generally labelled "foreign-instigated riots".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's new interim government helmed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said on Sunday it had "grave concern" over reports of attacks on Hindus and other religious minorities in the past week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's new interim government said Sunday it was working to resolve attacks on Hindus and other religious minorities reported after the dramatic ouster of autocratic premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hindus are the largest minority faith in mostly Muslim Bangladesh and are considered a steadfast support base for Hasina's party, the Awami League.</p>

<p>After Hasina's abrupt resignation and flight abroad on Monday brought an end to her 15 years of autocratic rule, there were numerous reports of attacks against Hindu households, temples and businesses.</p>

<p>"The attacks on religious minorities in some places have been noted with grave concern," the interim cabinet said in its first official statement since its Thursday appointment.</p>

<p>The cabinet said it would "immediately sit with the representative bodies and other concerned groups to find ways to resolve such heinous attacks".</p>

<p>Sunday's statement from the self-styled "council of advisors" tasked with steering democratic reforms in the South Asian nation of 170 million people listed numerous urgent priorities.</p>

<p>The government, led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, ordered "support" for the families of protesters who were killed in the weeks of demonstrations culminating in Hasina's departure.</p>

<p>It directed public funds to pay for those injured in the unrest, which began in July and killed more than 450 people.</p>

<p>The council also said it would reopen the metro system in the capital Dhaka by the end of the week and soon appoint a new central bank governor, replacing a Hasina loyalist forced to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>Institutional purge</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier in the day a new chief justice was sworn in to office the day after his predecessor, another Hasina ally accused of sublimating the Supreme Court to her government's will, quit following protester demands.</p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of fresh appointments to replace an old guard viewed as linked to the previous regime, ousted by the student-led uprising.</p>

<p>New top justice Syed Refaat Ahmed studied at the University of Dhaka, Oxford and Tufts University in the United States.</p>

<p>Ahmed replaced Obaidul Hassan after hundreds of protesters gathered outside the court to demand the latter step-down.</p>

<p>Appointed last year, Hassan earlier oversaw a much-criticised war crimes tribunal that ordered the execution of Hasina's opponents, and his brother was her longtime secretary.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents, during her 15-year rule.</p>

<p>Cabinet ministers left blindsided by her sudden fall have gone to ground, while several other top appointees have been forced out of office, including the national police chief.</p>

<p>Interim leader Yunus, 84, returned from Europe on Thursday to lead a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of ending disorder and enacting democratic reforms.</p>

<p>The restoration of law and order was the caretaker administration's "first priority", Yunus said.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.</p>

<p>He took office as "chief advisor" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, and has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A climber scaled the north face of the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Sunday, the last day of the Olympics, before he was intercepted by police mid-way up, police said.</p>

<p>"At 2.45 pm, an individual was seen climbing the Eiffel Tower. The police immediately intervened and arrested the individual," a police spokesman said.</p>

<p>Videos posted on social media showed the bare-chested climber skirting the Olympic rings as he made his way up without ropes.</p>

<p>In one, the grinning climber can be heard saying to bystanders "bloody warm, innit?" as he is escorted off the viewing platform by police.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Identifying China as both a competitor and an adversary, Republican vice presidential nominee Senator J D Vance said on Sunday that his party wants to establish a robust international framework where the US can "check" Beijing.</p>

<p>"I think they're both, right, and I think that what we want to do here is build the kind of international order where we can check China," Mr Vance told CBS in an interview when asked if he views Beijing as a competitor or an adversary.</p>

<p>"We don't want to go to war with China, but certainly they're an adversary...for example, the Chinese know that they're manufacturing tons of fentanyl, they're letting them come into our country. (Vice president and Democratic presidential candidate) Kamala Harris has done nothing about this," Mr Vance said in "Face the Nation" programme.</p>

<p>He said Harris should apply diplomatic and economic leverage on the Chinese to stop manufacturing fentanyl, which is smuggled into the Mexican drug cartels and subsequently shipped into the US.</p>

<p>Responding to a question, Mr Vance said China needs to be warned about it.</p>

<p>"You walk to Beijing, you talk to (President) Xi Jinping, and you say, your entire economy is going to collapse unless you get access to American markets. You need to take this fentanyl seriously or we are going to impose serious tariffs and economic penalties for not following our laws and not helping us stem the flow of this deadly poison," he said.</p>

<p>This is unlikely going to impact the American economy, Mr Vance said.</p>

<p>"I think that we have a powerful economy, with the best workers in the entire world. If we need to fight a trade war with the Chinese, we will fight it and we will win it, but we cannot do what Kamala Harris has done, which is be so terrified of using the economic power that we have that she's not even willing to stop the flow of this deadly poison coming into our country," he claimed.</p>

<p>According to the Ohio Senator, the former president and Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, gets along with world leaders, and there's nothing wrong with him complimenting them as people, if it makes him more effective diplomatically.</p>

<p>"If you actually have a good relationship with people and they trust you to follow your word. We have to remember that Democrats, including Kamala Harris, attacked Donald Trump for having a good relationship with Vladimir Putin. Well, when Donald Trump was president, Vladimir Putin didn't invade another country.</p>

<p>"...So maybe they should take a lesson from Trump's pray - playbook about diplomatic legitimacy, because I think Donald Trump got a lot done because world leaders respected him," Mr Vance said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An airstrike on a vehicle in eastern Syria near the porous border with Iraq killed at least five fighters from pro-Iran units, two security sources in the region told Reuters.</p>

<p>One of the sources said the strike was carried out by a drone, but could not specify which military the drone belonged to. The second source said it targeted fighters as they changed shifts at a checkpoint.</p>

<p>Swathes of Syria's eastern border with Iraq are controlled by armed groups aligned with Iran and who fought on behalf of Syria's armed forces throughout the country's civil war.</p>

<p>They include Iraqi armed groups that also control the Iraqi side of the frontier.</p>

<p>The border is now a smuggling hub, with weapons brought across from Iraq into Syria and other goods flowing into Iraq.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Israel have both carried out strikes in Syria against Iran-aligned factions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since dropping out of the White House race, warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since dropping out of the White House race, warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, if he wins... this election, watch what happens," Biden told CBS News in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday.</p>

<p>"He's a genuine danger to American security. Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."</p>

<p>Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since withdrawing after his flailing debate performance against Trump underlined fears about his age and mental abilities.</p>

<p>In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week, he appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."</p>

<p>Explaining his exit, he said other Democratic Party politicians standing for re-election feared he would damage their chances -- and added that his only priority was to stop Trump from returning to power.</p>

<p>"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he said.</p>

<p>"A critical issue for me still is -- not a joke -- maintaining this democracy.</p>

<p>"I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is -- we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."</p>

<h3><strong>Helping Harris</strong></h3>

<p>Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery -- and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.</p>

<p>Biden's age had come to dominate the 2024 campaign, and the Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since his exit, as Harris has enjoyed a surge in support that has left Trump struggling.</p>

<p>The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to stay on.</p>

<p>"I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth, but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.</p>

<p>Trump's light campaign schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, J.D. Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.</p>

<p>Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about white supremacist attacks on his family, child care, asylum seekers and abortion.</p>

<p>In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's new president presented his cabinet to parliament on Sunday for a vote of confidence, state media reported, proposing seasoned pragmatic diplomat Abbas Araqchi as foreign minister at a time of heightened regional tensions.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian is shaping his cabinet at a time of an increased risk of escalation of the conflict in Gaza into a broader regional war, after the recent killings of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and of Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut drew threats of retaliation against Israel.</p>

<p>Following the death of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May, Pezeshkian won a snap election last month by promising to improve ties with the world, promoting a pragmatic foreign policy, and to ease social restrictions at home.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian's proposed cabinet lineup requires lawmakers' approval and parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said that parliamentary commissions will start reviewing his candidates on Monday.</p>

<p>Araqchi, 61, who was Iran's ambassador to several countries, including Japan, played a key role in negotiating Tehran's 2015 nuclear agreement with six world powers, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump exited in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on Iran.</p>

<p>Araqchi later led Iran's negotiators during multilateral efforts - ultimately unsuccessful - to revive the pact via indirect diplomacy with Washington before he was replaced by hardline Ali Bagheri Kani in 2021.</p>

<p>The president's powers are limited in the Islamic Republic by those of the Supreme Leader, who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, appoints the head of the judiciary and has the last say on major policies.</p>

<p>Tensions between Iran and the West have increased over Tehran's fast-advancing nuclear programme and its threats to "harshly punish" Israel over the assassination of Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Tehran and Hamas accuse Israel of carrying it out, though it has not claimed or denied responsibility for the killing.</p>

<p>Separately, Iran's president nominated Mohsen Paknezhad as oil minister, who has served as deputy oil minister overseeing hydrocarbon resources between 2018 and 2021.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian has also nominated Farzaneh Sadeq as the road and transportation minister. If approved by the parliament, she would become only the second woman cabinet minister in the Islamic Republic's history.</p>

<p>The first one was appointed in 2009 by hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who was president at the time.</p>

<p>Under the president's proposed lineup Raisi's Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib would keep his position in the new cabinet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China supports Iran in defending its "sovereignty, security and national dignity", Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told Iran's acting foreign minister in a phone call on Sunday, according to a statement by China's foreign ministry.</p>

<p>In the phone call, Wang repeated Beijing's denunciation of the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, saying the strike had violated Iran's sovereignty and threatened regional stability.</p>

<p>Iran and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas have accused Israel of carrying out strike that killed Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility for the killing, which has fueled concern that the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip was turning into a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Iran has vowed to "harshly punish" Israel over the assassination.</p>

<p>Wang told Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister, that the killing of Haniyeh had "directly undermined the Gaza ceasefire negotiation process and undermined regional peace and stability," China's foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>"China supports Iran in defending its sovereignty, security and national dignity in accordance with the law, and in its efforts to maintain regional peace and stability, and stands ready to maintain close communication with Iran," Wang was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday nominated Abbas Araqchi as the country's foreign minister. Araqchi had been Iran's chief negotiator in nuclear talks from 2013 to 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's army appeared to acknowledge Sunday that Ukrainian units had driven deep into the country, saying it had hit troops and equipment around 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a surprise border incursion last Tuesday, shocking Russia, which has sent in additional reserves, tanks, drones, artillery and aviation to try to quash the offensive.</p>

<p>The defence ministry in Moscow said Sunday that its troops had "foiled attempts by enemy mobile groups with armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory."</p>

<p>But in an apparent sign of how far some Ukrainian units have managed to advance, it said it had hit enemy units near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>A senior Ukrainian official told AFP that "thousands" of its troops had been deployed to the operation.</p>

<p>Russia's army said Sunday it had continued to use aviation, drones and artillery to try to put down the attack.</p>

<p>It also said it had foiled an attempt by Ukraine to break into another border district of the Kursk region, further to the south from where the bulk of the fighting has occurred so far.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK government said on Sunday schools in England could teach children how to spot extremist and online content spreading "putrid conspiracy theories", under planned changes to the national curriculum.</p>

<p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she was launching a review of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools to introduce critical thinking across multiple subjects.</p>

<p>It follows recent disorder in more than a dozen English towns and cities following the Southport knife attack, which officials say were fuelled by misinformation online and far-right agitators.</p>

<p>The stabbing spree, allegedly carried out by British-born Axel Rudakubana, who was aged 17 at the time, left three children dead. Police have not disclosed a suspected motive for the attack but said it is not being treated as terrorism.</p>

<p>Online speculation in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy falsely claimed Rudakubana was a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>"It's more important than ever that we give young people the knowledge and skills to be able to challenge what they see online," Phillipson told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.</p>

<p>"That's why our curriculum review will develop plans to embed critical skills in lessons to arm our children against the disinformation, fake news and putrid conspiracy theories awash on social media."</p>

<p>Under the envisaged changes, students would analyse newspaper articles in English lessons to help spot fabricated clickbait, while computer classes would include analysing statistics in context.</p>

<p>However, the review is not set to report its findings and recommendations until next year, meaning reforms would not come into force until the school year starting in September, 2025, according to the Telegraph.</p>

<p>The moves are set to be combined with tougher regulation of social media sites and online content, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggesting imminent action on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lawyer of the main suspect in a foiled plot to carry out an attack at Taylor Swift concert in Vienna on Sunday sought to play down the seriousness of the plan, saying her client was only "playing with ideas".</p>

<p>Swift's three planned concerts this week were cancelled after Austrian authorities discovered a plot allegedly led by a 19-year-old to carry out an ISIS-inspired suicide attack at a soccer stadium where tens of thousands of fans were planning to attend the shows.</p>

<p>Austrian investigators said the youth had recently sworn a pledge to ISIS and had made a full confession after police raided his house, seizing chemicals, machetes and other devices the plotters planned to use in a bomb attack.</p>

<p>Lawyer Ina-Christin Stiglitz told Reuters the youth had only been involved with ISIS for the past month.</p>

<p>"It interested him," she said, suggesting that her client had not really intended to carry out a serious attack.</p>

<p>"It was just playing with ideas," she said. "He says the bomb wasn't of good enough quality, it wouldn't have worked."</p>

<p>He had researched online on how to build a bomb, she added.</p>

<p>Among three other teenagers Austrian police have detained in the investigation was a 17-year-old youth, whom Stiglitz said her client had described as his "best friend and neighbour".</p>

<p>Neighbours of the 19-year-old in the small town of Ternitz expressed shock at his arrest, describing him as reserved but friendly. One of few hints pointing to potential radicalization was that he had recently grown a long beard, they said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question about why he had changed his appearance, his lawyer said: "He wanted to be cool."</p>

<p>Chancellor Karl Nehammer said earlier that Austria's intelligence agencies should have greater power to monitor communications on messaging apps to stop extremists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A BSF officer is winning hearts for his calmness while explaining hundreds of Bangladesh refugees gathered at India's border why they cannot let them in.&nbsp;The video, shared by former Union Minister and Shiv Sena leader Milind Deora, shows the officer speaking to a group of refugees in a border area in West Bengal's Coochbehar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking in Bengali, the officer is heard saying, "We all know the problems you are facing. You have come here, but a discussion is required. The problem cannot be solved in this manner. We cannot let you in even if we want."</p>

<p>As the gathering protests, the officer continues, "Please listen to me, nothing will come out of shouting. The whole world knows your problem. But a discussion is needed. Once the discussion happens, we will see how we can protect you. You can see, senior officers are here. But if you say that we have to allow you immediately, is that possible?"</p>

<p>"I request you on behalf of my country. Your problems would be addressed through a discussion. We request you to go back, a solution cannot be find in an hour or two," the officer is heard saying in a video shared by The Indian Express.</p>

<p>Voices from the crowd are heard pleading with the BSF personnel to let them. "They will burn our homes, we will face atrocities," the crowd shouts.</p>

<p>The BSF officer says the officers know they are in trouble. "My seniors have had discussions with your force. They will listen to your problems. They have asked you to return," he says.</p>

<p>Praising the officer for his composure, Mr Deora said in a post on X, "This video of a BSF officer calmly explaining to Bangladeshis why they can't enter India illegally is heartbreaking, inspirational &amp; reassuring all at once."</p>

<p>"Heartbreaking to see the desperation; inspirational to witness the officer's calm composure; reassuring to know the government is committed to securing India's borders," said the Rajya Sabha MP, who switched from the Congress to the Eknath Shinde-led Sena earlier this year.</p>

<p>Bangladeshi nationals fleeing violence and arson in the aftermath of Sheikh Hasina's ouster as Prime Minister have gathered at India's borders in several areas.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Sunday acknowledged Ukrainian forces had pierced deep into the Kursk border region in an offensive that a top official in Ukraine said was aimed to "destabilise" Russia and "stretch" its armed forces.</p>

<p>Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official told AFP, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.</p>

<p>"We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border," the security official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The shock assault, now in its sixth day, appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army rushing in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash the incursion.</p>

<p>But it's army on Sunday appeared to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) in places.</p>

<p>In a daily briefing on the situation in the western Kursk region, the defence ministry said it had "foiled attempts" by Ukraine's forces to "break through deep into Russian territory" using armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>But it said some of those forces were located near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official also said Russia's claims that Kyiv had deployed 1,000 troops were a serious underestimation.</p>

<p>"It is a lot more... Thousands," they said.</p>

<p>After days of official silence, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the offensive for the first time in his nightly address on Saturday, saying that Kyiv was "pushing the war into the aggressor's territory".</p>

<h3><strong>'Helicopters over your head'</strong></h3>

<p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has waged an unrelenting campaign, occupying swathes of the east and south and subjecting Ukrainian cities to daily missile and drone attacks.</p>

<p>After re-capturing large areas in 2022, Kyiv has largely been on the back foot, increasingly struggling with manpower and arms supplies.</p>

<p>The assault on Russia's western Kursk region has been the largest and most successful cross-border offensive by Kyiv so far -- and the most significant attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since the Second World War.</p>

<p>Russia has used air power, artillery fire and drones in a bid to quash the advance.</p>

<p>It said Saturday that more than 76,000 civilians had been evacuated from border areas, with more leaving on Sunday.</p>

<p>Russia's rail operator has put on emergency trains from Kursk to Moscow, around 450 kilometres away, for those looking to flee.</p>

<p>"It's scary to have helicopters flying over your head all the time. When it was possible to leave, I left," said Marina, refusing to give her surname, who had arrived on a train to the Russian capital on Sunday.</p>

<p>An overnight Ukrainian missile strike on a residential building in Kursk city, around 80 kilometres from the fighting wounded 15, Russian officials said.</p>

<p>Across the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, from where Ukraine launched the incursion, AFP journalists on Sunday saw dozens of armoured vehicles daubed with a white triangle -- the insignia apparently being used to identify Ukrainian military hardware being used in the attack.</p>

<h3><strong>'Taste' of war</strong></h3>

<p>Ukraine's Sumy region has also come under retaliatory fire, and authorities there plan to evacuate some 20,000 people from the border zone.</p>

<p>At an evacuation centre in the regional capital of Sumy, retired metal worker Mykola, who had fled his village of Khotyn some 26 kilometres from the Russian border, said the offensive had given him a morale boost.</p>

<p>"Let's let them find out what it's like. They don't understand what war is. Let them have a taste of it," the 70-year-old told AFP, despite being forced to leave his home.</p>

<p>Analysts said Kyiv may have launched the assault in a bid to relieve pressure on its troops in other parts of the sprawling front line.</p>

<p>But the Ukrainian official said there had been little effect so far on fighting in the east.</p>

<p>"Their pressure in the east continues, they are not pulling back troops from the area," he said, adding that "the intensity of Russian attacks has gone down a little bit".</p>

<p>Russia has announced a local state of emergency in the Kursk region, as well as a "counter-terror operation" there and in two other border regions.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said he expected Russia would "in the end" manage to stop the incursion and that Ukraine was bracing for retaliation with a large-scale missile attack, including "on decision-making centres" in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of Bangladesh's toppled autocratic leader thanked New Delhi on Sunday for "saving her life", accused caretaker authorities of allowing "mob rule" and warned of chaos ahead without swift elections.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, 76, quit as prime minister on Monday after a student-led uprising and fled by helicopter to longtime ally India.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents during her 15-year tenure.</p>

<p>The military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, lead a caretaker administration, charged with ending disorder and enacting democratic reforms.</p>

<p>However, Hasina's son and former government adviser, US-based Sajeeb Wazed Joy, 53, criticised the interim government as "completely powerless" and composed of "figureheads".</p>

<p>"Right now in Bangladesh, you have mob rule," he told AFP in an interview from Washington.</p>

<p>He pointed to the ouster of top officials, including the chief justice, central bank governor and police chief, following protesters' demands.</p>

<p>"If the mob tomorrow says, 'no, we want this person in the interim government changed', they will have to be changed," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Devolve into chaos'</strong></h3>

<p>Yunus has said he wants elections "within a few months", but Wazed warned of risks if they were delayed.</p>

<p>"It's in their best interest to hold elections... to have a return to a legitimate government that has the legitimacy of the people and true authority," he said.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, it's just going to devolve into chaos."</p>

<p>Hasina swept January elections but only after a poll denounced as neither free nor fair and boycotted by genuine rivals after a crackdown during which thousands of opposition party members were arrested.</p>

<p>Members of Hasina's millions-strong Awami League have gone into hiding since she fled. There have been reprisal attacks against them and party offices have been torched.</p>

<p>But Wazed said the party was critical to the political future of the South Asian nation of some 170 million people.</p>

<p>"We have tens of millions of followers; they're not going anywhere," he said.</p>

<p>"You're not going to be able to establish democracy in Bangladesh without the Awami League. It will never be accepted by half the people of the country at least."</p>

<p>Former opposition groups such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of repression, the BNP holding a peaceful mass rally in Dhaka since Monday.</p>

<p>"It's going to be between the BNP and the Awami League," Wazed said. "We need to work together."</p>

<h3><strong>'Excessive force'</strong></h3>

<p>Wazed sought to divert blame for his mother's ouster onto others in government.</p>

<p>"Were mistakes made? Of course," he said. "They were made by people at the bottom, or in the chain of command... Blaming my mother for it is unfortunate."</p>

<p>While accepting that police officers who fired on protesters had gone too far, he argued that there was violence on both sides.</p>

<p>"Some of the police used excessive force but there were attacks on the police too -- police members were killed as well. The violence wasn't one-sided," he said.</p>

<p>"And then as it escalated further, the protesters started attacking police with firearms, weapons."</p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed in the unrest leading up to Hasina's fall -- 42 of whom were police officers, according to the national police chief.</p>

<p>Wazed alleged unidentified foreign forces had supported the protests, a claim for which he provided no evidence.</p>

<p>"I believe, at this point, it is from beyond Bangladesh," he said.</p>

<p>"Only an intelligence agency would have the capability of smuggling and supplying weapons to protesters."</p>

<p>It is not clear what Hasina will do next.</p>

<p>Wazed offered his "gratitude to the government of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi for saving her life and keeping her safe".</p>

<p>New Delhi saw a common threat in groups Hasina viewed as rivals and crushed with brutal force, including the BNP, according to analysts.</p>

<p>Hasina has been hosted in a secret safe house and hasn't spoken publicly since arriving at a military airbase near New Delhi.</p>

<p>It isn't clear how long she will now stay in India but Wazed said there "has been no such plans as of yet" of her moving to a third country.</p>

<p>"My mother never wanted to leave her country -- her dream is to retire there," he said, adding he spoke to her every day.</p>

<p>"This was going to be her last term. She's 76 years old. And so she just wants to go back home. Whether she'll be able to, we're waiting to see."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's new chief justice has been sworn into office after his predecessor, viewed as a loyalist of toppled premier Sheikh Hasina, quit following protester demands, a presidential official said Sunday.</p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of fresh appointments to replace an old guard viewed as linked to the previous regime, ousted by the student-led uprising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Syed Refaat Ahmed, the senior-most high court judge, was sworn into office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, the president's press secretary Shiplu Zaman told AFP.</p>

<p>"He became the 25th chief justice of Bangladesh," Zaman said.</p>

<p>Ahmed studied at the University of Dhaka, Oxford and Tufts University in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents over her 15-year rule.</p>

<p>Cabinet ministers left blindsided by her sudden fall have gone to ground, while several top appointees have been forced out of office -- including the national police chief and the central bank governor.</p>

<p>Ahmed's predecessor Obaidul Hassan on Saturday became the latest to announce his departure, after hundreds of protesters gathered outside the court to demand he step down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Appointed last year, Hassan earlier oversaw a much-criticised war crimes tribunal that ordered the execution of Hasina's opponents, and his brother was her longtime secretary.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader, Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus, 84, returned from Europe this week to lead a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of ending disorder and enacting democratic reforms.</p>

<p>The restoration of law and order is the caretaker administration's "first priority", Yunus said.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He took office Thursday as "chief advisor" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, and has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">NASA has shared a captivating image of the Earth's terminator, the thin line separating day and night.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The picture, taken from the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting 267 miles above the Pacific Ocean, shows the breathtaking moment when a new day dawns on our planet.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ISS, which completes 16 orbits of the Earth in 24 hours, offers a unique vantage point to witness the terminator, a phenomenon that occurs when the sun's rays illuminate the Earth's atmosphere, creating a distinct boundary between night and day. This boundary is visible as a thin, glowing line on the horizon, where the blue of the atmosphere meets the golden hues of sunrise.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Understanding the Earth's terminator</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">The Earth's terminator is the moving line that separates day and night on our planet, as per <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11353#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20this%20from,in%20sync%20with%20the%20seasons.">NASA</a>. It is a result of the Earth's rotation and its position relative to the Sun. It passes through most locations on Earth twice a day, once for sunrise and once for sunset, except for areas near the North and South Poles which experience long periods of darkness or sunlight during winter or summer months.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>How Earth's terminator affects/changes seasons</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">The Earth's axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees, which causes the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. This tilt leads to the changing of the seasons, NASA says.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During the equinoxes (March and September), the Earth's axis is perpendicular to its orbit, and the terminator is straight. Both hemispheres receive equal amounts of sunlight, resulting in milder temperatures and moderate weather.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The solstices (June and December) occur when the Earth's tilt is most pronounced, and the terminator is curved. One hemisphere receives more daylight than the other, resulting in the longest and shortest days of the year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Earth's tilt also affects the distribution of sunlight, impacting the length of days and nights. As the terminator moves, it alters the environment and influences natural processes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The March equinox typically occurs around March 20/21, and the September equinox around September 22/23. The June solstice occurs around June 20/21, and the December solstice around December 21/22. These dates can vary slightly due to the Earth's elliptical orbit and the gravitational pull of other celestial bodies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Sunday condemned Chinese air force actions in waters of the South China Sea claimed by both countries, calling the actions "unjustified, illegal and reckless".</p>

<p>Manila and Beijing accused each other on Saturday of disrupting their militaries' operations around the Scarborough Shoal in the first incident since Marcos took office in 2022 in which the Philippines has complained of dangerous actions by Chinese aircraft, as opposed to navy or coast guard vessels.</p>

<p>The Philippine military on Saturday condemned "dangerous and provocative actions" when two Chinese aircraft dropped flares in the path of a Philippine aircraft during a routine patrol around the shoal on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Chinese military's Southern Theatre Command countered that the Philippines had disrupted its training, accusing Manila of "illegally intruding" into Chinese airspace.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Marcos urged China to act responsibly both in the seas and in the skies.</p>

<p>"We have hardly started to calm the waters, and it is already worrying that there could be instability in our airspace," Marcos said in a statement posted by the Presidential Communications Office on the social media platform X.</p>

<p>The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Scarborough Shoal is one of Asia's most contested maritime features and a flashpoint for flare-ups over sovereignty and fishing rights.</p>

<p>Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual shipborne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>

<p>China rejects a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that Beijing's expansive claims had no basis under international law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before she resigned as Bangladesh Prime Minister and fled her Dhaka residence, Sheikh Hasina wanted to address the nation, especially the protesters whose agitation forced her to quit the top job. That speech was never delivered as the protesters reached her doorstep and the country's top security officers advised to leave at the earliest.</p>

<p><strong>Big Charge Against US</strong></p>

<p>Now in India, the 76-year-old has spoken to her close associates about the undelivered speech, accessed by NDTV. In the letter, Sheikh Hasina has accused the US for plotting a regime change in the country and would have said this in her speech if she got a chance.</p>

<p>"I resigned so that I did not have to see the procession of dead bodies. They wanted to come to power over the dead bodies of students, but I did not allow it. I resigned from premiership. I could have remained in power if I had surrendered the sovereignty of Saint Martin Island and allowed America to hold sway over the Bay of Bengal. I beseech to the people of my land, please do not be manipulated by radicals," her undelivered speech says.</p>

<p>The Saint Martin island has an area of just 3 square kilometres and is located in the northeastern part of Bay of Bengal. It is the southernmost part of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"Maybe, if I had stayed in the country, more lives would have been lost. I have removed myself. You were my strength, you did not want me, so I have left," it adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In her message to her party members, she has said Awami League has always bounced back. "Don't lose hope. I will return soon. I have lost but the people of Bangladesh have won, the people for whom my father, my family died," the speech adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Awami League leader had to resign and flee the country amid violent protests by students that started as an agitation against reservation and snowballed into a stand-off with the Sheikh Hasina government. Over 400 protesters were killed as the veteran leader tried to crush the protests.</p>

<p><strong>Hasina Clarifies Razakar Remark</strong></p>

<p>"If I had remained in the country, more lives would have been lost more resources would have been destroyed. I made the extremely difficult decision to exit. I became your leader because you chose me, you were my strength," the undelivered speech says.</p>

<p>It adds that she is pained by the targeting of Awami League leaders and that she "will return soon". "Awami League has stood up again and again. I shall forever pray for the future of Bangladesh."</p>

<p>She also clarified that she never called the protesting students Razakars.</p>

<p>In one of the statements during the protests, Sheikh Hasina had said, "If not the grandchildren of the freedom fighters, then who will get quota benefits? The grandchildren of the 'Razakars'?" The word, used to refer to a paramilitary force recruited by the Pakistani army during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, sparked a massive backlash and the protests intensified. In her undelivered address to the nation, the Awami League leader has said, "I have never called you Razakars. Rather my words were distorted to incite you. I request you to watch the full video."</p>

<p><strong>Hasina's Rocky Ties With US</strong></p>

<p>Relations between the US and Bangladesh had nosedived during Sheikh Hasina's term so much so that Washington DC had said the January elections in which Awami League returned to power were not free or fair.</p>

<p>Months before her exit, Sheikh Hasina had claimed that "conspiracies" were being hatched to topple her government and alleged a "white man's" plot to carve a new "Christian country" out of Bangladesh and Myanmar. "If I allowed a certain country to build an airbase in Bangladesh, then I would have had no problem," she had said in May.</p>

<p>Following her resignation and escape, the US said, "The United States has long called for respecting democratic rights in Bangladesh, and we urge that the interim government formation be democratic and inclusive." Washington DC also said that the US greatly values its relationship with the people of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Earlier, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller had condemned the violence against protesters. "We condemn any violence against peaceful protesters. We've been watching this matter very closely, both from our embassy and officials here in Washington. (We) have been monitoring the protests, have seen the reports of people dying, being killed in the protests. And we again, call on the government to uphold individual's rights to protest peacefully," he had said.</p>

<p><strong>What's Happening In Bangladesh</strong></p>

<p>With Sheikh Hasina gone, an interim government under Nobel peace prize winner and Grameen Bank founder Muhammad Yunus has taken charge. Amid reports of attacks on minorities, he has asked students leading the protests to ensure that they their efforts are sabotaged.</p>

<p>"There are many standing by to make your efforts futile. Don't fail this time," he said, urging them to protect Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm. "Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?...You must say - no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together," he has said.</p>

<p>In a major development, Bangladesh's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan and five other top judges on Saturday were forced to resign amid massive student protests demanding a revamp of the judiciary.</p>

<p>Several other top officials, including Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Maksud Kamal, have also quit after protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

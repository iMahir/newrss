       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in the US state of Texas have arrested a man in connection with the killing of a 32-year-old Indian national during a robbery at a convenience store in Dallas.</p>

<p>Dasari Gopikrishna, who came to the US only eight months ago, was shot dead&nbsp; at the convenience store in Pleasant Grove, Dallas, on June 21.</p>

<p>He hailed from the Yajali village of the Bapatla district in Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>Police have arrested 21-year-old Davonta Mathis for murdering Gopikrishna.</p>

<p>He faces capital murder charges for fatally shooting Gopikrisna multiple times, including in the head.</p>

<p>During the robbery, Mathis walked into the store, approached the counter and shot Gopikrishna. He stole items before running away, police said.</p>

<p>Gopikrishna was taken to the hospital in critical condition and later died.</p>

<p>Mathis was originally arrested and charged with robbery, but the charge was upgraded to capital murder because of Gopikrishna's death.</p>

<p>His bond is set at USD 7.5 million.</p>

<p>Sgt. Curtis Phillip of the Mesquite Police described Mathis' behaviour as "very bizarre," noting the significant impact of his decisions at such a young age.</p>

<p>Mathis is also charged in a separate fatal shooting in Waco city on June 20. He shot Muhammad Hussain, 60, multiple times, who died from injuries at the hospital.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian consulate here is finalising arrangements with Gopikrishna's family to repatriate his body, officials said.</p>

<p>Representatives from the Telugu Association of North America (TANA) and family friends are collaborating with the consulate to facilitate the transportation of Gopikrishna's body to his hometown in India.</p>

<p>The consulate has confirmed that all police autopsies and necessary formalities have been completed, and they are prioritising the shipment of the body by Tuesday.</p>

<p>Gopikrishna's murder is the second in as many days of a convenience store clerk working the night shift.</p>

<p>The incident has deeply affected the Indian community in Dallas and surrounding areas. Gopikrishna is survived by his wife and son.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said Monday he was "deeply disturbed" by reports that a woman allegedly attempted to drown a Palestinian-American child at a pool in Texas.</p>

<p>The woman has been charged with capital murder, court records show, following the May incident which gained national attention over the weekend.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old, identified as Elizabeth Wolf, allegedly approached a mother who was wearing a hijab at a suburban apartment pool near Dallas.</p>

<p>She then asked whether the mother's six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter belonged to her and also made racial statements, according to US media reports.</p>

<p>The woman reportedly grabbed the boy, who was able to wrangle free, then grabbed the girl, whom she pushed underwater.</p>

<p>"No child should ever be subjected to a violent attack, and my heart goes out to the family," Biden said on X on Monday.</p>

<p>"I am deeply disturbed by the reports of an attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian-American at a neighborhood pool," he said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which has called for a hate crimes probe, held a press conference on the incident.</p>

<p>In a statement from CAIR, the mother said her family were American citizens of Palestinian origin.</p>

<p>The episode comes with the war in Gaza igniting fierce passions in the United States, particularly on university campuses, where there have been numerous protests.</p>

<p>It has also led to a number of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic acts across the country.</p>

<p>In November, a man shot and injured three students of Palestinian origin in the northeast state of Vermont.</p>

<p>And in early October, a six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death near Chicago in a crime linked directly to the war in Gaza, according to police.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is set to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, as part of a deal with the Biden administration. This agreement is expected to end Assange's legal saga, which spanned nearly 15 years.</p>

<p><strong>Case Against Assange</strong></p>

<p>The case against Assange originates from WikiLeaks' publication of sensitive US military documents, war logs, and diplomatic cables between 2010 and 2011. These disclosures, including footage of a US airstrike in Baghdad, constituted one of the largest breaches of state secrets in US history. Assange was accused of conspiring with Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, to obtain classified materials.</p>

<p>Chelsea Manning, who leaked the documents, was convicted in 2013 but had her 35-year prison sentence commuted by President Barack Obama in 2017.</p>

<p>The US criminally charged Assange in 2019 under the Trump administration with violating the Espionage Act and was seeking to extradite him from the UK, where he has been in prison ever since. The initial charges — 17 related to espionage and one to computer misuse — carried a maximum penalty of 175 years in prison if he was found guilty on all counts.</p>

<p><strong>Plea Deal</strong></p>

<p>Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to violating US espionage law. As part of the deal, he will be sentenced to 62 months, which corresponds to the time he has already served in UK prisons. The sentencing will take place at a hearing scheduled on Wednesday in Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>After sentencing, he will return to his home in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Global Campaign And Support</strong></p>

<p>During his ordeal, Assange became a hero to free speech campaigners around the world and a villain to those who thought he endangered US national security and intelligence sources by revealing secrets.</p>

<p>He has spent more than a decade either in custody or holed up in Ecuador's London embassy, trying to avoid extradition. Assange has been detained in London's high-security Belmarsh prison for the last five years.</p>

<p>According to WikiLeaks, Assange's plea deal and imminent return to Australia are the result of a global campaign involving grassroots organizers, press freedom advocates, legislators, and leaders from various political backgrounds. This support extended to international bodies such as the United Nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[50 minutes into its journey, the Boeing 737 Max 8 plane started descending sharply and fell about 26,900 feet in around 15 minutes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Korean Air plane was forced to U-turn and make an emergency landing after dropping more than 25,000 feet due to a fault in the aircraft's pressurization system. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/korean-air-flight-diverted-taiwan-b2567663.html">Independent</a></em>, flight KE189 departed Seoul's Incheon International Airport (ICN) on June 22, 2024, at about 16:45 local time, headed for Taichung International Airport (RMQ) in Taiwan.</p>

<p>However, 50 minutes into its journey, the Boeing 737 Max 8 plane started descending sharply and fell about 26,900 feet in around 15 minutes. According to FL360aero, the message ''pressure system (pressure control function of the aircraft) abnormality'' was displayed while the aircraft was flying over Jeju Island.</p>

<p>As a result, several passengers experienced hyperventilation and ear pain,&nbsp;prompting oxygen masks to be released inside the cabin of the plane.&nbsp;One passenger told&nbsp;<em>The Taipei Times&nbsp;</em>that children on the flight were crying when oxygen masks were deployed during the flight's plunge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Another passenger said she felt something was amiss as the aircraft seemed to be hovering in the air and the flight attendants remained in their seats.</p>

<p>Upon landing in Taichung, Taiwan, 17 people were evaluated at medical facilities and were later&nbsp;discharged without severe injuries.</p>

<p>Korean Air apologised to ''all affected by this incident'', and said, ''We are fully cooperating with all relevant authorities to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident. We have provided comprehensive support to affected passengers, including accommodation, meals, and transportation arrangements.'</p>

<p>The flight resumed on the morning of June 23 with a different aircraft, about 19 hours after the initial departure schedule.&nbsp;passengers, who arrived at Taichung International Airport, said they were frightened and that they would not take a flight for a while, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2024/06/24/2003819818">Taipei Times</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>A Korean Air spokesperson said the airline is conducting a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the pressurisation system malfunction, intending to address any maintenance issues before returning the aircraft to service.</p>

<p>Boeing, the plane that suffered a malfunction during the flight, has been under massive pressure following a string of incidents involving their planes.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's Advay Misra, an 11-year-old student from New Delhi, participated in the International Academic Championship and won the Science and Academic Bee Competitions at the Championships and was runner-up in the Geography Bee Competition.</p>

<p>Held over three days from June 14 to June 16, the competition saw participation from over 300 students from 30 different cities across 14 different countries vying for a chance at the Asian Championship.</p>

<p>Advay holds the unique distinction of being the Asian Science Bee Champion for three years in a row, and it was his second consecutive win in the Academic Bee Championship.</p>

<p>Last year, representing India as the All India Winner of the National Academic Competition, Advay had achieved the feat of winning all the four Bees (Academic, Science, Geography and History) in offing. Prior to his achievements in the Asian Championships, Advay was the Runner-up in the National Science Bee Championship of the US for the year 2020-21.</p>

<p>The Bees are an intense individual competition where the contestants vie to answer a number of buzzer based questions. The format tests both the depth and the breadth of knowledge of the contestants. The format consists of a written Qualifier, followed by regional finals and then the Championships, which involve 4 preliminary rounds and one final round for each Bee.</p>

<p>Going beyond just being a collection/recollection of facts, a Bee Competition actually tests critical thinking and the ability to absorb details and discern linkages between a wide variety of subjects and helps bring alive classroom pedagogy.</p>

<p>Advay credited his success to his habit of reading extensively and guidance from his parents for his continuing success. As an 8-year old, Advay was named one of the brightest kids in the world by John's Hopkins University in the US and is a member of their Center for Talented Youth (CTY).</p>

<p>He has won numerous other Academic accolades and enjoys math and programming besides quizzing and reading. His project 'Moodmeter' that was made to take care of his peers' health during the pandemic was adjudged as one of the best school work across all grades by the New York City Department of Education. He is currently an 8th grader at Sanskriti School in New Delhi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Jailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been fighting for years to avoid extradition from Britain in connection with the 2010 publication of thousands of US classified documents.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been fighting for years to avoid extradition from Britain in connection with the 2010 publication of thousands of US classified documents.</p>

<p>Here is a timeline of his legal troubles after he agreed to plead guilty to revealing military secrets in exchange for his release from prison, ending his years-long legal drama:</p>

<h3><strong>2010: Assault charges&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In July 2010, Assange's WikiLeaks whistleblowing website begins publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked US military documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some of which detail US abuses.</p>

<p>It later follows up with a huge batch of secret US diplomatic cables, which show that Washington spied on the leadership of the United Nations and that Saudi Arabia pressured the US to attack Iran, among other revelations.</p>

<p>In November that year, a Swedish prosecutor issues an arrest warrant for Assange over sexual assault allegations involving two women.</p>

<p>Assange denies the claims, saying they had consensual sex, but is arrested after he reports to police in London. A week later he is released on bail.</p>

<h3><strong>2012: Embassy refuge&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In February 2011, a British judge rules Assange can be extradited to Sweden.</p>

<p>He appeals, claiming the Swedish allegations are a pretext to transfer him to the US to face charges over Wikileaks.</p>

<p>In June 2012, he takes refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London. Ecuador, then ruled by left-wing president Rafael Correa, grants him asylum.</p>

<p>In May 2017, Swedish prosecutors drop the sex assault investigation after failing to obtain Assange's transfer.</p>

<p>In December, Ecuador grants Assange nationality but is blocked by Britain from according him diplomatic status.</p>

<h3><strong>2019: Arrest, prison&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In January 2018, Ecuador, now ruled by conservative President Lenin Moreno, says hosting Assange has become "untenable".</p>

<p>Tensions peak in April 2019 when Moreno says Assange has "repeatedly violated" the conditions of his asylum and revokes his citizenship.</p>

<p>The next day, British police drag Assange from the embassy and arrest him on a US extradition request.</p>

<p>In May, he is sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for having breached bail in 2010.</p>

<p>The legal process for his extradition to the US begins.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Swedish prosecutors reopen the rape investigation.</p>

<h3><strong>US charges&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In May 2019, the US Justice Department charges Assange with violating the US Espionage Act by publishing military and diplomatic files in 2010. If convicted, he faces jail terms of up to 175 years.</p>

<p>Assange makes his first court appearance since being jailed via video-link.</p>

<h3><strong>Swedish charge dropped&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In November 2019, Swedish prosecutors drop the rape investigation because "the evidence is not strong enough" despite "credible" claims from Assange's alleged victim.</p>

<p>- 2020: Trump claim -</p>

<p>In February 2020 court hearings, Assange's lawyers claim then US president Donald Trump had promised him a pardon if he denied Russia had leaked him damaging emails about Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>The White House denies the claim.</p>

<h3><strong>2021: Victory, then setback&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Assange's supporters celebrate after a London court blocks his extradition in January 2021, on the grounds he would be a suicide risk if sent to the US.</p>

<p>But a High Court appeal overturns the verdict and sends the case back to the original court after a US promise he would not be held in isolation in jail and would receive proper medical treatment.</p>

<h3><strong>2022: Permission to appeal&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Judges in January 2022 grant Assange permission to appeal. But in March, the Supreme Court refuses to hear the challenge.</p>

<p>On June 17, 2022, the British government approves his extradition in what Wikileaks calls a "dark day for press freedom and for British democracy".</p>

<p>Assange appeals the government's decision.</p>

<h3><strong>'He will die' if extradited&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Assange's wife Stella tells a news conference in February 2024 that her husband "will die" if sent to the US, saying his physical and mental health are "in decline".</p>

<p>In May, Assange wins permission to appeal against the 2022 court ruling that approved his extradition, with a two-day hearing in London later scheduled for July 9.</p>

<h3><strong>2024: Plea deal and release&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Assange agrees to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information, according to US court documents released on Monday night.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks says "Julian Assange is free," writing on X that he has left prison and flown out of Britain after being granted bail by a high court judge.</p>

<p>Assange is scheduled to appear Wednesday morning local time at a court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US territory in the Pacific, close to his native Australia.</p>

<p>He is expected to be sentenced to 62 months in prison, with credit for the five years he has already served behind bars in Britain, meaning he can go free.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The relationship between India and the US is not just "addictive", it is "multiplicative", US envoy to India Eric Garcetti has said.</p>

<p>Garcetti also said that the relationship between the two countries has never been so good. The Indian-American community is the most successful immigrant community in America.</p>

<p>He made these remarks on Monday at an event on the sidelines of the SelectUSA Investment Summit, to which the largest delegation is from India.</p>

<p>“This (India US) is a relationship that isn't just additive. It's not just the US plus India. It's multiplicative. It's the United States times India,” Garcetti said on the sidelines of the summit, to which the largest delegation is from India.</p>

<p>The SelectUSA Investment Summit is the highest-profile event in the US to facilitate business investment by connecting thousands of investors, companies, economic development organisations (EDOs), and industry experts to make deals happen.</p>

<p>Garcetti was speaking at the event wherein India's JSW Steel announced its plans to invest USD 140 million in Bayton, Texas.</p>

<p>“Now, Americans are getting more and more familiar with Indian brands and Indian companies... Together we're investing in third countries, infrastructure, energy, climate solutions, empowering tomorrow's prosperity,” Garcetti said as he announced investment from JW Steel in Texas.</p>

<p>“We are so excited that JSW Steel is announcing a USD 140 million investment in America, in Baytown, in Texas. JSW is one of the largest Indian investors in the United States, investing more than USD 2 billion here in this country, in Texas and in Ohio. They have seen tremendous return on their investment,” he said. This FDI would result in jobs for more than 800 American workers.</p>

<p>Garcetti also said that the relationship between India and the US has never been so good.</p>

<p>“We've never had a closer relationship with India. Americans of Indian descent are now about 1.5% of our population. And pay six per cent of the taxes in America. It is the most successful immigrant community in America,” he said.</p>

<p>“While the story used to be about American companies going to India to invest, which we still do,... increasingly we're seeing this two-way street, a bridge in the Indo-pacific coming from India into the United States, savings steel mills, looking at mines that have been shut down, investing in electrolytes for electric vehicles of the future, the services, the health care,” Garcetti said.</p>

<p>Diane Farrell, Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade, from the Department of Commerce said India has the largest country delegation to the SelectUSA Investment Summit.</p>

<p>Divyakumar Bhair, Board Member, JSW Steel USA said that these investments would go into manufacturing high-end steel plates which are used for offshore wind, monopile, transition pieces, and towers.</p>

<p>“This will not only help realise the dream of clean energy for the generations to come in the United States but will also catalyse the local economies of Texas,” he said. JSW USA is part of the diversified USD 24 billion JSW Group.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has reached a deal to plead guilty to one count of violating the U.S. espionage law, prosecutors said in court papers on Monday.</p>

<p>He is due to appear in a U.S. federal court in the Northern Mariana Islands this week where he is expected to be sentenced to time served and allowed to return home to Australia.</p>

<p>Following are some key events and details in Assange's life:</p>

<p>July 1971 - Assange is born in Townsville, Australia, to parents involved in theatre. As a teenager, he gains a reputation as a computer programmer. In 1995, he is fined for computer hacking but avoids prison on condition he does not offend again.</p>

<p>2006 - Assange founds WikiLeaks, creating an internet-based "dead letter drop" for leakers of classified or sensitive information.</p>

<p>April 5, 2010 - WikiLeaks releases leaked video from a U.S. helicopter showing an air strike that killed civilians in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff.</p>

<p>July 25, 2010 - WikiLeaks releases more than 91,000 documents, mostly secret U.S. military reports about the Afghanistan war.</p>

<p>October, 2010 - WikiLeaks releases 400,000 classified military files chronicling the Iraq war. The next month, it releases thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables, including candid views of foreign leaders and blunt assessments of security threats.</p>

<p>Nov. 18, 2010 - A Swedish court orders Assange's arrest on sex crime allegations, which he denies. He is arrested in Britain the next month on a European arrest warrant but freed on bail.</p>

<p>February 2011 - London's Westminster Magistrates' Court orders Assange's extradition to Sweden. He appeals.</p>

<p>June 14, 2012 - The British Supreme Court rejects Assange's final appeal. Five days later, he takes refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and seeks political asylum, which Ecuador grants in August 2012.</p>

<p>May 19, 2017 - Swedish prosecutors discontinue their investigation, saying it is impossible to proceed while Assange is in the Ecuadorean embassy.</p>

<p>April 11, 2019 - After Ecuador revokes his political asylum, Assange is carried out of the embassy and arrested. He is sentenced on May 1 to 50 weeks in prison by a British court for skipping bail. He completes the sentence early but remains in jail pending extradition hearings.</p>

<p>May 13, 2019 - Swedish prosecutors reopen their investigation and say they will seek Assange's extradition.</p>

<p>June 11, 2019 - The U.S. Justice Department formally asks Britain to extradite Assange to the United States to face charges that he conspired to hack U.S. government computers and violated an espionage law.</p>

<p>Nov. 19, 2019 - Swedish prosecutors drop their investigation, saying the evidence is not strong enough to bring charges, in part because of the passage of time.</p>

<p>Feb. 21, 2020 - A London court begins the first part of extradition hearings.</p>

<p>Jan. 4, 2021 - A British judge rules that Assange should not be extradited to the U.S. to face criminal charges, saying his mental health problems mean he would be at risk of suicide.</p>

<p>Dec. 10, 2021 - The U.S. wins an appeal against the ruling after a judge says he is satisfied with a U.S. package of assurances about the conditions of Assange's detention. &nbsp;</p>

<p>March 14, 2022 - Britain's Supreme Court denies Assange permission to appeal against the decision to extradite him to the United States.</p>

<p>March 23, 2022 - Assange marries his long-term partner Stella Moris, the mother of his two children fathered inside the Ecuadorean embassy, inside a British high-security prison.</p>

<p>June 17, 2022 - Britain orders Assange's extradition to the United States, prompting Assange to appeal.</p>

<p>June, 2023 - Judge at London's High Court rules Assange has no legal grounds to appeal.</p>

<p>Feb. 20, 2024 - Assange launches what his supporters say will be his final attempt to prevent extradition.</p>

<p>March 26, 2024 - The extradition is put on hold when the court says the U.S. must provide assurances that Assange will not face a potential death penalty.</p>

<p>May 20, 2024 - The High Court gives Assange permission to launch a full appeal against his extradition on grounds that, as a foreign national on trial, he might not be able to rely on the First Amendment right to free speech that U.S. citizens enjoy.</p>

<p>June 24, 2024 - The U.S. Justice Department and Assange reveal a deal in which he will plead guilty to one criminal count and be sentenced to time served.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top US official said on Monday that progress in the bilateral relationship with India has finally achieved "escape velocity", using a term from space exploration to describe the velocity required by a body to soar without the pull of gravity.</p>

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell was speaking on a sustainable and enduring US policy in the Indo-Pacific region at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations, a leading think tank.</p>

<p>He was recently in India along with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan for a much-anticipated visit that also turned out to be the first trip by senior US officials to New Delhi in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third term.</p>

<p>Campbell also made a strong pitch for according to a higher preference to increasing the intake of Indian students in STEM fields in US universities, than to students from China, who are not trusted in high-technology fields.</p>

<p>"The United States and India have launched an effort to intensify defence industrial cooperation on jet engines and armoured vehicles," Campbell said about ties with India in the context of America's sustained engagement with the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>"After working in India for decades, I can tell you that it is my view that finally, the use-end rate relationship has reached escape velocity. I think we have a partnership that can be sustained and there is ambition in both Delhi and Washington to take important next steps. We've worked together on a variety of other issues between the United States and India including announcing new initiatives where we will work together for the first time in the Indian Ocean."</p>

<p>Campbell was previously the White House czar for President Joe Biden's Indo-Pacific policy, which has seen this administration elevate the Quad platform with India, Australia, and Japan to the level leaders, the launch of the Australia, UK and US partnership called AUKUS and deepening bilateral, trilateral and multilateral ties with Indo-Pacific countries with the shared goal of managing China's aggressive rise.</p>

<p>The jet engine cooperation that Campbell mentioned is the joint production of GE's F414 jet engine with HAL that was announced during Prime Minister Modi's state visit in June last year.</p>

<p>India and the US are also in talks to co-produce Stryker armoured infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs or infantry combat vehicles). India is looking to this vehicle as a replacement for its fleet of ageing Russian-made ICVs.</p>

<p>India and the United States cooperate on a wide suite of issues and people-to-people is one of the most important of them. Indian students in US universities are a key part of it. Indians account for the second largest cohort of foreign students and their numbers are growing rapidly.</p>

<p>Campbell's strong pitch for a larger intake of Indian students came in response to a question on what needs to be done to shore up declining numbers of Chinese students. "Right now the largest increase that we need to see going forward would be much larger numbers of Indian students that come to study in American universities on a range of technology and other fields more directly," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that Israel is "committed" to the deal proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.</p>

<p>"We are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden endorsed," Netanyahu said on Monday during a special plenum session of the Knesset (parliament) summoned by the opposition, noting "Our position has not changed".</p>

<p>Biden first presented the deal proposal to end the ongoing conflict in late May. Netanyahu's remarks marked the first time the Israeli side has confirmed that Israel has approved and supports the proposal, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told the Knesset that Israel will not end the conflict "until we bring back all the hostages, all 120 of them -- both the living and the fallen" and until Hamas is "eliminated" and the residents in southern and northern can safely return to their homes.</p>

<p>Israel has been carrying out a massive offensive in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas rampage on October 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has agreed to plead guilty in US court to revealing military secrets in exchange for his freedom, ending his years-long legal drama, according to court documents released Monday night.</p>

<p>Assange, who had been in custody in Britain, will plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defense information, according to the document filed in court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US territory in the Pacific.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks reported early Tuesday morning British time that "Julian Assange is free" and had left the country. He is scheduled to appear Wednesday morning local time in the US territory.</p>

<p>Assange is expected to be sentenced to 62 months in prison, with credit for the five years he has served in prison in Britain. This means he could return to his native Australia.</p>

<p>The publisher now aged 52 was wanted by Washington for publishing hundreds of thousands of secret US documents from 2010 as head of the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>During his ordeal Assange became a hero to free speech campaigners around the world and a villain to those who thought he endangered US national security and intelligence sources by revealing secrets.</p>

<p>US authorities wanted to put Assange on trial for divulging US military secrets about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This plea bargain agreement will presumably end Assange's nearly 14-year legal drama.</p>

<p>Assange was indicted by a US federal grand jury in 2019 on 18 counts stemming from WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of national security documents.</p>

<p>Announcement of the deal came two weeks before Assange was scheduled to appear in court in Britain to appeal against a ruling approving his extradition to the United States.</p>

<p>Assange has been detained in the high-security Belmarsh prison in London since April 2019.</p>

<p>He was arrested after spending seven years holed up in Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced accusations of sexual assault that were eventually dropped.</p>

<p>The material he released included video showing civilians being killed by fire from a US helicopter gunship in Iraq in 2007. The victims included two Reuters journalists.</p>

<p>The United States has accused Assange under the 1917 Espionage Act. Supporters have warned this means he could be sentenced to 175 years in prison.</p>

<p>The British government approved his extradition in June 2022.</p>

<p>In the latest twist to the saga, two British judges said in May that he could appeal against his extradition to the United States.</p>

<p>The appeal was to address the question of whether, as a foreigner on trial in America, he would enjoy the protections of freedom of speech accorded under the First Amendment to the US Constitution.</p>

<p>The plea deal was not entirely unexpected. President Joe Biden had been under growing pressure to drop the long-running case against Assange.</p>

<p>In February the government of Australia made an official request to this effect and Biden said he would consider it, raising hopes among Assange supporters that his ordeal might end.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese probe carrying samples from the far side of the Moon is expected to return to Earth on Tuesday, capping a technically complex 53-day mission heralded as a world first.</p>

<p>Beijing has not disclosed the spacecraft's estimated arrival time, but experts say it will likely touch down in a barren expanse of desert in the northern Inner Mongolia region at around midday (0400 GMT).</p>

<p>It comes bearing soil and rocks from the side of the moon that faces away from Earth, a poorly understood region that scientists say holds great research promise because its rugged features are less smoothed over by ancient lava flows than the near side.</p>

<p>That means the materials harvested there may help us to better understand how the Moon formed and how it has evolved over time.</p>

<p>Chang'e-6 blasted off from a space centre on the island province of Hainan on May 3 and descended into the Moon's immense South Pole-Aitken Basin almost exactly a month later.</p>

<p>It used a drill and robotic arm to scoop up samples, snapped some shots of the pockmarked surface and planted a Chinese flag in the grey soil.</p>

<p>On June 4, the probe made the first ever successful launch from the far side in what Chinese state news agency Xinhua called "an unprecedented feat in human lunar exploration history".</p>

<p>Authorities have been coy about disclosing updates on the probe's progress since then.</p>

<p>But China's space agency said in a social media post on Friday that it was "70 percent" of the way back to Earth.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Space dream' -</strong></p>

<p>Plans for China's "space dream" have shifted into high gear under President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Beijing has poured huge resources into its space programme over the past decade, targeting ambitious undertakings in an effort to catch up to traditional space powers the United States and Russia.</p>

<p>It has built a space station, landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon, and become only the third country to send astronauts into orbit.</p>

<p>But the United States has warned that China's space programme masks military objectives and an effort to establish dominance in space.</p>

<p>China aims to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030 and plans to eventually build a base on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>The United States also plans to put astronauts back on the Moon by 2026 with its Artemis 3 mission.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on Israel during a Monday meeting with its defense minister to avoid further escalation in Lebanon as they discussed efforts to reach a deal to free hostages in Gaza.</p>

<p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was on a visit to Washington seeking to reaffirm the value of ties with Israel's top ally, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly chastised the United States for what he said was a delay in weapons deliveries.</p>

<p>In a two-hour meeting with Gallant at the State Department, Blinken discussed indirect diplomacy between Israel and Hamas on an agreement that "secures the release of all hostages and alleviates the suffering of the Palestinian people," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Blinken also "underscored the importance of avoiding further escalation of the conflict and reaching a diplomatic resolution that allows both Israeli and Lebanese families to return to their homes," Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Tensions have been rising with growing exchanges of fire between Israel and Lebanon's Iranian-backed militant movement Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has said Israeli forces are winding up the most intense part of the Gaza war and will redeploy to the northern border, although he cast the move as defensive.</p>

<p>Gallant also met CIA chief Bill Burns, the key US pointman in negotiations to free hostages from Hamas.</p>

<p>"I would like to emphasize that it is Israel's primary commitment to return the hostages, with no exception, to their families and homes," Gallant said before starting his meetings.</p>

<p>"We will continue to make every possible effort to bring them home," he said.</p>

<p>The minister made no further comment as he left the meeting with Blinken, as a few dozen protesters outside the State Department chanted to call him a "war criminal."</p>

<p><strong>- Arms shipment dispute -</strong></p>

<p>President Joe Biden on May 31 laid out a plan for a ceasefire in Gaza and release of hostages.</p>

<p>Hamas, which launched the conflict with its October 7 attack on Israel, has come back with its own demands, and the United States hopes the gaps can be bridged.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who has faced major protests calling for him to accept the deal, in recent days has annoyed the Biden administration by accusing Washington of cutting back arms and ammunition deliveries.</p>

<p>Gallant took a different tack, saying: "The alliance between Israel and the United States, led by the US over many years, is extremely important."</p>

<p>Other than Israel's own military, "our ties with the US are the most important element for our future from a security perspective," he said.</p>

<p>Biden, who has faced criticism from parts of his own base over his support for Israel, held back a shipment that included heavy 2,000-pound bombs.</p>

<p>Netanyahu -- who has close relations with Biden's rivals in the Republican Party -- told a cabinet meeting on Sunday that there was a "dramatic drop in the supply" of US weapons around four months ago.</p>

<p>Asked about his latest remark, Miller told reporters, "I don't understand what that comment meant at all."</p>

<p>"We have paused one shipment of high-payload munitions. That shipment remains on pause," Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>"There are other weapons that we continue to provide Israel, as we have done going back years and years, because we are committed to Israel's security. There has been no change in that," Miller said.</p>

<p>Miller said the United States would also press Israel to work on longer-term arrangements after the end of the fighting.</p>

<p>"We don't want to see in Rafah what we've seen in Gaza City and what we've seen in Khan Yunis, which is the end of major combat operations and then the beginning of Hamas reasserting control," he said, referring to two other major cities targeted by Israel earlier in the war.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron told a podcast episode shown on Monday that both the far right National Rally (RN) party and the left-wing New Popular Front coalition - front runners in the parliamentary election- risked bringing "civil war" to France.</p>

<p>Macron told the podcast "Generation Do It Yourself" that the manifesto of the RN party - which election pollsters put in first place - and their solutions to deal with fears over crime and immigration were based upon "stigmatisation or division".</p>

<p>"I think that the solutions given by the far right are out of the question, because it is categorising people in terms of their religion or origins and that is why it leads to division and to civil war," he told the podcast.</p>

<p>Macron made the same criticism of the France Unbowed (LFI) extreme left-wing party, which forms part of the New Popular Front coalition.</p>

<p>"But that one as well, there is a civil war behind that because you are solely categorising people in terms of their religious outlook or the community they belong to, which in a way is a means of justifying isolating them from the broader national community and in this case, you would have a civil war with those who do not share those same values," said Macron.</p>

<p>Asked to respond to Macron's civil war comments, RN president Jordan Bardella - seen as a possible prime minister if the RN wins the most votes in the election - replied to M6 TV: "A President should not say that."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky replaced a high-ranking army official leading troops in the country's embattled east on Monday after he was accused of incompetence and abuse of power during the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>The move came as Kyiv has struggled to hold back Moscow's forces in the east for months, almost two and half years into the war. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have decided to replace the Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Yuriy Sodol, with Brigadier General Andriy Gnatov," Zelensky said in his daily evening address.</p>

<p>He gave no details on the reasons for the dismissal but the decision came after criticism from a commander of the Azov brigade, known for its links with the far right.</p>

<p>The Azov commander, Bogdan Krotevych, had a day earlier filed a complaint to the SBU security service, calling for an investigation into Sodol.</p>

<p>According to media reports, Krotevych accused Sodol of incompetence and blamed him for the death of Ukrainian soldiers at the front.</p>

<p>Ukraine -- outgunned and outmanned by Russia -- has been on the back foot for months, with Moscow's forces claiming new villages in the east almost every week, but without making a major breakthrough.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Union (EU) regulators on Monday opened a new investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces in Europe under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), adding that the App Store's "steering" policies violate the DMA meant to encourage competition.</p>

<p>Margrethe Vestager, who heads competition policy in Europe, said their preliminary position is that Apple does not fully allow steering.</p>

<p>"Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers' app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers," she said in a statement.</p>

<p>The EU regulators said they are concerned as Apple's new business model makes it too hard for app developers to operate as alternative marketplaces and reach their end users on iOS.</p>

<p>"We will look into Apple's new business model - the commercial terms Apple imposes on app developers who want to reach end users on the iOS platform," said the regulators.</p>

<p>The regulators also said that they have adopted their first preliminary findings in a case of non-compliance.</p>

<p>"And it is again about Apple. About the many ways in which their new terms fall short of the DMA requirements regarding steering users to options outside the Apple App Store. As they stand, we think that these new terms do not allow app developers to communicate freely with their end users, and to conclude contracts with them," they added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new study has provided genetic evidence linking a common condition of the blood vessels in brain to dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Known as white matter hyperintensity (WMH), the condition marked by lesions in the brain, is a common feature of the cerebral small-vessel disease, which involves the narrowing of the blood vessels thereby obstructing blood flow, potentially resulting in strokes.</p>

<p>By damaging blood vessels, cerebral small-vessel disease is thought to be the main contributor to cognitive decline and dementia, in which one's memory and ability to think is affected, thereby impacting daily activities and living. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia.</p>

<p>According to the study's authors, led by those at the University of Texas, US, "causal evidence" of WMH lesions leading to stroke and dementia has been limited. Although previous studies have found that these lesions, which appear as bright areas in MRI brain scans, increase the risk of such neurologically deteriorative conditions.</p>

<p>The study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open, showed genetic evidence of blood vessel-related (vascular) damage in the brain can result in dementia.</p>

<p>The researchers first estimated the genetic risk of developing WMH, stroke and blood pressure in an individual. In the second stage, they compared these risks with people actually developing dementia, data for which were taken from population-level studies published between 1979 and 2018. The two-year-long analysis included up to 75,000 dementia cases with European ancestry.</p>

<p>"As vascular disease is a treatable contributor to dementia risk, our findings have broad significance for prevention strategies of Alzheimer's and dementia as a whole," first author Muralidharan Sargurupremraj, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center, said.</p>

<p>With about 75 million people around the world expected to develop dementia by 2030, the researchers said that devising strategies to prevent or delay its occurrence is a major public health priority.</p>

<p>Future studies could examine whether their findings can be applied more widely to non-European populations, the authors said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homeless man found a wallet containing around 2,000 euros ($2,100) on an empty train at Amsterdam station and handed it to the police, receiving a gift voucher for his honesty.</p>

<p>Hadjer Al-Ali, who has been homeless for 18 months, found the wallet at Amsterdam central station while he was "doing his rounds" looking for empty plastic bottles to exchange for cash.</p>

<p>Police said the 33-year-old turned in the wallet with "approximately 2,000 euros... but unfortunately no identity papers or anything that would allow us to contact the owner."</p>

<p>"Because we think that honesty should pay, he got a 'silver thumb' prize that we sometimes give to citizens and a gift voucher worth 50 euros," authorities added.</p>

<p>If the money is not claimed within one year, it will go to the finder.</p>

<p>In a video posted on local media De Stentor, Al-Ali said: "No matter what I find, I always give it back."</p>

<p>"Maybe the owner has a business and can give me work, maybe a building I can live it. You never know what can happen."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's deadliest executioner died Monday a year after he was released from prison where he hanged some of the country's notorious serial killers, opposition politicians convicted of war crimes and coup plotters, police said.</p>

<p>Since he was released from prison last June, Shahjahan Bouya, 70, wrote a top-selling book narrating his experiences as a hangman, briefly married a young girl 50 years younger than him, and in recent weeks took TikTok by storm with short clips with teenage girls.</p>

<p>He felt chest pain on Monday morning at his home in Hemayetpur, an industrial town outside the capital Dhaka, and was rushed to Dhaka's Suhrawardy Hospital, police said.</p>

<p>"He was brought in dead -- doctors haven't ascertained the actual cause of his death," Sajib Dey, a police station chief in Dhaka, told AFP.</p>

<p>"He had breathing difficulties," Abul Kashem, Bouya's landlord, told AFP. "He rented one of our rooms only 15 days ago. He lived alone".</p>

<p>Bouya had been serving a 42-year-old jail term over a murder.</p>

<p>But the dozens of hangings he did in the jails helped reduce his sentence leading to his release from Dhaka's top jail last year.</p>

<p>Bangladesh ranks third in the world for death sentences passed according to rights group Amnesty International, and assigns convicts to carry out the hangings.</p>

<p><strong>'So much power'</strong></p>

<p>A well-read Marxist revolutionary, Bouya in the 1970s joined the outlawed Sarbahara rebels trying to topple a government they saw as puppets of neighbouring India.</p>

<p>He was convicted for the 1979 death of a truck driver in crossfire with police.</p>

<p>In custody during his trial -- a glacial 12-year process -- he noticed the "first class" treatment afforded to executioners, watching one being massaged by four other inmates.</p>

<p>"A hangman has so much power," he said to himself, and volunteered his services.</p>

<p>Prison authorities put Bouya's total at 26 executions, but he says he participated in 60.</p>

<p>Those to die at his hands included military officers found guilty of plotting a 1975 coup and killing the country's founding leader, the father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Activists say that Bangladesh's criminal justice system is deeply flawed, but Bouya shrugged off their criticisms, even though he believes at least three of those he executed were innocent.</p>

<p>In February, his book on his years as a hangman was published and became a best-seller at Bangladesh's largest book annual book fair.</p>

<p>His 96-page book narrates the procedures of hanging by ropes the country inherited from the British colonial rulers.</p>

<p>He described the process nonchalantly, never wading into the debates over the abolition of executions.</p>

<p>He also dwelled on the final moments of some of the country's controversial figures and serial killers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency was sued on Monday by dozens of Israelis who accused it of aiding and abetting the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p>

<p>In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) spent more than a decade helping Hamas build what they called the "terror infrastructure" and personnel needed for the attack.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for what they allege was UNRWA's "aiding and abetting Hamas' genocide, crimes against humanity, and torture," which they said violated international law and the federal Torture Victim Protection Act.</p>

<p>UNRWA declined to comment, saying it had yet to be served with the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The agency has said it takes accusations of staff misconduct seriously, and terminated 10 staff members accused by Israel of involvement in the attack. Two others died, it has said.</p>

<p>UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, and several current and former agency officials are also defendants.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs include 101 people who survived the attack or had relatives who were killed.</p>

<p>While many of their accusations have been made by Israel's government, the plaintiffs want UNRWA held liable for allegedly funneling more than $1 billion from a Manhattan bank account to benefit Hamas, including for weapons, explosives and ammunition.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs accuse UNRWA of providing "safe harbor" to Hamas in its facilities, and letting its schools use Hamas-approved textbooks to indoctrinate Palestinian children to support violence toward and hatred of Jews and Israel.</p>

<p>They also said the attack was "foreseeable" to the defendants, regardless of whether they knew the specifics.</p>

<p>"We are talking about people who have been killed, lost family members and lost homes," Avery Samet, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. "We expect damages will be substantial."</p>

<p>WARNING FROM UNRWA CHIEF</p>

<p>The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, while about 250 other people were abducted, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>More than 37,000 Palestinians have since been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, health officials in the Hamas-ruled enclave have said.</p>

<p>Several countries including the United States halted funding to UNRWA after Israel alleged that staff members were involved in Hamas' attack.</p>

<p>In April, Norway called on international donors to resume funding UNRWA, after a UN-authorized independent review found that Israel had not provided evidence supporting its accusations that hundreds of UNRWA staff were members of terrorist groups.</p>

<p>On Monday, Lazzarini urged resistance to Israeli efforts to disband UNRWA.</p>

<p>"If we do not push back, other U.N. entities and international organizations will be next, further undermining our multilateral system," Lazzarini said at a meeting of the agency's advisory commission in Geneva.</p>

<p>Established in 1949 after the first Arab-Israeli war, UNRWA provides schooling, healthcare and humanitarian aid in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. It is funded almost entirely by U.N. member states.</p>

<p>The case is Estate of Kedem et al v United Nations Relief and Works Agency et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 24-04765.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

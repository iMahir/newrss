       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking discovery, experts have identified ancient remnants of a long-lost tectonic plate, dubbed Pontus, dating back an astonishing 120 million years. This finding sheds new light on Earth's history and underscores the ongoing quest for knowledge about our planet. According to<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/lost-earth-crust-northern-borneo-2669278686"> Indy100.com</a></em>, researchers Suzanna van de Lagemaat and Douwe van Hinsbergen from Utrecht University made the breakthrough by analysing geological data from the Asia-Pacific region. Their prediction has now been confirmed, revealing the existence of Pontus, a previously unknown part of Earth's crust in Borneo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Geologist Suzanna van de Lagemaat said, "We thought we were dealing with relics of a lost plate that we already knew about. But our magnetic lab research on those rocks indicated that our finds were originally from much farther north, and had to be remnants of a different, previously unknown plate."</p>

<p>Researchers reconstructed the ancient Pontus plate, estimating it covered an area roughly one-quarter the size of the Pacific Ocean. Formed during the supercontinent Pangaea, Pontus lay beneath the vast ocean separating Eurasia and Australia 160 million years ago. As Pangaea broke apart, the Pontus plate was gradually subducted or swallowed by neighbouring plates. This geological process carried countries like the Philippines and Borneo to their present-day locations.</p>

<p>Notably, van de Lagemaat focussed her research on the intricate Junction Region, where tectonic plates converge between Japan, Borneo, the Philippines, New Guinea, and New Zealand. Her groundbreaking research enabled the creation of a stunning visual reconstruction.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday took a critical view of the United Nations, saying it was "like an old company", not entirely keeping up with the market but occupying the space.</p>

<p>During an interaction at the Kautilya Economic Conclave here, he also said that two very serious conflicts are going on in the world. "And where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander," the minister said.</p>

<p>In response to a query on the possible outcome of the US elections, he said the US actually has "made a shift", geopolitically and in its economic outlook, and irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will "intensify" in the days to come.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WATCH</a> | Delhi: At Kautilya Economic Conclave, EAM Dr S Jaishankar says "The United Nations is like an old company, not entirely keeping up with the market, but occupying the space...What you have today is, yes, there is a UN. At the end of the day, however suboptimal it is in… <a href="https://t.co/AFFTf9ScHo">pic.twitter.com/AFFTf9ScHo</a></p>
— ANI (@ANI) <a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1842852176911372755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>S Jaishankar took part in the interactive session on 'India and the Globe' and spoke of India's role and challenges amid changing global dynamics.</p>

<p>"So, we are both a lifting tide and a bit of paradoxical one, a ballast as well," S Jaishankar said as he enumerated some of the steps India has taken to help other countries, including its neighbours such as Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>Asked about his upcoming visit to Pakistan to attend a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), he again sought to rule out any bilateral talks with his Pakistani counterpart.</p>

<p>"I am going there for a certain job, a certain responsibility. And, I take my responsibilities seriously. So, I am going there to represent India at the SCO meeting, and that is what I am going to do," S Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>At an event on Saturday, the external affairs minister said that he was going to Islamabad for a "multilateral event" and not to discuss India-Pakistan relations.</p>

<p>In his response to a query on the United Nations' role amid the changing global scenario, he took a rather critical view of the world body that was born in 1945 after the Second World War. Initially, it had 50 countries, which has grown over these years to nearly four times.</p>

<p>"The UN is in a way like an old company, not entirely keeping up with the market, but occupying the space. And, when it's behind times, in this world you have start-ups and innovations, so different people start doing their own things," S Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>"So, what you have today is that yes you have a UN at the end, however suboptimal in functioning, it is still the only multilateral game in town," he added.</p>

<p>"But, when it doesn't step up on key issues, countries figure out their own ways of doing it. For example, let's take the last five-10 years, probably the biggest thing that happened in our life was Covid. Now, what did the UN do on Covid? I think the answer is -- not very much," the minister said.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar said, "Now, you have two conflicts going on in the world today, two very serious conflicts, where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander," he said.</p>

<p>So, what is happening, as it did during Covid also, countries did their own thing such as the initiative like Covax that was done by a group of countries, the minister said. "When it comes to big issues of the day, you have an increasing combination of countries coming together to agree to do something." He cited the examples of connectivity initiatives like the India-MiddleEast-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), QUAD in Indo-Pacific to look after the global commons, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), saying all these bodies came outside the UN framework.</p>

<p>"Today, the UN will continue, but increasingly there is a non-UN space which is the active space and I think it's telling on the UN," Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>More than 75 years after its inception, the United Nations is still working to maintain international peace and security, give humanitarian assistance to those in need, protect human rights, and uphold international law, according to the UN website.</p>

<p>India has been demanding reforms in the world body and its UN Security Council in sync with the changed times.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, S Jaishankar suggested that the "short-sighted" approach of the five permanent members of the UNSC is holding back forward movement in the long-pending reform of the global body.</p>

<p>The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the US and these countries can veto any substantive resolution.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar was asked about a possible outcome of the US elections and how will India engage with the new administration.</p>

<p>"You spoke of one possibility of the two in the American elections. I stress to you, look back over the last five years, how many of the policies which in 2020 people thought were the Trump administration's policies actually not just carried over by Biden but they doubled down on those policies," he said.</p>

<p>So, this is not just a politician, it's not just a fashion, just one administration. "I think there are very deep shifts happening," the minister added.</p>

<p>"This is... America which actually has made a shift, geopolitically and in its economic outlook and has come to the conclusion that the order which itself devised many years ago no longer works to its benefit to that degree," he said.</p>

<p>"So, I would argue, irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will intensify in the days to come. And, you are going to get, I would call it a more fractured world, but I would say, in some ways, reliability and transparency are going to be two very key factors which will become a metric for countries to have enterprises and domains to have dealings with each other," he said.</p>

<p>On a question on the Global South, S Jaishankar said that it itself has a "great value".</p>

<p>"It is a collective. We don't expect to be the leader. We are seen as a trusted member, an articulate member... So, I am not really comfortable with the idea that you walk away from the Global South. On the contrary, I see value," the minister said.</p>

<p>He also spoke on the role and impact of artificial intelligence in shaping the world going forward.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least one person was killed and 10 others injured Sunday during a shooting in southern Israel's Beer Sheva, police and emergency responders said, a day before the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack.</p>

<p>"Paramedics have pronounced a 25-year-old female deceased, and are evacuating 10 casualties," emergency service provider Magen David Adom said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police said the incident was being treated as a "suspected terrorist attack".</p>

<p>"A short time ago a report was received at the police headquarters about a suspected shooting incident at the central station in Beer Sheva," said a police spokesman in a statement.</p>

<p>"A number of injured on the scene. The terrorist was neutralised at the scene and many police forces of the southern district are at the scene," the statement added.</p>

<p>The incident comes just days after a Hamas-claimed shooting attack last week in which seven people were killed in Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The Tel Aviv attack -- one of the deadliest in the country since the October 7 Hamas attack -- came as Iran fired about 200 missiles at Israel, sending hundreds of thousands of people into public shelters.</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas have been at war in Gaza since the October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 41,870 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations has said the figures are reliable.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Despite cabin crew and passengers' efforts to calm the situation, the disruptive man refused to comply.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chaos erupted on an easyJet flight from Turkey to London Gatwick after a reportedly intoxicated passenger caused a disturbance, prompting an emergency landing in Athens. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/05/easyjet-captain-pleads-drunk-passengers-midair-brawl-21741849/">Metro</a></em>, the topless man had been arguing with fellow travellers, leading the captain to issue a stern warning over the intercom.&nbsp;The captain was heard saying: "This is the captain speaking. To the people fighting, the police are waiting for you at the gate. You're only making things worse for yourself. Please sit down."</p>

<p>Despite cabin crew and passengers' efforts to calm the situation, the disruptive man refused to comply. Passengers grew increasingly frustrated, shouting insults at the delay. A woman exclaimed, "You've messed us all up, you silly fool!"</p>

<p>It is unclear what started the fight, but the original TikTok post was captioned: "POV your flight back from Turkey gets diverted to Athens because boys can't handle their drink."</p>

<p>Later, staff attempted to dress the man and guide him off the plane, but he continued to provoke others, including a passenger in a white jacket who sarcastically applauded the captain's announcement. As tensions escalated, the captain's warning proved ineffective, and the man was eventually escorted off the flight by authorities.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for EasyJet stated, ''Flight EZY8558 from Antalya to London Gatwick on 1 October diverted to Athens and was met by police after landing due to two passengers behaving disruptively onboard. easyJet's cabin crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the flight's and other passengers' safety is not compromised at any time. Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously and do not tolerate disruptive behaviour onboard. The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always EasyJet's highest priority.''</p>

<p>The footage has elicited strong reactions from internet users, who called for severe consequences, including billing the disruptive passengers thousands of dollars for the diversion and imposing lifetime bans on flying. Others suggested prohibiting alcohol on flights, citing the excessive drinking culture among some travellers.</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''It's only a matter of time before they ban drinking because of people like these who can't handle their drink. Jail them and they may think twice.''&nbsp;Another commented, ''Why do Brits revolve their life around drink, drink, drink? This is what ends up happening. I'm not generalizing, but this is why alcohol is not the way.''</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The United Nations estimates there is over 42 million tonnes of debris, including both shattered edifices that are still standing and flattened buildings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ruins of his two-storey home, 11-year-old Mohammed gathers chunks of the fallen roof into a broken pail and pounds them into gravel which his father will use to make gravestones for victims of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"We get the rubble not to build houses, no, but for tombstones and graves - from one misery to another," his father, former construction worker Jihad Shamali, 42, says as he cuts through metal salvaged from their home in the southern city of Khan Younis, damaged during an Israeli raid in April.</p>

<p>The work is hard, and at times grim. In March, the family built a tomb for one of Shamali's sons, Ismail, killed while running household errands.</p>

<p>But it is also a tiny part of the efforts starting to take shape to deal with the rubble left by Israel's military campaign to eliminate Palestinian militant group Hamas.</p>

<p>The United Nations estimates there is over 42 million tonnes of debris, including both shattered edifices that are still standing and flattened buildings.</p>

<p>That is 14 times the amount of rubble accumulated in Gaza between 2008 and the war's start a year ago, and over five times the amount left by the 2016-17 Battle of Mosul in Iraq, the U.N. said.</p>

<p>Piled up, it would fill the Great Pyramid of Giza - Egypt's largest - 11 times. And it is growing daily.</p>

<p>The U.N. is trying to help as Gazan authorities consider how to deal with the rubble, three U.N. officials said.</p>

<p>A U.N.-led Debris Management Working Group plans a pilot project with Palestinian authorities in Khan Younis and the central Gazan city of Deir El-Balah to start clearing roadside debris this month.</p>

<p>"The challenges are huge," said Alessandro Mrakic, the Gaza Office head for the United Nations' Development Programme (UNDP) which is co-chairing the working group. "It's going to be a massive operation, but at the same time, it's important that we start now."</p>

<p>Israel's military has said Hamas fighters hide among civilians and that it will strike them wherever they emerge, while also trying to avoid harming civilians.</p>

<p>Asked about the debris, Israel's military unit COGAT said it aimed to improve waste-handling and would work with the U.N. to expand those efforts. Mrakic said coordination with Israel was excellent but detailed discussions on future plans were yet to take place.</p>

<p>Tent Amid The Ruins</p>

<p>Israel began its offensive after Hamas militants entered Israel on Oct. 7 last year, killed about 1,200 Israelis and took over 250 people hostage.</p>

<p>Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in a year of conflict, Palestinian health authorities say.</p>

<p>On the ground, wreckage is piled high above pedestrians and donkey carts on dusty narrow paths that were once busy roads.</p>

<p>"Who is going to come here and clear the rubble for us? No-one. Therefore, we did that ourselves," taxi driver Yusri Abu Shabab said, having cleared enough debris from his Khan Younis home to erect a tent.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of Gaza's pre-war structures - over 163,000 buildings - have been damaged or flattened, according to U.N. satellite data. Around a third were high-rise buildings.</p>

<p>After a seven-week war in Gaza in 2014, UNDP and its partners cleared 3 million tonnes of debris - 7% of the total now. Mrakic cited an unpublished preliminary estimate that it would cost $280 million to clear 10 million tonnes, implying around $1.2 billion if the war stopped now.</p>

<p>A U.N. estimate from April suggested it would take 14 years to clear the rubble.</p>

<p>Concealed Bodies</p>

<p>The debris contains unrecovered bodies, as many as 10,000 according to the Palestinian health ministry, and unexploded bombs, Mrakic said.</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross says the threat is "pervasive" and U.N. officials say some of the debris poses a big injury risk.</p>

<p>Nizar Zurub, from Khan Younis, lives with his son in a home where only a roof remains, hanging at a precarious angle.</p>

<p>The United Nations Environment Programme said an estimated 2.3 million tonnes of debris might be contaminated, citing an assessment of Gaza's eight refugee camps, some of which have been hit.</p>

<p>Asbestos fibres can cause larynx, ovarian and lung cancer when inhaled.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization has recorded nearly a million cases of acute respiratory infections in Gaza in the past year, without saying how many are linked to dust.</p>

<p>WHO spokesperson Bisma Akbar said dust was a "significant concern", and could contaminate water and soil and lead to lung disease.</p>

<p>Doctors fear a rise in cancers and birth defects from leaking metals in coming decades. Snake and scorpion bites and skin infections from sandflies are a concern, a UNEP spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Land And Equipment Shortages</p>

<p>Gaza's rubble has previously been used to help build seaports. The U.N. hopes now to recycle a portion for road networks and bolstering the shoreline.</p>

<p>Gaza, which had a pre-war population of 2.3 million crammed into an area 45 km (28 miles) long and 10 km wide, lacks the space needed for disposal, the UNDP says.</p>

<p>Landfills are now in an Israeli military zone. Israel's COGAT said they were in a restricted area but that access would be granted.</p>

<p>More recycling means more money to fund equipment such as industrial crushers, Mrakic said. They would have to enter via crossing points controlled by Israel.</p>

<p>Government officials report fuel and machinery shortages because of Israeli restrictions that slow clear-up efforts. The UNEP spokesperson said prolonged approval processes were a "major bottleneck".</p>

<p>Israel did not specifically comment on allegations it was restricting machinery.</p>

<p>The UNEP says it needs owners' permission to remove debris, yet the scale of destruction has blurred property boundaries, and some property records have been lost during the war.</p>

<p>Several donors have expressed interest in helping since a Palestinian government-hosted meeting in the West Bank on Aug. 12, Mrakic said, without naming them.</p>

<p>A U.N. official, requesting anonymity to avoid undermining ongoing efforts, said: "Everybody's concerned whether to invest in rebuilding Gaza if there is no political solution in place."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 31-year-long treasure hunt that attracted thousands of enthusiasts across France has come to an end.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 31-year-long treasure hunt that attracted thousands of enthusiasts across France has come to an end.&nbsp;The hunt, called “On the Trail of the Golden Owl,” was based on a book of riddles published in 1993. Participants had to solve 11 puzzles in the book, along with a 12th hidden puzzle, to discover the exact location of the replica of the golden owl.&nbsp;The official website of the search announced on Thursday that the token needed to claim the grand prize had been found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hunt's <a href="https://goldenowlhunt.com/the-golden-owl-is-won-after-31-years/">official chat line</a> announced, "We confirm that the replica of the golden owl was dug up last night and that simultaneously a solution has been sent on the online verification system."</p>

<p>The book, published in 1993 by author Regis Hauser and artist Michel Becker, gained a cult-like following with over 2 lakh players, known as ‘owlers,' from France and beyond, according to the hunt's official website. In a documentary posted on YouTube, Mr Becker mentioned that he oversaw and financed the creation of the prize, which is an owl made of 3 kg of gold and 7 kg of silver with diamond chips on its face.</p>

<p>Regis Hauser, the riddle maker, initially used the pen name Max Valentin to prevent the most determined treasure hunters from seeking him out. He died in 2009, French newspaper Le Monde reported.</p>

<p>According to a 2021 documentary, the concept was inspired by The Masquerade, a 1979 book of riddles by Kit Williams, where hunters also had to solve several puzzles to find a golden rabbit.</p>

<p>The writer of the treasure search was Michel Becker, a French artist who illustrated "Sur la Trace de la Chouette d'Or" ("On the Trail of the Golden Owl"), a picture book published in 1993, and sculpted the gold-and-silver owl promised to whoever could first solve the clues hidden in its pages. He and Hauser decided to bury a replica of the owl while keeping the valuable original in a safe place. Its value is estimated at £126,000 (Rs 1.39 crore), fans of the treasure hunt have said online.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the world's longest-running treasure hunt is believed to be The Secret, by Byron Preiss, published in 1982. It involves a search for 12 boxes of treasure buried at secret locations in the US and Canada, of which only three have been found.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mother of a British woman, who was among those taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, has written a heartfelt letter to her daughter and urged UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to ensure it's delivered in Gaza. Emily Damari, 28, is a British-Israeli dual citizen and was taken hostage from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, near the Gaza border, where she was born and raised, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13926257/mother-missing-British-hostage-hamas-Gaza-letter-daughter.html">Daily Mail </a>reported.</p>

<p>Mandy Damari, Emily's mother, travelled to Downing Street earlier this week and handed over the note for her daughter to Mr Starmer. She also urged the UK government to do more to bring Emily back home.</p>

<p>"It is breaking my heart a little more, day by day... Soon there will be nothing left of my heart - or Emily," Mandy, 63, was quoted as saying by the news outlet.</p>

<p>She said that most of the British people were still unaware that a UK citizen was still held hostage in Gaza. Hence, she urged Starmer to mention her daughter whenever the UK government talks about the hostages.</p>

<p>Requesting Starmer to use &nbsp;"every ounce of his influence" to get Emily back, Mandy said, "Diplomatic pressure, negotiations, humanitarian efforts — whatever it takes... We cannot let another day pass."</p>

<p>She said that the country can't afford to lose any more lives to the nightmare, adding, "We don't need tea and sympathy, we need actions, not words."</p>

<p><strong>Here's Mandy's heartfelt letter for her daughter:</strong></p>

<p>"Dear Emily,</p>

<p>I hope this note gets to you when you are alive and home with me, abba and all your family. And you'll see that we are all alive.</p>

<p>If it gets to you in Gaza know that we all love you and miss you and are sick with worry about what is happening to you every day and we are praying and meeting whoever we can to get you back home.</p>

<p>Please keep strong, keep praying and just be your beautiful self that I love to the moon and back. You will come home. And I promise that I'll never complain again about your perfume sticking to me when you're home.</p>

<p>Love you so much</p>

<p>Your Mum (who is always right!)"</p>

<p>In January this year, Dafna Elyakim, a released hostage, said in an interview with an Israeli TV channel that she and her sister were taken into underground tunnels by the Hamas militants where they met five other hostages. Besides Emily Damari, the other four mentioned by her are Liri Albag, Naama Levy, Romy Gonen and Agam Berger.</p>

<p>It is believed that Emily, kidnapped alongside twin brothers Ziv and Gali Berman, is still somewhere in the Gaza Strip, held hostage inside a deep underground tunnel. On Monday, it will be a year since the October 7 attack by Hamas militants in southern Israeli communities, killing at least 1,200 people and kidnapping over 250 others.</p>

<p>The report further said that Emily's beloved dog Choocha, a golden cockapoo, was shot dead by the Hamas militants in her arms, while she too suffered a gunshot wound to the hand.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Singapore's Pan Pacific Orchard hotel has been crowned the world's best new skyscraper, as recognised by The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore's Pan Pacific Orchard hotel has been crowned the world's best new skyscraper, as recognised by The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). The 23-storey, 140-metre-tall structure located in the heart of Singapore's iconic shopping district opened in June 2023 and has quickly gained global recognition.</p>

<p>The hotel, designed by Woha Architects, also won three other prestigious awards, including “Best Tall Building” in the 100m-199m category. The CTBUH, an esteemed global authority on skyscrapers, announced the awards during its recent conference held from September 23-27 across London and Paris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CTBUH CEO, Javier Quintana de Una, praised Pan Pacific Orchard, saying that the hotel “represents the best of responsible vertical urbanism today,” as per the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-s-pan-pacific-orchard-hotel-crowned-world-s-best-new-skyscraper">Straits Times</a>. Vertical urbanism is a concept that promotes the sustainable use of urban spaces by building upwards, maximising land use while incorporating greenery into the design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pan Pacific Orchard is celebrated for integrating eco-friendly elements into its design. It features solar panels, rainwater harvesting for irrigation and an on-site biodigester to manage food waste. The hotel's lush greenery mirrors Singapore's focus on sustainable development, with high trees, gardens, and pools enveloping the guest experience. It achieved a green plot ratio of over 300 per cent, meaning it has more than three times the landscaped surface area of its footprint.</p>

<p>The hotel is divided into four distinct environments: the Forest Terrace, Beach Terrace, Garden Terrace and Cloud Terrace. Each zone offers unique experiences, from a high-ceiling lobby with towering trees to a sandy beachfront and meandering pools. The Cloud Terrace hosts a pillarless ballroom, one of the highest in Singapore, ideal for exclusive events.</p>

<p>This recognition further strengthens Woha Architects' standing, following past accolades for projects like Kampung Admiralty and Oasia Hotel Downtown. The Pan Pacific Orchard hotel also earned Singapore's Green Mark Platinum award – the nation's highest environmental certification – in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same CTBUH event, other Asian skyscrapers also received recognition. Malaysia's Petronas Towers won the Global Icon award, while China's Greenland Hangzhou Century Centre was named Asia's best tall building.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 21-year-old man has been arrested and charged with the murder of his 20-year-old wife who disappeared from their home in Pendleton, South Carolina, on August 1.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested and charged with the murder of his 20-year-old wife who disappeared from their home in Pendleton, South Carolina, on August 1. Brandon Barnes was arrested and charged with one count of murder in connection to the death of his wife, Jessica Barnes, reported <a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/missing-woman-pendleton-jessica-barnes-home-search/62300209 ">WYFF4</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to authorities, Brandon allegedly enlisted the help of their two roommates, Kendall Mims and Victoria Tippett, in moving Jessica's body after her death. They were charged with “accessory after the fact, Obstruction of Justice and Misprision of a Felony.”</p>

<p>Jessica Barnes was last seen on August 1 at her home in Pendleton, South Carolina, which she shared with her husband, Brandon, and two roommates, Mims and Tippett.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She was not reported missing until September 10, when her mother, Cecilia Varvara, contacted the Pendleton Police Department. Her body was discovered kilometres away in a woody area near Twin Lakes in Pickens County on September 20.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pickens County Coroner's Office determined the cause of death to be “asphyxiation by strangulation”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a press conference on Wednesday, Pendleton Police Chief Robert Crosby said, "Details surrounding the disappearance were vague and material and personnel from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) were required and needed for this continued investigation."</p>

<p>Chief Crosby confirmed that Jessica Barnes' mother had claimed several times that she received text messages from an account in Jessica's name after her disappearance, but she didn't believe they were sent by her daughter. On September 20, police searched the home where the couple lived with their roommates, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/us-news/south-carolina-wife-jessica-barnes-allegedly-murdered-by-husband-brandon-and-two-roommates/ ">NY Post</a> reported.</p>

<p>Pendleton Police collected "clues, articles of clothing and electronic devices" from the residence. Their investigation also led police to the car of one of the couple's roommates at a location regularly visited by both Jessica and Brandon Barnes. Phone records allegedly showed that Brandon Barnes had driven the vehicle to the location, though it wasn't immediately clear which roommate's car the police traced.</p>

<p>During their investigation, authorities discovered remains in nearby Pickens County, which were not immediately identified, according to a statement from Pendleton Police this week. On October 1, a Pickens County coroner confirmed that the remains belonged to Jessica.</p>

<p>After the remains were found, Pendleton Police, along with SLED, interviewed Jessica's husband, Brandon Barnes, and the couple's two roommates, Kendall Mims and Victoria Tippett, according to an official statement. Following these interviews, police charged the three with several offences including a murder charge for Brandon. Both women allegedly confessed to their involvement, according to their affidavits.</p>

<p>Victoria Tippett is also accused of failing to report a crime, despite "witnessing" the killing and having several opportunities to inform the police, as outlined in the affidavits. Police further alleged that Mims failed to report the crime, even though she had been told about the killing.</p>

<p>"There were some issues with her and her husband. They were having the typical marital disputes, argumentative, and then, she just left,” Chief Crosby said earlier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The tree, linked to Biblical times, shows medicinal properties, including anti-cancer compounds. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ancient 1,000-year-old seed has grown into a tree named "Sheba" in Israel. The tree, linked to Biblical times, shows medicinal properties, including anti-cancer compounds. Scientists believe it could be linked to historical resins mentioned in religious texts.</p>

<p>This remarkable development began when archaeologists unearthed the pristine seed in the 1980s. Years later, Dr Sarah Sallon, from the Louis L Borick Natural Medicine Research Centre in Jerusalem, initiated a study to plant the seed, which was remarkably dated to be 1,000 years old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To the researchers' surprise, a tiny shoot emerged just five weeks after planting, leading scientists to identify the tree as part of the Commiphora genus, although its exact species remains unknown and is likely extinct.</p>

<p>Now it has grown into a 10-feet-tall tree. Despite thriving in height, the tree has yet to flower or produce fruit. Researchers believe it could be linked to a healing plant mentioned in the Bible. This project is part of a broader effort to bring back extinct species, like the woolly mammoth and dodo, using hybrid techniques.</p>

<p>Beyond plants, scientists are also studying ancient DNA for new drugs and insights into genetic diversity, which could benefit modern medicine. These efforts show how exploring the past can help us understand and improve our future.</p>

<p>In parallel, Mount Everest is rising more rapidly than previously thought, growing at a rate of about 0.08 inches (2 millimetres) per year due to geological processes dating back millions of years. A recent phenomenon known as “river piracy” is contributing to this unexpected growth.</p>

<p>In Denmark, archaeologists found a Viking-era burial ground with over 50 well-preserved skeletons, including a woman buried in a wagon. They plan to extract DNA from the remains to learn more about the people buried there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the northern bald ibis population has rebounded thanks to dedicated efforts, growing from just 59 pairs in the 1990s to over 500 today. Other reintroduction programs, including teaching zoo-raised ibises their migration routes using ultralight aircraft, have helped these distinctive birds return to Europe for the first time since the 1600s.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The dog, named Gita, was first seen sitting in the middle of the road in a remote wooded area in Washington's Stevens County by a deputy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A loyal rescue dog named Gita has been hailed as a "hero" after she saved&nbsp;her 84-year-old owner's life by guiding an officer to his location following a severe fall in the woods. The incident occurred on September 25, when Deputy Dean Jones of the Stevens County Sheriff's Office found Gita sitting in the middle of a remote wooded road.</p>

<p>The deputy tried to get Gita into his vehicle, but she refused to go in. Deputy Jones searched nearby homes but couldn't find the dog's owner. Growing worried, Jones returned to Gita, lying on the road's centerline, said the Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="250" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fstevenscountysheriff%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0m3KKRvaeJ2zacE9j1BE5xwByYhYro3m7LwrRGXm5YRBpyFs3ErsTHpQQc2DbA5RJl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>When Jones tried to move Gita to safety, she darted down a nearby unmarked path. The deputy followed her, and she eventually led him to a small summer cabin. Near the cabin, Jones heard an elderly man's faint voice calling for help. The 84-year-old man had fallen hours earlier, injuring his leg and unable to take his medication.</p>

<p>He had fallen and injured his leg, which could have led to serious consequences if he wasn't found. Authorities added that he had been injured for three hours and also had other medical conditions that required attention.</p>

<p>“It turns out the dog, Gita, is a 13-year-old rescue dog and best friend of the gentleman in trouble,” said the Sheriff's Office. “We credit Gita for saving his life that day. The loyalty and heroism of our furry friends never cease to amaze us,”&nbsp; the Sheriff's Office added. The sheriff's office did not provide details about how Gita's owner was treated or where he was taken. "Thank you Gita for being a good girl and true hero," the statement concluded.</p>

<p>This comes four months after another dog ran six kilometres to find help for his owner, who had crashed his car into a ravine in Oregon. That owner was eventually rescued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<li class="CetSht_li">The pagers' most sinister feature was a two-step de-encryption procedure that ensured most users would be holding the pager with both hands when it detonated.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel came up with the pager idea in 2022, and parts of the plan began falling into place more than a year before Hamas's October 7 attack, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/05/israel-mossad-hezbollah-pagers-nasrallah/" rel="nofollow,noindex">The Washington Post reported</a>.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Because Hezbollah leaders were alert to possible sabotage, the pagers could not originate in Israel, the US or any other Israeli ally. So, in 2023, Hezbollah began getting solicitations for the bulk purchase of Taiwanese-branded Apollo pagers, a well-recognised trademark and product line with worldwide distribution and no discernible links to Israeli or Jewish interests. The Taiwanese company had no knowledge of the plan, officials said, according to The Washington Post article.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Most top elected officials in Israel were unaware of the capability until September 12, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned his intelligence advisers for a meeting to discuss potential action against Hezbollah, Israeli officials told the newspaper.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google-owned YouTube said in a latest update that it has reinstated all channels and most videos that were removed due to a technical glitch or a bug.</p>

<p>After a bug incorrectly flagged some channels for spam and removed them, YouTube began working on the fix.</p>

<p>“Happy to report that all channels and most videos incorrectly removed have been reinstated and subscriptions are restored (we're still working on the last few, bear with us),” YouTube said in a post on X social media platform early on Sunday.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>“We know this caused some disruption, and we so appreciate your patience while we sort this out,” the company added.</p>

<p>The Google-owned company earlier said that their teams were “still working on reinstating the incorrectly removed channels and access to subscriptions”.</p>

<p>“We're sorry for the trouble! Some content like playlists may be delayed, but it's all coming back. Thanks for your patience while we work on this,” the company had mentioned in a post on X.</p>

<p>The YouTube channels were incorrectly removed for “Spam and Deceptive Practices.” That included access to all subscriptions (YouTube TV, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music).</p>

<p>The company also mentioned that some YouTube creators might have some content, like playlists, missing. But those will also be restored soon, the company added.</p>

<p>The original notice and subsequent updates on the support page have been addressed to "Content Creators”.</p>

<p>Although, some non-content creators have been unable to access their YouTube account, watch YouTube videos, or listen to YouTube Music too.</p>

<p>According to reports, with some paid subscriptions, like YouTube Premium, not available, saved content cannot be viewed including playlists.</p>

<p>YouTube, however, did not confirm how many users were affected by the technical glitch.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dubai's Emirates airline has implemented a ban on pagers and walkie-talkies on its flights, responding to recent attacks linked to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. In a statement released on Friday, the airline announced that all passengers travelling to, from, or via Dubai are prohibited from carrying these devices in both checked and cabin baggage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Such items found in passengers' hand luggage or checked baggage will be confiscated by Dubai Police,” the airline warned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision comes in the wake of alarming incidents where&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-pagers-walkie-talkies-banned-on-flights-from-lebanon-after-deadly-blasts-6606808">thousands of pagers exploded</a> simultaneously across Lebanon, followed by walkie-talkies detonating in a similar manner. Lebanese officials have attributed these attacks to Israel, which has heightened tensions in the region. At least 37 people, including children, were killed, and nearly 3,000 others injured as a result of these twin device attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a Lebanese security source, the explosive material was cleverly concealed within the lithium batteries of the pagers, making it nearly undetectable.</p>

<p>In addition to the ban on pagers and walkie-talkies, Emirates confirmed that it will resume services to Jordan's capital, Amman, on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emirates has announced that flights to and from Beirut will remain cancelled through October 15, and passengers transiting through Dubai to reach Beirut will not be permitted to travel from their point of origin until further notice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flights to and from Iraq and Iran will remain cancelled until at least Monday. Other airlines in the region have also cancelled flights to Beirut and several other airports as safety concerns continue to rise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation escalated over the weekend when <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-israeli-airstrikes-hit-beirut-hezbollah-heir-apparent-missing-10-points-6726826 ">Israeli fighter jets launched significant airstrikes</a> on southern Beirut on Saturday.&nbsp;The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that they aimed to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure and warned residents to evacuate the area before the strikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since September 23, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed&nbsp;over 1,110 people&nbsp;and displaced more than a million people. Reports indicate that Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah figure, is missing, with communication lost amid the bombings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The music industry has long evaded a #MeToo reckoning like that experienced in Hollywood or the media, but the blockbuster charges against hip hop magnate Sean Combs could finally prove an inflection point.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors say the artist known by various monikers including "Diddy" ran a criminal sex ring that preyed on women and blackmailed them into silence -- accusations that have activists and industry watchers hoping music's moment of accountability has arrived.</p>

<p>Their hope has been bolstered by a massive class action suit that followed Combs's federal charges, as well as a new lawsuit against country star Garth Brooks.</p>

<p>When an explosive series of accusations against R&amp;B hitmaker R. Kelly went public five years ago, outlets including AFP asked if that was the beginning of a sea change in music.</p>

<p>Kelly was convicted and sentenced to more than 30 years of prison for child sex crimes, sex trafficking and racketeering.</p>

<p>It was indeed a milestone for the #MeToo movement as the first major sex abuse trial where the majority of accusers were Black women.</p>

<p>But wider cultural shifts in the industry long-cliched as a bastion of sex, drugs and rock and roll didn't seem to crystallize.</p>

<p>The shock rocker Marilyn Manson, the music mogul Russell Simmons, the DJ Diplo, the producer Dr. Luke -- over the years women have made serious accusations against these and many other powerful men in the industry. Few repercussions have followed.</p>

<p>"There's this whole pass we give rock stars because of the rock star trope," said Caroline Heldman, an Occidental College professor and co-founder of the Sound Off Coalition, which is focused on sexual violence in the music industry.</p>

<p>"A lot of survivors that I've spoken with from the music industry, they've internalized the rock star idea -- that they should have expected" bad behavior, "because he was a rock star," she told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'Keep survivors quiet'</strong></p>

<p>Kate Grover -- a women's and gender studies professor at Washington and Lee University, who has researched intersections of gender and the music industry -- said the notion of "geniuses" is also particularly pronounced in music.</p>

<p>"Once we have labeled someone as a genius," she said, "it kind of creates a scarcity model," where they're seen as too big to fail.</p>

<p>But women "are seen as much more disposable within the music industry than men," she added.</p>

<p>Many experts including Grover and Heldman say race is a clear factor when considering which cases are taken seriously by the wider public. Celebrity also plays a major role.</p>

<p>The victims in Kelly's lawsuits were young Black girls and women who "did not have the kind of star power that a lot of the actresses who came forward against Harvey Weinstein did," Grover said.</p>

<p>And pop's top musicians are frequently empires in their own right, said Heldman, "who employ a people who help them in their years of perpetration."</p>

<p>Since the initial lawsuit against Combs by his longtime partner Cassie Ventura, many similar lawsuits have followed. He is imprisoned on federal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, awaiting trial.</p>

<p>The volume of the class action suit against him that followed this week "really speaks to the power of certain people in the music industry to marshal their fame and their resources to keep survivors quiet," said Heldman.</p>

<p><strong>'Systemic issues'</strong></p>

<p>A burst of litigation against other powerful men in music, from artists to CEOs, also followed Ventura's suit.</p>

<p>The myriad allegations underscored "the gravity of the situation" wrote singer-songwriter and activist Tiffany Red, who has worked with Ventura, in an open letter to Combs last December.</p>

<p>"The systemic issues of rape culture and misogyny deeply entrenched in the music industry pose a real threat to so many people's safety every day in this business," Red wrote.</p>

<p>"How can we expect meaningful change when senior leadership and superstars face accusations of these crimes?"</p>

<p>Heldman also pointed to "perverse market incentives:" Kelly's sales jumped more than 500 percent after his racketeering conviction, with streams jumping 22 percent over the week that followed.</p>

<p>Similiarly Diddy's music saw an average 18.3 percent increase in on-demand streams the week of his arrest compared to that prior, according to industry data company Luminate.</p>

<p>Some of that might be curiosity after a name is in the news, but Heldman also pointed to the intense fandoms musicians enjoy.</p>

<p>"In years of doing this work with survivors in different industries, I've never seen anything like the fan dedication to musical artists," she said.</p>

<p>Still, Heldman said, "it feels like we are on the crest of something."</p>

<p>"I would anticipate any rapist artist who has been operating with the idea that he can silence survivors now knows that the jig is up."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong's police force is taking on a campaign to install thousands of surveillance cameras across the city to ramp up their crime-fighting capabilities. The Chinese city, consistently ranked among the world's safest, plans to introduce facial recognition and artificial intelligence tools to enhance law enforcement. Critics, however, warn that this could come at the cost of privacy and freedom.</p>

<p>Hong Kong has close to 55,000&nbsp;public CCTV cameras, with plans to add 2,000 more this year, announced security Chief Chris Tang in July. The police force is considering equipping these cameras with facial recognition technology and AI tools to help identify suspects. “The police will definitely comply with relevant laws,” said the force in a statement to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/asia/hong-kong-police-cameras-facial-recognition-intl-hnk-dst/index.html ">CNN</a>, though details on when these technologies might be deployed remain vague.</p>

<p>Experts are raising alarms about the repressive potential of surveillance technology, especially in Hong Kong. They draw parallels to mainland China's extensive surveillance systems, highlighting the heightened concern in Hong Kong, where political dissent has been severely limited since the national security law was introduced after the 2019 anti-government protests.</p>

<p>Hong Kong already has more than 54,500 public CCTV cameras, equating to about seven cameras per 1,000 people. That number puts it on par with major cities like New York, though far behind China's urban centres, where an average of 440 cameras per 1,000 people is commonplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Tang highlighted that countries like the UK have also started using facial recognition cameras. However, experts warn that even in these democracies, the implementation of such technology has raised significant concerns about privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Normann Witzleb, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said, “It's important to design guidelines for those systems that take proper recognition of the potential benefits that they have, but that also acknowledge they're not foolproof, and that they have the potential to interfere with (people's) rights in serious ways,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute, warned that the new cameras could be used for political repression under the guise of fighting crime. “This is likely to be a further step in making Hong Kong law enforcement closer to how it is done on the Chinese mainland,” he said.</p>

<p>Samantha Hoffman, a nonresident fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, noted, “The difference is how the technology is being used.” While Western democracies face their challenges with surveillance technology, she argues that the situation in Hong Kong is fundamentally different due to the legal framework supporting the government's authority. She remarked, “When you feel like you're being monitored, that affects your behaviour and your feelings of freedom,” as per CNN.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/t4rmm39_iphone_625x300_06_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>Typing this essay on a MacBook Air, tethered to an iPhone Pro (not the latest model) for accessing the internet, reeks of hypocrisy. Yet, certain issues need to be highlighted using all resources at hand. The news cycle around the sale of iPhone 16 across India is yet another reminder of how the industrially produced concoction of glamour, envy, and cultural imperialism continues to define most markets in the Global South.</p>

<p>Economics perceives envy-an essentially negative emotion - as a powerful driver for economic growth. It is said to positively impact "consumers' achievement motivation and raising their purchasing and spending rates". The more you envy, the more you intend to earn and spend. Owning an iPhone has been an envy-induced and inducing activity for many consumers ever since its launch in 2007. The sleek iPhone was the new Onida television, minus the devil hissing "neighbour's envy, owner's pride".</p>

<h2><strong>Simulation Is Supreme&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The iPhone is a curious gadget - it is both a product and a platform in the industrial production of glamour. Was it always intended to be so? Let's go to what experts were saying about the telecom revolution and the advent of the smartphone at the beginning of the 21st century. Thomas Elsaesser's 2005 observation is worth quoting in some detail:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Will it be the sheer everyday usefulness, the universal popularity, and - lest we forget - the ruinous sums telecom firms have invested in licenses for "third-generation" cellphones that win the day, or kids playing computer-games that simulate ever more sophisticated parallel worlds? Whatever redefines the function of sound-and-images combinations in our culture, the entrepreneurial risks and the profitable stakes are equally high."</p>

<p>A quarter of a century later, the answer is clear. Simulation has squarely trumped any and all utility functions. Smartphone has become the space where people curate worlds for influence and clout.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The World Of Influencers And Aspirations</strong></h2>

<p>Most discussions around social media obsession focus on the behaviour of the weak and the vulnerable: children/adolescents or the economically marginalised. How social media fuels aspirations, how the world of influencers prey on these aspirations, how children and other vulnerable groups see social media as empowering with all its possibilities, and such. What needs to be examined more, however, is how the adult 'haves' of society are vitiating it for the 'have-nots' by getting on an envy-horse and indulging in a reckless production of a sense of fascination. Posing with a high-end luxury shopping bag - even if it's empty-is not necessarily directed at the slum-dwellers. It's purely for the peers to consume and, hopefully, be envious of. The slum dwellers are mere collaterals of this glamour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kiran V Bhatia, while assessing children's digital experiences in Indian slums, notes that digitally produced glamour "allows users to compensate for the "lack" in their lives resulting from the socio-economic and cultural constraints they face". The slum children, for example, gain "liminal access to experiences they aspire to participate in" through social media images. Bhatia notes that this access and participation seldom result in actual upward mobility in class. This makes one thing clear: Though impacted perhaps the most, these children are not the intended audience for the garden variety glamour posters. Yes, they are important as "followers"-data.</p>

<h2><strong>'Curation' Is The Keyword</strong></h2>

<p>It must be added here that not all glamour is created around expensive commodities and experiences. There is enough pontificating about a new book - because one wants to signal intellectual moorings without possessing any. Or long posts around a newly acquired cultural signifier like wine because, finally, one has arrived. Curation is the keyword.</p>

<p>This curation, unbeknownst to the curator, is the first step towards iSlavery that scholars like Jack Linchuan Qiu want to be acknowledged and, consequently, abolished. Qiu argues, "Digital objects such as smartphones have not only failed to deliver their emancipatory promise, but have created instead new conditions of enslavement". The impact of this digital enslavement is for everyone to see: brain imaging has revealed that screen obsession is causing neurological disorders in children and adolescents, medical science research has established. What it is doing to adults is perhaps even more dangerous-adults are choosing to be enslaved to their life on the screen, unlike the children. They are the 'ultimate slaves', borrowing Orlando Patterson's phrase. Seemingly empowered, wealthy, controllers of narratives, but utterly vulnerable. Standing in a queue for more than twenty hours to buy the latest iPhone, or the inability to be one's authentic self, unless it's for another hey-look-at-me-this-is-the-real-me social media post - if this is not the vulnerability of the ultimate slaves, what is?</p>

<h2><strong>iSlavery</strong></h2>

<p>The cultural imperialism of the United States of America hinges on this digital ultimate slavery. The rapid global penetration in the global mobile sector&nbsp;of Apple's iPhone is incumbent mainly not so much on the end users marvelling at its technological leaps but on their ability to flaunt it as a possession. The possession that allows them to flaunt other possessions. Slavery exploits the body, whole or parts, in an abnormal labour-capital transaction, as Christian Fuchs puts it. What is being exploited in this case is the human brain-the site of ideas, emotions, and more.</p>

<p>And one day, it is bound to lead to anomie-nothingness.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Imran Khan's party leaders have been staging protests, claiming that the Pakistan government should adhere to the constitution.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A leader of jailed former premier Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has said that the party plans to "invite" External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to join its protests here, triggering a sharp response from the ruling coalition on Saturday. Mr Jaishankar will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's Council of Heads of Government (SCO-CHG) meeting in Pakistan on October 15 and 16.</p>

<p>Muhammad Ali Saif, an advisor on information to the chief minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province ruled by Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, invited <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/1-member-of-saarc-practising-cross-border-terrorism-s-jaishankar-6725111">Mr Jaishankar</a> to participate in the ongoing protests while speaking on a Geo News programme late on Friday night.</p>

<p>"PTI will invite Jaishankar, Indian External Affairs Minister, to come and join PTI's protest and speak to our people and see that Pakistan is a strong democracy where everyone has a right to protest," Mr&nbsp;Saif said sarcastically in response to a question.</p>

<p>Reacting strongly, Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcast and a leader of the major ruling partner Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), said Mr&nbsp;Saif's invitation to the Indian foreign minister is "highly irresponsible" and amounts to "enmity towards Pakistan."</p>

<p>Sarjeel Memon, Sindh province's Information Minister and a leader of another ruling partner Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), said: "Today the PTI is inviting Jaishankar to its protest and tomorrow it will call Israeli premier for the purpose. This party is anti-Pakistan and wants to sabotage the SCO summit through its protest."</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the PTI's invitation to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/not-going-there-to-discuss-india-pakistan-relations-jaishankar-on-his-upcoming-islamabad-visit-for-sco-summit-6721390">Mr&nbsp;Jaishankar</a> "put a question mark on the credibility of Khan's party."</p>

<p>However, after the government ministers' sharp reactions, Mr&nbsp;Saif said his statement about Mr Jaishankar was taken out of context.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pak-capital-locked-down-as-imran-khans-supporters-try-to-seize-the-streets-6722928">PTI has been staging protests</a>, claiming that the government should adhere to the constitution, pressing for the judiciary's independence, against rising inflation apart from demanding the release of its 72-year-old founder.</p>

<p>Currently incarcerated at the Adilala Jail in Rawalpindi, Khan was arrested on August 5, 2023. Facing dozens of cases, he has been convicted in a few of them.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Pakistan Army troops were deployed in Islamabad to ensure security ahead of the PTI's protest rally at the D-Chowk. The army would remain in the city from October 5-17 to maintain law and order for the upcoming SCO, the government had announced.</p>

<p>The authorities have taken strict measures to stop the PTI from entering Islamabad, blocking all highways leading to the city, banning pillion riding and suspending mobile phone services.</p>

<p>Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which bans public gatherings, political assemblies, and demonstrations, has also been imposed in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to outlaw any political assembly or protest.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

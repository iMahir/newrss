       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Dutch court on Wednesday sentenced a woman to 10 years in prison for joining Islamic State in Syria and keeping a Yazidi woman as slave.</p>

<p>Prosecutors had asked for an 8-year sentence for the Dutch woman, 33-year old Hasna Aarab, but the District Court in The Hague said the gravity of slavery as a crime against humanity required a stronger punishment.</p>

<p>Judges said it was clear that Aarab had actively participated in the enslavement of a Yazidi woman between 2015 and 2016, while she lived in Raqqa with her young son and her ISIS terrorist husband.</p>

<p>The Yazidi woman, identified only as Z., had been forced to work in their household. She was also sexually abused.</p>

<p>Aarab knew of Z.'s dire situation and made it worse by ordering her to do household work and take care of her son, the judges said.</p>

<p>"She did this, knowing that what happened in her house was part of a widespread, systemic attack on the Yazidi community," the court said.</p>

<p>"These types of crimes against humanity are among the worst international crimes possible."</p>

<p>Islamic State controlled swathes of Iraq and Syria from 2014-2017, before being defeated in its last bastions in Syria in 2019.</p>

<p>It viewed the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority, as devil worshippers and killed more than 3,000 of them, as well as enslaving 7,000 Yazidi women and girls and displacing most of the 550,000-strong community from its ancestral home in northern Iraq.</p>

<p>Aarab was also convicted of joining a terrorist organisation, of enabling acts of terrorism and for putting the life of her young child at risk.</p>

<p>She had been accused of slavery by two women, but the court said there was not enough proof of the accusations of the other woman, identified as S.</p>

<p>Aarab had told the court earlier in the trial that she moved from the Netherlands to ISIS-held territory in Syria in 2015 with her son to try to change her life for the better.</p>

<p>But she had denied taking an active part in the enslavement of the women and told judges the Yazidi victims were lying when they said she gave them orders and forced them to pray.</p>

<p>Aarab was held in Kurdish detention camps after the fall of IS and was repatriated by the Dutch government in 2022.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The father and stepmother of Sara Sharif, a 10-year-old girl who was found dead in her home in Britain, were on Wednesday convicted of her murder after a trial which heard harrowing details of her treatment before her killing.</p>

<p>Sara Sharif was found dead in August 2023 at her home in Woking, a town southwest of London, after what prosecutors say was a campaign of "serious and repeated violence".</p>

<p>The family fled to Pakistan immediately after Sara Sharif was killed, before they were arrested in September 2023 at London's Gatwick airport after flying from Dubai.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Sara had suffered a litany of injuries, including burns, broken bones and bite marks.</p>

<p>Sara's father Urfan Sharif, 43, and his wife Beinash Batool, 30, stood trial at London's Old Bailey court charged with her murder, which they denied.</p>

<p>The jury convicted Urfan Sharif and Batool of Sara's murder. Sara's uncle Faisal Malik, 29, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of causing or allowing Sara's death.</p>

<p>Sharif and Batool will be sentenced on Dec. 17.</p>

<p>Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Urfan Sharif had called police and said: "It wasn't my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much."</p>

<p>Sharif gave evidence and initially denied responsibility for Sara's death. He accepted slapping Sara to discipline her, but denied beating her in a regular or sustained way.</p>

<p>But Urfan Sharif, under questioning from Batool's lawyer Caroline Carberry, later said he took "full responsibility" for his daughter's death.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Batool, who did not give evidence, said Urfan Sharif was violent and controlling and that she was scared of him.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[President-elect Donald Trump is planning a blizzard of more than 25 executive orders and directives on his first day in office on Jan. 20 as he seeks to dramatically reshape U.S. government policy on issues from immigration to energy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump is planning a blizzard of more than 25 executive orders and directives on his first day in office on Jan. 20 as he seeks to dramatically reshape U.S. government policy on issues from immigration to energy.</p>

<p>Two sources familiar with the effort said Trump has told his team he wants to make a "big splash" with the Day One orders, looking to exert his executive power with greater scale and speed than he did during his first term. The number of planned orders has not been previously reported.</p>

<p>The Republican issued only a handful of such orders on the first day of his 2017-2021 presidency. In contrast, Democratic President Joe Biden issued 17 executive orders on his first day in office in 2021, many of which were aimed at rolling back Trump's policies.</p>

<p>"The American people can bank on President Trump using his executive power on day one to deliver on the promises he made to them on the campaign trail," Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said when asked about the executive order plans.</p>

<p>U.S. presidents frequently issue executive orders to make good on campaign pledges and quickly establish their policy objectives without going through the lengthy process of getting legislation through Congress. The orders can be subject to court challenges, however, and typically any money set aside to carry out the mandates of the orders has to be approved by Congress.</p>

<p>One of the sources familiar with the Trump team's plans said there was recognition internally that each action required an enormous amount of coordination among the affected government agencies, potentially slowing things down and reducing the overall number of Day One orders.</p>

<p>More orders and directives will be issued in the days and weeks afterward, the sources told Reuters.</p>

<p>The effort is being coordinated by Stephen Miller, a long-time Trump aide who will be a top White House adviser when Trump begins his second term, four sources said.</p>

<p>The Trump team is working from lists of draft orders provided by groups such as the America First Policy Institute, a think tank founded in 2021 to promote Trump policies and ideas, as well as the Conservative Partnership Institute and the Heritage Foundation, two other right-leaning organizations.</p>

<h2><strong>FIRST WAVE</strong></h2>

<p>Trump's post-inaugural orders on the first day are expected to mostly focus on rolling back what Trump views as Biden's overly permissive border policies and preventing new surges of migration along the U.S. southern border with Mexico, two sources said.</p>

<p>He is expected to sign executive orders that give immigration officers more latitude to arrest people with no criminal records, send more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and restart construction of the border wall, three separate sources with knowledge of those draft orders said.</p>

<p>The orders will also include a drive to increase energy production and follow through on Trump's oft-stated campaign vow to "drill, baby, drill" and "frack, frack, frack," the sources said.</p>

<p>While some of the moves would face stiff court challenges or would require legislation or new agency regulations - which can take many months to implement - there are dozens of actions that Trump can in fact take with the stroke of a pen.</p>

<p>Trump told NBC's "Meet the Press" in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he plans to take executive action on his first day in office to try to end birthright citizenship, which confers citizenship on anyone born in the U.S. regardless of their parents' immigration status.</p>

<p>Trump advisers say they are prepared for court challenges to this move.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to sign a Day One order stripping federal funds from schools teaching critical race theory, an academic concept - rarely taught in public schools - that rests on the premise that racial bias is baked into U.S. institutions.</p>

<p>He has said he would issue an order on the first day that would remove some anti-discrimination protections the Biden administration had afforded to transgender students. Trump also promised to sign an executive order designed to stop federal contractors from carrying out certain diversity training programs.</p>

<p>One source who has worked on transition matters for Trump's incoming State Department described helping to prepare an executive order that would determine whether any hiring decisions at the agency have been made for race or gender-based characteristics rather than merit.</p>

<p>It was not clear if that order would be rolled out on Day One, and Trump could always decide against issuing it.</p>

<p>The work on various executive orders appears to be diffuse, according to several people with knowledge of the transition's internal workings, with some orders being drafted up at Trump's de facto base in Palm Beach, Florida, and others at the think tanks in Washington.<br />

</div>

<p>Narrative sovereignty—the ability of a nation to control how it is perceived internationally—is an essential yet often overlooked dimension of sovereignty. Historically, colonial powers weaponised narratives to justify exploitation, portraying colonised nations as uncivilised and incapable of self-governance. This practice continues today in more insidious forms, with international organisations, global media, and, in some cases, foreign governments, framing narratives that often misrepresent India. These narratives, rooted in what Edward Said termed 'Orientalism', perpetuate stereotypes and biases that align with the geopolitical and economic interests of their creators.</p>

<p>Studies analysing global media coverage of developing countries have found that over 70% of articles from leading Western outlets portrayed these nations negatively, emphasising conflict, corruption, or poverty. This skewed framing shapes international perceptions and has tangible consequences. For instance, countries frequently portrayed as unstable or corrupt attract 20-25% less foreign direct investment than their peers, irrespective of their actual economic performance. This narrative also, in some cases, impacts sovereign ratings.</p>

<h2><strong>Why A Nation Should Be Free To Define Itself</strong></h2>

<p>Nations must prioritise safeguarding their narrative sovereignty because control over a nation's story is intrinsic to its autonomy, legitimacy, and capacity for self-determination. At its core, narrative sovereignty is about ensuring that a state retains the power to define its identity, articulate its aspirations, and shape its collective memory in ways that align with the interests of its people rather than external actors. Without this, the very essence of state sovereignty—rooted in its ability to govern itself—is compromised.</p>

<p>Hannah Arendt reminds us that power is fundamentally relational and the narratives that underpin a society are a key locus of that power. When a nation loses control over how it is perceived domestically and internationally, it risks surrendering a critical form of influence. Foreign actors with geopolitical agendas have long recognised this. Entities like OCCRP, often backed by state or private interests, are more than disseminators of information; they are architects of perception, framing issues in ways that serve external goals rather than reflecting nuanced realities. Their narratives can erode trust in domestic institutions, destabilise public opinion, and manipulate policy discourse—all without direct confrontation.</p>

<p>This also aligns with Joseph Nye's concept of 'soft power', where influence is achieved not through coercion but through attraction and persuasion. Nations that fail to assert narrative sovereignty effectively forfeit this form of power to external forces, undermining their ability to shape global perceptions or even their citizens' understanding of internal affairs. Barry Buzan's securitisation theory similarly highlights the importance of protecting intangible assets like narratives, treating them as vital to national security as physical infrastructure or borders.</p>

<h2><strong>Narrative And Legitimacy</strong></h2>

<p>Moreover, narratives play a foundational role in building national legitimacy and cohesion. Robert Putnam's work on social capital underscores how trust and collective identity are prerequisites for societal resilience. When a state's narrative is hijacked, it fractures this trust, creating polarisation and eroding the civic spirit necessary for collective progress. Over time, this delegitimisation leads to a form of cultural and political disintegration, as observed in Alasdair MacIntyre's <em>After Virtue</em>, where societies that fail to sustain coherent narratives face moral and structural entropy.</p>

<p>In the digital age, the stakes for narrative sovereignty are higher than ever because information flows with unprecedented speed and reach, often bypassing traditional accountability and control mechanisms. Digital platforms, which now serve as the primary vehicles for public discourse, amplify foreign narratives and disinformation campaigns, giving them an audience far beyond their origin. This amplification is not accidental; it is driven by algorithms designed to maximise engagement, often by prioritising sensationalism, outrage, or polarising content over accuracy or nuance. The consequence is an information ecosystem where the loudest, most provocative voices dominate, irrespective of their veracity or intent.</p>

<p>Scholars such as Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts have detailed how these information ecosystems are not neutral. In their book <em>Network Propaganda</em>, they demonstrate how digital platforms and their algorithms are inherently shaped by structural biases that serve elite interests, whether they are domestic or foreign. These platforms become conduits for influence operations, enabling powerful entities to control the narrative with minimal resistance. This dynamic creates an asymmetry where external actors with resources and expertise in narrative engineering gain disproportionate influence over a nation's discourse.</p>

<h2><strong>Regulatory Capture</strong></h2>

<p>This phenomenon mirrors what George Stigler and others have described as “regulatory capture”, though in a more insidious form. Instead of industries capturing regulators, foreign and elite actors capture the very platforms and structures through which narratives are constructed and disseminated. In this form of capture, the national narrative—its values, aspirations, and perceptions—is distorted to align with the interests of these external actors. Unlike traditional policy capture, this is more difficult to identify and address because it operates diffusely and in a decentralised manner, often cloaked in the rhetoric of free speech or transparency.</p>

<p>The implications are huge. When external entities manipulate the discourse, they distort public perception, shape policy debates, influence electoral outcomes, and undermine trust in democratic institutions. For instance, coordinated campaigns can highlight specific flaws or crises, ignoring context or progress, to delegitimise governments or policies. They can also create artificial divisions within society, exacerbating polarisation and weakening social cohesion. Over time, this erodes a nation's capacity for collective action, leaving it vulnerable to internal discord and external exploitation.</p>

<p>The role of algorithms is particularly critical here. These are not passive tools but active gatekeepers determining what information reaches whom and how it is framed. As Shoshana Zuboff argues in <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>, the logic of these systems is driven by commodification and profit, not public interest. In such a scenario, narratives that align with sensationalism and divisiveness gain traction, while those that require complexity and balance are sidelined. This systemic bias ensures that foreign narratives designed to exploit these tendencies find fertile ground.</p>

<h2><strong>Invest In The Marketplace Of Ideas</strong></h2>

<p>Moreover, this manipulation often operates in the shadows. Entities behind these campaigns are rarely transparent about their funding, intentions, or methodologies, making it challenging for states to counteract them effectively. Without robust regulatory frameworks to demand accountability from these platforms and the actors who exploit them, nations are left defenceless against this form of narrative intrusion.</p>

<p>To counter the erosion of narrative sovereignty, states must take concrete steps focused on transparency, education, and narrative infrastructure. First, governments should mandate independent algorithm audits for digital platforms to ensure they do not amplify divisive or sensational content. Platforms must be required to disclose data on content moderation and clearly label the origin of all sponsored or paid posts. The European Union's <em>Digital Services Act</em> offers a practical framework for implementing such transparency measures. Second, media literacy programs must be integrated into national education systems to equip citizens with the skills to identify misinformation and analyse content critically. Finland's <em>Anti-Fake News Initiative</em> is a model, combining public awareness campaigns with formal education to foster resilience against manipulation. Needless to say, the government should also invest in narrative infrastructure. Governments should actively participate in the marketplace of ideas.</p>

<p>Ultimately, narrative sovereignty is about reclaiming agency. It is about ensuring that a nation's story is told by those who understand and prioritise its people's aspirations. In this digital age, where perceptions shape reality, safeguarding narrative sovereignty is crucial. Anything less risks leaving a nation's destiny in the hands of those who neither share nor serve its interests.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tomb of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's father Hafez was torched in his hometown of Qardaha, AFP footage taken Wednesday showed, with rebel fighters in fatigues and young men watching it burn.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor told AFP the rebels had set fire to the mausoleum, located in the Latakia heartland of Assad's Alawite community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AFP footage showed parts of the mausoleum ablaze and damaged, with the tomb of Hafez torched and destroyed.</p>

<p>The vast elevated structure atop a hill has an intricate architectural design with several arches, its exterior embellished with ornamentation etched in stone.</p>

<p>It also houses the tombs of other Assad family members, including Bashar's brother Bassel, who was being groomed to inherit power before he was killed in a road accident in 1994.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels seized key cities before reaching Damascus and forcing Assad to flee, ending more than 50 years of his family's rule.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Afghan minister for refugees was killed on Wednesday in a suicide explosion at the ministry's offices in the capital Kabul, a government source told AFP.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately an explosion happened at the Ministry of Refugees and minister Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani has been martyred along with some of his colleagues," the official said, requesting not to be named.</p>

<p>He added that the explosion was caused by a suicide blast.</p>

<p>Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani -- who is on the US sanctions list and never appears without an automatic weapon in his hand -- was the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, who founded the terror group Haqqani network responsible for some of the most violent attacks during the Taliban's two-decade insurgency.</p>

<p>He was also the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current interior minister.</p>

<p>The Haqqanis are said to be engaged in a struggle for influence within the Taliban authorities.</p>

<p>According to press reports, they are pitted as a pragmatic faction up against supporters of the severe interpretation of Islamic law in line with the Taliban's supreme leader based in Kandahar.</p>

<p>Several senior Taliban leaders have been killed since their return to power, including provincial governors, commanders and religious clerics, mostly in attacks claimed by the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>Violence has waned in Afghanistan since the Taliban forces took over the country in 2021, ending their war against the United States and Nato-led foreign forces.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumours are swirling in Palm Beach that billionaire Elon Musk, a frequent visitor to Mar-a-Lago since Donald Trump's reelection campaign, is interested in purchasing a luxurious penthouse formerly owned by the late beauty mogul Sydell Miller.&nbsp;The luxurious Bristol Penthouse in West Palm Beach is a property that could potentially break records with a price tag exceeding $100 million.</p>

<p>The 19,000-square-foot penthouse is part of a 25-story waterfront condo. The complex offers high-end amenities, including a spa, fitness centre, pool, and concierge services, making it an ideal residence for the billionaire entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Notably, Musk has been spending a lot of time at President-elect Trump's estate, Mar-a-Lago, and has even brought his children along for holidays. This comes as Musk prepares to take on the role of co-chair of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a position announced by Trump.</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised that he would want to, and with his role within the new administration, be close to that," Agent Steve Hall&nbsp;told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/elon-musk-warming-up-south-florida-move-real-estate-insiders-say-reasons-endless">Fox News Digital.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>"I'm, through the grapevine, just hearing chatter. It does appear that he's more serious about buying a property here, buying something soon. He was considering some homes right near Mar-a-Lago, just to the north, and also considering some of the West Palm Beach condominiums," he added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's that time of year again … and we've invited 30 of our writers, from fields as disparate as wildlife ecology and mathematics to literature and politics, to share their best books of 2024. Of course, best books lists are subjective, relying on what people have read and remembered. But we always love finding out which books lingered for our writers.</p>

<p>This year, the Books &amp; Ideas team set ourselves the hard (but fun) task of picking our own best books too.</p>

<p>Suzy Freeman-Greene's best book was <a href="https://theconversation.com/security-or-self-sabotage-exiled-from-their-families-shirley-hazzard-and-elizabeth-harrower-followed-two-very-different-writing-paths-229381">Hazzard and Harrower: the letters</a>, edited by Brigitta Olubas and Susan Wyndham (NewSouth): four decades of correspondence between two fiercely intelligent writers as vivid, felt and dramatic as a fine novel. (Honorable mention: Samantha Harvey's <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/orbital-9781529922936">Orbital</a>).</p>

<p>James Ley's pick was <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/blue-lard-9781681378183">Blue Lard</a> (NY Review Books) by dissident Russian novelist Vladimir Sorokin. It is not for the faint-hearted: a bizarre and baffling mashup of science fiction and alternative history, cut with outrageous grotesquery and irreverent parodies of classic Russian literature. (Honourable mention: Rachel Kushner's <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/creation-lake-9781529933383">Creation Lake</a>.)</p>

<p>And Jo Case's best book was <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781529062762/">Liars</a> (Picador), Sarah Manguso's electric, vividly poetic fragmented divorce novel (the standout in a fertile 2024 genre): a masterclass in balancing cold precision and blazing emotion. (Honourable mention and close second: Fiona McFarlane's inventive fictional riff on true crime, <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-fiona-mcfarlanes-highway-13-an-uncanny-restlessness-haunts-the-australian-psyche-232386">Highway 13</a>.)</p>

<p>We'd love to hear your best books of 2024 too –&nbsp;please share them in the comments at the end of this article.</p>

<p>There are many ways of reading Jock Serong's <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com.au/9781460765357/cherrywood/">Cherrywood</a> (Fourth Estate), and it helps to know Enid Blyton's Magic Faraway Tree and the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy. Regardless, Serong has created a magical world, illuminated by language that is both lyrical and straightforward. Central to the story is the history of a stack of timber, sourced mysteriously from somewhere in the Caucasus, which links two periods of time, divided by 70 years, all flowing together in a wonderful mix of realism and fantasy.</p>

<p>I've enjoyed several recent books, including Dava Sobel's <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780008536923/the-elements-of-marie-curie/">fresh retelling of Marie Curie's story</a> – and my pick, Jim Baggott and John L. Heilbron's challenging but compelling <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/quantum-drama-9780192846105?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp;">Quantum Drama: From the Bohr-Einstein Debate to the Riddle of Entanglement</a> (Oxford University Press). This detailed history of quantum theory includes a terrific explanation of the mysterious “Bell inequality” – which enabled experimenters to prove Einstein's “spooky” concept of entanglement is real – and a fascinating glimpse into key players' personal, political and philosophical responses to their bizarre quantum discoveries.</p>

<p>Lauren Samuelsson's witty, illuminating history of the Australian Women's Weekly's food pages <a href="https://publishing.monash.edu/product/a-matter-of-taste/">A Matter of Taste</a> (Monash University Publishing) reveals their influence on how Australians cooked, ate and entertained in the 20th century. It's also a fascinating account of changing gender roles: food was largely women's domestic responsibility and could be a chore, but also provided a space of creativity. This is a view of Australia's past from the kitchen bench, rather than the driver's seat of the family car. I'll bet your mum would love it for Christmas.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uqp.com.au/books/the-sunbird">The Sunbird</a> by Sara Haddad (University of Queensland Press) is a short book, a novella, designed to be read in one sitting. It was written after the Gaza war commenced and conveys an urgency to tell the Palestinian story. It focuses on Nabila Yasmeen, a Palestinian woman who lives in Australia because she was exiled from her native Palestine during the 1948 <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-nakba-how-the-palestinians-were-expelled-from-israel-205151">Nakba</a>. The Sunbird jumps across time (1948 and 2023) and space (Palestine and Australia) to capture Nabila's ongoing displacement and her relentless desire to go home.</p>

<p>Jonathan Haidt's <a href="https://theconversation.com/have-smartphones-created-an-anxious-generation-jonathan-haidt-sounds-the-alarm-227344">The Anxious Generation</a> (Allen Lane) makes two key claims. First, the kids are not alright: compared to earlier generations, Gen Z has almost twice the chance of serious mental health disorders and related episodes. Second, a major cause is the smartphone. Problems arise not only from what happens on smartphones, but what doesn't happen. Children need unsupervised play, physical risk-taking and relationships with actual peers. Haidt recommends social media be banned for those under 16, but he also urges parents to recognise that social media is not the only source of teenage mental health concerns.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.penguin.co.in/book/the-distaste-of-the-earth/">The Distaste of the Earth</a> (Penguin India), Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih, author of <a href="https://newsouthbooks.com.au/books/funeral-nights/">Funeral Nights</a> (2021), continues his fabulist storytelling about mythic archetypes, against the backdrop of his beloved Khasi Hills rainforests. Subverting the tragic star-crossed lovers folktale of Manik Raitong the Wretched and Khasi Queen Liang Makaw, Nongkynrih extends oral storytelling traditions to create an utterly irreverential narrative. Part poetry, part philosophy and part critique, this is a fascinating glimpse into a world weary of humankind and wise in its Aesop-like vision of our contemporary moment.</p>

<p>I don't usually pick up memoirs by those who know they're about to die – they're unbearably sad. But Alexei Navalny's <a href="https://theconversation.com/even-the-worst-possible-scenario-is-not-actually-all-that-bad-alexei-navalnys-memoir-is-a-testament-to-resisting-authoritarianism-242294">Patriot</a> (Bodley Head) is a darkly comedic exception. Surviving a Federal Security Service (FSB) assassination attempt, Navalny returned to Russia to defy Vladimir Putin, knowing the Kremlin wouldn't let him go. They didn't. Written from prison, Patriot immortalises his unshakeable hope for a “beautiful Russia”. With sharp wit and boundless courage, Navalny's story transcends borders, reminding us of the enduring power of resistance. His voice and vision live on.</p>

<p>My discovery of 2024 was <a href="https://uipress.uiowa.edu/books/children-tactical-gear">Children in Tactical Gear</a> (University of Iowa Press) by Peter Mishler, winner of the Iowa Poetry Prize. It's a technicolour nightmare of whiteboards and bullets, plastic and product placement. Mainly free verse, there are moments of fixed rhyme and metre – which I usually hate. But I love this: “he stands with me, / barefoot, in a whirlpool / of trash, my dark hair collecting / ballistic ash.” The collection is a bleak, pitiless vision of corporate, consumerist America. It would make a perfect Christmas gift.</p>

<p>One favourite pick for 2024 is Anita Heiss' <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/books/Dirrayawadha/Anita-Heiss/9781761105272">Dirrayawadha</a> (Simon &amp; Schuster Australia), a groundbreaking Wiradyuri nation historical novel set at the time of Wiradyuri–colonial contact in rural New South Wales. This book is a reminder to Australia of the truth-telling needed to wipe away the historical colonial amnesia narratives curated to make Aboriginal people invisible – <em>nullius</em>. This book invites deep listening to a Wiradyuri and Australian story, carrying forward resilience, memory and Country.</p>

<p>Eighty-five years after his death, is there anything left to say about Freud? Andrew Blauner's fine collection <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691242439/on-the-couch">On the Couch: Writers Analyse Sigmund Freud</a> (Princeton University Press) answers an emphatic yes. A dream-team of leading writers consider subjects ranging from Freud's first scientific paper (on eel testicles) to the shadowy figure of his wife Martha, and his love of dogs. The book offers lucid, deeply personal reflections on the complicated legacies of psychoanalysis. Is it a failed system, a model of radical doubt, or a humanising corrective to a culture of shallowness and artificiality?</p>

<p>Elfriede Jelinek's <a href="https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300142150/the-children-of-the-dead/">The Children of the Dead</a> (Yale University Press), originally published in 1995, is now available in English for the first time, in a masterful translation by Gitta Honegger. It's a haunting exploration of Austria's Nazi past and its failure to confront the Holocaust. Hypnotic and unsettling, Jelinek's darkly satirical novel yokes avant-gardism and popular culture together, offering an unflinching reckoning with history. With antisemitism and the far-right on the rise in Europe, it feels more urgent and relevant than ever.</p>

<p>The book I most enjoyed this year was Brian Castro's <a href="https://theconversation.com/vanitas-and-the-life-of-the-author-in-chinese-postman-brian-castro-transforms-fiction-into-a-mechanism-of-truth-240691">Chinese Postman</a> (Giramondo). An elliptical meditation on the indignity of ageing and the inevitability of death might not be everyone's recipe for a relaxing summer read. Yet Abe Quin, Castro's alter ego, has a downbeat charm, with his limpid turns of phrase, self-deprecation and seething hatred of hypocrisy. In Castro's work, there is a bleakness teetering on the edge of farce and a pathos bubbling through quotidian reverie, but the situations bounce back on the springs of his irony. Then the humour drops away and we meet a man reflecting on his life with astonishing candour.</p>

Grant writes with such deep reverence and reflection around ideas of time, spirituality, history, philosophy and physics. The sections on Grant's father, Wiradjuri leader Uncle Stan Grant Sr, are the book's true heart, making me reflect on my own relationship with my parents with deeper understanding. Grant's book is about building a bridge of love: with parents, with community, even with those who espouse racist ideologies.</p>

<p>Anthologies are so diverse, a reader's enthusiasm often wanes at certain points. But <a href="https://magabala.com.au/products/woven">Woven</a>, edited by Anne-Marie Te Whiu (Magabala Books), is a breathtaking exception. This collection of 15 collaborations between First Nations poets from Australia and overseas is consistently compelling and formally ingenious, with lyrical, political punch. Joy Harjo with Ali Cobby Eckermann, Tony Birch with Simon J. Ortiz, and Raelee Lancaster with essa may ranapiri are standouts. But all the conversations in the book brilliantly enhance solidarities, while allowing differences to cohabit with care.</p>

<p>I first read Alice Driver's reporting on slaughterhouse workers in the US South in the New York Review of Books in 2021. <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Life-and-Death-of-the-American-Worker/Alice-Driver/9781668078822">Life and Death of the American Worker</a> (Atria/One Signal Publishers) is the book-length investigation I've waited for since. From Arkansas, but reporting for years from Mexico and Central America, Driver was uniquely equipped to get to know the Spanish-speaking workers who prop up the US meat industry. When Covid hit, she was immersed in this world. She offers incredible insights into the expendable lives powering an “essential” industry.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/tell-me-everything-9780241634356">Tell Me Everything</a> (Viking), Elizabeth Strout demonstrates why she is one of the best living writers in the Anglophone world. It's hard to summarise the plot – there is some narrative tension about a court case, a hard death and a love story – but these are not the point of the book. If there is a point, it is that there is a multitude of conflicting stories within us – and all of them shape us, whether we know it or not.</p>

<p>Stanley Tucci's <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/what-i-ate-in-one-year-9780241683132">What I Ate in One Year</a> (Fig Tree) is exactly what we all need in these strange times. While Tucci's prose immediately piques your curiosity about Italian cooking, it dives much deeper than just food. My favourite parts are the unexpected moments of profound humanity as he reflects on the value of family, friendships, mortality and the downsides of being famous. Tucci's year is exposed in this engrossing, humorous, heartwarming book. A delicious memoir of gastronomy, love, loss, death and pasta. Oh yes, and more pasta!</p>

<p>I loved Michelle de Kretser's <a href="https://theconversation.com/michelle-de-kretser-writes-back-to-the-woolfmother-in-theory-and-practice-239295">Theory &amp; Practice</a> (Text Publishing) for its formal experimentation and for its post-critique flavour. How does de Kretser do both those things and write such a page turner? It's a disturbing read and a thoughtful one. Disturbing because distrust, betrayal and other familiar exclusionary tactics reproduce themselves in the world of the narrator. Thoughtful because de Kretser urges us to look at the relationship between theory and practice with clear-sightedness and care.</p>

<p>The most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/13/ceos-at-australia-biggest-companies-earn-55-times-more-than-typical-worker-report-finds">recent data shows</a> CEOs of Australia's top listed companies take home 55 times average adult earnings. Yet such inequalities rarely feature in public policy. The focus is on tackling disadvantage and increasing opportunity, without addressing entrenched privilege and unequal outcomes. Poverty is a politically safe topic, argues Ingrid Robeyns. Inequality raises uncomfortable questions about societal structures, political choices and power differences. In a democratic society, we should argue about how much inequality is (un)reasonable. <a href="https://theconversation.com/everybody-has-not-won-trickle-down-economics-was-an-idiotic-idea-how-do-we-fix-the-inequality-it-causes-223296">Limitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth</a> (Allen Lane) can help that conversation.</p>

<p>We have been told authors die in the act of writing. What strikes me about Salman Rushdie's memoir, <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-knife-his-memoir-of-surviving-attack-salman-rushdie-confronts-a-world-where-liberal-principles-like-free-speech-are-old-fashioned-227892">Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder</a> (Jonathan Cape), is his engagement with death in its very materiality, its corporeality, as he describes what it is like to be confronted, after the fatwa, with a second death. Written without sentimentality or accusation, this is an extraordinary account that makes us think of death not as a theoretical premise that informs the act of writing, but a living reality for an author who dared to challenge age-old assumptions.</p>

<p>This year, the Booker judges overlooked a piercing reflection on racial identity in favour of a novel set on a space station. While we may like to believe the existential threat of climate change will ultimately overturn racial politics, Percival Everett's <a href="https://theconversation.com/james-by-percival-everett-an-enthralling-reimagining-of-huckleberry-finn-from-the-perspective-of-formerly-enslaved-jim-228940">James</a> (Mantle) forces us to consider the ethics of embracing such a post-racial fantasy. Everett's reimagining of Mark Twain's classic Huckleberry Finn imbues the runaway slave Jim with ingenuity, agency and gravitas. His scintillating prose elicits a long overdue reckoning with the literary canon.</p>

<p>Alan Hollinghurst's <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781035038534/">Our Evenings</a> (Picador) follows Dave Win from his youth in 1960s England through to the era of Brexit turmoil and pandemics. While the history is sweeping, the novel focuses on significant yet understated moments, particularly those that reflect on Dave's close relationship with his resilient mother and his entanglement with a wealthy family encountered while a scholarship student at boarding school. Hollinghurst's preoccupations are on display: class, sexuality, race and power, generational shifts, legacies and memories. Dave is an excellent lens for exploring these concerns and perhaps Hollinghurst's most engaging protagonist to date.</p>

<p>My pick is British historian William Dalrymple's <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/au/golden-road-9781408864418/">The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World</a> (Bloomsbury). After hearing him speak about this book in Melbourne a few weeks ago, I purchased and devoured it. It is, in written form, a reflection of Dalrymple's erudition and passion: a vastly and methodically researched resetting of cultural truths that puts India at the centre of South-East Asian culture and religion, and positions India's Golden Road as every bit as important as the Silk Road.</p>

<p>Byung-Chul Han's <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-a-time-of-information-overload-enigmatic-philosopher-byung-chul-han-seeks-the-re-enchantment-of-the-world-225176">The Crisis of Narration</a> (Polity) is an indictment of the loss of community and identity in a world drowning in information and all-too-easy clickbait answers. Narrative, in Han's words, no longer “anchors us in being”. Storytelling has been reduced to political pitches and advertisements. We are left with “storyselling” where dissemination and manipulation lock us into the moment like a just-swiped selfie. Is all hope gone? It would be hard to describe Han's book as positive. But The Crisis of Narration offers a provocative, novel and insightful way to reconsider politics and community in the age of information.</p>

<p>Observing wildlife and communing with nature brings immense joy to my life. Bill Bailey – extraordinarily talented multi-instrumentalist, actor and quirky comedian – is also known for his adoration of animals. So, it's unsurprising I was instantly drawn to <a href="https://www.hachette.com.au/bill-bailey/my-animals-and-other-animals-a-memoir-of-sorts">My Animals and Other Animals: A Memoir of Sorts</a> (Quercus). A quick skim of the contents hooked me. With stories like Radioactive Sea Lice, Hissing Cockroaches and The Chicken that Went Bad, I simply had to read on. Complete with gorgeous drawings, it's the delightful, heartwarming romp you'd expect.</p>

<p>Future historians will puzzle about how, in 2024, a twice-impeached convicted felon facing indictment for his role in insurrectionary violence was returned to office by popular vote. John Ganz's <a href="https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9780374605445/">When the Clock Broke</a> (Farrar Straus Giroux) will be a work of reference, as it is for anyone today trying to understand “how America cracked up”. Ganz's scope is sweeping, his prose incisive. He shows that Trump did not come from nowhere. MAGAism is the product of over three decades of radicalisation on the right. Ganz does not preach; he simply reports, leaving readers to draw the links between then and now.</p>

With unpredictable and destablising movement, Le masters language, its form and its register, only to break it, demonstrating the power of language to erase identity on one hand and resist erasure on the other.</p>

This beautifully written book reminds us that Trump is both symptom and cause, both new and old. The Forever War meticulously makes sense of the unresolved contradictions of American history, unpicking tired mythology to clearly argue that Trump – and his support – is the product of that inescapable history.</p>

<p>Ying Qian's <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/revolutionary-becomings/9780231555555">Revolutionary Becomings</a> (Columbia University Press) is a fascinating study of how Chinese documentary cinema shaped the revolutionary politics of the 20th century. It traces the emergence of early documentaries about colonial war and transnational revolutionary networks. The author analyses how documentary impacted political and social change during the Mao and post-Mao periods. She is deeply empathetic to revolutionaries' aspirations and actions, but insists on learning hard lessons from China's revolutionary past. It promises to be rewarding reading, likely to stimulate scholars, documentary-makers and cinema lovers alike.</p>

<p>Dominique Hecq's <a href="https://liquidamberpress.com.au/product/volte-face/">Volte Face</a> (Liquid Amber Press) is an exquisite collection of prose poems: poems written in sentences and paragraphs rather than lines, while obeying the grammar of poetry rather than prose. The book is crammed with luscious words and impossible juxtapositions that, articulated (by the poet) and contemplated (by the reader), seem entirely true. This work is a “fugue of language”, whose poems eschew reportage. Instead, they work through gestures of recognition, instances of spotting something unexpected from the corner of the eye.</p>

<p>The report featured the same image with the caption: "Israel gives 24 hours to evacuate Gaza residents. Photo: Ohad Zwigenberg/AP Photo/picture alliance."</p>

<p>The report stated that the Israeli military had issued a 24-hour evacuation notice to over 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza, instructing them to move to the southern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>We also found the original image from the Associated Press (AP) archives.</p>

<p>The description provided by AP confirmed that the photo shows Israeli tanks heading toward the Gaza Strip border in southern Israel, not Damascus. The image was taken during heightened conflict along the Gaza border in October 2023.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan's fertility rate had reached a record low in June after witnessing a fall for many years, even though the government has made an effort for young people to get married and start families.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Karoshi" is a Japanese term that refers to occupational stress, disability, or even death because of work - something that is now resulting in low birth rates for the country.</p>

<p>Starting next year, in April, Japan will function on a four-day work week. The reason kills two birds with one stone - it improves work-life balance while also addressing declining birth rates.</p>

<p>Apart from this, a separate policy will allow parents of elementary school children to reduce their work hours in accordance with proportionate salary cuts.</p>

<p>Japan's fertility rate had reached a record low in June after witnessing a fall for many years, even though the government has made an effort for young people to get married and start families.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recorded that only 727,277 babies were born last year with the fertility rate dropping to 1.2. In order for the population to remain stable, a fertility rate of 2.1 would be needed. This concerning decline is expected to cause a reduction in population from 128 million in 2008 to an estimated 86.7 million by 2060.</p>

<p>"We will review work styles ... with flexibility, ensuring no one has to give up their career due to life events such as childbirth or childcare. Now is the time for Tokyo to take the initiative to protect and enhance the lives, livelihoods, and economy of our people during these challenging times for the nation", said Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, in a policy address on Wednesday.</p>

<p>According to sociologists, Japan's work culture and cost of living are the major reasons for the plunging birth rates.</p>

<p>As per a World Bank report, there is a huge gender gap in the country's labour force participation with women standing at 55% and men at 72%. Women especially have to choose between career and personal life.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that a four-day workweek improves well-being and productivity. This shift has also sparked interest in the West. 4 Day Week Global, a nonprofit organisation has conducted global trials and reported positive results.</p>

<p>However, Tokyo is not the only Asian country implementing policies for an increase in birth rate. Singapore has also introduced new guidelines for a flexible work environment. South Korea has also been battling with low birthrates and a deep gender divide. South Korean women had also pledged to the 4B movement, or "four nos". It rejects dating men, getting married to men, having sex with men or having children with men.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chatter muffled as members of a secret society, masked and garbed in honey-coloured robes, entered the court of Foumban, the historic capital of a centuries-old kingdom nestled in hilly northwestern Cameroon.</p>

<p>The 20th king of the Bamoun people, Mouhammad Nabil Mfourifoum Mbombo Njoya, stood up from his ornate throne -- a replica of the original, now at a German museum -- for the ancient ritual to get under way.</p>

<p>The nearly 600-year-old tradition sees him put on public trial over his governance -- with local chiefs reading out indictments destined to put his popularity to the test.</p>

<p>The tradition is part of a set of rituals taking place over a week in a bid to promote dialogue, harmony and peace.</p>

<p>The ceremony is a first for Mbombo Njoya, 31, who took over the throne after his father died in 2021.</p>

<p>If deemed to have failed, the monarch could be fined or removed from office. But if he succeeds, he is granted a new mandate and allegiance.</p>

<p>Tourists and officials last week flocked to the remote, grassy region of the West African country to attend Nguon, a set of royal rituals that date back to 1384, when the kingdom was founded.</p>

<p>The rites, which are followed by celebrations, had not taken place in six years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and other factors, but were recognised in December 2023 by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The Bamoun territory, which is home to the ethnic group of the same name, is one of the oldest traditional kingdoms in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2><strong>GRIEVANCES</strong></h2>

<p>Constituents of the brotherhood shrouded in secrecy planted their spears into the ground as the young ruler braced for his people's opinions and grievances.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, the people are very preoccupied with the dilapidation of the kingdom's property assets," a Bamoun lawmaker told his monarch before the attentive crowd.</p>

<p>"So far there is only one queen by the king's side in the court," said another parliamentary, as laughter and clapping broke out.</p>

<p>But the king survived the session and earned the approval of his people.</p>

<p>Warriors and members of the royal guard fired their rifles into the air in celebration.</p>

<h2><strong>ROLE REVERSAL</strong></h2>

<p>"I really enjoyed how there is this role reversal and he is judged by his people. I thought it was just going to be a pretend judgment but the judgment was really severe, I was surprised," said Roly Allen, a 46-year-old businessman who travelled from London to attend.</p>

<p>"There was a lot of good humour and I thought it really demonstrates a real love between the kingdom and the king," said the British tourist, proudly boasting a traditional Bamoun headdress.</p>

<p>For some locals, the ritual is an important occasion to connect with their culture.</p>

<p>"I am very proud to be Bamoun, these are moments that allow us to learn about our culture and pass it on to our children," said Amadou Njoya, a 21-year-old native of Foumban.</p>

<p>Cameroon's 270 ethnic groups, with various customs and languages, are organised into more than 80 kingdoms and sultanates.</p>

<p>The importance of customary law and the sense of belonging to these chiefdoms have withstood the test of time and remain key parts of the lives of many of Cameroon's 28 million people.</p>

<p>"The first Nguon of the 20th king was an event not to be missed," said Mariam Poughouo, a Bamoun company manager based in France.</p>

<p>Poughouo, who is passionate about tradition, described the king as "a great fighter who fights for the preservation of culture".</p>

<p>Yet the chiefdom is still missing its original throne, said Hamidou Ntieche, an elderly village chief in Bamoun territory.</p>

<h2><strong>'LOBBYING' FOR THRONE</strong></h2>

<p>Like many African cultural antiques, the treasured artefact was taken to Europe under unclear circumstances during the colonisation of Cameroon.</p>

<p>The colourful, pearl-inlaid wooden chair is now exhibited at the Humboldt Forum Museum in Berlin, after its transfer during the Germany colonial period in Cameroon.</p>

<p>The monarch visited it last year -- and sat on the heirloom that once belonged to his great-grandfather.</p>

<p>But the Bamoun people are attempting to recover the original, Azize Mbouho, the Bamoun palace's communications advisor, told AFP.</p>

<p>In April, the royal family inaugurated the spacious Museum of the Bamoun Kings, a building shaped like its imposing coat of arms -- a two-headed snake and a furry spider -- and designed to house thousands of objects spotlighting its rich heritage.</p>

<p>Alexis Njivah Mouliom, general secretary of the Nguon foundation, hopes that becoming UNESCO-listed can bring "publicity" to the Bamoun community and "strengthen lobbying for the return of the throne".<br />

       <description><![CDATA[UK hereditary lawmaker Richard Fletcher-Vane, better known as Lord Inglewood, will soon no longer commute the few hundred miles from his country house in northwest England to the House of Lords in London -- and he is not happy about it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK hereditary lawmaker Richard Fletcher-Vane, better known as Lord Inglewood, will soon no longer commute the few hundred miles from his country house in northwest England to the House of Lords in London -- and he is not happy about it.</p>

<p>"Anybody who's sacked doesn't like it, particularly if you think you're being sacked for what per se is a bad reason," he told AFP at Hutton-in-the-Forest, his vast home dating back to 1350 near Penrith, Cumbria, 300 miles (480 kilometres) from Britain's capital.</p>

<p>The Labour government elected earlier this year is axing the 92 seats reserved for peers who inherited their position as a member of an aristocratic family, as the centre-left party moves to reform parliament's unelected upper chamber.</p>

<p>Britain is an anomaly among Western governments in having such lawmakers, who hold titles such as duke, earl, viscount and baron.</p>

<p>Lesotho in southern Africa is the only other country in the world with a hereditary element in its legislature, according to the UK government.</p>

<p>It is "out of step with modern Britain," government minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said in September as he introduced the legislation that will scrap the Lords' bloodline members.</p>

<p>The proposals were quickly approved by the House of Commons lower chamber and will be debated in the Lords on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Fletcher-Vane, who travels by train to the Lords most weeks, took his seat in 1989 after he became 2nd Baron Inglewood on the death of his father.</p>

<p>He served as a junior minister for the Conservatives in the mid-1990s and is a former member of the European Parliament.</p>

<p>The 73-year-old now sits as an independent cross-bencher.</p>

<p>At Hutton-in-the-Forest, where 500-year-old tapestries adorn the walls, Fletcher-Vane acknowledged that peerages by birthright are anachronistic in today's world.</p>

<p>But he also defended the contribution of many hereditary peers, some of whose titles have been in their family for centuries.</p>

<h2><strong>'I'VE HAD AN ORDINARY LIFE'</strong></h2>

<p>"I've always tried to take it seriously," Fletcher-Vane said, claiming to be "a voice" for the north of England.</p>

<p>The Lords, whose primary role is to scrutinise government legislation, comprises around 800 members, most of whom are appointed for life by outgoing prime ministers, sometimes as a less-than-subtle reward for political loyalty.</p>

<p>Members include former MPs, people nominated after serving in prominent public- or private-sector roles and senior Church of England clerics.</p>

<p>John Attlee, the 2nd Earl Attlee and grandson of former Labour prime minister Clement Attlee, is another hereditary peer preparing to hand back the red ermine-clad robes adorned by lords.</p>

<p>He entered the chamber in 1992 after a career in road transport operations and as a member of the British Army's volunteer reserve force.</p>

<p>"Because I've had an ordinary life, I have experience and knowledge that others, or very few others have in parliament," the 68-year-old told AFP over coffee in the Lords' guest room.</p>

<h2><strong>'LIFE BEYOND' THE LORDS</strong></h2>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's party, which in July returned to power for the first time in 14 years, is resurrecting reforms begun under Tony Blair's Labour government in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Blair had intended to abolish all the seats held by hundreds of hereditary members who sat in the chamber at that time. But he ended up retaining 92 in what was supposed to be a temporary compromise.</p>

<p>"Reform of the House of Lords has been on the political agenda on and off to some extent for well over a century," Daniel Gover, a constitutional expert at Queen Mary University of London, told AFP.</p>

<p>That led hereditary peers to feel for decades that they were on borrowed time.</p>

<p>"I always expected that the system would have been changed before my turn came," Attlee said.</p>

<p>But reform has proven to be a thorny issue for successive administrations, in part because officials have struggled to propose better alternatives.</p>

<p>The government says it wants to ultimately replace the Lords with an alternative second chamber more representative of the UK.</p>

<p>But campaign groups such as the Electoral Reform Society want much wider reforms.</p>

<p>It notes that the Lords is "the second-largest legislative chamber in the world after China's National People's Congress", and calls for a "smaller, elected house" to work alongside the elected Commons.</p>

<p>Some peers are criticised for rarely turning up. Those who do are eligible to claim a daily allowance of up to 361 pounds ($460) plus travel expenses.</p>

<p>Fletcher-Vane said he thinks scrapping hereditary peers is a "crude" reform when he believes he contributes more than many life peers.</p>

<p>He said his last day, likely next year, will be a "sad" one, but not completely unfamiliar since he previously lost a European Parliament seat.</p>

<p>"I've been through it all before and there's life beyond it," he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A Bangladesh court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Hindu priest and spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote, who has been arrested and jailed by the local authorities on charges of sedition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladesh court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Hindu priest and spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), who has been arrested and jailed by the local authorities on charges of sedition.</p>

<p>Local media reported that Chittagong Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md. Saiful Islam, who is on vacation, passed the order on Wednesday citing that the plea was rejected because Das did not have a lawyer's letter of attorney on his behalf.</p>

<p>The petition, which will be heard on January 2 next year now, states that Das - a monk who is suffering from various diseases including diabetes and respiratory problems - has been arrested in a false and fabricated case.</p>

<p>It also mentions that his lawyer Subhashish Sharma could not attend the hearing on December 3 due to security reasons.</p>

<p>"Chittagong Metropolitan Sessions Judge Court Public Prosecutor PP Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan said that the state party informed the court that lawyer Rabindra Ghosh, who had applied for Chinmoy's anticipatory bail hearing, had not given any power of attorney to fight the case on his behalf. Apart from this, Chinmoy's lawyer Subhashish Sharma was also not present. Subhashish did not give anything in writing to Rabindra Ghosh to fight the case. Later, the court rejected the application made by lawyer Rabindra Ghosh," reported the country's leading Bengali daily Prothom Alo.</p>

<p>It was revealed that the bail hearing of two other accused in the case was also scheduled for Wednesday but could not take place due to the lawyer's absence.</p>

<p>India has been reiterating that it hopes that the trial will be "fair and transparent" as the arrested Hindus have legal rights that should be respected.</p>

<p>New Delhi has also urged the interim government's authorities in Dhaka to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all minorities, including their right of freedom of peaceful assembly and expression while highlighting that the arrest of Das follows multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"The interim government must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities. We are concerned at the surge of extremist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation. These developments cannot be dismissed only as media exaggerations. We once again call upon Bangladesh to take all steps for the protection of minorities," Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last month.</p>

<p>On Monday, during his visit to Dhaka, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had conveyed India's concerns, especially those related to the safety and welfare of minorities, during his meetings with the Chief Advisor of the Interim Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus and the Foreign Affairs Advisor, Touhid Hossain.</p>

<p>"We also discussed some regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties. We expect, overall, a constructive approach on all these issues by the Bangladesh authorities, and we look forward to moving the relationship forward in a positive, forward-looking, and constructive direction," Misri told reporters in Dhaka on December 9 following his meeting with Hossain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine attacked Russian border regions with missiles and drones early Wednesday, sparking a fire at an oil depot and damaging an "industrial facility", officials said.</p>

<p>The two separate attacks targeted Russia's southern Rostov region and western Bryansk region, both of which have been hit by cross-border Ukrainian fire throughout Moscow's nearly three-year invasion.</p>

<p>Videos purportedly taken in the Bryansk region showed a distant fireball illuminating the night sky over an urban area, while air raid sirens could be heard in footage from the southern Rostov region.</p>

<p>Kyiv said it struck an oil depot being used to "supply the Russian occupation army" in the Bryansk region, while the governor of Russia's Rostov region said a Ukrainian missile attack damaged an "industrial enterprise" in the port city of Taganrog.</p>

<p>Kyiv has ramped up strikes on Russian oil and gas facilities this year, curbing Moscow's energy industry and causing billions of dollars' worth of damage.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian army said Russia was using the facility in Bryansk as a loading point for the Druzhba oil pipeline, a key supply route for Russian oil heading to much of central Europe.</p>

<p>"A massive fire broke out," Ukraine's general staff said in a statement.</p>

<p>It did not comment on the strike on the Rostov region.</p>

<p>The Russian governor of the Bryansk region, Alexander Bogomaz, said Ukraine had attacked a "production facility" with drones but that the blaze had since been extinguished.</p>

<p>Refineries and oil depots are a huge driving force behind Russia's economy, with some facilities being given their own air-defence systems to ward off attacks.</p>

<p>Major companies have redirected oil to sites further away from Ukraine, as some Ukrainian drone strikes have reached hundreds of kilometres into Russian territory.</p>

<p>Ukraine says its attacks are "fair" retaliation for Moscow's strikes on its own energy infrastructure that have cut power to millions of people.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was the result of a plan by the United States and Israel.</p>

<p>One of Syria's neighbours also had a role, he said. He did not name the country but appeared to be referring to Turkey, which has backed anti-Assad rebels.</p>

<p>Assad's overthrow is widely seen as a major blow to the Iran-led "Axis of Resistance" political and military alliance that opposes Israeli and U.S. influence in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"What happened in Syria was mainly planned in the command rooms of America and Israel. We have evidence of this. A neighbouring government of Syria was also involved," Khamenei said in a speech reported by Iranian state media.</p>

<p>The neighbour had a "clear role and continues to do so," he said.</p>

<p>NATO member Turkey, which controls swathes of land in northern Syria after several cross-border incursions against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, has been a main backer of opposition groups aiming to topple Assad since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011.</p>

<p>Iran spent billions of dollars propping up Assad during the war and deployed its Revolutionary Guards to Syria to keep its ally in power.</p>

<p>Hours after Assad's fall, Iran said it expected relations with Damascus to continue based on the two countries' "far-sighted and wise approach" and called for the establishment of an inclusive government representing all segments of Syrian society.</p>

<p>In his speech, Khamenei also said the Iran-led alliance would gain in strength across the entire region.</p>

<p>"The more pressure you exert, the stronger the resistance becomes. The more crimes you commit, the more determined it becomes. The more you fight against it, the more it expands Khamenei said.</p>

<p>"Iran is strong and powerful-and will become even stronger," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is more than a 50% chance of La Nina developing in the next three months, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said on Wednesday, but if it does it will be relatively weak and short-lived.</p>

<p>The La Nina pattern involves the cooling of ocean surface temperatures and could break a spell of high temperatures that are set to make 2024 the world's warmest since records began.</p>

<p>Forecasts show that there is a 55% likelihood of a transition to La Nina between December 2024 and February 2025, the WMO said in a statement sent to journalists. This was down from a forecast 60% possibility from the WMO in September.</p>

<p>"Even if a La Nina event does emerge, its short-term cooling impact will be insufficient to counterbalance the warming effect of record heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere," WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's arrest of almost 30 mostly Jewish citizens who allegedly spied for Iran in nine covert cells has caused alarm in the country and points to Tehran's biggest effort in decades to infiltrate its arch foe, four Israeli security sources said.</p>

<p>Among the unfulfilled goals of the alleged cells was the assassination of an Israeli nuclear scientist and former military officials, while one group gathered information on military bases and air defences, security service Shin Bet has said. Last week, the agency and Israel's police said a father and son team had passed on details of Israeli force movements including in the Golan Heights where they lived. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrests follow repeated efforts by Iranian intelligence operatives over the past two years to recruit ordinary Israelis to gather intelligence and carry out attacks in exchange for money, the four serving and former military and security officials said.</p>

<p>The sources asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.</p>

<p>"There is a large phenomenon here," said Shalom Ben Hanan, a former top Shin Bet official, referring to what he called the surprising number of Jewish citizens who knowingly agreed to work for Iran against the state with intelligence gathering or planning sabotage and attacks.</p>

<p>Shin Bet and the police did not respond to requests for comment. Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to questions.</p>

<p>In a statement sent to media after the wave of arrests, Iran's U.N. mission did not confirm or deny seeking to recruit Israelis and said that "from a logical standpoint" any such efforts by Iranian intelligence services would focus on non-Iranian and non-Muslim individuals to lessen suspicion.</p>

<p>At least two suspects were from Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, police and the Shin Bet have said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike Iranian espionage operations in previous decades that recruited a high-profile businessman and a former cabinet minister, the new alleged spies were largely people on the fringes of Israeli society, including recent immigrants, an army deserter and a convicted sex offender, conversations with the sources, court records and official statements show.</p>

<p>Much of their activity was limited to spraying anti-Netanyahu or anti-government graffiti on walls and damaging cars, Shin Bet has said.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the scale of the arrests and involvement of so many Jewish Israelis, in addition to Arab citizens, has caused concern in Israel at a time it remains at war with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza and that a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah remains fragile.</p>

<p>Shin Bet on Oct. 21 said the espionage activities were "among the most severe the state of Israel has known."</p>

<p>The arrests also follow a wave of attempted hits and kidnappings linked to Tehran in Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>The unusual decision to provide detailed public accounts of the alleged plots was a move by Israel's security services to signal both to Iran and potential saboteurs inside Israel that they would be caught, Ben Hanan said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"You want to alert the public. And you also want to make an example of people that may also have intentions or plans to co-operate with the enemy," he said.</p>

<p>Israel has achieved major intelligence successes over the past few years in a shadow war with its regional foe, including allegedly killing a top nuclear scientist. With the recent arrests Israel has "so far" thwarted Tehran's efforts to respond, one active military official said.</p>

<p>Iran has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the related fall of Tehran's ally, former president Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p>

<h2><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA RECRUITS</strong></h2>

<p>Iranian intelligence agencies often find potential recruits on social media platforms, Israeli police said in a video released in November warning of ongoing infiltration attempts.</p>

<p>The recruiting efforts are at times direct. One message sent to an Israeli civilian and seen by Reuters promised $15,000 in exchange for information, with an email and number to call.</p>

<p>Iran has also approached expatriate networks of Jews from Caucasus countries living in Canada and the United States, said one of the sources, a former senior official who worked on Israel's counter espionage efforts until 2007.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities have said publicly some of the Jewish suspects were originally from Caucasus countries.</p>

<p>Recruited individuals are first assigned innocuous-seeming tasks in return for money, before handlers gradually demand specific intelligence on targets, including about individuals and sensitive military infrastructure, backed by the threat of blackmail, said the former official.</p>

<p>One Israeli suspect, Vladislav Victorsson, 30, was arrested on Oct. 14 along with his 18-year-old girlfriend in the Israeli city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv. He had been jailed in 2015 for sex with minors as young as 14, according to a court indictment from that time.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of Victorsson told Reuters he had told her he had spoken to Iranians using the Telegram messaging app. She said that Victorsson had lied to his handlers about his military experience. The acquaintance declined to be named, citing safety fears.</p>

<p>Igal Dotan, Victorsson's lawyer, told Reuters he was representing the suspect, adding that the legal process would take time and that his client was being held in tough conditions. Dotan said he could only respond to the current case and had not defended Victorsson in earlier trials.</p>

<p>Shin Bet and police said Victorsson knew he was working for Iranian intelligence, carrying out tasks including spraying graffiti, hiding money, posting flyers and burning cars in the Hayarkon Park in Tel Aviv for which he received over $5,000.</p>

<p>According to the investigation made public by the security services, he was found to have subsequently agreed to carry out an assassination of an Israeli personality, throw a grenade into a house and also look to obtain a sniper rifle, pistols and fragmentation grenades.</p>

<p>He recruited his girlfriend, who was tasked with recruiting homeless people to photograph demonstrations, the security services said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Analyzing data from over 1,500 participants aged 13 to 77, researchers found that individuals with a positive outlook are more driven and determined to achieve their goals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two professors from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) conducted a study that looked at the characteristics that enable people to succeed in their ambitions. According to their research, people who have more willpower frequently have one crucial characteristic in common: a "growth mindset."</p>

<p>The large-scale study found that this mindset-which is defined as the belief in personal progress and improvement-is associated with higher levels of enthusiasm, determination, and success.</p>

<p>The research included over 1,500 participants aged 13 to 77, with an average age of 26. They completed questionnaires measuring traits such as grit, passion, and mindset. The data revealed that individuals with a positive outlook not only had more willpower but were also more driven to achieve their goals.A new article about the test has been published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X24000394"><em>New Ideas in Psychology.</em></a></p>

<p>The findings highlight the importance of fostering a belief in growth to unlock one's potential. Adopting a growth mindset could be the key to developing resilience and passion in various areas of life.</p>

<p>"An individual's belief in growth is important. Individuals can change and increase their development through training. People with growth mindsets see challenges as opportunities for learning," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1062439">said Professor Hermundur Sigmundsson</a> at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We find large differences in passion and determination when we compare the five percent who have the most positive attitude with the five percent who are the most negative," Sigmundsson said.</p>

<p>"Our results can help us better understand the connections between different factors. These are in turn related to how satisfied people are with their lives, how they feel, what they have already achieved, and learning," Sigmundsson said.</p>

<p>When we know more about what characterises people with different attitudes, we can also better understand how we can motivate different groups. We can thus get people to set long-term goals and make an effort to achieve these goals. This is what Sigmundsson calls "getting the I CAN feeling.".</p>

<p>"The belief in growth is important for large parts of our society. This is true for school, sports, work, and family life," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Olympic rings will remain on the Eiffel Tower until at least 2028, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced. The rings were mounted ahead of the Paris Olympics and became a popular tourist attraction. However, the mayor's decision to keep them as is has received opposition from lawmakers, residents, and conservation groups, who argue that the symbol of the International Olympic Committee does not belong to a protected historical landmark like the Eiffel Tower. Her rivals accuse her of political opportunism ahead of the 2026 mayoral election.</p>

<p>"The proposal that I have made for the rings... is a proposal that until 2028, until the Games in Los Angeles, we will leave the rings on the Eiffel Tower," she said at a press conference.</p>

<p>The Eiffel Tower was a central backdrop for several Olympic events, including the opening ceremony and beach volleyball. However the temporary structures built for the Games are supposed to be dismantled, and the city is expected to return to its original state.</p>

<p>Mayor Hidalgo claimed she wanted to preserve the "festive spirit" of the successful Games, but her opponents see it as an attempt to leave her mark on the iconic monument. David Alphand, a right-wing city councillor and ally of Ms Hidalgo's rival Rachida Dati, accused the mayor of trying to "recuperate the positive spin-offs" of the Olympics for her political gain.</p>

<p>Ms Hidalgo's camp has dismissed criticism as typical Parisian resistance to change, citing the initial opposition to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre's pyramids. However, descendants of Gustave Eiffel (who designed the Eiffel Tower), including Olivier Berthelot-Eiffel, argue that the rings disrupt the tower's design and disrespect their ancestor's work.</p>

<p>"The rings completely break the design of the monument... it does not respect the work of our ancestor," Mr Berthelot-Eiffel, chairing an association of Eiffel's descendants, told <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eiffel-tower-olympic-rings-paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-french-politics/ ">Politico</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While decorating the tower is not unprecedented, this is the first time the Eiffel family has publicly opposed plans related to the monument. Meanwhile, the Mayor claimed the decision was hers to make, as the tower was owned by the city of Paris. But rivals like Rachida Dati and heritage groups argue that modifications require careful consideration and approval.</p>

<p>"The Eiffel Tower is a protected monument that can only be modified under certain conditions and after an impact assessment," Ms Dati noted.</p>

<p>Julien Lacaze, president of the association "Sites &amp; Monuments," France's oldest heritage defence association, slammed Ms Hidalgo's proposal as a way to promote herself, latching onto the Eiffel Tower like a "parasite" to "take advantage of its fame... to say these are my Games."</p>

<p>The current 30-ton steel rings will have to come down as they are too heavy to remain there permanently. The Mayor said the city planned to replace them with new, lighter ones.</p>

<p>The controversy comes as Ms Hidalgo prepares to face off against Rachida Dati in the 2026 mayoral election. Ms Dati is the outgoing culture minister and current mayor of the arrondissement where the Eiffel Tower is located.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are due to meet for the first time in front of a prime-time television audience of millions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to hostile exchanges between prosecutor and felon, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are old hands. But Tuesday's high-stakes debate will be new territory for the Democratic vice president and her Republican rival, due to meet for the first time in front of a prime-time television audience of millions.</p>

<p>"The striking thing about this debate is, it's the first time in history where we'll see a prosecutor and convicted felon facing off against each other," Andrew Koneschusky, a PR expert and former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That's an incredible contrast. I wouldn't expect a lot of intricate policy discussion. I expect we'll see more style than substance."</p>

<p><strong>ALSO READ |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-explained-the-rules-of-donald-trump-vs-kamala-harris-debate-6515920">Explained: The Rules Of Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris Debate</a></strong></p>

<p>Students of debating technique identify <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-kamala-harris-tied-in-latest-polls-ahead-of-televised-presidential-debate-6520668">Trump</a>, who is 78, as an avid proponent of the "Gish Gallop," named for Duane Gish.</p>

<p>Gish, who defended as literally true the Biblical account of the world's creation in six days, would overwhelm opponents with a dizzying torrent of rapid-fire falsehoods, distortions and distractions.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-donald-trump-sounds-dark-tone-at-rally-kamala-harris-says-ready-for-debate-6514936">Trump</a> -- who is not known to have a granular grasp of policy -- owes much of his success to this kind of filibustering, as he packs conspiracy theory, anecdote and aside into an arcane, rebuttal-proof word salad.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to debate someone who is quickly changing topics and not fully or truthfully answering the questions," said Flavio Hickel, a politics professor at Maryland liberal arts school Washington College.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But while the "Gish Gallop" may be good at putting opponents on the back foot, it is a risky strategy for someone trying to look presidential, analysts warn.</p>

<h3><strong>'Certainty and strength'</strong></h3>

<p>"As a debater, Trump brings energy, conveys certainty and strength, and never admits error, which translates for many people into presidential qualities," said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and professor at Binghamton University in New York state.</p>

<p>"Of course, they are likely to be coupled with transparent lies, wild exaggerations, unseemly ad hominem attacks and loopy digressions that have the opposite effect, especially on the few undecided voters."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-kamala-harris-campaign-gets-a-desi-touch-with-hindi-music-video-6522378">Harris</a> rose to the top of the Democratic ticket after 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dismal debate performance against Trump led to him dropping out of the race amid questions around his advanced years.</p>

<p>Analysts expect the 59-year-old Californian -- "Kamala the Cop" to her admirers -- to lean into her experience as a district attorney and press Trump on his role in the deadly 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, as well as his multiple criminal cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Harris is a sharp prosecutor," said Keith Gaddie, a politics professor at Texas Christian University.</p>

<p>"She showed her chops debating Biden and others in 2020, and will likely lean into a combination of tricks used by prosecutors to control witnesses, while also cultivating 'jury sympathy.'"</p>

<p>Since Harris's ascension, Democrats' messaging has evolved from presenting Trump as a powerful and existential threat to democracy to minimizing him as "weird" and small.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Koneschusky expects to see more of this in the debate, but warned that Harris faces a balancing act between going after her opponent and using her precious airtime to make her own pitch for the Oval Office.</p>

<h3><strong>Former prosecutor</strong></h3>

<p>"On the one hand, this is a chance for Harris to define herself, and she needs to fully capitalize on that opportunity," he said.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, it's also important that Harris prosecutes the case against Trump in this debate, and she's well-equipped to do so as a former prosecutor. This is something Biden failed to do in the last debate."</p>

<p>One of Harris's standout debate moments came against Biden, ironically, in the 2019-20 Democratic presidential nominating contest, when she took her then-rival to task for his opposition to using federal funds to desegregate schools through busing.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/weaponising-joy-how-kamala-harris-plans-to-beat-trump-at-his-own-game-6509981">Harris</a> said, in a moment that immediately went viral.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But her short-lived 2020 bid for the White House also illustrated weaknesses, as when she allowed herself to be rattled by former Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who savaged Harris over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard has switched sides and Trump has been using her in his debate prep.</p>

<p>The use of muted microphones during the Trump debate may meanwhile deprive Harris of another strength -- her ability to shut down rivals when they try to interrupt.</p>

<p>Harris deployed this to full effect when Mike Pence tried to cut her off during their 2020 vice-presidential debate and she stopped him dead with an ice-cold, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been trading near-daily cross-border fire, with the Lebanese group saying it is acting in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas in the ongoing war in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former war cabinet member Benny Gantz on Sunday said Israel should shift its focus toward Hezbollah and the Lebanese border, warning that "we are late on this." Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been trading near-daily cross-border fire, with the Lebanese group saying it is acting in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas in the ongoing war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We have enough forces to deal with Gaza and we should concentrate on what is going on in the north," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/leaving-with-heavy-heart-israel-war-cabinet-minister-benny-gantz-quits-over-gaza-plan-5855047">Benny Gantz</a> said, speaking in Washington at a Middle East forum where he also said Iran and its proxies were "the real issue."</p>

<p>"The time of the north has come and actually I think we are late on this," the former army chief and centrist politician added.</p>

<p>Gantz said Israel had made a mistake in evacuating much of the north of the country as hostilities with Hezbollah flared following the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"In Gaza, we have crossed a decisive point of the campaign," he said. "We can conduct anything we want in Gaza."</p>

<p>"We should seek to have a deal to get out our hostages but if we cannot in the coming time, a few days or few weeks, or whatever it is, we should go up north."</p>

<p>"We are capable of... hitting the state of Lebanon if needed," he said.</p>

<p>"The story of Hamas is old news," he added, saying instead that "the story of Iran and its proxies all around the area and what they are trying to do is the real issue."</p>

<p>Gantz left Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in June over its lack of a post-war plan for Gaza.</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, including some hostages killed in captivity, official Israeli figures show. They seized 251 hostages during the attack, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,972 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>The UN human rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also referred to the situation on the Lebanese border Sunday during a tour of the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, telling troops "we are preparing for anything that may happen in the north."</p>

<p>"The shift of the centre of gravity can happen quickly and can also involve you in a short period of time," Gallant said, according to a statement issued by his office.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With darkness making the search difficult, authorities deployed a thermal drone to scan the dense 6-foot-tall cornfield.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young boy who wandered into a vast cornfield at night was successfully rescued thanks to the use of thermal imaging technology. The incident occurred in Alto, Wisconsin, where deputies from the Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Office were alerted to the missing child around 8:45 p.m. on August 25th.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With darkness making the search difficult, authorities deployed a thermal drone to scan the dense 6-foot-tall cornfield. The drone's infrared camera revealed heat signatures, allowing rescuers to pinpoint the child's location within the vast expanse of stalks, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/06/us-news/drone-helps-rescue-3-year-old-boy-lost-in-dark-wisconsin-corn-field/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video begins with a drone surveying the vast expanse of a cornfield filled with 6-foot-tall stalks. In the thermal image, the rows of corn appear as a textured black-and-white pattern.</p>

<p>Around 9:30 p.m., a bright white shape suddenly moves through the corn, disrupting the uniform pattern on the screen-it's the missing toddler!</p>

<p>The footage then shows a Fond du Lac County deputy and personnel from the Alto Fire Department arriving on the scene. The rescuers, also appearing as white shapes in the thermal image, can be seen moving through the corn toward the child.</p>

<p>After approximately 15 minutes, they gather around the toddler. By detecting this heat signature, deputies were able to narrow their rescue efforts to a specific area of the cornfield.</p>

<p>The boy was safely brought out of the field and driven back to reunite with his parents.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="448" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=448&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffdlcosheriff%2Fvideos%2F520207617501682%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=560&amp;t=0" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>The thermal drone footage captured the dramatic rescue, showcasing the technology's invaluable role in such critical situations.</p>

<p>"This incident underscores the importance of technology and collaboration among law enforcement in our community," said the Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>"Without the thermal imaging drone, it likely would have taken deputies and other first responders hours to search the entire cornfield, and the outcome could have been different," the statement added.</p>

<p>The Sheriff's Office also noted that the boy was found about half a mile from his home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Indian-American community leader Ajay Bhutoria has released a Hindi campaign song titled "Nacho Nacho" for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Oscar-winning track "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/mm-keeravani-on-winning-oscar-for-naatu-naatu-global-recognition-came-for-a-song-thats-not-my-best-6076062" target="_blank">Naatu Naatu</a>" from the film "RRR", the song has been performed by Bollywood singer Shibani Kashyap and aims to mobilise South Asian voters for Indian-origin Kamala Harris in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>"'Nacho Nacho' isn't just a song, it's a movement. This campaign aims to connect with the diverse South Asian American community across battleground states and key districts. With over 4.4 million Indian Americans and 6 million South Asians eligible to vote, our goal is to help propel Vice President Kamala Harris to victory in 2024," Mr Bhutoria said.</p>

<p>"In 2020, we made history by electing the first woman of South Asian and African American descent as Vice President. Now, in 2024, it's time to make her our next President," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>What Polls Say On Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to polls released Sunday, two days before <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-kamala-harris-tied-in-latest-polls-ahead-of-televised-presidential-debate-6520668" target="_blank">Kamala Harris and Donald Trump</a> hold their first televised debate, the US presidential race remains neck-and-neck&nbsp;</p>

<p>A New York Times/Siena poll found that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-donald-trump-sounds-dark-tone-at-rally-kamala-harris-says-ready-for-debate-6514936" target="_blank">Trump</a>, 78, is leading Harris nationally by 48 to 47 percent. The poll found Harris narrowly ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania and tied in four other swing states -- Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona.</p>

<p>A CBS News/YouGov poll put Harris ahead by one percentage point in Michigan and Wisconsin and tied in Pennsylvania.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Influential pastor Apollo Quiboloy, the self-proclaimed "owner of the universe" and "appointed son of god" who was wanted on charges of child sex trafficking, was arrested in the Philippines on Sunday.</p>

<p>Over 2,000 police were deployed for more than two weeks to search a 74-acre compound in the southern city of Davao owned by his church - the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) - on suspicion that he was hiding there in a bunker.</p>

<p>Quiboloy's followers had blocked the gate of the compound to prevent shield-carrying police from enforcing a court order to arrest him. Police also used helicopters to circle over a cathedral, a college, and a stadium with 75,000 seats.</p>

<p>Days before Quiboloy's arrest, the police reportedly recorded the warmth and heartbeat of a human body, deep in the earth, using thermal imaging and radar technology.</p>

<h3><strong>Apollo Quiboloy Is Accused Of Sex Crimes</strong></h3>

<p>Apollo Quiboloy, a longtime friend of former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte, is wanted on charges of child and sexual abuse and related allegations of human trafficking. He also figures on the FBI's "most wanted" list on charges of sex trafficking.</p>

<p>Quiboloy was charged by the US Justice Department in 2021 with sex trafficking of girls and women between the ages of 12 and 25 to work as personal assistants, or "pastorals", who were allegedly required to have sex with him.</p>

<p>He is also sought by authorities for bulk cash smuggling and a scheme that brought church members to the United States using fraudulently obtained visas. They were then forced to solicit donations for a bogus charity, raising funds that were instead used to finance church operations and the lavish lifestyles of its leaders.</p>

<p>The evangelist preacher, who is followed by millions of people in the Philippines, has denied wrongdoing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India, the US and other countries in the West are facing the problem of unemployment while China isn't as it is dominating global production, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi said, underscoring the need to focus on manufacturing in India.</p>

<p>During an interaction with students at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-on-ai-during-interaction-in-texas-if-youre-positioned-properly-its-an-opportunit-6521837">University of Texas in Dallas</a> on Sunday, Mr Gandhi said there is no shortage of skills in India and the country could compete with China if it starts aligning itself for production.</p>

<p>He also stressed the need to encourage vocational training to bridge the gap between the business system and the education system and flagged the "ideological capture" of the latter.</p>

<p>Mr Gandhi is on a four-day unofficial trip to the US during which he will interact with the members of the Indian diaspora and youths with stops in Dallas, Texas and Washington DC. He also plans to meet lawmakers and senior officials of the US government during his visit to Washington DC beginning Monday.</p>

<p>He arrived in Dallas on Saturday night and was welcomed by dozens of members of the Indian-American community led by senior Congress leader Sam Pitroda and president of Indian National Overseas Congress, USA, Mohinder Gilzian.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bharat-jodo-yatra-introduced-the-idea-of-love-in-politics-rahul-gandhi-in-us-6521554"><strong>Read: "Bharat Jodo Yatra Introduced The Idea Of Love In Politics": Rahul Gandhi In US</strong></a></p>

<p>"The West has an employment problem. India has an employment problem... But many countries in the world don't have an employment problem. China certainly doesn't have an employment problem. Vietnam doesn't have an employment problem," Mr Gandhi said.</p>

<p>"If you look at the United States in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, they were the centre of global production. Anything that was made, (be it) cars, washing machines (or) TVs, all was made in the United States. Production moved from the United States. It went to Korea and it went to Japan. Eventually, it went to China. If you look today, China is dominating global production," he said.</p>

<p>The West, America, Europe and India have "given up on the idea of production" and they've handed it to China.</p>

<p>"The act of production creates jobs. What we do, what the Americans do, what the West does, is we organise consumption... India has to think about the act of production and organising production..."</p>

<p>"It's not acceptable that India simply says, okay, manufacturing, what you call manufacturing or production is going to be the preserve of the Chinese. It's going to be the preserve of the Vietnamese. It's going to be the preserve of Bangladesh," Mr Gandhi said.</p>

<p>He underlined the need to encourage manufacturing.</p>

<p>"Until we do that, we will face high levels of unemployment. And frankly, it's not sustainable. So, you're going to see that if we carry on down this path of forgetting about manufacturing, you're going to see massive social problems coming in India and in the United States and Europe. The polarisation of our politics is because of this..." he added.</p>

<p>According to the leader of opposition, there is no shortage of skills in India.</p>

<p>"Many people say that India has a problem with skills. I don't think India has a problem with skills. I think... India does not have respect for people who possess skills," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Gandhi said there is a need to link the education system with the business system through vocational training.</p>

<p>"Bridging that gap or linking these two systems, skills and education, through vocational training is fundamental. I think currently the huge problem with the education system is the ideological capture, where ideology is being fed through it...," he said.</p>

<p>He said he is convinced that India can take on China if it starts aligning itself for production and starts respecting skills.</p>

<p>"I'm absolutely convinced of it. States like Tamil Nadu have already shown it. It's not that Indian states have not done it. Pune has shown it. Maharashtra has shown it. So, it is being done but it's not being done at the scale and with the coordination that it needs to be done," Mr Gandhi said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Apple has a lot riding on what would be the iPhone 16 and will hope that customers will be enticed to buy the latest models, attracted by new AI powers.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is expected to release its latest line of iPhones on Monday that will feature generative AI capabilities as the tech behemoth looks to bolster sales of its iconic device. The company founded by Steve Jobs has disclosed little about what it plans to show off during a launch event, titled "Glowtime," at its headquarters in the Silicon Valley city of Cupertino.</p>

<p>It is the time of year, though, when Apple typically updates its iPhone lineup.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/ahead-of-apples-big-launch-first-indian-ad-for-apple-goes-viral-6516353">Apple</a> has a lot riding on what would be the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/news/iphone-16-series-a18-apple-arm-v9-chipset-financial-times-report-6513432">iPhone 16</a> and will hope that customers will be enticed to buy the latest models, attracted by new AI powers.</p>

<p>With $39 billion in sales last quarter, the iPhone counts for roughly 60 percent of Apple's revenue, and remains the main entryway to the company's services, such as the App Store or Apple TV, which are becoming a growing part of its business.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/all-about-iphone-16-series-set-to-launch-on-september-9-6489624">Apple</a> is only just coming out of a long sales slump as users increasingly stick with older models longer.</p>

<p>"The iPhone 16 will be one of the most significant iPhone introductions, not because of what's on the outside but because of what's inside -- namely, Apple Intelligence," said Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO READ | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tim-cook-explains-why-apple-manufactures-iphones-in-china-elon-musk-reacts-6510900">Tim Cook Explains Why Apple Manufactures iPhones In China. Elon Musk Reacts</a></strong><br />
<br />
"Apple Intelligence" is a new suite of software features for all devices that was announced in June at the company's annual developers conference, where it also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.</p>

<p>In the short-term, these include AI-infused image editing, translation, and small, creative touches in messaging, but not more ambitious breakthroughs promised by other AI players, such as OpenAI or Google.</p>

<h3><strong>'Super-powered Siri'</strong></h3>

<p>Apple also said its digital assistant Siri will get an AI upgrade and now will appear as a pulsating light on the edge of a home screen.</p>

<p>"Siri will be a big part of the conversation," Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi said of Monday's event.</p>

<p>Launched more than 12 years ago, Siri has come to be seen as a dated feature, overtaken by a new generation of assistants such as GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest offering.</p>

<p>Apple watchers predict Apple will introduce iPhone 16 models with custom chips that can power these AI features, including the Siri upgrade.</p>

<p>By adding AI capabilities, Apple is looking to "shake that expectation" that iPhone launches are &nbsp;"just steady improvements in hardware and software," &nbsp;said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart.</p>

<p>Longer term, Apple could dramatically change the iPhone experience with a "super-powered Siri" working across all the apps, Greengart said.</p>

<h3><strong>Pixel power</strong></h3>

<p>Apple's announcement closely follows Google, which last month unveiled AI-infused Pixel 9 smartphones, its challenge to the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pixels account for a tiny sliver of the global smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple, but Google argued its new line is a chance to answer what -- after all the hype -- AI can actually do for customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There have been so many promises, so many 'coming soons,' and not enough real world helpfulness when it comes to AI - which is why today we're getting real," Google senior vice president of devices Rick Osterloh said at the company's campus in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>Samsung has also showcased AI across a range of its consumer electronic products as it looks to extend its leadership in global smartphone sales.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-E-Insaf, was issued a warning by the local administration to adhere to the rally's NOC guidelines, which mandated them to vacate the venue by 7pm, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>In the Sangjani Rally on Sunday, the district magistrate issued several reminders to vacate the venue. But the rally exceeded the permit time, which made the police and the administration take action against them, as per ARY News report.</p>

<p>The participants arriving from a different route clashed with the police as the PTI workers threw stones, leading the police to respond with tear gas at Choongi No 26 area, ARY News stated.</p>

<p>A police spokesperson told ARY News that participants deviated from the designated rally route and attacked law enforcement. Several officers, including SSP Safe City Shoaib Khan, were injured in the incident as stone pelting continued.</p>

<p>Pakistan's interior Minister, Mohsin Naqvi, took notice of the situation and sought a report from Inspector General Islamabad and instructed to provide the best medical treatment of injured police officers. In a telephonic conversation with injured SSP Shoaib Khan, Mohsin Naqvi inquired about his health and emphasized the need for top-quality treatment for all injured officers involved in the incident.</p>

<p>PTI alleged that shots were fired at its members by the police during the rally in Islamabad on Sunday, which was being held demanding the release of party founder and incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf shared a video where they shared visuals from the rally and stated, "You can jail a man, but not his ideas," referring to PTI's incarcerated leader and founder Imran Khan.</p>

<p>The party's official account also shared pictures of protests at Pakistani Embassy in Norway demanding the release of Imran Khan.</p>

<p>The post stated, "Protest in front of the Pakistani Embassy in Oslo Norway to show solidarity with Imran Khan and his fight for justice and democracy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Monday that the Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a good opportunity if one is positioned properly.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, while interacting with the students at the University of Texas at Dallas, spoke about the fears that AI is going to take jobs away.</p>

<p>He said that every new technology takes away some jobs and generates new ones.</p>

<p>"Everytime you get a new technology, the argument is made that it's going to take jobs away. When computers first came [it was feared that] it's going to take jobs away. When calculators first came [it was feared that] it's going to take jobs away. ATMs came [it was feared that] it's going to take jobs away. What happens is- it does take jobs away from some people and then transfers them to other people. I'm not of the view that jobs will vanish, but different types of jobs will be created and different types of systems will benefit more or less," Mr Gandhi said.</p>

<p>Elaborating his view, the Congress leader said, "I think, for example, the IT industry in India is going to have a real big serious problem because of AI. But I don't really think that Bajaj- making scooters is going to have such a big problem. It's going to take away some jobs, it's going to add some jobs and if you're positioned properly, it's an opportunity and if you positioned badly, you're in trouble."</p>

<p>"I remember Mr [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee gave a speech that Indians don't need computers. And somebody else gave a speech that Indians don't need English. [But] Computers created millions of jobs in India. So it depends how flexible you are and how well you're looking at the future," he added.</p>

<p>Rahul Gandhi arrived in Dallas, Texas, on Sunday for his three-day US visit. The Congress MP was welcomed at the airport by Sam Pitroda, Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, and members of the Indian diaspora.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes in central Syria killed at least seven people late Sunday, including three civilians, a war monitor reported.</p>

<p>Since the start of the civil war in Syria in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes there, targeting pro-Iranian groups in particular.</p>

<p>"The number of dead in the Israeli strikes on the Masyaf region stands at seven, namely three civilians, including a man and his son who were in a car, and four unidentified soldiers," said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a vast network of sources inside the country.</p>

<p>The attack also wounded at least 15 others and destroyed military facilities in the area, the Observatory said.</p>

<p>"Thirteen violent explosions rang out in the zone housing scientific research centres in Masyaf where pro-Iranian groups and weapons development experts are present," the group said in an earlier statement.</p>

<p>The Syrian state news agency Sana had previously reported five killed and 19 wounded near Masyaf, citing a medical source.</p>

<p>"Around 11:20 pm (2020 GMT) on Sunday, the Israeli enemy carried out an air attack from the northwest of Lebanon targeting a number of military sites in the central region," Sana reported, citing a military source.</p>

<p>"Our air defence shot down some missiles."</p>

<p>Israeli air raids in Syria have intensified since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.</p>

<p>At the end of August, three pro-Iranian fighters were killed in the central region of Homs in strikes attributed to Israel, the Observatory said.</p>

<p>A few days later, the Israeli military said it had killed an unspecified number of fighters belonging to Hamas ally Islamic Jihad in a strike in Syria near the Lebanese border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. House of Representatives Republicans will release a long-awaited report on Monday blasting Democratic President Joe Biden's administration for failures surrounding the chaotic and deadly U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.</p>

<p>The report contends that the administration made its decision to evacuate noncombatants far too late, formally ordering it only on Aug. 16, failed to communicate between departments in Washington and among officials in Afghanistan, and botched the paperwork for the departure of Afghan civilians eligible to leave the country.</p>

<p>It is the result of a three-year investigation led by Representative Michael McCaul, Republican chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

<p>"America's credibility on the world stage was severely damaged after we abandoned Afghan allies to Taliban reprisal killings - the people of Afghanistan we had promised to protect," the report said. "And the moral injury to America's veterans and those still serving remains a stain on this administration's legacy."</p>

<p>The withdrawal has become intensely politicized ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Last month, the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, shot video for his campaign at Arlington National Cemetery where he appeared at a ceremony honoring troops killed in the evacuation.</p>

<p>Trump has also attacked Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over the exit from Afghanistan during campaign appearances, blaming them personally for the deaths at Kabul airport's Abbey Gate. On Aug. 26, 2021, as U.S. forces were trying to help Americans and Afghans flee as the Islamist Taliban movement took control of the country, a suicide attack at the Abbey Gate entrance to Kabul's airport killed 13 Americans, compounding the U.S. sense of defeat after two decades of war.</p>

<p>Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>

<p>Democrats have insisted that some blame for the messy end of the war - less than seven months into Biden's presidency - should be laid at the feet of Trump, who began the withdrawal process by signing a deal with the Taliban in 2020.</p>

<p>"When former President Trump took office, there were approximately 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan. Days before leaving office, the former President ordered a further reduction to 2,500," Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, said in a letter to committee Democrats about the investigation.</p>

<p>Republican committee aides dismissed that contention as partisan politics, saying Biden could have ignored Trump's agreement or enforced it, accusing officials who served during Biden's presidency of allowing the Taliban to disregard its commitments.</p>

<p>Some 800,000 U.S. servicemembers served in Afghanistan following the U.S.-led invasion triggered by the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the U.S. by Afghanistan-based al Qaeda.</p>

<p>During the war, 2,238 U.S. servicemembers died and nearly 21,000 were wounded. Independent estimates put the number of Afghan security forces and civilians killed at more than 100,000.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, while interacting with the students at the University of Texas, Dallas in the US, said that Bharat Jodo Yatra introduced the idea of love in politics.</p>

<p>Elaborating the reasons for conducting the Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhi said, "The reason [behind conducting Bharat Jodo Yatra] is that all avenues of communication in India were shut. No matter what we did, it was all shut. We spoke in parliament. That's not televised. We go to the media, they don't pick up what we say. We even go with documents to the legal system, nothing happens. So all our avenues were shut. And for a long time we literally couldn't understand how to communicate. And then suddenly we hit upon the idea... what better way to go directly than to literally go walking across the country? And so that's what we did..."</p>

<p>"But it went surprisingly easy. And it fundamentally changed the way I think about my work... It completely changed how I view politics, how I view our people, how I communicate, how I listen. To me, the most powerful thing that happened organically, was that we introduced certainly for the first time in India, possibly for the first time in many countries, the idea of 'love' in politics. And this is strange... because... [in] the political discourse in most countries, you will never find the word 'love'... You'll find hatred, anger, unfairness, corruption... and the Bharat Jodo Yatra actually introduced that idea into the Indian political system, and it has amazed me how that idea has worked," he said.</p>

<p>The Congress leader also said that India has to think about the act of production and organising production.</p>

<p>"India has to think about the act of production and organising production. It's not acceptable that India simply says, manufacturing or production is going to be the reserve of the Chinese... or Vietnamese... or Bangladeshis. Bangladesh completely outcompetes us in textiles, regardless of the problems they're facing right now... We have to reimagine how to produce in a democratic environment. Until we do that, we will face high levels of unemployment. And frankly, it's not sustainable. So... if we carry on down this path... you're going to see massive social problems coming in India and in the United States and in Europe. The polarization of our politics is because of this," he said.</p>

<p>Talking about issues faced by the youth due to unemployment, the Raebareli MP said that the act of production creates jobs. But India organises consumption, which is the reason of worry.</p>

<p>"If you look at the United States in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, they were the center of global production. Anything that was made- cars, washing machines, TVs- all made in the United States. Production moved from the United States... [then] to Korea, [from there] it went to Japan. Eventually it went to China... China is dominating global production. [In] India, the phones... furniture... clothes, [most are] made in China. That's a fact. The West, America, Europe, India have given up on the idea of production and they've handed it to China. The act of production creates jobs. What we do, Americans do, the west does, is organize consumption. Uber, Foxconn, Mahindra, Bajaj organize production. These are the guys who create the jobs..."</p>

<p>Mr Gandhi added that not all countries have an employment problem.<br />
"Let's be clear. Not everywhere on the planet has an employment problem. The west... [and] India has an employment problem. But there are many countries in the world that don't have an employment problem. China... [and] Vietnam doesn't have an employment problem. So there are places on the planet that are not struggling with unemployment. There's a reason," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poland's longest river, the Vistula, on Sunday hit a record-low water level in the capital because of drought, the national weather agency said.</p>

<p>Its level at one Warsaw measuring station fell to 25 centimetres (10 inches), beating the last record by a centimetre, according to the IMGW weather institute.</p>

<p>"It's worse than in 2015 -- and the water continues to fall!" the institute added on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>Most of Poland's rivers are suffering from drought, IMGW hydrologist Grzegorz Walijewski told AFP last week.</p>

<p>"We've been dealing with hydrological drought in Poland for a while. Since 2015 there's been permanent drought," he said.</p>

<p>He said climate change was to blame, as milder winters with less snow alongside fewer days of rain and higher temperatures push down water levels.</p>

<p>The Vistula, which is the EU member's longest river at more than 1,000 kilometres (621 miles), splits the country in half and deposits in the Baltic Sea.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of supporters of Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan gathered in Islamabad on Sunday despite authorities' attempts to block the protesters' main routes into the capital, AFP journalists noted.</p>

<p>The demonstration, led by Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, is the largest in Islamabad since the retired international cricketer was jailed last year on several charges, some of them still before the courts.</p>

<p>The rally's "size and popularity ensure (PTI's) mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it," said Michael Kugelman, Pakistan specialist at the Wilson Center, a US-based think tank.</p>

<p>Protesters on Sunday cleared containers used by Pakistani authorities to block major roads into Islamabad ahead of the demonstration.</p>

<p>"They closed the city with containers. But despite this, thousands are here. They cannot stop this motivation and emotions the people have right now," Humayun Mohmand, a PTI senator, told AFP.</p>

<p>In jail since August 2023, Khan insists along with his party that the charges against him are designed to prevent him from returning to office.</p>

<p>Backed by the military, which wields enormous influence, he rose to power in 2018 by standing against widespread corruption embedded in the country's revolving door of dynastic politics.</p>

<p>But he was ousted in 2022 after falling out with the military establishment.</p>

<p>That furthered a sense of helplessness and frustration among many Pakistanis who want the generals to stay out of politics in a country that has been ruled by the military on and off for much of its history, and where a civilian prime minister has never served a full term.</p>

<p>Khan's first arrest, on corruption charges in May 2023, sparked nationwide demonstrations by supporters expressing anger at the army. In response, the army orchestrated a massive crackdown on the PTI.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The governor of Russia's southern Belgorod region said on Sunday Ukrainian forces attacked a fuel depot, triggering a series of fires after Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of launching overnight attacks on border regions.</p>

<p>"The Ukrainian military, aided by lethal drones, attacked a fuel storage site in Volokonovsky district," Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram, referring to an area near the border.</p>

<p>"Several reservoirs caught fire in an explosion. Firefighting crews are putting out the blaze."</p>

<p>Gladkov also reported drone attacks on three other localities. There were no casualties reported in the incidents.</p>

<p>In the overnight air attacks, Ukrainian officials said two people died and four were injured in Sumy region. Gladkov reported three civilians were injured in Belgorod.</p>

<p>Two children were among those injured in Sumy, the military administration of the northeastern Ukrainian region said on Sunday on Telegram. Several homes and cars were damaged.</p>

<p>In Belgorod region, three civilians, including two children, were injured. Gladkov said two residential buildings were destroyed and more than 15 buildings in total were damaged.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said it had destroyed one drone over Belgorod region and another over Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion last month. It said two drones were intercepted over Belgorod overnight.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the reports.</p>

<p>Border regions on both sides have been subject to frequent attacks. Both Moscow and Kyiv deny targeting civilians, saying the attacks are aimed at destroying each other's infrastructure critical to war efforts.</p>

<p>Thousands of civilians have died in the war, which Russia started with a full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022. Millions of Ukrainians have also been displaced, while their cities and villages have become piles of rubble</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A blaze destroyed a dormitory at a Kenyan school on Sunday, police said, the third such incident in just days.</p>

<p>A dorm at Njia Boys High School in the central county of Meru caught fire as students were having supper and no casualties were reported, a police statement said.</p>

<p>The building housing about 150 students "completely burnt down, the inferno consuming everything, and property of unknown value was destroyed", it said.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, 21 boys perished when flames engulfed their dormitory at the Hillside Endarasha Academy in Nyeri county as they were sleeping.</p>

<p>And on Saturday, another fire erupted at a girls' high school in Isiolo county, also in the centre of the country.</p>

<p>A local official said there were several injuries, but police said no one was hurt.</p>

<p>Last week's deadly inferno has thrown the spotlight on safety at Kenya's schools, with President William Ruto vowing that those responsible would be brought to justice.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Sudan Doctors Network, which was set up after the start of the war in April 2023, reported a similar death count, but said the number of wounded was more than 70. It blamed the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for the shelling.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A golden eagle attacked a toddler in Norway on Sunday, with her mother and a neighbour fighting the bird off repeatedly until a game warden killed it, Norwegian media reported.</p>

<p>The 20-month-old girl, who was playing on her family's farm in Trondelag in central Norway when the eagle swooped down on her, required stitches to the back of her head and had scratches from the eagle's talons on her face, her father told public broadcaster NRK.</p>

<p>"The eagle came out of nowhere and grabbed our youngest daughter," said the father, whose name was not disclosed.</p>

<p>"Her mother jumped up and grabbed hold of the eagle, but had to fight to get it to let go. A neighbour also had to help her and our little girl," he said.</p>

<p>Gamekeeper Per Kare Vinterdal, who killed the eagle, told NRK the bird saw the little girl as "prey".</p>

<p>He said the mother and neighbour managed to get the eagle off the girl "but it kept coming back" even though "the neighbour chased it away with a stick".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that droplets were a "minor" route of transmission for mpox compared to physical contact, adding that more research is required to understand how the virus spreads.</p>

<p>The UN health agency declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 amid a surge of cases across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Mainly, two distinct clades of the virus, Ia and Ib, are causing significant concern in the DRC. A third variant, Clade II, originated in Nigeria and has been responsible for the global outbreak that began in 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Mpox?</strong></h3>

<p>The mpox virus is an orthopoxvirus that causes mpox (monkeypox), a disease with symptoms similar to smallpox, although less severe, according to the WHO website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are the symptoms of Mpox?</p>

<ol>
	<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Extensive characteristic rash&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Back pain and muscle ache</li>
	<li>Lack of energy</li>
</ol>

<p>The incubation period of mpox can range from 5 to 21 days. The febrile stage of illness (when fever persists) usually lasts 1 to 3 days, according to WHO. This is followed by the skin eruption stage, which can last for 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>How does Mpox spread?</strong></h3>

<p>WHO has said that mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact with someone who has the virus. "Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing)," it said.</p>

<p>However, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said today that if a person with the virus had lesions, "if you're talking closely to someone, breathing on them, physically close, face-to-face, there is a possibility" of viral spread, "but this is a minor source".</p>

<p>"When you're talking to somebody, you're spitting out droplets," but "it's not a very major form of transmission -- and it's not a... through-the-air, long-distance sort of transmission," she added.</p>

<p>The WHO recommends the use of facemasks for those with mpox, their close contacts and health workers treating them.</p>

<h3><strong>Does mpox have a vaccine?</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, there are vaccines recommended by WHO for use against mpox. However, only people who are at risk should get the vaccine. WHO has not recommended mass vaccination against mpox.</p>

<h3><strong>How has India prepared for a possible mpox outbreak?</strong></h3>

<p>India currently has no active mpox cases. The government had ordered the authorities in airports, ports and borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan to remain alert about incoming international passengers who show mpox symptoms.</p>

<p>The All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had issued protocols for handling suspected mpox cases in India. Various government hospitals were directed to set up isolation rooms for suspected and confirmed cases of mpox.</p>

<p>The institute has recommended setting up a screening process in the triage area wherein, upon arrival, patients with fever, rash, or a history of contact with confirmed mpox cases should be flagged for immediate assessment.</p>

<p>According to an assessment, the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is low, officials had said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's advantage over Kamala Harris on the economy and crime is eroding among U.S. voters, a sign the Democratic vice president's campaign is gathering momentum ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.</p>

<p>The three-day poll, conducted Aug. 23-25, showed Republican former President Trump's approach to the economy and employment was preferred by 43% of registered voters compared to 40% who preferred Harris's approach. The 3 percentage point difference was too small to be significant given the poll's 4 percentage point margin of error. A prior Reuters/Ipsos poll in late July showed Trump with an 11-point advantage on the economy.</p>

<p>On crime and corruption, Harris and Trump were tied with 40% support for each, showing more movement toward Harris, who trailed Trump by 5 points in the July poll.</p>

<p>Recent national polls have shown Harris building a small lead over Trump since she entered the race on July 21 following President Joe Biden's decision to fold his campaign. The Reuters/Ipsos poll from late July showed Harris up by 1 point, 43% to 42%.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the race will be affected by independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr's decision on Friday to suspend his campaign. Kennedy, who had attracted the support of about 8% of voters in a July poll, subsequently endorsed Trump.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign speeches frequently criticize the Biden administration's management of the economy as households continue to feel the sting of several years of high inflation. Harris has pledged to get prices under control through efforts like cracking down on "price gouging" by grocers.</p>

<p>The new poll showed the economy was the biggest issue for 26% of registered voters, compared to 22% who picked political extremism and threats to democracy and 13% who picked immigration.</p>

<p>Voters picked Harris over Trump on the issue of extremism by 42% to 36%. Trump had an advantage on immigration policy, picked by 45% of voters compared to Harris' 37%.</p>

<p>Neither of the two candidates is broadly liked, with 59% of voters saying they have an unfavorable view of Trump and 52% saying the same of Harris. Harris was viewed favorably by 47% of voters, compared to 39% for Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The poll gathered responses online from 1,028 adults nationwide, including 902 registered voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ukrainian presidency on Tuesday said it wanted the next peace summit aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine to be held in a country of the Global South.</p>

<p>Leaders and top officials from more than 90 states gathered in Switzerland in June for a first summit organised by Ukraine, held without Russia or China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We would like for the second summit to be held in one of the countries of the Global South," Andriy Yermak said at a forum in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The Global South refers to several countries and blocs outside Europe and North America, whose foreign policy interests are not fully aligned with either Kyiv or Moscow.</p>

<p>Russia had been excluded from the first summit but Ukraine said it hoped Moscow could be involved in a second round of talks.</p>

<p>"If Russian representatives want to attend the second summit, they will attend," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Any diplomatic breakthrough however looks elusive as the Kremlin said it "will not talk" to Ukraine since its counter-assault in Russia's Kursk region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even before the incursion, the Kremlin insisted any peace deal would need to force Kyiv to surrender territory that Moscow claims as its own -- an unacceptable condition for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kyiv's announcement comes a few days after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kyiv, where he advocated for peace.</p>

<p>Mr Modi "made it absolutely clear that India will never support any plan, any proposal that includes any compromise with the territorial integrity of Ukraine," Mr Yermak said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However neither side showed any signs of breakthrough in Kyiv -- and India firmly believes Moscow should be involved in diplomatic efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Modi spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin and "emphasised his interest to contribute to a possible political and diplomatic settlement of the situation around Ukraine," the Kremlin said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Besides Modi, Zelensky has met with several leaders of countries in the Global South including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>

<p>He is yet to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has become Moscow's key political and economic partner since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>"The only thing that remains is for our president to meet with the leader of China. But I am confident that this will happen," Mr Yermak said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite efforts by an off-duty doctor and ambulance staff, the man was pronounced dead at the scene.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A motorcycle rider was tragically killed in a collision with a car on the British highway A4112 near Kinnersley, Herefordshire, on Sunday. The fatal crash occurred around Monday, leaving one person dead. The video of the tragic accident has gone viral on social media.</p>

<p>The viral video shows a motorcyclist travelling at dangerously high speed crashing into a car that was making a slow right turn. Despite the motorcyclist's attempt to brake sharply upon realising the imminent collision, he lost control, causing the bike to flip. The impact triggered a devastating fire that engulfed both the rider and the motorcycle.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://wmas.nhs.uk/2024/08/27/motorcyclist-dies-in-hereford-collision/">release by the National Health Service of the UK</a>, West Midlands Ambulance Service received calls from police and fire colleagues reporting a road traffic collision involving a motorcycle and a car on the A4112 in Kinnersley, Hereford, at 11.05am yesterday (26th August 2024). Two ambulances and a paramedic officer responded to the scene.</p>

<p>A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: "On arrival, ambulance staff found a motorcyclist, a man, who was in a critical condition being cared for by an off-duty doctor. Sadly, nothing could be done to save the man, and he was confirmed dead on scene. No one else was injured in the collision."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia has announced that it will be limiting its international student intake to 2.7 lakh in 2025 in a bid to tackle record levels of migration that has led to skyrocketing house rental prices.</p>

<p>The limit includes higher education courses as well as vocational education and training courses, Australia's Education Minister Jason Clare said today.</p>

<p>The move is set to impact Indian students hoping to go abroad for higher education, especially those from Punjab which accounts for a large number of such students.</p>

<p>"In June 2022, Australia capped the foreign student intake at 5.10 lakh. This number was reduced to 3.75 lakh in 2023. Now they have reduced the annual planning levels further. These levels are accorded to individual universities for all international students and not just for Indian students. The universities will distribute the quotas country wise then state wise," &nbsp;Sunil Jaggi, a member of Migration Agents Registration Authority of Australia, said.</p>

<p>"The students who were preparing to take admission for the February intake will get affected by this announcement. Students from Punjab will be worst affected," he further said.</p>

<p>"This will affect my career. My family is taking loans for my education as the cost of studying in Australia is quite high," a student from Haryana, who wishes to study nursing in Australia, said.</p>

<p>"The Indian government must put forward students' point of view to the Australian government," another student said.</p>

<p>Notably, the Australian Education Minister on a visit to India last year had signed an agreement to expand in-country access to Australian higher education institutions for Indian students.</p>

<p>According to India's Ministry of External Affairs, around 1.22 lakh students from the country study in Australia. India's Quad partner is the fourth most popular destination for Indian students studying abroad, after Canada, the US and the UK.</p>

<p>Australia also increased its non-refundable visa fee for foreign students from AUD 710 to AUD 1,600, another measure that seemingly aims to reduce migration levels.</p>

<p>Canada has also announced new restrictions on its temporary foreign workers' programme. Starting September 26, businesses will only be allowed to fill up to 10 per cent of their workforce with low-wage foreign workers, down from the previous 20 per cent. The decision to limit the number of low-wage foreign workers comes in response to rising unemployment rates in Canada. The overall unemployment rate has climbed to 6.4 per cent, with the rate for younger workers reaching 14.2 per cent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Ohio woman and her boyfriend have been arrested following a shocking incident in which her 6-year-old son was handcuffed as a form of "corporal punishment" before being attacked by a pit bull, according to police. Angelina Williams, 27, of Cleveland, and her boyfriend, Taylor Marvin-Brown, now face charges of endangering children and obstructing justice.</p>

<p>In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ashlandcountysheriff.org/news-releases/2024/8/20/savannah"><em>release,</em></a> the Ashland County Police said, "On Saturday, August 17, 2024, at 5:06 pm the cops received a 911 call for a squad to be sent to 23 Chapel Street, Savannah, Ohio. Dispatchers were told that a Pitbull had bitten a 6-year-old child on the neck and ear. When the squad members and deputies arrived, the child was in serious condition, and Life Flight was called. Deputies identified the mother as Angelina Williams of Cleveland, Ohio, who was living with a family member of Robert Michalski, who was the owner of the house and dog. Robert had left the house with Pitbull prior to deputies arriving."</p>

<p>Detectives and deputies learnt through an investigation that the 6-year-old child had been restrained with handcuffs on his hands and feet when the Pitbull attacked him.</p>

<p>A search warrant was executed at the house where deputies recovered evidence to support the investigation. Also, they found Robert and the Pitbull hiding in a cubbyhole upstairs at the residence. The Pitbull was taken into custody to be housed as a vicious dog.</p>

<p>Angelina Williams and Robert Michalski were taken into custody and taken to jail. Angelina's boyfriend, Taylor Desiree Marvin-Brown, was at the house and assisted with the restraining of the 6-year-old child. She was taken into custody along with Williams and Michalski.</p>

<p>The investigation will continue, and the case will be forwarded to the Ashland County Prosecutor's Office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes US government pressure on his social media platforms to take down certain Covid-19 content in 2021 was "wrong", according to a letter submitted to a US congressional committee.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes US government pressure on his social media platforms to take down certain Covid-19 content in 2021 was "wrong," and said he would resist similar attempts in the future, according to a letter submitted to a US congressional committee.</p>

<p>In the letter, addressed to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and released by Republicans on the committee, Mr Zuckerberg addressed a number of controversies centered on content moderation on his platforms.</p>

<p>He also asserted that he did not plan on repeating funding efforts for US election infrastructure ahead of the country's presidential poll this year, donations that had drawn sharp criticism from Republicans.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg's submission to the committee on Monday comes just over two months out from a tightly contested US presidential election race, with the spotlight on widespread online misinformation about the candidates.</p>

<p>Regarding the pandemic, the Facebook founder said President Joe Biden's administration had in 2021 "repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire."</p>

<p>"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it," Mr Zuckerberg wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration in either direction -- and we're ready to push back if something like this happens again."</p>

<p>Republicans took the letter as a victory, with the Republicans' House Judiciary Committee account on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, labeling it a "big win for free speech."</p>

<p>The White House defended its actions during the pandemic, which killed more than a million people in the United States amid bitter political battles over vaccines and attempts to limit the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>"When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety," a White House spokesman said Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said he would not be repeating his Covid-era push to fund non-profits working to support US electoral infrastructure due to such donations being seen by Republicans as being partisan.</p>

<p>"My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another -- or to even appear to be playing a role," he wrote.</p>

<p>The letter also touched on controversy regarding Facebook's handling of a story regarding US President Joe Biden's son Hunter that was published by the New York Post in 2020.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said the story, which purported to expose corrupt dealings by the Biden family, was "temporarily demoted" while Facebook fact-checkers probed the possibility of it being "a potential Russian disinformation operation."</p>

<p>The Meta CEO said the story was ultimately found not to be part of such an operation and that the platform has changed its policy such that posts in the United States are no longer demoted while fact checkers investigate them.</p>

<p>Republicans in Congress have been targeting social media and tech companies in recent months, alleging that they are suppressing or censoring conservative views.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, who is seeking a return to power in November after losing his reelection fight to Biden in 2020, claimed that Zuckerberg's statement offered support for his conspiracy theory that the election was stolen.</p>

<p>"This is what everyone's been waiting for -- THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS RIGGED!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Iraqi criminal court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for a businessman and a former government official wanted over their alleged involvement in stealing $2.5 billion of public funds.</p>

<p>The scandal dubbed the "heist of the century", sparked widespread anger in Iraq, which is ravaged by rampant corruption, unemployment and decaying infrastructure after decades of conflict.</p>

<p>The criminal court issued the warrants for businessman Nour Zuhair and Haitham al-Juburi, a former adviser to then prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, state news agency INA reported.</p>

<p>The two suspects are among several facing a trial which opened in mid-August, but are on the run and failed to appear in court.</p>

<p>According to the tax authorities, the defendants allegedly expropriated the $2.5 billion between September 2021 and August 2022 through 247 cheques cashed by five companies.</p>

<p>The money was subsequently withdrawn -- in cash -- from the firms' accounts.</p>

<p>The owners of those accounts -- most of whom are also on the run -- have also been subject to arrest warrants.</p>

<p>Around 30 suspects are facing trial, INA reported, including six already behind bars or awaiting extradition to Iraq, the national anti-fraud agency has said.</p>

<p>In October 2022, Zuhair was arrested at Baghdad airport as he was trying to leave the country.</p>

<p>A month later he was released on bail after giving back more than $125 million and pledging to return the rest in instalments.</p>

<p>Juburi also returned $2.6 million of the allegedly embezzled funds before disappearing, a judicial source told AFP.</p>

<p>The current whereabouts of both men is unknown.</p>

<p>However, wealthy businessman Zuhair was back in the news over the few days after he reportedly had a car crash in Lebanon, following an interview he gave to an Iraqi news channel.</p>

<p>"The Nour Zuhair affair is a scandal... that concerns the entire political system," Iraqi journalist and commentator Hamed al-Sayyed told AFP.</p>

<p>He blamed the authorities for releasing him on bail two years ago, allowing him "to flee".</p>

<p>"His release from jail, at a time when he was being investigated, shows that the political system, at the highest echelons, is complicit," Sayyed added.</p>

<p>Corruption is endemic in Iraqi state institutions, with the top echelons of power often evading accountability.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Singapore soon to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two nations. The specific dates for the prime minister's official visit are not known yet, but it will happen shortly, a top official said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Singapore was mentioned by Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan after senior ministers of India and Singapore concluded a high-level meeting to further their strategic ties.</p>

<p>A four-member Indian delegation comprising Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, and Railway &amp; IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw participated in the second India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) in Singapore.</p>

<p>Calling the meeting "productive", Mr Balakrishnan said, "We will, very shortly, be announcing an official visit by Prime Minister Modi to Singapore. I cannot give you the specific date, but it will occur shortly".</p>

<p>During the multi-ministerial meeting, the two countries discussed ways to boost bilateral cooperation in the digital arena, skill development, sustainability, healthcare, connectivity and manufacturing.</p>

<p>Mr Balakrishnan further said that advanced manufacturing and semiconductors, as well as aviation and maritime connectivity are the new areas that Singapore and India have added to their bilateral talks.</p>

<p>"A country with more than 1.4 billion people is now embarking on a major upgrade of its aviation sector. This is a once in a two, three-decade opportunity, and it's good that we are, in a sense, in the front seat and have a chance (to collaborate)," he said.</p>

<p>At the meeting, Singapore was represented by Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, Digital Development and Information Minister Josephine Teo, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng and Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat.</p>

<p>"During the meeting, the ministers reaffirmed the close and long-standing relationship between the two nations, underpinned by strong economic and people-to-people ties," Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a joint release.</p>

<p>Besides a link-up between Singapore's PayNow and India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in February 2023, which lets financial institutions from both sides transfer funds in real time, the two countries have also facilitated investments in renewable energy, such as green ammonia.</p>

<p>"I am confident that the discussions we had today and those in the future will pave the way to foster greater collaboration between Singapore and India," Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>An official announcement by the Ministry of External Affairs regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit is awaited.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said the West was playing with fire by considering allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with Western missiles and cautioned the United States on Tuesday that World War Three would not be confined to Europe.</p>

<p>Ukraine attacked Russia's western Kursk region on Aug. 6 and has carved out a slice of territory in the biggest foreign attack on Russia since World War Two. President Vladimir Putin said there would be a worthy response from Russia to the attack.</p>

<p>Sergei Lavrov, who has served as Putin's foreign minister for more than 20 years, said that the West was seeking to escalate the Ukraine war and was "asking for trouble" by considering Ukrainian requests to loosen curbs on using foreign-supplied weapons.</p>

<p>Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly warned of the risk of a much broader war involving the world's biggest nuclear powers, though he has said Russia does not want a conflict with the U.S.-led NATO alliance.</p>

<p>"We are now confirming once again that playing with fire - and they are like small children playing with matches - is a very dangerous thing for grown-up uncles and aunts who are entrusted with nuclear weapons in one or another Western country," Lavrov told reporters in Moscow.</p>

<p>"Americans unequivocally associate conversations about the Third World War as something that, God forbid, if it happens, will affect Europe exclusively," Lavrov said.</p>

<p>Lavrov added that Russia was "clarifying" its nuclear doctrine.</p>

<p>Russia's 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out when its president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons "when the very existence of the state is put under threat".</p>

<p><strong>RUSSIA'S RESPONSE</strong></p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier this month that the assault on Russia's Kursk region showed that Kremlin threats of retaliation were a bluff.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy said Ukraine, because of the restrictions imposed by allies, could not use the weapons at its disposal to hit some Russian military targets. He urged allies to be bolder in their decisions about how to help Kyiv in the war.</p>

<p>Russia has said that Western weaponry, including British tanks and U.S. rocket systems, have been used by Ukraine in Kursk. Kyiv has confirmed using U.S. HIMARS missiles to take out bridges in Kursk.</p>

<p>Washington says it was not informed about Ukraine's plans ahead of the surprise incursion into Kursk. The United States has also said it did not take any part in the operation.</p>

<p>Putin's foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, said on Tuesday that Moscow did not believe Western assertions that it had nothing to do with the Kursk attack. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the involvement of the United States was "an obvious fact".</p>

<p>The New York Times reported that the United States and Britain provided Ukraine with satellite imagery and other information about the Kursk region in the days after the Ukrainian attack.</p>

<p>The Times said that the intelligence was aimed at helping Ukraine keep better track of Russian reinforcements.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five more murder cases have been filed against Bangladesh's ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina taking the total number of cases filed against the Awami League leader to 71, a media report said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Four of the new cases were filed in Dhaka and one in Rajshahi against the 76-year-old deposed former prime minister, several former ministers and police officials, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>In the first case, Hasina and 48 others were booked for the death of one Dulal alias Selim in the city's Jatrabari area on August 3 during mass protests.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Mostafa Kamal filed the case against the Awami League president and others with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Saddam Hossain.</p>

<p>Former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader, former Awami League lawmakers Shamim Osman and Ramesh Chandra are among the accused, The Daily Star said.</p>

<p>In the second case, Sheikh Hasina along with 21 others was booked on the charge of killing one Mansur Miah, a machine operator of Buriganga Filling Station at Basila of Mohammadpur on July 19.</p>

<p>In the third case, Sheikh Hasina and 91 others were sued for the death of one Miraz Hossain at Sanarpar in the city's Demra area on August 5.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Khorshed Alam filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Belal Hossain.</p>

<p>The fourth case was filed against Sheikh Hasina and 40 others for the death of 21-year-old Nahidul Islam at Mirpur-10 on July 19.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Md Sabuj filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mehedi Hasan.</p>

<p>Quader, Asaduzzaman, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana, son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Harun Or Rashid and former DMP commissioner are among the accused.</p>

<p>In Rajshahi, SM Salahuddin Ahmmed Shamim Sarkar, a member of Bagha upazila Chhatra Dal in Rajshahi, filed a case against Hasina, former state minister for foreign affairs Shahriar Alam and 52 others, said Bagha police station's officer-in-charge Abu Siddque.</p>

<p>The number of cases filed against Hasina has risen to 71 with four new cases filed in Dhaka, the report said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India on August 5 after unprecedented anti-government student-led protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs.</p>

<p>The Hasina-led government was replaced by an interim government, and 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was named its Chief Adviser.</p>

<p>Over 230 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government, taking the death count to more than 600 since the massive protest by students against a controversial quota system in government jobs first started in mid-July.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops have recovered an Israeli hostage in "a complex rescue operation" in the southern Gaza Strip, the military said on Tuesday, more than 10 months after he was abducted by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7.</p>

<p>It said 52-year-old Qaid Farhan Alkadi, a member of the Bedouin community in southern Israel, had been transferred to a hospital and his medical condition was normal.</p>

<p>The operation, following the rescue of four Israeli hostages in June, comes as talks have continued to try to agree a halt to the fighting in Gaza and the return of more than 100 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>"We are doing everything to save the hostages," the head of the military Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israeli television stations showed a military helicopter landing at a hospital as medical staff stood by.</p>

<p>Alkadi was taken hostage in Kibbutz Magen, one of a string of communities around the Gaza Strip that were attacked by Hamas-led fighters on Oct. 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 39-year-old woman died on the first day of Burning Man, the popular counterculture festival held annually in the Nevada desert, according to the New York Post. Kendra Frazer was found unresponsive at the festival around 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, and despite efforts to revive her, she was pronounced dead, Burning Man organizers said in a statement.</p>

<p>Pershing County Sheriff Jerry Allen stated that the cause of death is under investigation, pending autopsy and toxicology results, in a statement shared on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=904349431727786&amp;set=a.329297399232995" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Facebook</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Kendra's family and friends," Allen added.</p>

<p>Authorities noted that the death occurred before the official start of the event, which festival organizers confirmed began at 6 p.m. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/us-news/woman-dies-at-opening-day-at-burning-man-festival/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The New York Post</em></a> also reported that participants were not permitted to enter the festival until midnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>"It is with heavy hearts that Burning Man Project confirms the death of a participant in Black Rock City in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family and friends affected by this loss. The participant has been identified by the Pershing County Sheriff's Office as 39-year-old Kendra Frazer," Burning Man organisers said in a statement.</p>

<p>"On Sunday, August 25, 2024, at 11:29 am, Burning Man's emergency services personnel responded to a report of an unresponsive individual. Once on scene, life-saving measures were immediately attempted but were unsuccessful," they added.</p>

<p>Burning Man is a nine-day festival centred around community and art, culminating in the symbolic burning of a large wooden effigy.</p>

<p>The event takes place in Black Rock City, a temporary city constructed in the Black Rock Desert of northwestern Nevada.</p>

<p>According to the <em>Guardian</em>, the festival began early Sunday after the gates were closed for 12 hours due to severe weather.</p>

<p>About 20,000 people were already on the Playa - a silt-alkaline salt flat - before the gates reopened, and organizers anticipate more than 70,000 attendees throughout the nine-day event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A museum in southern French city Marseille is inviting visitors to discover Europe's relationship to the naturist lifestyle by wandering its halls in the nude.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A museum in southern French city Marseille is inviti naturist lifestyle by wandering its halls in the nude.</p>

<p>"It's not every day you get to walk around a museum naked," said Julie Guegnolle, 38, who was celebrating her birthday at the "Naturist Paradises" exhibition in the Museum of Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean (Mucem).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once a month, visitors to Mucem can explore the history of naturism in Europe in only their shoes -- a precaution not for modesty's sake but simply to "avoid getting splinters," the head of France's FFN naturist organisation Eric Stefanut told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walking around the displays clad in a sarong, Guegnolle told AFP she wanted to "do something different" for her birthday.</p>

<p>She and her husband, Matthieu -- also in his birthday suit -- were among 80 visitors in various states of undress strolling around the 600 photos, paintings, sculptures, and other works one Tuesday in August.</p>

<p>"When we arrived, we felt a bit lost, but it's not so strange," Guegnolle said.</p>

<h3><strong>Not really accepted</strong></h3>

<p>Some visitors suffered more culture shock than others, with one couple from southwest England marvelling at the liberated attitudes towards nudity on display.</p>

<p>Kieren Parker-Hall and Xander Parry told AFP they enjoyed the "fantastic" photography, including a nude black-and-white portrait of Christiane Lecocq -- a female pioneer of French naturism who died at the age of 103.</p>

<p>Discovering the history of naturism while in the nude was a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" for the two Brits, especially since they said the practice is not widely accepted in their home country.</p>

<p>"There's not a lot of naturist stuff in England," said web developer Parker-Hall, 28, adding the practice is "not really accepted".</p>

<p>Xander Parry, a 30-year-old stained glass maker, agreed.</p>

<p>Being naked in England is seen as "weird... you should be a bit ashamed of being naked," Parry said.</p>

<h3><strong>Stronghold of naturism</strong></h3>

<p>Though there is no official ranking, Mucem describes France as "the world's leading tourist destination" for those who enjoy going nude outdoors.</p>

<p>The naturist movement sprang up in Switzerland and Germany in the 19th century, Bruno Saurez, head of the local naturist association and co-host of the visit told AFP.</p>

<p>France's first naturist group emerged in the southeastern Provence region in 1930 before spreading throughout the country.</p>

<p>The southern port city of Marseille, long considered a "stronghold of naturism" boasts several dedicated centres due, in part, to the region's mild climate, Saurez added.</p>

<p>"We're right on Spain's heels for the number of visitors to vacation resorts" dedicated to naturists, he said.</p>

<p>But for Christelle Bouyoud, 53, naturism goes further than tourist numbers or the freedom to bare it all - the decision to go nude can be a unifying force for society.</p>

<p>"When you're naked, it's very complicated to face someone on the battlefield," Bouyard, a naturist of a decade's standing, told AFP.</p>

<p>For the fully clothed and the naked alike, the exposition featuring loans from the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Louvre, and the Swiss National Library in Bern is open until December 9.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that his military had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically produced ballistic missile.</p>

<p>His announcement in Kyiv came in the wake of two consecutive nights of large-scale Russian bombardments across Ukraine that killed several people and battered energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>"There has been a positive test of the first Ukrainian ballistic missile. I congratulate our defence industry on this. I can't share any more details about this missile," he said at a press conference in the Ukrainian capital.</p>

<p>Ukraine has been attempting to develop its own arms industry and encourage military production on its own territory as part of efforts to become less dependent on Western military aid.</p>

<p>Zelensky said last week that his forces had deployed in combat for the first time a Ukrainian-made long-range "rocket drone" called Palianytsia.</p>

<p>Kyiv has signed agreements with Western arms companies on the production of small arms and ammunition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite a late-season boost, the overall cyclone activity remains below historical averages, and direct hits on Hawaii are rare due to environmental factors.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 Northeast Pacific hurricane season, which had been quiet up until recently, got a late-week shot in the arm. On August 25, Hurricane Hone-which had developed from a disturbance well southeast of Hawaii-reached Category 1 intensity before passing south of the Big Island, according to <em>the NASA Earth Observatory.</em></p>

<p>Though Hone did not strike the island chain directly, it still delivered damaging winds, soaking rains, and life-threatening surf. Some parts of Hawaii received more than 10 inches (25 centimetres) of rain within 24 hours and faced localised flash floods. Some 24,000 utility customers lost power initially, though the number dropped to 2,400 by the afternoon of August 26, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/hawaii"><em>PowerOutage.us.</em></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Hone continued to move along west, Hurricane Gilma did the same, reaching Category 3 but was likely weakening owing to unfavourable weather. In the eastern Pacific, the other troublemaker was Tropical Storm Hector, expected to fade.</p>

<p>This new breed of planetary storms received further attention from the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA), which is thought to have combined three of the most powerful storms in Earth's memory into a stunning video showing them wreak havoc over an ocean.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>These planetary storms are documented in the video as merging over the vast ocean.</p>

<p>This season has seen the Northeast Pacific spawn just nine named storms, most of them very short-lived despite that late surge. Nevertheless, Hone and Gilma, collectively, did a lot to put a better dent in the overall activity for the basin this season. Researchers say that so far this season, accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, is running below the historical average, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153242/storms-line-the-northeast-pacific"><em>NASA Earth Observatory.</em></a></p>

<p>While direct hits to Hawaii are quite rare, tropical storms do occasionally make runs at the state. Strong wind shear, a steering high-pressure system, and colder ocean temperatures usually break apart or weaken the storm before it makes a direct landfall on the islands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relations between Moscow and Paris have reached a nadir following the arrest of Russian-born Telegram boss Pavel Durov, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, after the tech billionaire's detention was extended until Wednesday.</p>

<p>Durov, who has French as well as Russian nationality, was arrested near Paris over the weekend as part of an investigation into crimes related to images of child sex abuse, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions on the platform, French prosecutors said on Monday.</p>

<p>It remains unclear if he knew about the threat of arrest in France. Durov's French lawyer did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Durov's arrest has plunged Moscow-Paris ties to their lowest level, Lavrov said on Tuesday, capping months of deteriorating relations between the two nations.</p>

<p>French authorities accused Russia of trying to destabilise it ahead of the Paris Olympics in response to its more hawkish stance on the Ukraine war - claims Russia has denied.</p>

<p>Durov's detention was extended by 48 hours late on Monday, a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor's office said on Tuesday. After that, prosecutors will either need to charge or release him. Should he face charges, his flight risk status is a factor judges have to include in their assessment of possible pretrial detention, according to French law.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday that Russia was ready to provide Durov with all necessary assistance given his Russian citizenship, but that his French citizenship complicated the situation. Durov also holds a UAE passport.</p>

<p>"The charges are very serious indeed," said Peskov. "They require a no less serious basis of evidence. Otherwise they will be a direct attempt to limit freedom of communication."</p>

<p>FREE SPEECH DEBATE</p>

<p>Durov's arrest has sparked a debate about the limits of free speech online, with X-owner Elon Musk saying the right to expression in Europe was under attack. It also underlines a movement by governments around the world to take a tougher line on policing illegal activity that flourishes on some platforms.</p>

<p>Brazil's supreme court briefly suspended Telegram nationwide in 2022 over its failure to comply with judicial orders.</p>

<p>With close to 1 billion users, Telegram is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. It presents itself as a haven for free speech, but is also widely used by far-right, anti-vax and conspiracist movements, as well as political dissidents.</p>

<p>The platform has become crucial to battlefield communications in the war in Ukraine and is used by governments and soldiers on both sides of the war to share war-related news and propaganda.</p>

<p>Without providing evidence, Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, earlier said the United States, through France, was attempting to exert control over Telegram.</p>

<p>"Telegram is one of the few and at the same time the largest Internet platforms over which the United States has no influence," Volodin said in a post.</p>

<p>"On the eve of the U.S. presidential election, it is important for (President Joe) Biden to take Telegram under control."</p>

<p>The White House has yet to comment on Durov's arrest.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who is known to be an avid user of the app, has said that the arrest was "in no way a political decision".</p>

<p>Russia has previously tried, and failed, to block Telegram and fined the company several times for failing to delete what it deemed illegal content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned Tuesday that his new government's first budget in just over two months will be "painful", asking the country to "accept short-term pain for long-term good".</p>

<p>Starmer, whose Labour Party won a landslide parliamentary majority on July 4, used his first major speech since then to lay the ground for the much-anticipated fiscal event on October 30.</p>

<p>He also used the address, from the Downing Street garden, to attack the ousted Conservatives, reiterating claims they had left a £22-billion ($29-billion) "black hole" in the public finances.</p>

<p>"There is a budget coming in October, and it's going to be painful," Starmer said.</p>

<p>"Those with the broadest shoulders should bear the heavier burden," he added, hinting at tax rises for some after October 30.</p>

<p>Labour has pledged not to hike taxes on "working people", which would appear to rule out raising income tax, other social security and VAT rates.</p>

<p>But there is growing speculation that other taxes, like capital gains, could be targeted.</p>

<p>Starmer insisted the UK must look beyond tinkering with taxes and that growing the economy remained the "number one mission".</p>

<p>But he also cautioned that his government's fiscal inheritance would not be "easily fixed".</p>

<p>"We're going to have to take tough decisions, I did not cater for a £22-billion black hole," he added.</p>

<p>Political opponents have argued that the government was aware of the country's perilous financial plight months ago and is preparing the ground for unpopular announcements.</p>

<p>Labour has insisted the Tories misled the public and others on the issue, including the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).</p>

<p>The independent fiscal watchdog has said it is investigating the last government's spending forecasts in light of Labour's black hole claims.</p>

<p>In his speech, Starmer also addressed the recent anti-immigration riots sparked by the deadly Southport knife attack.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder, which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers as well as police officers and other properties.</p>

<p>Attempting to link the disturbances to the Conservatives' legacy, the UK leader said they "didn't happen in a vacuum" and had "exposed the state of our country".</p>

<p>They "revealed a deeply unhealthy society... weakened by a decade of division and decline, infected by a spiral of populism which fed off cycles of failure of the last government".</p>

<p>"Every time they faced a difficult problem, they failed to be honest, they offered the snake oil of populism, which led to more failure," Starmer argued.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of Indian student graduates have staged protests against a new federal policy in Canada that puts them at risk of getting deported from the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many international students, particularly those from India, dream of moving to the North American country in hopes of building a better life, but the announced immigration policy changes have left the future of more than 70,000 student graduates in uncertainty.</p>

<p>Indian students have camped in front of the legislative assembly in Canada's Prince Edward Island province, protesting the sudden policy change for more than three months. Similar demonstrations were also seen in the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia.</p>

<p>The new policies are aimed at reducing the number of permanent residency nominations by 25 per cent as well as limiting study permits.</p>

<p>The change comes as Canada saw rapid population growth over the last few years. Around 97 per cent of last year's population increase in Canada was driven by immigration, according to Federal data.</p>

<p>Representatives from student advocacy group Naujawan Support Network warned the graduates are at risk of being deported when their work permits expire at the end of this year.</p>

<p>"I spent the most crucial six years of my life taking many risks to come to Canada," says Mehakdeep Singh, a former international student who is facing deportation.</p>

<p>"For the past six years, I studied, I worked, I paid taxes, I earned enough CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) points but the government has just taken advantage of us," Mr Singh said.</p>

<p>Like many international students, Mr Singh had spent his family's life savings on college tuition fees in the hopes of eventually gaining permanent residency.</p>

<p>Amid a local housing and jobs crisis, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is under pressure to reduce the number of temporary residents, which has seen a staggering growth in recent years. Mr Trudeau has been trailing in polls ahead of an election expected next year.</p>

<p>The Canadian government is also reducing the number of temporary foreign workers it brings in, reversing its decision to expand the programme in 2022. The programme allows immigrants to work in the country on a short-term basis, meant to fill labour shortages.</p>

<p>According to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), 183,820 temporary foreign worker permits were granted in 2023, a steep 88 per cent increase from 2019. The ESDC on Monday criticised employers for using the programme to "circumvent hiring talented workers in Canada".</p>

<p>Under the new changes, work permits will be denied in regions where the unemployment rate is at or above 6 per cent. The changes will exempt sectors like agriculture, food processing, construction and healthcare.</p>

<p>"We're looking at the various streams to make sure that as we move forward, Canada remains a place that is positive in its support for immigration, but also responsible in the way we integrate and make sure there's pathways to success for everyone who comes to Canada," Justin Trudeau told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>The government has also promised more measures to reduce the temporary resident population to 5% of Canada's total population in three years.</p>

<p>The International Sikh Student Organization, an advocacy group, insisted that the prevailing employment and housing issues are rooted in broader policy failures rather than the migration of international students.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in the Maldives are investigating an alleged attempt to topple President Mohamed Muizzu by stirring anger over the Indian Ocean archipelago's worsening financial conditions.</p>

<p>Last week, the main commercial bank in the upmarket tourist destination drastically reduced the foreign exchange spending allowed for Maldivians, sparking widespread anger.</p>

<p>Muizzu has slammed the move as an "illegal attempt" to overthrow his government, by making him unpopular and encouraging street protests.</p>

<p>"An investigation has been launched into the alleged coup attempt," the police said in a statement late Monday.</p>

<p>There have been no demonstrations in the capital Male, but scathing criticism of the government has erupted online.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of 'bot' accounts have been used on social media to encourage people to take to the streets to overthrow the government and incite public unrest," police said.</p>

<p>The bank said the changes, which they have since rescinded, came "in response to the escalating usage of foreign currency spent on cards and the static sale of foreign currency to the Bank".</p>

<p>The international credit rating agency Fitch downgraded the Maldives in June and warned it could be headed for a sovereign default after its foreign currency reserves dropped to $492 million in May.</p>

<p>The downgrade came weeks after the IMF warned the Maldives against a looming "debt distress", as the small but strategically placed country eyes further borrowing from main creditor China.</p>

<h3><strong>Pivot to China</strong></h3>

<p>Official data showed the Maldives' foreign debt reaching $4.038 billion last year, about 118 percent of gross domestic product, an increase of nearly $250 million from 2022.</p>

<p>Fitch had noted the government's debt servicing obligations, amounting to $409 million this year, would add to severe stress.</p>

<p>The crisis escalated over the weekend, when the Bank of Maldives Limited (BML) stopped debit card transactions and allowed a maximum monthly credit card spend of $100 for online transactions.</p>

<p>Maldivians use their cards to pay for tuition and medical treatment abroad apart from online purchases.</p>

<p>Muizzu told supporters late Monday the bank decision was a plot to discredit him, and accused some BML directors of being loyal to the former government.</p>

<p>"There is room to believe that this (cap on spending) was an illegal attempt to overthrow a legitimate government," Muizzu said.</p>

<p>The bank on Sunday raised forex spending limits after the Maldives Monetary Authority intervened.</p>

<p>Political parties have called on the government to tax hotels in foreign currency.</p>

<p>Since winning office last year, Muizzu has reoriented his nation from traditional benefactor India and towards China.</p>

<p>As of June 2023, the Export-Import Bank of China owned 25.2 percent of the Maldives' external debt and was the country's biggest single lender, Male's finance ministry figures showed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The CDC states that parvovirus B19 is "highly transmissible in respiratory droplets."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health advisory concerning a significant rise in cases of parvovirus B19, commonly known as the Fifth Disease or "slapped cheek" illness due to the characteristic reddening of the cheeks it causes. This illness can be especially hazardous for pregnant women, according to the agency.</p>

<p>The CDC examined individuals with IgM antibodies, which indicate a recent infection, and found that the greatest increase occurred among children aged 5-9, with cases rising from "15% during 2022-2024 to 40% in June 2024." Across all age groups, the prevalence of these antibodies increased from 3% during 2022-2024 to 10% in June 2024, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/slapped-cheek-illness-parvovirus-cases-rising-8696532"><em>People </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>The CDC states that parvovirus B19 is "highly transmissible in respiratory droplets." Symptoms such as fever and malaise typically develop about a week after exposure. During the second week, the distinctive facial rash appears, often accompanied by body pain.</p>

<p>While most people only need supportive care, pregnant women face a risk of "adverse fetal outcomes," including fetal anaemia, non-immune hydrops (which can strain the heart), or fetal loss. The risk is greatest if a pregnant woman contracts parvovirus between weeks 9 and 20 of pregnancy.</p>

<p>One case highlighted by NBC News involves Abby Parks, a teacher from Springfield, Illinois, who contracted parvovirus B19 at 18 weeks pregnant, resulting in fetal anaemia. She was hospitalized and received blood transfusions, which she believes were "lifesaving" for her fetus. "If that anaemia had persisted, with that low blood count, the baby could have died," Parks said.</p>

<p>The CDC has received reports from clinicians observing "more than the expected number" of pregnant individuals with parvovirus B19, including cases of severe fetal anaemia requiring transfusions or resulting in pregnancy loss.</p>

<p>The agency advises that pregnant individuals seek medical care if exposed to parvovirus B19. However, the patient is no longer contagious once the characteristic facial rash appears.</p>

<p>Now at 30 weeks, Parks says she and her fetus are under close monitoring, describing the illness as "truly the most difficult experience to go through." She adds, "He wasn't guaranteed to come through the fetal anaemia."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To many, reading is a paragon of hobbies. If you take the wide spectrum of leisure activities that humans devote much of their lives to pursue, reading sits snugly in the Goldilocks zone: the sweet spot that defines the perfect avocation. Consider the evidence: an interest in philately, numismatics, or collecting trinkets of any kind really, marks you out as someone who spends their weekends caressing their collection albums and murmuring, 'My precious....'. Opting for a more energetic brand of recreation - like cycling or running, for instance - signals to society that if anyone makes the mistake of approaching you, they will hear about your training regimen in insufferable detail.</p>

<h2><strong>Congratulations, You Are A 'Sophisticate' Now</strong></h2>

<p>On the other hand, reading - as a hobby - offers a number of benefits. You can win any debate so long as you preface your argument with the words, 'Well, I know that's what you heard on a podcast but I read in a book...'. When your friends are raving about a new movie, you can declare with a sniff, 'To be perfectly honest, the book is much better...'. Surrounding yourself with books can earn you the admiration of your peers. You don't even need to have read them - merely possessing a well-stocked bookcase can make you a sophisticate (ask any interior designer). In these times of snappy reels, clickbait headlines, and dwindling attention spans, book readers are revered as 'Zen masters' who can ignore the lure of doomscrolling and immerse themselves in the textual world.</p>

<p>It is no wonder then that so many parents hope their children grow up to be readers, or that countless adults strive to adopt reading as a hobby. Yet, you rarely hear anyone talking about the undiagnosed emotional damage caused by books - anyone who has read <em>A Little Life</em> by Hanya Yanagihara will know what I mean - and the pernicious effects of reading in general. It is about time someone acted to remedy this grave oversight.</p>

<h2><strong>That Perpetual Despair...</strong></h2>

<p>Allowing yourself to be consumed by a love for books can harm you, broadly speaking, in four significant ways. To begin with, it can cause you to be assailed by a sense of despair, a feeling of crushing hopelessness every time you enter a bookshop. As you browse the shelves and stack volumes in the crook of your arm, you realise you will never get around to reading all the books that call out to you. Some are able to make peace with this doleful reality.</p>

<p>Others, those of a more defiant disposition, refuse to be cowed. They redouble their efforts, but since reading capacity is constrained by physical limits, these efforts end up being channelled solely towards the acquisition of books. The Japanese have an elegant word to describe this condition: <em>tsundoku</em>. It means a penchant for stockpiling books with the genuine intention to read them all - subject only to the minor requirement of first attaining immortality. If you are also afflicted with this malady, do not be disheartened. Karl Lagerfeld is said to have owned over 3,00,000 books. At least, things are not as grim for you (I hope).</p>

<h2><strong>Guilt Meets Snobbery</strong></h2>

<p>This abundance of material naturally leads to the second pitfall of reading: experiencing guilt. No matter which book you pick up, you are sure to feel a twinge of regret for the ones you're compelled to set aside. Every time you pull out your favourite Agatha Christie or P. G. Wodehouse title from the bookshelf, you can hear your dusty copy of <em>War and Peace</em> tutting in disappointment. In the library, when you're lingering in the Young Adult fantasy section - 'young' is relative, after all - you can feel <em>Great Expectations</em> glaring at you from across the aisle. Every breezy read - every literary guilty pleasure - is laced with the shame of having abandoned <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em> after a dozen pages.</p>

<p>A large part of this contrition is attributable to the third ill effect of reading: snobbery.</p>

<h2><strong>The Struggle To 'Belong'</strong></h2>

<p>The world of bibliophiles can be alarmingly tribal and each clique has its idiosyncrasies. You have the acolytes of the Russian masters - a bleak lot who can be disqualified from their clan if they ever crack a smile. Crime fiction aficionados tend to sidle up to you, introduce themselves, and then lean in to whisper, "So... what do you think is the best way to get rid of a body?" The devotees of speculative fiction can be identified by their pallid skin, thick glasses, and ability to talk for hours about the genealogy of dragons; and then there are the readers of business management books, who pride themselves on having no imagination.</p>

<p>Every group believes their reading habits to be loftier and they are all perpetually at odds with each other. Indeed, there is only one thing that unites them: a shared loathing for lovers of romance novels, and, let's be honest, you can see where they're coming from.</p>

<p>If you do not throw in your lot with any one of these clubs, then you must forever contend with their tidal pulls as you chart your literary journey. As you flit from one genre to the next, you will be welcomed and then mocked, your choice of books forever questioned and dismissed as being inferior to a host of other suggestions. If you somehow muster the will to ignore these challenges and keep going, then you will eventually have to tackle the fourth, and most fatal, misfortune to befall a reader. You will begin to believe that you, too, can be a writer.</p>

<h2><strong>'Can I .... Be A Writer?'</strong></h2>

<p>Anyone who spends a substantial amount of time reading books soon begins to harbour fantasies of writing one themselves. It is one of those immutable laws of nature (those who read poetry are - unfortunately for the rest of us - especially susceptible to this affliction). This is one of life's greatest tragedies because writing is a masochistic, time-consuming and exhausting pursuit. When you choose to become a writer, the only people who suffer more than you are your friends and family members who have to read your early output. It is only because they pretend to enjoy it that you are encouraged to continue. Pick up any celebrated guide on the craft of writing - be it <em>Bird by Bird</em> by Anne Lamott or <em>On Writing </em>by Stephen King - and it will tell you that as a writer you must persevere; you must write with dedication and doggedness, and perhaps one day you will be wildly successful and publish a manuscript that makes a tenth of the sales of the latest book by a social media celebrity.</p>

<p>Most bookworms endure one or more of these ordeals, and yet, astonishingly, they continue to read. Books continue to exist, and some people still find the greatest joy in getting lost in their pages, in weaving stories of their own.Most bookworms endure one or more of these ordeals, and yet, astonishingly, they continue to read. As far as book lovers are concerned, that is a blessing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Ferris wheel caught fire at a German summer music festival and injured at least thirty people, including four police officers, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/18/world-news/germany-ferris-wheel-bursts-into-flames-at-highfield-music-festival/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em>New York Post.</em></a> The incident took place in a gondola at the Highfield Festival at Stormthaler Lake, at around 9.13 pm. The fire began in one lower tub and quickly spread to another, scaring the people on the ride.</p>

<p>Videos captured from the festival showed the Ferris wheel spinning despite the two gondolas being turned into fireballs. Further, thick, black smoke was also seen in the night sky with several people screaming.</p>

<p>The conductors stopped the ride and reversed it so that the burning vehicle was positioned close to the top of the wheel. The video showed how powerful the fire was-it blazed white at its centre.</p>

<p>According to the outlet, the 30 people who were treated for injuries sustained mild cases of smoke inhalation. However, two were seriously injured.</p>

<p>German rapper Ski Aggu was on stage when the blaze started and was also instructed to carry on with his performance despite the accident. "I was just told through my earpiece that I should not end the show under any circumstances," the rapper said on his Instagram. He said he was told to continue performing to avoid "mass panic."</p>

<p>Further, the two gondolas were successfully tipped upside down by firefighters to stop the fire from spreading. "We currently know that there are over 30 injured people, including four injured police officers, but all of them are probably slightly injured," police spokeswoman Josephin Sader told the tabloid BILD.</p>

<p>The fire has been put out, leaving the two gondolas destroyed. According to the organisers, a technical issue with the Ferris wheel was the reason for the fire.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh on Sunday reopened all educational institutions, including universities, secondary schools and colleges, across the country after more than a month of closure due to violence centring the student-led protests that led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>The educational institutions in Bangladesh were closed indefinitely on July 17 to ensure the safety of students in the wake of clashes that erupted during the recent movement demanding reform of the job quota system.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education on Thursday issued a directive to reopen the institutions under its jurisdiction. All the educational institutions reopened on Sunday, after a month of closure.</p>

<p>According to Somoy Television, a Bengali news channel based in Dhaka, “All concerned have been asked to take necessary steps to resume academic activities in all the educational institutions from August 18 following the instruction of Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus,” a notification signed by deputy secretary Mosammat Rahima Akhtar, said on August 15.</p>

<p>In the morning, school students in uniform were seen going to their institutions, many accompanied by guardians, the Daily Star reported.</p>

<p>Many points of Dhaka city are witnessing severe traffic congestion due to the reopening of educational institutions.</p>

<p>The working week is from Sunday to Thursday in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Initially, classes were scheduled to resume on August 4 in all government primary schools, except in the 12 city corporations and Narsingdi municipality, but this was also postponed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the postponed Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and equivalent examinations will be resumed from September 11.</p>

<p>According to the revised routine, the exams will be completed on October 23.</p>

<p>Classes at public universities have been suspended since July 1 when teachers went on strike in protest of a new pension scheme.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government on August 5, the educational institutions were declared open on August 7, but the academic activities could not be resumed fully due to the low attendance of students.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin, fired eight shots from a warehouse rooftop, injuring the former US president and several others in the crowd.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A police sniper's quick response likely saved numerous lives during the assassination attempt at Donald Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last month. According to a preliminary report by Congressman Clay Higgins, the sniper's bullet struck the gunman's rifle, causing damage that temporarily knocked him down and disrupted his aim.</p>

<p>On July 13, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin, fired eight shots from a warehouse rooftop, injuring the former US president and several others in the crowd, and killing one person. However, the Butler SWAT operator's precise shot prevented further harm, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/17/trump-assassination-attempt-swat-officer-report">The Guardian</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The local law enforcement officer reportedly “ran towards the threat”, firing from 100 yards away and hitting the gunman's rifle with “a single shot”, temporarily knocking him off balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The 9th shot fired on J13 was from a Butler SWAT operator from the ground about 100 yards away from the AGR building [where the gunman was positioned]. Shot 9 hit Crooks' rifle stock and fragged his face/neck/right shoulder area from the stock breaking up,” the report said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report called the SWAT operator a “total badass”, adding that “when he had sighted the shooter Crooks as a mostly obscured by foliage moving target on the AGR rooftop, he immediately left his assigned post and ran towards the threat, running to a clear shot position directly into the line of fire while Crooks was firing 8 rounds.”</p>

<p>Crooks was wounded by fragments from the damaged rifle and was subsequently killed by a federal sniper as he attempted to get back up. “A 10th and final shot” was fired by another Secret Service sniper, striking the gunman in the head and ending the threat, the report read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New records obtained by <a href="http://https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/newly-released-docs-show-security-plans-ahead-trump/story?id=112907116 ">ABC News</a> show local authorities discussing security for the rally, including requests for extra support. The Secret Service reassigned officers from President Biden's detail to President Trump's after Biden dropped out of the election race. The director of the Secret Service resigned after facing criticism for the agency's response to the shooting. The FBI is investigating the protection failure, and Congress has started inquiries.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Donald Trump's campaign team has announced plans to bolster security protocols, including the installation of bulletproof glass around stages at future outdoor rallies. The former president did not have the protection during his 13 July rally in Butler when Crooks' bullet nearly hit him squarely in the head.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump once again sparked controversy by criticising two Olympic gold medalist female boxers, labelling them as men during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump's remarks, made in the context of his pledge to "keep men out of women's sports," have reignited debates over gender and sports.</p>

<p>Referring to the athletes at the recently concluded Paris Olympics, Trump stated, "They were men. They transitioned to women, and they were in the boxing," adding that it is "so demeaning to women."</p>

<p>Trump's comments follow a pattern of his rallies where he has frequently targeted transgender athletes.</p>

<p>The two Olympic gold medalist athletes in question, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan and Imane Khelif of Algeria have been at the centre of global scrutiny due to misconceptions about their gender.</p>

<p>Both athletes were disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships by the now-banned International Boxing Association (IBA) over alleged failures in gender eligibility tests, despite both being born and raised as women.</p>

<p>Khelif and Lin, who were cleared to compete in women's boxing at the Paris 2024 Olympics, had been disqualified from the Women's World Championships in India due to elevated testosterone levels, according to the IBA.</p>

<p>The IBA's decision, which stripped both boxers of their medals and barred them from women's competition, was widely criticised for its lack of transparency and fairness.</p>

<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing events in Paris, cleared both Lin and Khelif to compete in the Olympics, basing their eligibility on the athletes' passport gender.</p>

<p>The IOC condemned the harassment faced by Khelif, who has been subjected to online abuse and threats following the ruling by the IBA. Khelif spoke out against the bullying, warning of its potential to ruin lives.</p>

<p>Trump's repeated criticism of Khelif, including referring to her as a man, has drawn widespread condemnation from various quarters. His remarks come amidst ongoing debates about the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports, an issue that has polarised opinions across the globe.</p>

<p>The situation has highlighted the broader challenges faced by athletes like Khelif and Lin, who are caught in the crossfire of debates over gender, fairness, and the intersection of sports and identity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has compared Brazil's Chief Justice Alexandre de Moraes to the infamous Harry Potter villain, Lord Voldemort. The SpaceX CEO made the comparison in a tweet, which has since gone viral, featuring side-by-side images of Judge Moraes and Voldemort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judge Moraes is seen in a black cloak similar to that worn by Voldemort, who is wielding a wand in the other image. "The resemblance is uncanny. Alexandre de Voldemort," The Tesla CEO wrote in the caption on X.</p>

<p>An X user added fuel to the controversy by creating a&nbsp;video that transitioned Brazil's Chief Justice&nbsp;into Voldemort. The edited clip showed Mr Moraes rising in the air, cloaked in black, before morphing into the Harry Potter villain holding a wand. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This comparison comes on the heels of a major development involving X's operations in Brazil. On Saturday, the social media giant announced it would be shuttering its operations in the country, citing an ongoing legal battle with the Brazil Chief Justice as the primary reason. The shutdown was described as "effective immediately," although Brazilian users will still have access to the platform.</p>

<p>"We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision," X said in an official statement, placing the blame squarely on Moraes. The company claimed that the decision was a direct result of the actions of the Brazilian Supreme Court judge.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Last night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions.<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The legal conflict between X and Judge Moraes has been simmering for some time. Earlier this year, the judge ordered X to block certain accounts accused of spreading disinformation and hate speech, particularly those linked to supporters of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. Mr Bolsonaro had repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of Brazil's electronic voting system, claiming it was vulnerable to fraud - a claim that fueled tensions leading up to the tightly contested 2022 election.&nbsp;<br />
Alexandre de Moraes, who also presides over Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal, has been a vocal advocate for combating disinformation. "Freedom of expression doesn't mean freedom of aggression," Mr Moraes has said in the past, as per an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/17/elon-musks-x-to-shut-operations-in-brazil-amid-bitter-legal-fight">Al Jazeera</a> report. "It doesn't mean the freedom to defend tyranny."</p>

<p><br />
In the latest escalation, X claimed Mr Moraes secretly threatened one of its legal representatives in Brazil with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content. "As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil," they said in their statement.&nbsp;<br />
Elon Musk, never one to shy away from controversy, doubled down on his criticism of Mr Moraes, calling him "an utter disgrace to justice" in a separate post on X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to demands by “Justice” <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Alexandre</a> in Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, ???? has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil.<br />

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/hb13n3t8_imane-khelif_625x300_18_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The kind of bullying and abuse Olympic boxer Imane Khelif has been subjected to makes one thing crystal clear: in the age of social media, misinformation is easiest to amplify when it's rooted in misogyny, transphobia and racism, and amplified by verified, blue-ticked accounts on X. It has also made it clear that trans-hate will eventually come to haunt all women who do not fit traditional, conservative definitions of femininity.</p>

<p>Now that Imane Khelif has refused to take the online abuse in silence and is suing the key amplifiers - J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk - let's revisit the brutal online hate campaign unleashed against the Olympic gold medallist, all for being a 'non-feminine' woman of colour.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Prime Purveyors Of Hate</strong></h2>

<p>On August 1, after facing Khelif for a whopping 45-second battle, Italian boxer Angela Carini forfeited the match. Later, she would tell the press, "I have never been punched so hard" and shed tears in front of the camera, as anyone would have in her position. However, seeing a white woman cry on television was, of course, too much to bear for champions of women's rights like author J. K. Rowling, who has had a history of making transphobic comments. Rowling cried foul on X about a "man" punching a woman and about men's rights activism having gone too far. Even the owner of X, Elon Musk, could not resist chiming in. It's another story that Musk's own views about transgender persons are worth some scrutiny and may be best described by his estranged daughter who he refuses to acknowledge.</p>

<p>The Imane Khelif case underlines a hard but unsurprising truth: we are not as progressive in 2024 as we would like to believe. Sure, there are more people today who are accepting of queer rights, gender equality, and just human rights in general, but in the country called the internet, this population is sparse.</p>

<h2><strong>Trans Hate Is Misogyny</strong></h2>

<p>When two people with a combined following of over 200 million people put out such derogatory posts against a woman, their legions of followers are bound to spew out the same misinformation, often with vile language. But Rowling and Musk's comments also fanned the fire of deep-rooted transphobia and misogyny that still burns in all stratas of human classes, races, and nationalities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans hate is just another catalyst for overall misogyny. Groups abound on Reddit and Facebook where people aligned with the Rowling ideology simply attack any female celebrity they don't think is "woman enough" and must therefore, be a transsexual or transgender; there is a word for this group too, "transvestigators". &nbsp;For example, if you like to lift weights and be muscular, then you are not feminine, and hence make for a perfect target for these 'tranvestigators'. Like sports? Big cars? Not dainty, petite, blonde, and light-eyed enough? Wear too much makeup as if to hide male appearance? Wear too little makeup because you are a man trying to pass off as a 'sporty woman'? Well, women who exhibit such traits "aren't women", according to tranvestigators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming back to the hate campaign against Khelif. Soon after her win in Paris and its fallout, conservative-leaning media outlets and social media handles started talking about her 2023 disqualification by the International Boxing Association (IBA) for failing a 'gender eligibility test'. No matter the fact that the IBA itself was questioned by the Olympics for their 'methods' and that there have been accusations of corruption as well. The International Olympic Association (IOC) banned the IBA last year over its governance and finance issues, with the Olympic body allowing the boxing competition to be held in Paris. But alas, this grain of truth was buried deep under the rubble of misinformation that flooded the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of questions have been raised amid this storm. "How can 'he' be a woman?", "IBA must have banned 'him' for a reason!", "XY is a man! Only men have Testosterone!", "He clearly looks like a man. He is built like a man."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let's try to answer them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Man, Woman, Other?</strong></h2>

<p>Khelif's story is very <em>Dangal</em>-like. Indian audiences, if they read her full interview with UNICEF, may relate to the story of a young girl joining a sport that's dominated by men. But unlike <em>Dangal</em>, she did not have a father ready to fight the world. She fought mostly alone in her childhood, while her family battled poverty to feed their children and sustain the family.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that Algeria is a deeply religious Islamic country, where being trans may invite a host of legal challenges. If any of the 'tranvestigators' like Rowling or Musk followers had bothered to do a simple Google search, they would know Algeria would probably never send a 'trans' person to represent their country in the Olympics. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>XX or XY?</strong></h2>

<p>Doesn't matter, honestly. Anyone who has studied genetics and chromosomes can answer this: the set of chromosomes that define sex (not gender) are named so based on their shape. Zoya Fatima, a teacher at Jamia Senior Secondary School, explains that women have two chromosomes shaped like 'X', while in men, one of them is shaped like a 'Y'. "Genetic mutation can cause a foetus with XX to have a Y-shaped chromosome," she explains, "They can have all female genitalia, even uterus in some cases, but ovaries in almost all cases are non-functional. But they can be mothers via IVF and have normal pregnancies. So it is incorrect to say that all XY automatically classify as male and man."</p>

<p>If we were to go by the definitions recommended by conservative social media, then millions of women would immediately lose their right to be called a woman for having elevated testosterone levels. While testosterone is considered the 'male hormone', women produce it too - many with hormonal disorders, such as PCOS, tend to produce too much of it. Will these conditions void a woman's right to be called a 'woman'?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we consider science for our definitions, the majority of women with XY or XXY or XXYY chromosomal structures have one common denominator: a non-functional ovary. So that begs the question, is a perfectly functional ovary fundamental for being classified as a 'woman'? If yes, what about a few thousand women who have ovarian insufficiency? Will they cease to be known as women?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Question Of Race</strong></h2>

<p>Women of colour who don't fit conservative definitions of femininity have always had it worse. Barely a day before her match, Khelif's Hungarian opponent, Luca Hamori, posted an incendiary picture on Instagram that showed Khelif as a 'beast'. For centuries now, Black women have been mocked for their 'masculinity'. Not too far in India itself, sprinter Duttee Chand had been on the receiving end of primitive gender tests. "In 2014, I challenged the IOC's rule that a person with a higher testosterone level should not participate in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. It was noted that hormonal levels cannot increase athletic performance. I suffered a lot at that time. I faced a lot of controversy regarding my gender," Chand told <em>PTI </em>after the Imane Khelif controversy erupted.</p>

<p>The abuse and attacks Imane Khelif has faced online will be remembered for years to come. The key takeaway is this: misinformation driven by racist, misogynist ideologies often travels much, much faster than the truth.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The enormous prints, spaced up to 75cm apart, are thought to have been made by a large herbivore from the late Triassic period.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A casual summer beach walk turned into a prehistoric adventure for a 10-year-old girl in the UK when she&nbsp;stumbled upon enormous footprints.&nbsp;While strolling along the shore with her mother in Penarth, Tegan stumbled upon five massive footprints, which dinosaur experts believe belong to a Camelot that roamed the area over 200 million years ago, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c049pe7gx6do">BBC</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The enormous prints, spaced up to 75cm apart, are thought to have been made by a large herbivore from the late Triassic period. Palaeontologists are now working to verify the discovery, with the National Museum Wales' palaeontology curator expressing confidence that the prints are genuine, leaving Tegan and her mother thrilled to have walked in the footsteps of dinosaurs.</p>

<p>"We've got five footprints and we're talking about half-to-three-quarters of a metre between each one. These footprints are so big, it would have to be a type of dinosaur called a sauropodomorpha,'' Cindy Howells told the BBC's The Dinohunters programme.</p>

<p>The incredible discovery was made on the South Wales coast, where&nbsp;the girl's mother Claire used to live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was so cool and exciting. We were just out looking to see what we could find, we didn't think we'd find anything. We found these were big holes that looked like dinosaur footprints, so mum took some pictures, emailed the museum and it was from a long-necked dinosaur,'' said Tegan.</p>

<p>Following the remarkable discovery, Claire reached out to Cindy via email just a few days later. The dinosaur footprints had been found embedded in red siltstone at Lavernock Point, a location situated between Cardiff and Barry along the Glamorgan Heritage Coast.</p>

<p>Cindy, a seasoned dinosaur expert with 40 years of experience in the region, was convinced of the authenticity of the footprints due to the consistent stride pattern. "What's telling is the alternating left and right feet, with a consistent distance between them. If they were just random holes, we'd be sceptical, but this pattern suggests a deliberate gait. It's a significant discovery, and the excitement is palpable when someone contacts us with a confirmed dinosaur find - it's truly thrilling'', she explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's hard to comprehend you're walking on the same beach that hundreds of millions of years ago some massive prehistoric animal was here. You can spend a lifetime looking for dinosaur treasures so for it to happen for Tegan at this age is great,'' she added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US&nbsp;Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, shared a childhood photo of her and her mother, revealing that as a teenager she worked at fast food chains to earn money.</p>

<p>In a heartfelt social media post, the 59-year-old recalled her childhood growing up in a middle-class household, where her mother “saved for over a decade to buy a home”. “I was a teenager when the day finally came—and I can still remember how excited she was,” she revealed in a post on X. Ms Harris also shared her own experience working at McDonald's in college to “earn spending money.”</p>

<p>“That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up,” she said, underlining the increasing struggles faced by many Americans when the cost of living increases, promising to make it a top priority to bring down costs and “increase economic security” for all if she is elected President.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This pledge comes just ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Ms Harris is set to step onto the stage as the party's official presidential nominee. Her candidacy was cemented after receiving overwhelming support in a virtual roll call of delegates, as confirmed by the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-nominee-DNC-majority-democratic-roll-call-votes/story?id=112580918" target="_blank">Democratic National Committee</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, with the convention fast approaching, voters are keen to understand where the Democratic presidential nominee stands on key issues. Kamala Harris' stance on economic issues includes supporting policies that benefit the middle class, such as mortgage assistance and tax credits for parents, as per <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx924r4d5yno" target="_blank">BBC</a>. On immigration, Ms Harris has shifted towards bipartisan border security solutions, addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.</p>

<p>Ms Harris is a strong advocate for reproductive rights and has vowed to protect them nationwide if elected president. She also supports NATO and continued aid to Ukraine, while maintaining Israel's right to self-defence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding taxes, Ms Harris opposes increases for those earning under $400,000 and supports corporate tax rate hikes. She aims to expand healthcare access without eliminating private insurance. Ms Harris also supports gun safety regulations, including red-flag laws, to prevent gun violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine and Russia were on the brink of engaging in indirect ceasefire negotiations in Qatar's Doha this month. The discussions, mediated by Qatar, aimed at halting the destructive strikes on energy and power infrastructure that have plagued both countries since the conflict began. However, a diplomatic breakthrough, which could have marked de-escalation in the ongoing war, was derailed by Ukraine's surprise ground offensive in Russia's western Kursk region, the Washington Post <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/17/kursk-ukraine-russia-energy-ceasefire/">reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the report, both Kyiv and Moscow had signalled their willingness to negotiate an agreement that would stop the relentless attacks on their respective energy grids - an issue that has caused widespread suffering and economic turmoil on both sides.</p>

<p>However, Ukraine's sudden incursion into Kursk, a strategic region where Kyiv has been intensifying its military operations, threw these plans into disarray. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Saturday that his forces were consolidating their positions in Kursk, which has been a focal point of Ukrainian military efforts for over 11 days. This offensive, intended to disrupt Russian supply routes and troop movements, coincided with Moscow's accusations that Ukraine had destroyed a key bridge in the area.</p>

<p>The report claimed that a diplomat briefed on the situation noted that Russian officials viewed the incursion as an "escalation" and postponed their meeting with Qatari mediators. While the Russian delegation did not officially cancel the talks, they requested more time to reassess their position. In response Qatar decided to delay the summit.</p>

<p>There have been previous attempts at diplomacy, including secret talks in Istanbul and the United Nations but they ultimately collapsed due to continued military aggression from both sides.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The volcano has started to "spew ash and lava", the state-owned TASS news agency reported, citing the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>"The eruption of the Shiveluch volcano has begun... According to visual evaluations, the ash column is rising as high as 8 kilometres above the sea level," the report quoted scientists as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday night (local time), a 7.0-magnitude earthquake jolted a sea area off the east coast of Kamchatka.</p>

<p>The epicentre was monitored at 52.8 degrees north latitude and 160.15 degrees east longitude. The quake struck at a depth of 50 km, according to a report issued by the China Earthquake Networks Center.</p>

<p>The US National Tsunami Warning Center had initially issued a tsunami threat but later said the threat had passed. The Russian Emergencies Ministry had not issued any tsunami warning.</p>

<p>The earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks in the Pacific Ocean off Kamchatka, measuring between 3.9 and 5.0. Most of them were not felt on the land, TASS reported, citing the ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from Brooklyn, United States, who fell from a golf cart is suing Hard Rock Cafe &amp; Hotel in the Dominican Republic for $500,000 (Rs 4 crore). Taylor O'Leary claimed in the complaint that she suffered several injuries after she fell out of her golf cart in July 2022 because the seat was wet and slippery, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/nyc-woman-sues-hard-rock-for-500k-after-falling-out-of-golf-cart/"><em>New York Post.</em></a></p>

<p>The incident happened at the Hard Rock Golf Club in Punta Cana. According to the lawsuit, the 27-year-old, who was a guest at the hotel, filed the complaint against the establishment and its corporate owner, Hard Rock Cafe International.</p>

<p>Celebrities like Justin Bieber, Shakira, and Mariah Carey are said to love this five-star luxury resort, which is located along Macao Beach.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in June, a Disneyland employee died two days after suffering a head injury in a golf cart accident, as per a report in The Hollywood Reporter. The 60-year-old woman named Bonnye Mavis Lear was in the backstage area of the California theme park when the incident occurred.</p>

<p>Anaheim Police and Anaheim Fire and Rescue personnel arrived at the resort on Wednesday after they were informed about the accident. She was sitting as a passenger and struck her head after falling from the moving cart. The 60-year-old was then taken to a local hospital in grave condition.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old worked for 24 years at the Disneyland Resort, where she "supported membership services at Club 33," the park's exclusive private dining club.</p>

<p>Disney California Adventure Attractions cast member Rae Delgado, wrote on Facebook that Ms Lear suffered brain swelling and a fractured skull from the accident. "Bonnye was travelling on a rear-facing seat of a golf cart along with 3 passengers behind Critter Country. The driver of the vehicle was driving at least 20 mph on the route. The golf cart came in contact with a bump/dip in the road which caused Bonnye to react immediately. As she went to grab the handrail, it gave way and sent her out of the vehicle. ... She was deemed unconscious when paramedics arrived."</p>

<p>Despite the surgery, "it was beyond repair," according to the employee, and Ms Lear was pronounced "brain dead".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unrelentingly bitter US presidential race, defined by name-calling, attack ads and stunted campaigning, has so far left little space for discussion about climate change, despite the world experiencing unprecedented heat and disasters.</p>

<p>But with Donald Trump now facing Kamala Harris rather than Joe Biden, the Republican has used recent rallies to echo misinformation and memes on X, including fictional bans on red meat and gas stoves.</p>

<p>The aim? To undermine Harris.</p>

<p>"Kamala called for slashing consumption of red meat to fight climate change," Trump said during a July 27 rally in the state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>The Democratic nominee would "get rid of all cows ... and I guess that at some point, they'll go after the humans," the former president added, echoing "depopulation" conspiracy theories that have plagued Harris in right-wing spaces since she waded into the topic of "climate anxiety" among younger generations at a White House press conference last year.</p>

<p>JD Vance, Trump's running mate, amplified the claims in an August 3 speech in Atlanta, saying Harris "wants to take away your gas stoves, she even wants to take away your ability to eat red meat."</p>

<p>Such climate myths took on a life of their own on X, encouraged by conservative commentators in swing states and MAGA accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.</p>

<p>However, Harris made no such campaign promise.</p>

<p>She has cooked with a gas stove herself and noted in a 2019 environmental panel that she "love(s) cheeseburgers from time to time," although she has supported the idea of updating dietary guidelines.</p>

<p>"A tried-and-true tactic in politics is to misrepresent your opponent's positions to make them sound extreme and unacceptable. Trump and Vance are doing exactly that with Vice President Harris's positions on climate action," said Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication.</p>

<h3><strong>Harris's climate record&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The false narratives add to Trump and Vance's criticism of the vice president's stance on issues such as fracking, a violently disruptive underground oil and gas extraction technique.</p>

<p>Harris initially advocated banning the practice in 2019 before becoming Biden's running mate in 2020. She has more recently sought to avoid questions about it, particularly in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania where fracking is big business.</p>

<p>Still, climate activists have mostly saluted Harris, whose environmental stance has historically been to the left of the president -- notably in going after oil companies as California attorney general.</p>

<p>The Biden administration also pushed a renewable energy shift in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in reducing carbon pollution in US history.</p>

<p>Trump has vehemently opposed the legislation, adopting the slogan "drill, baby, drill" to sum up his fossil fuel-friendly approach.</p>

<p>The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group, told AFP the Trump campaign's amplification of misinformation on "widespread bans" constitutes "ridiculous scare tactics" perpetrated to undermine recent "climate progress."</p>

<h3><strong>Potential to 'backfire'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Responding to AFP's request for comment, Harris spokeswoman Lauren Hitt did not address specific claims from Trump and his running mate, but said the Democrat "is focused on a future where all Americans have clean air, clean water, and affordable, reliable energy."</p>

<p>Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly dismissed the threats of climate change.</p>

<p>"The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years," he told Elon Musk on X in mid-August. Musk officially endorsed Trump in July.</p>

<p>More than a third of registered voters disagree, saying global warming is very important to their vote in the 2024 election, according to a recent survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.</p>

<p>"I suspect the tactic will backfire with a relatively smaller number of uncommitted voters, most of whom are concerned about climate change," Maibach said.</p>

<p>"Trump and Vance attacking VP Harris on her climate positions will hurt them more than help them."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump has claimed at an election rally that he is "much better looking" than his Democratic rival for the White House, Vice-President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"I am much better looking than her. I think I'm a better-looking person than Kamala," Trump said at an election rally in Pennsylvania, which is one of the battleground states that will determine the race.</p>

<p>Trump appears to have been triggered by a column in The Wall Street Journal that described Harris as beautiful. "You can't take a bad picture of her. Her beauty, plus the social warmth that all who have known her over the years speak of, combines to produce: radiance," Peggy Noonan, the columnist, had written.</p>

<p>Trump leaned into it by calling out to a Republican who is running for US Senate from the state. "You're not allowed to say this anymore. You know, David, don't ever get caught in this trap," Trump said addressing Republican Senate candidate David McCormick in the audience. "David, please don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that will be the end of your political career."</p>

<p>"I am much better looking than her. I'm a better-looking person than Kamala," he said and went on to belittle a sketch of her on a Time magazine cover. He said he thought it was actresses Sophia Loren or Elizabeth Taylor.</p>

<p>Former President Trump also attacked Harris on policy calling the economic plan she announced on Friday as a plan that "will usher communism in the US". He has called it the "Maduro plan", after Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan leader.</p>

<p>Trump has used a string of personal slurs against Harris in the last three weeks. He has called her "crazy" and a "lunatic", questioned her ethnicity, and even stated that he is "entitled" to these personal attacks because she makes him angry and she has also attacked him as "weird".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is America ready to elect a Black woman as its president? Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be officially confirmed as the Democratic US presidential nominee in Chicago next week, is betting that it is.</p>

<p>"In my entire career, I've heard people say when I ran... people aren't ready, it's not your time, nobody like you has done that before," the Democrat said in 2019 when she ran against Joe Biden in the primary presidential campaign.</p>

<p>"I haven't listened and I would suggest that nobody should listen to that kind of conversation."</p>

<p>But Harris's campaign never took off and she left the primaries race before Biden picked her as his running mate.</p>

<p>If Harris, 59, manages to beat Donald Trump in November, she will become the first woman and the second Black person, after Barack Obama, to run the world's leading power.</p>

<h3><strong>Trailblazer&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In so many ways, Harris already is a trailblazer. Born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she was the first woman attorney general ever elected in California, on top of being the first African American and Asian American to hold that post. She then became the first vice president in US history in those same categories.</p>

<p>In a survey published in September 2023, the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank, found that for a majority of Americans, gender does not play a role in choosing a president.</p>

<p>Sixty per cent of respondents said that a female president would handle pressure as well as a man, while 27 per cent believed that she would do better.</p>

<p>"While female leadership -- whether as presidents, queens, prime ministers, and heads of state -- has become the norm in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, South America, and African nations, the United States has yet to experience this moment," said Sonia Gipson Rankin, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.</p>

<p>She noted that even though Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college and therefore the presidency to Trump in 2016, she won the popular vote.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategic discrimination&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Regina Bateson, a professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder, believes that voters' biases may not themselves be the issue.</p>

<p>"The problem is often not that voters are actually biased," Bateson said. "It's that party insiders and delegates and political donors worry that the voters will be biased."</p>

<p>That leads them to withhold support from a woman of colour, a phenomenon that Bateson calls "strategic discrimination," which usually manifests itself during the primaries when a candidate must demonstrate that he or she is able to rally many groups of voters.</p>

<p>Harris, however, took over from Biden after the 81-year-old leader withdrew from the race, thus sparing her "this process of trying to convince people that she's electable" during the primaries.</p>

<p>Flanked by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old white man, Harris now hopes to win the trust of all Americans, regardless of ethnicity or gender.</p>

<p>Some are already convinced such as "White dudes for Harris," a group that brought nearly 200,000 people together for a Zoom fundraiser for Harris in late July, raising more than $4 million.</p>

<p>Donald Trump didn't wait long to attack his Democratic rival on her background.</p>

<p>The billionaire charged that Harris "turned Black" only recently in order to win electoral support.</p>

<p>Harris, who had always spoken of her Black and Asian heritage with pride, called out Trump for his "divisiveness and disrespect."</p>

<p>The former president's running mate, J.D. Vance, caused an outcry recently when a 2021 video resurfaced in which he dismisses the Democratic Party as being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives... and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too."</p>

<p>Harris is married to Douglas Emhoff and helped in raising his two children from a previous marriage. She does not have any biological children of her own.</p>

<p>Vance's comments caused a backlash amplified by Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Glenn Close, and were widely considered a political misstep in a country where the fertility rate is historically low.</p>

<p>Vance has sought to walk back his remarks saying they were taken out of context.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, the UK government is planning to treat extreme misogyny as a form of terrorism, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/17/extreme-misogyny-treated-as-terrorism-government/">Telegraph </a>reported.</p>

<p>To tackle growing incidents of violence against women and girls, UK home secretary Yvette Cooper has ordered a review of the counter-terrorism strategy which will help identify gaps in current laws and also study emerging ideologies especially online misogynistic discourse.</p>

<p>This move will look at violence against women in the same way as far-right extremism.</p>

<p>Under the suggested legislation, it would be mandatory for school teachers to refer students they suspect of extreme misogyny to the government's counter-terror programme.</p>

<p>Anyone who is referred to the programme is assessed by local police to see if they show signs of radicalistaion and need to be deradicalised.</p>

<p>This comes after reports warned that misogynistic influencers like Andrew Tate are radicalising teenage boys online in the same way terrorist draw in their followers.</p>

<p>Last year, counter-extremism workers warned of a rise in the number of cases being referred to them by schools concerned about the his influence. The reports included incidents of verbal harassment of female teachers or other students which reflected the influencer's views.</p>

<p>The UK Home Ministry has several extremism categories marked as areas of "concern" and this includes a category for "incel" - an abbreviation of the term "involuntary celibate" - which refers to a misogynistic view that blames women for men's failure to get sexual opportunities.</p>

<p>UK officials now fear that this category does not capture other forms of extreme misogyny.</p>

<p>"For too long, governments have failed to address the rise in extremism, both online and on our streets, and we've seen the number of young people radicalised online grow. Hateful incitement of all kinds fractures and frays the very fabric of our communities and our democracy," Ms Cooper told the Telegraph.</p>

<p>Last month, UK's National Police Chiefs' Council published a report on violence against women and girls labelling it as a national emergency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Hamas official on Saturday dismissed optimistic talk by US President Joe Biden that a Gaza truce is nearer after negotiations in the Gulf emirate of Qatar.</p>

<p>"To say that we are getting close to a deal is an illusion," Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri told AFP. "We are not facing a deal or real negotiations, but rather the imposing of American diktats."</p>

<p>He was responding to Biden's comment Friday that "We are closer than we have ever been."</p>

<p>Biden spoke after two days of talks in Qatar where Washington tried to bridge differences between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas which have been at war for more than 10 months in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Previous optimism during months of on-off truce talks has proven unfounded.</p>

<p>But the stakes have risen significantly since the late July killings in quick succession of Fuad Shukr, a top operations chief of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Their deaths prompted promises of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah and fears of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Trying to avert a broader conflict, Western and Arab diplomats have been shuttling around the region to push for a Gaza deal which they say could help avert a wider conflagration.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed back to the region this weekend in a bid to help seal a deal.</p>

<p>Hamas officials have objected to "new conditions" from Israel in the latest proposal drawn up by Washington.</p>

<p>Israel's delegation expressed "cautious optimism" about the prospects for an agreement after returning from Doha, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Saturday.</p>

<p>"There is hope that the heavy pressure on Hamas from the United States and mediators will lead to the removal of their opposition to the American proposal, potentially allowing a breakthrough in the negotiations," it said.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy urged all parties to "engage positively and flexibly" in the negotiations.</p>

<p>"We underline the importance of avoiding any escalatory action in the region which would undermine the prospect for peace," they added.</p>

<p>"There is too much at stake."</p>

<h3><strong>Strikes in Lebanon, Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>As efforts towards a truce continued, so did the killing in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli air strike in the southern Nabatieh area killed 10 Syrians, including a woman and her two children.</p>

<p>The strike was among the deadliest in south Lebanon since the onset of near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah following the start of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it struck a Hezbollah weapons storage facility.</p>

<p>In Hamas-run Gaza, the civil defence authority said an Israeli air strike killed 15 people from a single Palestinian family. The deaths in Al-Zawaida helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death count to 40,074.</p>

<p>"We are in the morgue seeing indescribable scenes of limbs and severed heads and children who are dismembered," said Omar al-Dreemli, a relative.</p>

<p>Israel's military told AFP that overnight its forces had struck "terrorist infrastructure" in central Gaza from which rockets were being fired.</p>

<p>"Reports were received that as a result of the strike, civilians in an adjacent structure were killed. The incident is under review," it said.</p>

<p>The war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and healthcare infrastructure, leaving children vulnerable to preventable diseases.</p>

<p>The United Nations appealed Friday for seven-day pauses in the fighting so it could vaccinate children against polio, as the Palestinian health ministry reported Gaza's first polio case in 25 years.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bring them home'</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says 332 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza campaign since the ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees", the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are working to finalise details of a framework agreement initially outlined by Biden in May. He said Israel had proposed it.</p>

<p>Thousands rallied in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities on Saturday demanding a deal that would bring home the remaining Gaza hostages.</p>

<p>"We all know there's a real possibility for a deal," said Mor Korngold, hostage Tal Shoham's brother.</p>

<p>"These are crucial hours for my brother, for the hostages, for the soldiers, for those displaced from their homes, for the entire country."</p>

<p>In a joint statement after two days of talks in Qatar, the mediators said they would meet in Cairo "before the end of next week", hoping to seal an agreement.</p>

<h3><strong>Gazans on the move again</strong></h3>

<p>As truce talks took place, thousands of civilians were on the move again after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders ahead of imminent action in central-southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"During each round of negotiations, they exert pressure by forcing evacuations and committing massacres," said Issa Murad, a Palestinian displaced to Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>Over the past day, troops expanded operations around Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis including by "eliminating" Hamas who had fired munitions toward Nirim, just outside Gaza, Israel's military said Saturday.</p>

<p>Witnesses told AFP air strikes hit the Hamad residential towers in the city's northwest.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in the northern city of Jenin that Israel's military said targeted a "terrorist cell".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike in the occupied West Bank on Saturday that the Israeli military said targeted a "terrorist cell" in the Jenin area.</p>

<p>"Two bodies were transferred to Jenin public hospital after the occupiers (Israeli forces) bombed a car in the centre of the city," the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was carried out by an "Israeli drone".</p>

<p>The military said in a statement that it had carried out an "air strike on a terrorist cell in the Jenin area".</p>

<p>Video footage posted online showed a vehicle on fire in the middle of a street, while some images showed a crowd around a charred car, trying to open the doors.</p>

<p>"There are dead people in the car," shouts a man as a stretcher is brought by rescue workers.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, violence has flared in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967 and separated geographically from Gaza by Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Since October 7, at least 635 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers, according to an AFP count based on Palestinian official figures.</p>

<p>During the same period, at least 18 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks, according to Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

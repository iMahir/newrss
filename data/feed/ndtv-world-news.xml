       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As US Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to take the stage against former President Donald Trump in her White House bid in November, her secret weapon seems to be a high-powered lawyer with a surprising side gig - defending Google in a landmark antitrust trial that could reshape the tech giant's future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karen Dunn, a partner at the prestigious Paul, Weiss law firm, has been tapped by Harris to coach her for her campaign. Dunn had allegedly prepared Harris for her first debate of the 2024 US elections, against Trump. But while Dunn is busy prepping the VP for the debate, she's also leading Google's defense in a blockbuster case brought by the Joe Biden administration alleging the company illegally monopolized the online advertising market.</p>

<p>Dunn's dual roles have raised eyebrows among antitrust experts who worry her close ties to the Harris camp could undermine the government's aggressive pursuit of Google. They argue it's an "outrageous" conflict of interest for the Vice President to be taking advice from a lawyer representing a company her own administration is suing.</p>

<p>"It's clear that you can't serve both sides," said Matt Stoller of the American Economic Liberties Project to the New York Times. "If these were legal cases, she would be ethically barred from doing what she's doing," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dunn, who has prepped Democratic candidates for debates since 2008, delivered Google's opening statement in the high-stakes trial on Monday, September 9, two days prior to the most anticipated presidential debate ahead of the US polls, since Biden quit the presidential race. Hours later, on the very same day, Dunn rushed out of the Virginia courtroom to join Harris' team in Pittsburgh as they put the finishing touches on her debate prep.</p>

<p>The 48-year-old litigator is no stranger to the revolving door between Big Law and Democratic politics. She started as a legislative correspondent on Capitol Hill for Representative Nita Lowey of New York. She was next hired as the second employee on Hilary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign in 1999, with whom she worked during and after the September 11 terrorist attacks as well. She then briefly left politics to attend Yale Law School. But, by 2008, she was back to working on the presidential campaign with Clinton, and then later, with Barrack Obama.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a combination of tough love," said Hillary Clinton of Karen Dunn in an interview earlier this month. "She is someone who as a lawyer sweats the details, but she has an ability in her communications work to see the big picture, and that's really a rare quality," Clinton added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dunn's represented tech giants such as Apple and Uber and even helped prepare Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for a congressional hearing. In 2021, she won a landmark lawsuit against organizers of the 2017 Charlottesville far-right rally.</p>

<p>But Dunn's current juggling act may be her most high-profile yet. As she argues Google's case in court, her advice to Harris had an instrumental role in shaping the outcome of a debate that has been pivotal in the 2024 race. And with the Department Of Justice seeking a breakup of Google's ad business, the stakes couldn't be higher.</p>

<p>"One imagines her stature in Harris' world has only gone up after the debate - which could be concerning if she's ever negotiating a potential settlement with the Justice Department under Harris," said Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project.</p>

<p>The Republicans have already seized on the controversy, with a top Trump adviser blasting it as proof Harris will "never stand up to Big Tech." House Republicans are demanding answers from Attorney General Merrick Garland on how he's combating potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Neither Google nor the Harris campaign have commented on the issue so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of now, Dunn shows no signs of slowing down. As she told the New York Times in 2019, the key to a winning debate moment is engaging your opponent in a way that challenges them, and then creating a winning moment, preferably at the expense of someone else. With her dual roles, Dunn's on the verge of challenging the boundaries of what's acceptable in the world of high-stakes politics and la</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg recently made headlines after being labelled "Antisemite of the Week" by the Jewish watchdog group StopAntisemitism, following her arrest at an anti-Israel rally. The group criticized Thunberg for aligning with protesters who oppose Israel, accusing her of turning her activism into a platform for anti-Semitism, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/greta-thunberg-named-antisemite-of-the-week-by-jewish-advocacy-group/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She has sadly transformed her activism into a platform for vile Jew-hatred," the organization added.</p>

<p>Ms Thunberg, 21, was arrested on September 4 while demonstrating with Students Against the Occupation, who called on Copenhagen University to cut ties with Israel, including climate change programs. StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez condemned Thunberg, accusing her of prioritizing hatred for Israel over environmental activism, despite Israel's efforts in climate action.</p>

<p>"Sadly, Greta's hatred of the world's only Jewish nation eclipses her love of the environment. Despite Israel being a global leader in tackling climate disasters and rushing to aid in crises worldwide, Greta sides with their homicidal terrorist enemies," founder Liora Rez said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Her actions speak louder than her words. She claims to care about the future of humanity but Greta's hypocrisy is on full display as she's been active in championing Hamas leaders who openly call for genocide."</p>

<p>Thunberg, who had previously participated in other anti-Israel demonstrations, also faced backlash for holding a sign that some interpreted as using antisemitic imagery. Thunberg later removed the image and explained that the toy octopus in the photo was a communication tool used by autistic people, denying any antisemitic intent.</p>

<p>"The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people to communicate feelings," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China and Russia are concerned about the strengthening India-US relationship because it promotes inclusivity, peace, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, along with valuing diverse voices in society, a top US diplomat said Monday.</p>

<p>"Frankly, why do you think China and Russia are so concerned about this partnership? Because we bring a way of life to the rest of the world, that is about inclusivity, about peace, about the peaceful resolution of disputes, about the rule of law, and it's about hearing everyone's voice in a society," Richard Verma, the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources said at the prestigious Hudson Institute, in response to a question, after he delivered remarks on India-US relationship.</p>

<p>Mr Verma said the relationship between India and US is "a very different mode" than how some of the adversaries of the latter operate.</p>

<p>The diplomat noted that this uniqueness is why President Joe Biden has described the relationship between both countries as the "defining relationship of this century".</p>

<p>He recalled that nearly 20 years ago, when he stood with then-Senator Biden and staff director Tony Blinken in the Senate, Biden had remarked that if the US and India were the closest friends and partners by 2020, the world would be a safer place.</p>

<p>"Not just because we have two big militaries, not just because we have two big economies, but because we actually stand for something that matters to people in their daily lives across the world,” Mr Verma said.</p>

<p>In response to a question on QUAD, Mr Verma said it aims to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity.</p>

<p>"I look at what the Quad has, the kinds of statements and pronouncements it's made on technology, for example …technology for good, not to harass, not to surveil, not to misinform, laying out a set of key principles, going even further on some of our work on quantum computing and cybersecurity,” he said.</p>

<p>"When I look at what the Quad has said and done on energy transition, trade, rule-based order, I don't think it has to take on a military character. Indians are not supportive of that. Frankly, I don't think we need that. I think there are other venues to deal with core military issues,” he said.</p>

<p>"I think this is about like-minded countries, two of which are treaty allies of the United States, coming together in a different form, in a different architecture, bringing in the most populous country in the Indo-Pacific to actually chart some new territory that we hadn't charted before," Verma said.</p>

<p>"I think it has positive impact to security without being a treaty-based security organisation. There's great promise and excitement in the QUAD. I think this weekend's meeting will be quite significant. It'll be historic. QUAD will continue to just build in many ways,” said the top American diplomat.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden will host the fourth in-person Quad leaders summit at his Delaware residence next week, in a rare gesture for his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan, a presidential spokesperson announced Thursday.</p>

<p>India, which was scheduled to host QUAD this year, would host the summit next year. QUAD leadership summit is an initiative of Biden and is one of the key foreign policy legacies for the outgoing American president.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Infections of drug-resistant superbugs are projected to kill nearly 40 million people over the next 25 years, a global analysis predicted on Monday, as the researchers called for action to avoid this grim scenario.</p>

<p>Superbugs -- strains of bacteria or pathogens that have become resistant to antibiotics, making them much harder to treat -- have been recognised as a rising threat to global health.</p>

<p>The analysis has been billed as the first research to track the global impact of superbugs over time, and estimate what could happen next.</p>

<p>More than a million people died from the superbugs -- also called antimicrobial resistance (AMR) -- a year across the world between 1990 and 2021, according to the study in The Lancet journal.</p>

<p>Deaths among children under five from superbugs actually fell by more than 50 percent over the last three decades, the study said, due to improving measures to prevent and control infections for infants.</p>

<p>However when children now catch superbugs, the infections are much harder to treat.</p>

<p>And deaths of over-70s have surged by more than 80 percent over the same period, as an ageing population became more vulnerable to infection.</p>

<p>Deaths from infections of MRSA, a type of staph bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics, doubled to 130,000 in 2021 from three decades earlier, the study said.</p>

<h3><strong>'This threat is growing'</strong></h3>

<p>The researchers used modelling to estimate that -- based on current trends -- the number of direct deaths from AMR would rise by 67 percent to reach nearly two million a year by 2050.</p>

<p>It will also play a role in a further 8.2 million annual deaths, a jump of nearly 75 percent, according to the modelling.</p>

<p>Under this scenario, AMR will have directly killed 39 million people over the next quarter century, and contributed to a total of 169 million deaths, it added.</p>

<p>But less dire scenarios are also possible.</p>

<p>If the world works to improve care for severe infections and access to antimicrobial drugs, it could save the lives of 92 million people by 2050, the modelling suggested.</p>

<p>"These findings highlight that AMR has been a significant global health threat for decades and that this threat is growing," study co-author Mohsen Naghavi of the US-based Institute of Health Metrics said in a statement.</p>

<p>The researchers looked at 22 pathogens, 84 combinations of drugs and pathogens, and 11 infectious syndromes such as meningitis. The study involved data from 520 million individual records across 204 countries and territories.</p>

<p>It was released ahead of a high-level AMR meeting at the United Nations scheduled for September 26.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a natural phenomenon, but the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and plants has made the problem worse.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an expansion of the country's war goals on Tuesday to include the return of northern residents who fled cross-border fire traded with Hamas ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The political-security cabinet updated the goals of the war this evening, so that they include the following section: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes," Netanyahu's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israeli forces and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group have exchanged near-daily strikes since Hamas's October 7 attack sparked war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says the campaign is in support of its Palestinian ally.</p>

<p>Hezbollah officials have said the group would stand down if a Gaza ceasefire was reached, while Israel insists it cannot allow militants to remain in the border area in Lebanon's south.</p>

<p>The violence has killed hundreds of mostly fighters in Lebanon, and dozens of civilians and soldiers on the Israeli side.</p>

<p>The fighting has also forced tens of thousands of people on both sides to flee their homes.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told a visiting US envoy that "military action" was the "only way left to ensure the return of Israel's northern communities to their homes".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reproductive rights groups erupted in outrage Monday after ProPublica revealed that a Georgia woman died from delayed medical care caused by the US state's restrictive abortion law.</p>

<p>Amber Nicole Thurman, 28, developed a rare complication from abortion pills and died during emergency surgery in August 2022, with an official state committee blaming the fatal outcome on a "preventable" lag in performing a critical procedure.</p>

<p>Georgia had just passed a law that made performing dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) a felony offense with medical exceptions that doctors had warned were vague and difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>"Amber would be alive right now if it wasn't for Donald Trump and Brian Kemp's abortion ban," said Mini Timmara, president of Reproductive Freedom for All. "They have blood on their hands."</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn national abortion rights unleashed a wave of bans and restrictions in 22 states, thrusting reproductive rights to the forefront of the upcoming presidential election.</p>

<p>ProPublica said this was the first abortion-related death officially deemed "preventable" and plans to publish details of a second case soon.</p>

<p>These official reviews are not made public, but ProPublica obtained copies of the reports.</p>

<p>Thurman, an otherwise healthy medical assistant and mother of a six-year-old boy, made the decision to terminate a twin pregnancy to preserve her newfound stability, her best friend Ricaria Baker told ProPublica.</p>

<p>She and her son had recently moved to a new apartment complex and she planned to enroll in nursing school. She wanted a surgical abortion, but Georgia's six-week abortion ban forced her to seek care at a clinic in North Carolina.</p>

<p>On the day of the procedure, the hours-long drive was hampered by traffic, and Thurman missed her 15-minute appointment window.</p>

<p>The clinic offered a medication abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol. While overwhelmingly safe, rare complications can occur.</p>

<p>Thurman's condition worsened over several days, turning into heavy bleeding and vomiting blood. She was taken to Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge.</p>

<p>Doctors found she had not expelled all the fetal tissue from her body and she was diagnosed with "acute severe sepsis."</p>

<p>But despite her rapidly deteriorating health, the hospital delayed Thurman's dilation and curettage procedure for 17 hours.</p>

<p>By the time they operated, the situation was so dire it required open abdominal surgery. The doctor performed the operation and found a hysterectomy was also required -- but during the procedure, Thurman's heart stopped.</p>

<p>Her mother recalled her last words: "Promise me you'll take care of my son."</p>

<p>The state committee found there was a "good chance" that an earlier procedure could have saved Thurman's life.</p>

<p>"Life of the mother" exceptions have widely proven inadequate, forcing women to cross state lines in desperate bids for lifesaving care.</p>

<p>"She died in a hospital, surrounded by medical providers who could have saved her life," feminist author Jessica Valenti wrote on X. "This is what abortion bans do."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Egypt on Tuesday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire and release of hostages with Egyptian officials, the State Department said.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>Washington and mediators Qatar and Egypt have for months sought to reach a deal between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to halt the war and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>The two biggest obstacles now are Israel's demand to keep its forces in the Philadelphi corridor to maintain a buffer between Gaza and Egypt, and the specifics of an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTE</strong></p>

<p>Blinken will discuss efforts to reach a deal "that secures the release of all hostages, alleviates the suffering of the Palestinian people, and helps establish broader regional security," the State Department said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered last Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Guterres lashed out at Israel's handling of its war in the devastated Palestinian territory, now almost in its second year, as the UN prepares to host world leaders starting next week.</p>

<p>"It is unimaginable, the level of suffering in Gaza, the level of deaths and destruction have no parallel in everything I've witnessed since (becoming) secretary-general," said Guterres, who has led the embattled international organization since 2017.</p>

<p>"We all condemn the terror attacks made by Hamas, as well as the taking of the hostages, that is an absolute violation of international humanitarian law," he said.</p>

<p>"But the truth is that nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that is what we are witnessing in a dramatic way in Gaza," he added, decrying the widespread carnage and hunger blighting Gaza.</p>

<p>On October 7, Hamas fighters infiltrated from Gaza into southern Israel, unleashing unprecedented violence which killed 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP toll including hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, in power in Gaza since 2007, and its land and air offensive has claimed 41,226 lives according to the health ministry of the Hamas government.</p>

<p>More than 200 humanitarian workers, mostly UN staff, have also been killed.</p>

<p>"Accountability should be a must" for all civilian deaths, Guterres said acknowledging "serious violations" had been perpetrated by both Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Against that backdrop the UN leader has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire, but talks overseen by the United States, Egypt and Qatar remain deadlocked, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of resisting a deal.</p>

<p>"They are endless," Guterres said of the talks, saying it would be "very difficult" to reach a compromise but that he remained hopeful.</p>

<p>With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refusing to return his calls since October, Guterres is not counting on a breakthrough during the General Assembly's high-level week from Sunday when he would typically receive all visiting heads of state and government.</p>

<p>"As far as I understand, it was already said publicly that it is not his intention to ask for any meeting with me. So of course, the meeting will very probably not take place," Guterres said, brushing off the apparent snub.</p>

<p>- 'Very strange' -</p>

<p>"What matters is not the question of a phone call or no phone call, a meeting or no meeting -- what matters is what happens on the ground. What matters is the suffering of people.</p>

<p>"What matters is the constant denial of the two-state solution and the undermining of that two-state solution by the different actions that are taking place on the grounds.</p>

<p>"With grabbing of land, with evictions, with the new settlements being built -- all illegally and in the context of an occupation that now, according to the International Court of Justice's opinion, is in itself also illegal."</p>

<p>He also said a proposed surveillance mission he backed to oversee any future ceasefire looked "improbable", with all sides unlikely to sign up.</p>

<p>UN missions require the agreement of the host countries.</p>

<p>It was partly for this reason that almost a year ago, the Security Council mandated a multinational mission, led by Kenya, not the UN, to help police in gang-plagued Haiti where blue helmets are reviled.</p>

<p>But with only a few hundred police officers deployed and the mission lacking funds, Washington has raised the specter of transforming it into a UN mission -- something that the Security Council could only do at Haiti's request.</p>

<p>"I find it very strange that it's so difficult to fund a relatively small police operation in Haiti," he said.</p>

<p>"I find it absolutely unacceptable."</p>

<p>Responding to accusations the UN is powerless to curb conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere, he blamed member states -- particularly the Security Council and its 15 members -- for the decisions taken or not taken.</p>

<p>The Security Council as well as international financial institutions are "outdated, are dysfunctional and are unfair," he said.</p>

<p>"We have been trying to solve the wars, the problem is that we have not the power, sometimes we don't even have the resources, to be able to do so."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Secret Service said on Monday it was aware of a post by billionaire Elon Musk's on the X social media platform musing about a lack of assassination attempts on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk, who owns the platform, formerly known as Twitter, put up the post after a man suspected of planning to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his golf course in West Palm Beach was arrested on Sunday.</p>

<p>A Trump supporter and the CEO of Tesla, Musk wrote on Sunday: "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala," a post he ended with an emoji of a face with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>He was quickly criticized by X users from the left and right, who said they were concerned his words to his nearly 200 million X followers could incite violence against Biden and Harris.</p>

<p>Musk deleted the post but not before the Secret Service, tasked with protecting current and former presidents, vice presidents and other notable officials, took notice.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence," a spokesperson told Reuters in an email. "We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees."</p>

<p>The spokesperson declined to specify whether the agency had reached out to Musk, who seemed to suggest in follow-up posts that he had been making a joke.</p>

<p>"Well, one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X," he wrote. "Turns out that jokes are WAY less funny if people don't know the context and the delivery is plain text."</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat running against the Republican Trump in the 2024 election, and Biden both issued statements on Sunday night expressing relief that Trump had not been harmed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards top commander Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Asif Merchant, 46, entered his plea to one count of attempting to commit terrorism across national boundaries and one count of murder for hire at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The judge ordered that Merchant be detained pending trial.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors say Merchant spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States to recruit people for the plot.</p>

<p>Merchant told a confidential informant he also planned to steal documents from one target and organize protests in the United States, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The defendant named Donald Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Court papers do not name the alleged targets, and no attacks were made. As president, Trump had in 2020 approved the drone strike on Soleimani.</p>

<p>There are no suggestions that Merchant was tied to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course on Sunday, or a separate shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>Merchant wore an olive-colored prison T-shirt on top of an orange undershirt to his hearing, and sported a salt-and-pepper beard.</p>

<p>He is being held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, following his July 15 arrest in Texas.</p>

<p>Defense lawyer Avraham Moskowitz objected at the hearing to the jail conditions.</p>

<p>He said Merchant was being held in isolation, had been allowed out for exercise only once in two months, and had lost 15 to 20 pounds (6.8 to 9.1 kg) because jail officials would not serve a halal diet appropriate for a Shi'ite Muslim.</p>

<p>"It is literally torture," Moskowitz said.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Sara Winik said she would speak with the Bureau of Prisons to ensure Merchant received an adequate diet.</p>

<p>The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations said in August that the "modus operandi" described in Merchant's court papers ran contrary to Tehran's policy of "legally prosecuting the murder of General Soleimani."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian vowed Monday to ensure the morality police will no longer "bother" women, in remarks to the media on the second anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death in custody.</p>

<p>Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, died in police custody on September 16, 2022, days after the morality police arrested her in Tehran for an alleged breach of the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.</p>

<p>Her death triggered months-long protests across the country, with hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, killed in the unrest. Thousands of demonstrators were arrested.</p>

<p>"The morality police were not supposed to confront (women). I will follow up so they don't bother" them, Pezeshkian said during his first press conference since he took office in July.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian replaced the ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May.</p>

<p>During his election campaign, he had vowed to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory hijab headscarf as well as easing long-standing internet restrictions.</p>

<p>Iran has over the years tightly controlled internet use, restricting popular social media platforms such as Facebook and X.</p>

<p>Harsher curbs were enforced following 2019 protests against fuel price hikes and during the wave of demonstrations triggered by Amini's death.</p>

<p>On Monday, Pezeshkian said his government was working to ease restrictions online, especially on social media.</p>

<p><strong>Relations with the West</strong></p>

<p>At Monday's press conference, Pezeshkian briefly touched on other topics including Iran's fraught relations with the United States and the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

<p>"We do not want to fight with America if it respects our rights," he said.</p>

<p>"It is not us who are hostile (to the Americans). We have not built military bases around their country."</p>

<p>Iran and the United States have had no diplomatic relations since 1980, the year after the Islamic Revolution that toppled its Western-backed Shah Mohammed Reza.</p>

<p>A landmark 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers granted Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.</p>

<p>But the deal quickly collapsed and tensions reignited following the United States' unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions on Iran the following year.</p>

<p>Iran has since suspended its compliance with caps on nuclear activities.</p>

<p>"We are not seeking nuclear weapons; we have respected the framework of the nuclear agreement," said Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>"They (the United States) broke the agreement and forced us to do something."</p>

<p>Pezeshkian also spoke about newly imposed sanctions.</p>

<p>Last week, Britain, France and Germany announced punitive measures targeting Iranian air transport, accusing it of delivering ballistic missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Iran has repeatedly denied sending any weapons to Russia for use in the war, and vowed to respond to the latest in a long string of Western sanctions on Tehran including over its nuclear activities.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said Iran "has not given" Russia any weapons.</p>

<p>"It is possible that Iran and Russia had military cooperation in the past... because there was no ban at the time," he said.</p>

<p>"What I can say with certainty is that since our arrival, we have not given them anything so that (the West) boycotts us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Consulate General of India in New York has strongly condemned the vandalism of a temple in New York, saying it has raised the matter with the US law enforcement authorities for prompt action against perpetrators of the "heinous act".</p>

<p>"The vandalism of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Melville, New York, is unacceptable," the Indian Consulate said in a post on X Monday.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The vandalism of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Melville, New York, is unacceptable ; The Consulate <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiainNewYork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IndiainNewYork</a> is in touch with the community and has raised the matter with U.S. law enforcement authorities for prompt action against the perpetrators of this heinous act.…</p>
— India in New York (@IndiainNewYork) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiainNewYork/status/1835733692162965877?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It added that the Consulate "is in touch with the community and has raised the matter with the US law enforcement authorities for prompt action against the perpetrators of this heinous act".</p>

<p>Melville is located in Suffolk County on Long Island and is about 28 kilometres from the 16000-seater Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address a mega community event on September 22.</p>

<p>According to footage shared online, expletives have been sprayed on the road and the signage outside the temple. The temple is expected to hold a prayer meeting later in the afternoon following the incident.</p>

<p>The Hindu American Foundation said in a post on X that the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security "must investigate" the attack on the temple "after recent threats to Hindu institutions as a large Indian community gathering is planned in nearby Nassau County this weekend".</p>

<p>"It is hard to comprehend the absolute cowardice of those who would attack a Hindu temple to air hatred for an elected leader. This attack, following recent threats at Hindu and Indian institutions, must be seen in the context of that threat scenario," executive director of the Hindu American Foundation Suhag Shukla said in a post on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An organization of Taylor Swift fans said Monday they raised more than $40,000 for the Kamala Harris campaign following Donald Trump's post that he hates the pop megastar.</p>

<p>The Republican hopeful fired a Sunday morning missive on Truth Social saying "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!", which the "Swifties for Kamala" organization capitalized on to raise money for his Democratic rival.</p>

<p>"As soon as we saw the post, we knew this was an opportunity. Our team was ready to go with lyric response ideas and ways to tie in our calls to donate and volunteer," said Carly Long, a member of the group's communications team, in a statement.</p>

<p>"We use the memes to catch people's attention, and then tell them how to turn that emotion into action. Taylor Swifties know that haters gonna hate, but we also know we can do more than just shake, shake, shake."</p>

<p>The superfans stumping for Kamala Harris are not formally affiliated with the artist who unites them.</p>

<p>They say they've now raised more than $207,000 since kicking off their fundraising and outreach efforts less than two months ago.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago they held an inaugural fundraising call that was joined by 27,000 viewers, and featured appearances from stars like Carole King along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Ed Markey.</p>

<p>Since then Taylor Swift herself has endorsed Harris and her running mate Tim Walz over Donald Trump, calling the Democrat and current vice president a "steady-handed, gifted leader."</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Taylor Swift posted in the minutes following the Harris-Trump debate last week.</p>

<p>In addition to fundraising and phone banking, the Swifties For Kamala outfit says they are planning additional outreach efforts particularly in swing states and at remaining dates of the blockbuster Eras Tour, which is currently on break.</p>

<p>It's scheduled to pick back up in Miami on October 18.</p>

<p>Irene Kim, a Swifties For Kamala cofounder, said in a statement that the group is "proof of the power Swifties have."</p>

<p>"We're building off our existing fandom culture to make voting and politics accessible."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Monday blamed his election rival Kamala Harris and US President Joe Biden after he was targeted in a second apparent assassination attempt, saying their "rhetoric" about him endangering democracy is to blame.</p>

<p>Trump's rapid politicization of Sunday's incident, in which a man allegedly planned to fire on the Republican while he played golf in Florida, guaranteed that tensions ahead of the presidential election in seven weeks would continue to boil.</p>

<p>Both Biden and Harris have denounced the apparent assassination bid.</p>

<p>The suspect, identified by police as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, was arrested soon after being spotted while hiding with an assault-style rifle at the edge of Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach. US Secret Service agents opened fire, not hitting him, and he fled before surrendering without a struggle.</p>

<p>On Monday, Routh appeared in court where he was informed he was being charged with illegal firearms possession. He appeared calm and did not speak, other than to say "yes" a few times to questions from the judge.</p>

<p>The FBI announced that it is also probing "what appears to be an attempted assassination."</p>

<p>This follows an attempt targeting Trump two months ago at a rally in Pennsylvania. The former president was grazed by a bullet in that attack, which also saw a supporter in the crowd killed before the lone gunman was shot dead by return fire.</p>

<p>Trump -- who was not hurt in Sunday's event -- told Fox News Digital that rhetoric from Biden and Harris "is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country."</p>

<p>Trump, 78, referred to frequent comments that he poses a "threat to democracy."</p>

<p>Biden and Harris have described Trump as a danger over his refusal to concede defeat to Biden in 2020 and his campaign to classify the mob of his supporters that stormed Congress in 2021 as political dissidents.</p>

<p>Trump -- whose main election message against Harris is built on dark warnings about immigrant "invasion" and claims that the United States is a "failing nation" that only he can save -- said his opponents "use highly inflammatory language."</p>

<p>"I can use it too -- far better than they can -- but I don't," he added.</p>

<p><strong>Secret Service scrutiny</strong></p>

<p>At the White House earlier Monday, Biden had told reporters "thank God the president is OK."</p>

<p>But the Secret Service "needs more help," he said, "and I think Congress should respond to their needs."</p>

<p>The protective service came under severe criticism after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which the shooter was able to climb onto a nearby roof overlooking the rally.</p>

<p>As a major party candidate and former president, Trump has a sizeable security detail but smaller than that of a sitting president. This meant the bodyguards could not cordon off the entire golf course, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said, explaining how the suspect was able to get to within a few hundred yards of Trump before being intercepted.</p>

<p>The would-be attacker has a lengthy criminal record, according to US media, and was obsessed with the Ukrainian cause. He traveled to Ukraine, claiming he wanted to volunteer and was recruiting foreign fighters to help repel Russia's invasion, giving numerous media interviews, including to AFP in 2022.</p>

<p>However, there is no evidence that he ever fought there or was able to join the Ukrainian military. His social media presence indicates a wide variety of political affiliations at home.</p>

<p><strong>Fear of wider violence</strong></p>

<p>The intensity of threats is rising as the presidential race enters its final weeks and polls continue to indicate a tight finish on November 5.</p>

<p>The latest twist follows days of tension in the Ohio town of Springfield as a result of conspiracy theories stoked by Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance about the local Haitian immigrant community.</p>

<p>Schools and other public institutions have been repeatedly shut down there since Thursday after receiving threats.</p>

<p>There are also broader worries that Trump will again refuse to concede if he loses to Harris, stoking a repeat of the violence on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed Congress to try and stop certification of Biden's victory two months earlier.</p>

<p>Trump used Sunday's incident to appeal for campaign funds, posting on social media Monday: "FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!!!!!" and "Donate Today!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ex-BBC anchor Huw Edwards, once one of the most trusted and recognisable faces on British TV, on Monday avoided jail at his sentencing over indecent pictures of children, capping a stunning fall from grace.</p>

<p>The 63-year-old presenter was instead handed a six-month sentence, suspended for two years, meaning he will not serve any time in prison if he does not reoffend.</p>

<p>Edwards guided Britons through some of their country's most seismic events over the past two decades, including the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022.</p>

<p>His calm delivery -- mixed with the public broadcaster's reputation for journalistic impartiality -- made him a reassuring presence for millions.</p>

<p>But his reputation and career now lie in tatters after he pleaded guilty in July to three charges of making indecent images of children between December 2020 and August 2021.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer -- a former chief state prosecutor -- said he was "shocked and appalled" by the case.</p>

<p>Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring said at the sentencing that, if jailed, Edwards would have been at risk of "considerable harm" from others, and of suicide, adding that he had also shown remorse.</p>

<p>Edwards showed little emotion as was sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London, sitting in the dock with his hands clasped as if in prayer.</p>

<p>He left without speaking to the assembled media, which packed out the courtroom.</p>

<p>The former anchor admitted receiving 41 indecent images of children over WhatsApp sent by a 25-year-old convicted paedophile, including seven of the most serious type.</p>

<p>Most children were aged 13 to 15 and one was between seven and nine.</p>

<p>But the magistrate said that while the offences were extremely serious there was no need for an immediate custodial sentence.</p>

<p>He ordered that he also attend a sex offenders' treatment programme for 40 days as well as 25 days of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Philip Evans told the court Edwards accepted the "repugnant nature of the images" and was "profoundly sorry" for having "betrayed so many people".</p>

<p>Edwards had faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.</p>

<p>He was first arrested in November last year and charged in June, but the case was only revealed publicly in late July, just days before his court appearance.</p>

<p>The Welsh presenter resigned from the BBC in April on "medical advice" after 40 years with the broadcaster.</p>

<p>The taxpayer-funded BBC, whose brand is built on public trust, has admitted being made aware by police of the arrest and has been criticised for continuing to pay Edwards a salary for six months afterwards.</p>

<p>"We are appalled by his crimes," a spokesperson said after the sentencing. "He has betrayed not just the BBC, but audiences who put their trust in him."</p>

<p><strong>'Disrepute'</strong></p>

<p>The BBC has been rocked in recent years by scandals that saw some big names revealed as serial sex offenders, amid reports of a culture of covering up.</p>

<p>Most notoriously, presenter Jimmy Savile was found to have abused hundreds of young girls over decades, with his crimes only coming to light after his death in 2011.</p>

<p>Edwards was made anchor of the BBC's flagship 10:00 pm news bulletin in 2003.</p>

<p>As well as the funeral of the late queen, Edwards narrated the wedding of heir to the throne Prince William to Kate Middleton and helmed UK general election coverage.</p>

<p>But the father-of-five's professional life began to unravel in July 2023 when he was suspended by the BBC following allegations in a tabloid newspaper that he paid a young man for explicit images.</p>

<p>Edwards did not comment on the allegations, but his wife released a statement saying her husband was "suffering from serious mental health issues" and receiving "in-patient hospital care".</p>

<p>The police's criminal investigation into Edwards started after a phone seized by officers as part of an unrelated probe revealed his participation in a WhatsApp conversation.</p>

<p>The BBC Board has said that Edwards brought the corporation into "disrepute" and that it has asked him to return his salary from the time he was arrested -- a sum of £200,000 (237,000 euros).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United Nations rights experts warned Monday that Israel risked becoming an international "pariah" over its "genocide" in Gaza, suggesting that the country's UN membership should be called into question.</p>

<p>Several independent UN experts decried what they said was Israel's escalating violence and rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank, its disregard for international court rulings and verbal attacks on the UN itself.</p>

<p>The rapporteurs, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the UN, also slammed Western countries' "double standards" and insisted Israel needed to face consequences for its actions.</p>

<p>"I think that it is unavoidable for Israel to become a pariah in the face of its continuous, relentless vilifying assault on the United Nations, (and) Palestinians," said Francesca Albanese, the UN's special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p>

<p>Albanese, who has repeatedly accused Israel of committing "genocide" in Gaza and who has faced harsh criticism and calls for her dismissal from Israel, asked if the country deserved "to continue to go unpunished for its relentless attacks" on the UN.</p>

<p>"Should there be a consideration of its membership as part of this organisation, which Israel seems to have zero respect for?" she rhetorically asked a Geneva press conference, speaking via video link from Tunis.</p>

<p><strong>'Double standards'</strong></p>

<p>George Katrougalos, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion of democratic and equitable international order, demanded that Israel be held to the same standards as all countries, and condemned its repeated attacks on critical UN officials or agencies.</p>

<p>"We cannot anymore stand this kind of double standards and hypocrisy," he told reporters.</p>

<p>"I trust that the progressive and democratic citizens of Israel would not let their country become a pariah like South Africa had become during the times of apartheid."</p>

<p>Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, meanwhile warned that Israel and its allies blatant disregard for findings by international courts, the Security Council and other UN bodies in connection with the conflict was undermining the organisation as a whole.</p>

<p>"We are blowing up the United Nations if we don't react," he warned.</p>

<p>Israel, which flatly rejects accusations that its offensive in Gaza amounts to a "genocide", responded Monday to Albanese's comments especially, charging that she was "abusing her inherently discriminatory UN mandate to spread her hate-filled political agenda, anti-Semitism and disinformation".</p>

<p>"Her attitude, including defending and justifying Hamas' actions, is a constant stain on the United Nations," the Israeli mission in Geneva said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>'Abyss'</strong></p>

<p>The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas' October 7 attack inside Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Gaza operatives also seized 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,226 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Albanese lamented that in the face of "unimaginable" suffering in Gaza, the world -- first and foremost the Western countries -- "continues to remain silent".</p>

<p>Arrojo-Agudo charged that the deprivation of water in the besieged Palestinian territory was "clearly employed as a weapon".</p>

<p>He said Gaza's population currently accesses on average just 4.7 litres of water per person per day, compared to more than 100 litres typically considered sufficient to cover daily needs.</p>

<p>Speaking before the UN rights council Monday, an Israeli representative rejected that allegation, charging that Hamas had "completely mismanaged water in Gaza and is responsible for the irreversible damage to 95 percent of natural water resources".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man suspected of plotting to assassinate former US president Donald Trump was charged with federal gun crimes on Monday.</p>

<p>Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number at his initial court appearance.</p>

<p>Routh, who was arrested on Sunday after an alleged abortive bid to shoot the Republican presidential candidate at his West Palm Beach golf course, is expected to face further charges at a later date.</p>

<p>Routh appeared calm during the brief court hearing before Magistrate Judge Ryon McCabe of the Southern District of Florida, answering "yes" to several questions.</p>

<p>A detention hearing was scheduled for September 23 and an arraignment on further potential charges was set for September 30.</p>

<p>Routh was arrested on Sunday after a Secret Service agent on the former president's security detail saw what appeared to be the barrel of a rifle pointing out of a tree line on the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Course, according to a criminal complaint filed by an FBI special agent.</p>

<p>"The Agent fired his/her service weapon in the direction of the rifle," the complaint said.</p>

<p>Trump, who was slightly wounded in a July 13 assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, was several hundred yards away when the golf course shooting occurred and was unharmed.</p>

<p>A man later identified as Routh was seen by a witness fleeing the area in a Nissan sport utility vehicle at high speed, the complaint said.</p>

<p>Routh was arrested by local police about 45 minutes later on I-95, a major north-south highway, and replied in the "affirmative" when asked if he knew why he was being stopped, it said.</p>

<p>Video footage of the arrest showed Routh, who was wearing sunglasses and dressed in a peach-colored shirt, being taken into custody by the roadside without incident by heavily armed police officers.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, a "loaded SKS-style, 7.62x39 caliber rifle with a scope," a digital camera, a backpack and a black plastic bag containing food were recovered from the tree line.</p>

<p><strong>Criminal convictions</strong></p>

<p>Routh appears to have spent nearly 12 hours on the perimeter of the Trump golf course.</p>

<p>"Routh's mobile phone was located in the vicinity of the area along the tree line... from approximately 1:59 am until approximately 1:31 pm on September 15," the complaint said.</p>

<p>Routh is reported to be a self-employed builder based in Hawaii, with an arrest record spanning decades.</p>

<p>He regularly posted about politics and current events on social media, including criticism of Trump, according to US media.</p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint, he was convicted in North Carolina in December 2002 of "possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction."</p>

<p>He was convicted in 2010 in the same state of multiple counts of possession of stolen goods, it said.</p>

<p>Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number carries a maximum five-year sentence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

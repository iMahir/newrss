       <description><![CDATA[Speaking to broadcasters at the G20 in Brazil, Keir Starmer refused to be drawn "because the only winner, if we were to do that, is Putin".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday said he would not "get into operational details" after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles against Russia.</p>

<p>Speaking to broadcasters at the G20 in Brazil, Starmer refused to be drawn "because the only winner, if we were to do that, is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin".</p>

<p>Kyiv has long sought authorisation from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, to hit military installations inside Russia as its troops face growing pressure.</p>

<p>A US official said Washington's major policy shift on the missiles was in response to Russia's deployment of thousands of North Korean troops in its war effort.</p>

<p>Britain, which has provided Ukraine with Storm Shadow long-range missiles, has consistently pushed to ease restrictions on Kyiv's use of the weapons.</p>

<p>Putin had previously warned that letting Ukraine use long-range weapons would mean NATO was "at war" with Moscow.</p>

<p>In parliament in London, lawmaker Roger Gale asked if Britain planned to "align with the United States" in granting Kyiv permission to use the UK-supplied missiles "as it sees fit in its own defence".</p>

<p>Junior defence minister Maria Eagle said the government intended to "align with our allies" on how Ukraine "can make use of the capabilities that's been offered" by its backers.</p>

<p>Starmer added: "I've been really clear for a long time now we need to double down.</p>

<p>"We need to make sure Ukraine has what is necessary for as long as necessary, because we cannot allow Putin to win this war," he said.</p>

<p>Asked if he had spoken to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the G20, he said: "I haven't spoken to Russia and I've got no plans to do so."</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy, speaking to reporters after a UN Security Council meeting in New York, also refused to discuss the use of British missiles, because it "risks operational security".</p>

<p>Asked how concerned he was about the implications of Donald Trump's presidency on the war in Ukraine, he said: "One president at a time."</p>

<p>"We're dealing with President (Joe) Biden and we are committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“All we have to have is just a human form to be a victim.” This statement from attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specialises in online abuse and sex crimes, captures the heightened risks posed by deepfake pornography in the era of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The alarming rise of AI-generated deepfake pornography poses a massive threat to anyone, whether or not they've shared explicit images online. From high-profile individuals to everyday people, including minors, the psychological toll on victims is immense.</p>

<p><strong>The technology behind deepfakes</strong></p>

<p>Unlike revenge porn, which involves the non-consensual sharing of actual images, deepfake technology allows perpetrators to create entirely fabricated content by superimposing someone's face onto explicit photos or manipulating existing images to appear compromising. Even those who have never taken private photos can fall prey to this technology.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/tech/ai-deepfake-porn-advice-terms-of-service-wellness/index.html">CNN</a>, high-profile cases in the past have included celebrities like Taylor Swift and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But young individuals are also finding themselves targeted.</p>

<p><strong>Protect yourself: Preserve evidence</strong></p>

<p>For those who discover their image has been weaponised this way, the immediate instinct is often to try to get it removed. But Goldberg stresses the importance of first preserving evidence by taking screenshots. “The knee-jerk reaction is to get this off the internet as soon as possible. But if you want to be able to have the option of reporting it criminally, you need the evidence,” Goldberg was quoted as saying by CNN.</p>

<p>After documenting the content, victims can use tools provided by tech companies such as Google, Meta and Snapchat to request the removal of explicit images. Organisations like StopNCII.org and Take It Down also assist in facilitating the removal of harmful content across multiple platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Legal progress</strong></p>

<p>The fight against deepfake pornography has drawn rare bipartisan attention. In August 2024, US senators called on major tech companies like X (formerly Twitter) and Discord to participate in programmes aimed at curbing nonconsensual explicit content. A hearing on Capitol Hill featured testimonies from teenagers and parents affected by AI-generated pornography. Following this, a bill was introduced in the US to criminalise the publication of deepfake pornography. The proposed legislation would also require social media platforms to remove such content upon notification from victims.</p>

<p>Goldberg emphasises that while victims can take steps to respond, the onus is also on society to act responsibly. “My proactive advice is really to the would-be offenders which is just, like, don't be a total scum of the earth and try to steal a person's image and use it for humiliation. There's not much that victims can do to prevent this. We can never be fully safe in a digital society, but it's kind of up to one another to not be total a**holes,” Goldberg told CNN.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US aviation giant Boeing sent out its first redundancy notifications on Monday as part of a previously announced plan to cut 10 percent of its global workforce.</p>

<p>Boeing intends to cut almost 2,200 jobs in the US state of Washington, which is home to many of its oldest factories, according to a statement made public on Monday.</p>

<p>Companies in the United States are required by law to submit a "WARN" notice (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) to local authorities sixty days before any layoffs.</p>

<p>In its notice, Boeing said it expects to start laying people off permanently starting December 20. 2,199 people will be affected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The group has been plagued by production quality problems, and has just suffered a strike lasting more than 50 days that paralyzed two crucial factories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 12, it unveiled plans to reduce its global workforce by 10 percent over the coming months, without giving any further details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boeing's employees numbered some 170,000 people at the end of last year, with close to 67,000 of them in Washington state, where the company was founded and where it produces its best-selling 737 line of aircraft, along with the 777, 767 and several military planes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its plants in Renton and Everett, located near Seattle, were recently blocked by a strike involving more than 33,000 members of the local branch of the International Association of Machinists (IAM), who were negotiating over pay and work conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As previously announced, we are adjusting our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and a more focused set of priorities," a company spokesperson told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Boeing, most of the employees receiving redundancy notices this week will leave the company in mid-January. Benefits and health insurance will continue to be paid for up to three months after that.</p>

<p>The engineers' union SPEEA (Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace) was notified on Thursday evening that 438 of its members were to be laid off, according to a spokesman.</p>

<p>It has more than 19,000 members across the United States, around 16,500 of whom work for Boeing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[But as the Amazon battles the effects of climate change, a historic drought is making travel more difficult than ever.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Amazon, the world's largest river by volume and one of its busiest transportation networks is facing a serious challenge. In a region where roads are virtually nonexistent, people rely on ferries, boats, and canoes to navigate the river. But as the Amazon battles the effects of climate change, a historic drought is making travel more difficult than ever.</p>

<p>Cilene Santos, a Brazilian tourist guide, shared her concerns with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/17/world/video/amazon-rainforest-drought-pozzebon-dnt-digvid" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>, saying, "There are sandbanks everywhere, and the boat could hit one and break its propeller."</p>

<p>This month, UNICEF reported that over 400,000 children are being affected by the drought. More than 1,700 schools in the Brazilian portion of the Amazon have been closed or are inaccessible due to the low water levels.</p>

<p>The dramatic effects of climate change are hard to ignore, especially as former US President Joe Biden flew over the Amazon on Sunday. From the sky, the once lush landscape now features vast sand dunes, an unsettling sight that looks more like a desert than a rainforest.</p>

<p>Bram Ebus, an Amazon analyst, emphasized the significance of the moment, telling CNN, "It is a very important time for the Amazon because for the first time, there are two progressive presidents in the largest Amazonian economies - Colombia and Brazil. There is a small window of opportunity for both leaders to come up with concrete proposals to conserve biodiversity."</p>

<p>As the Amazon faces one of the toughest challenges in its history, the world watches, hoping that efforts to protect this vital ecosystem will be met with swift and meaningful action.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk has been an ever-present sidekick for President-elect Donald Trump since the US election at the start of the month. But can the bromance between world's wealthiest man and the soon-to-be US president survive some major policy differences?]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has been an ever-present sidekick for President-elect Donald Trump since the US election at the start of the month.</p>

<p>"I can't get him out of here," Trump joked about Musk at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last Thursday. "I like having him here as well. He's done a fantastic job, an incredible mind."</p>

<p>But can the bromance between the world's wealthiest man and the soon-to-be US president survive some major policy differences and their own combustible personalities?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>AFP looks at six possible areas of friction:</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Who's the boss?</strong></h3>

<p>Musk is famed for his manic working habits and self-described "hardcore" style, running his companies as personal fiefdoms in which his authority is rarely challenged.</p>

<p>From factory production lines to the boardroom, he is used to getting his way with an abrasive style that sees him fire people on the spot and sometimes insult their intelligence in public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump, also a tycoon fond of firing and humiliating people publicly, demands total loyalty and has chafed against sharing the limelight with others in the past.</p>

<p>He also likes to play his advisors and cabinet members against each other, former aides say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk reportedly had a first public row with Trump transition official Boris Epshteyn last week, according to the Axios news site.</p>

<p>And he openly endorsed brokerage billionaire Howard Lutnick for US Treasury secretary on Saturday, setting up an early test of his influence.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Climate change</strong></h3>

<p>Musk invested in Tesla in 2004 partly out of concern about global warming.</p>

<p>In 2017, he resigned from Trump's business advisory councils to protest the then-president's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate change accord.</p>

<p>"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk wrote on Twitter at the time.</p>

<p>Trump, who has called climate change a "hoax," is widely expected to abandon US commitments again after President Joe Biden re-joined the Paris Accord in 2020.</p>

<p>Musk has shifted his views recently, telling Trump during a live conversation on X in August that "if 50-100 years from now we're mostly sustainable I think that will probably be OK."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world's top climate scientific body, the UN's IPCC, says average global temperatures are on track to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial times in the early 2030s, a key level with major consequences for ecosystems.</p>

<h3><strong>Energy transition</strong></h3>

<p>Musk has bet big on the energy transition, making his fortune from Tesla electric cars, but also developing domestic battery technology and solar-powered roof tiles.</p>

<p>Trump ran pledging to "drill, baby, drill" and is expected to approve new fossil fuel infrastructure and permits, even opening up protected federal land to oil and gas companies.</p>

<p>Musk used to deride the "mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy" that Trump openly champions.</p>

<p>The president-elect has nominated a fracking magnate as his energy secretary. Chris Wright publicly dismissed climate change and the energy transition last year.</p>

<h3><strong>China</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's aggressive stance on China and the risk of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies could be another major thorn in the relationship between the billionaires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is a major market for Tesla, where the company has one of its so-called "Gigafactories" and is trying to compete with fast-growing home-grown manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk never says a negative word about the ruling Communist Party, putting him at odds with the China hawks like US Senator Marco Rubio who have been tapped to join Trump's cabinet.</p>

<h3><strong>'DOGE' on a leash</strong></h3>

<p>An unsparing cost-cutter in his own companies, Musk has been tasked by Trump with leading the "Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)," which will take an ax to government spending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plans to gut programs will almost certainly, however, face severe political pushback, even from Republicans.</p>

<p>As mid-term elections approach, whether it's rescuing Medicaid checks for the poor or handing out defense contracts to benefactors, Trump's political priorities could waver from Musk's.</p>

<h3><strong>Big Tech</strong></h3>

<p>Musk's complicated relationships and personal rivalries with Silicon Valley's biggest tech companies go back decades, and he is expected to face myriad conflicts of interest as part of the administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Would Musk, who owns his own AI company, sit by quietly if Trump champions OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed startup that Musk played a key role in starting a decade ago?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Amazon founder Jeff Bezos gets Trump's ear, would Musk tolerate that a rival to SpaceX got closer to the White House inner sanctum?&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan federal authorities have outlawed all sorts of public gatherings in the capital region for two months ahead of a planned protest by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan federal authorities have outlawed all sorts of public gatherings in the capital region for two months ahead of a planned protest by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's party.</p>

<p>Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) last week announced to protest in Islamabad on November 24 to force the government to release its jailed founding leader, incarcerated for more than a year.</p>

<p>The federal government retaliated by imposing Section 144 in Islamabad, a colonial era law that prohibits public assemblies.</p>

<p>According to different notifications issued by the office of Islamabad District Magistrate Usman Ashraf on Monday, Section 144 has been implemented due to "certain segments of society" planning "unlawful assemblies ... which can disrupt public peace and tranquillity."</p>

<p>Public gatherings of five or more people were banned, as they might "threaten public peace and tranquillity, cause public annoyance or injury, endanger human life and safety, pose a threat to public property, and ... lead to a riot or an affray including sectarian riot within the revenue/territorial limits of district Islamabad."</p>

<p>The notifications banned sound systems to play "all kinds of objectionable/sectarian related speeches and sermons" and has also been prohibited under the order. Similarly, the use of loudspeakers to antagonise "political/social groups/religious sects."</p>

<p>The district magistrate also banned firecrackers, the display of firearms as well as the distribution of hand-bills, pamphlets and affixing of posters.</p>

<p>The ban would be in place for two months, "unless revoked or extended," the order said.</p>

<p>However, the banning of rallies may hardly have any impact on the PTI which in the past flouted Section 144 several times, political observers said, adding, the protesters usually invoke a constitutional provision that provides the right of peaceful assembly and protest to all citizens.</p>

<p>Earlier Khan's sister Aleema Khan, after meeting him in the Adiala Jail at Rawalpindi on November 13, told the journalists that everyone from the PTI, including workers, members of parliament, and party supporters should join the protest on November 24.</p>

<p>Khan, 72, has been incarcerated in multiple cases since August last year. He has been convicted in a few and got bail in some but continues to be in jail on account of other cases.</p>

<p>"This is the moment when you will have to decide (whether) you want to live under martial law or live with freedom," she quoted Khan as saying.</p>

<p>"You used your right (to vote) on February 8.... but the next day, the foundation you had laid for democracy was stolen," she further quoted her jailed brother as saying.</p>

<p>She further said that Khan has addressed his call to four categories of people -farmers, lawyers, civil society and students- who should come out to protest for their rights.</p>

<p>Talking about the 26th Amendment being enacted as law, she quoted Khan as saying, "All of your rights have been taken away; the Supreme Court has been occupied, and the current conditions are even worse than previous martial laws."</p>

<p>The 26th amendment has granted legislators more power in appointing the top judge.</p>

<p>Separately, the PTI in a statement had said a long march would begin towards Islamabad on Nov 24 to force the government to accept three demands: "Restoration of judiciary, as 26th amendment is a blatant attempt to clip judicial powers; release of party leadership &amp; workers and return of stolen mandate, 2024 election by far, the most controversial and farce election."</p>

<p>The so-called final call for protest comes after a series of protests by the PTI supporters since September. The last protest call towards capital Islamabad on October 4 failed to achieve its objective.</p>

<p>By giving a go ahead for the final protest, Khan and his party has apparently exhausted all channels to secure his release from jail where he has been kept for more than year.<br />

<p>The recent U.S. presidential election defied expectations, delivering results that will shape American politics in unpredictable ways. For only the second time in US history, a president won non-consecutive terms in office. Despite widespread predictions of a contentious transition, the handover from President Biden to President Trump was remarkably smooth.</p>

<p>This election did more than simply return Trump to office; it also gave the Republican Party control over both chambers of Congress, completing a “trifecta” of control across the executive and legislative branches. With this majority, Trump has moved quickly to form his cabinet, signalling his commitment to an assertive, and in some ways, radical policy direction. His cabinet picks have both reassured his base and stirred fresh controversy among Democrats and even some Republicans.</p>

<h2><strong>A Complex Blend</strong></h2>

<p>Trump's cabinet nominations have surprised many, reflecting his intent to shake up the status quo with a blend of political loyalty and unconventional figures. His picks for Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Michael Waltz, respectively, have been met with cautious optimism. However, other nominations have sparked bipartisan concern. Trump's choice of Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, for instance, has been seen as a signal of a conservative re-evaluation of the military's role, funding, and structure. Known for his hawkish views, Hegseth is expected to push for a downsized but more targeted military approach, potentially bringing resources from long-standing international deployments to home.</p>

<p>Another controversial decision is Trump's decision to appoint Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence. Gabbard, a former Democratic Congresswoman known for her anti-interventionist stance, has drawn scrutiny due to her critiques of US military actions abroad and her relatively diplomatic tone toward adversaries like Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Her stance on foreign interventions may face significant resistance from both sides of the aisle.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Some Names Have Raised Eyebrows</strong></h2>

<p>Trump's choices for domestic policy roles have provoked an even stronger backlash. His selection of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services has ignited concerns across the political spectrum. Gaetz, a controversial figure with ongoing legal issues, is perceived by critics as an overly polarising choice to lead the Justice Department. Similarly, Kennedy, known for his outspoken opposition to vaccines, raises questions about his suitability to lead a department overseeing national health policy.</p>

<p>Trump's establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by high-profile entrepreneurs Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, has been met with a mix of enthusiasm and scepticism. While the concept of streamlining government operations and reducing bureaucracy is appealing to many, the feasibility of such an initiative remains uncertain. DOGE's role is intended to be primarily domestic, targeting inefficiencies in agencies like the Department of State and the Pentagon, which are often criticised for sluggish operations. Yet, some fear that drastic cuts or restructuring could disrupt government functions, creating bottlenecks rather than improvements.</p>

<p>Amidst these appointments, there is growing speculation that Trump is prioritising loyalty over qualifications. Some Republicans have privately expressed concerns that certain nominees may struggle to pass Senate confirmation, even with the party's majority. This scenario would put Trump in a delicate position.</p>

<h2><strong>The Fringe Rules?</strong></h2>

<p>Democrats, for their part, have criticised Trump's cabinet selections, suggesting that his administration risks becoming insular, filled with figures from the political fringe. They warn that governing with a small, ideologically close circle could be the worst sounding board.</p>

<p>Despite the controversies, Trump's nominations for Rubio, Waltz, and Hegseth indicate a clear intent to strengthen America's role abroad through a resolute foreign policy. His administration appears focused on standing firm against rivals like China, reinforcing traditional alliances, and avoiding new military conflicts. At the same time, Trump's administration seems inclined to reduce military entanglements in ongoing wars, in line with his campaign promises to prioritise American interests.</p>

<p>For India, Trump's return to the presidency could mark a new chapter in US-India relations. Rubio and Waltz are both strong proponents of closer US-India ties, viewing the partnership as crucial for countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Above all, Trump's personal rapport with Prime Minister Modi adds guardrails of certainty to the bilateral relationship.</p>

<p>While Trump's choices reflect his desire for a loyal team, they also signal his intention to challenge traditional governance structures and pursue a different vision for America's future.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares in Donald Trump's social media company soared on Monday after a Financial Times report that it was in talks to buy a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, was up more than 16.5 percent at the close of trading after the newspaper reported it was in advanced talks to buy crypto platform Bakkt.</p>

<p>Many in the crypto sector are expecting the US president-elect to enact reforms that will benefit the industry once he is in office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purchase, if it goes through, would give Trump further personal exposure to any favorable regulations his administration enacts.</p>

<p>Bakkt shares shot up more than 160 percent after the financial daily's report, which cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Bakkt's parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Bakkt has previously entered into business partnerships with Starbucks and Mastercard in moves intended to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to consumers.</p>

<p>The company, which went public in 2021, has not yet turned a profit although its losses have narrowed in recent years.</p>

<p>TMTG posted revenue of just $2.6 million in the first three quarters of this year while reporting a loss of $363 million.</p>

<p>Trump has a 53 percent stake in the company.</p>

<p>He also has ties to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial.</p>

<p>Groups affiliated with the crypto industry spent millions supporting candidates across both US political parties in the November election, including Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there was any doubt that Joe Biden is no longer in the picture for many world leaders, his final G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro provided a sure sign. Biden has been making a last pitch for global support on issues from Ukraine and Gaza to climate change before Donald Trump returns to the White House. But as his counterparts gathered for an official G20 photo beside the Brazilian city's stunning bayside, there was a problem -- the 81-year-old Biden was a no-show.</p>

<p>Instead of the US president, it was China's Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who joked and chatted in the front row before posing together.</p>

<p>Frustrated American officials blamed it on "logistical issues" and said the picture was taken too soon, as Biden was still making his way to the area from talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>

<p>"They took the photo early before all the leaders had arrived. So a number of the leaders weren't actually there," a US official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Trudeau and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also missed out.</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Twilight</strong></h2>

<p>But while the issue did not appear to have been a deliberate snub, it reflected the increasingly sidelined status of the lame-duck US leader as Trump's comeback looms.</p>

<p>The fact that it was the leaders of three BRICS countries in the front row that see themselves as a counterpart to a Western-dominated world did not help.</p>

<p>In another incident, US officials played down footage of the leader of the world's biggest economy and most powerful military apparently straying from the red carpet on the way into the summit.</p>

<p>The US officials said that "several" leaders from "countries that face high threats" took a different route like Biden did, even if Brazilian media said they did not see any others.</p>

<p>However, the missteps come in the twilight of a presidency whose achievements are set to meet a Trump-shaped wrecking ball come January 20th.</p>

<p>Biden dropped out of the US presidential election against Trump after a disastrous debate raised concerns about his age, but he still saw his Democratic replacement, Kamala Harris, lose heavily to the Republican.</p>

<p>Now his six-day tour of South America has turned into a desperate frenzy to reassure world leaders amid uncertainty about what Trump will bring, from trade wars to threats to upending old alliances.</p>

<h2><strong>Final Pitch</strong></h2>

<p>At the G20 on Monday, Biden had urged the other leaders to back Ukraine's "sovereignty," in his first comments since it emerged on Sunday that he had approved Kyiv's use of long-range missiles against Russia.</p>

<p>Yet Trump could reverse not only that decision, but also Biden's huge US military aid for Ukraine, with signs that the president-elect may push through a peace deal that could force Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow.</p>

<p>Biden also pushed G20 leaders to pressure Hamas on a ceasefire deal with Israel -- and while Trump has appointed some key Israel hawks, he may also try to push for a historic deal there too.</p>

<p>Time and again, Biden has used his valedictory appearance on the world stage to try to keep his policies out of Trump's shadow.</p>

<p>At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima last week, Biden met with Xi, who promised to work with Trump on a "smooth" transition even as both leaders warned of turbulence ahead.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden visited the Amazon rainforest in Brazil to promote his record on climate change -- despite Trump threatening to pull the United States back out of the Paris climate agreement.</p>

<p>At the G20 he announced what the White House called a "historic" $4 billion pledge for a World Bank fund that helps the world's poorest countries.</p>

<p>But US officials admitted that there was no way they could "Trump-proof" the money if Trump -- who has appointed tech tycoon Elon Musk to head a commission on cutting government "waste" -- scraps the plan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Archegos Capital Management founder Bill Hwang, whose family office's soaring portfolio briefly made him worth more than $30 billion, said he now only has around $55 million.</p>

<p>Hwang, who faces sentencing Wednesday in New York for fraud and market manipulation tied to Archegos' spectacular 2021 collapse, estimated his current wealth in a Monday court filing. His lawyers are pushing back against prosecutors' request that Hwang be forced to pay $10 billion to compensate his victims, on top of spending 21 years in prison.</p>

<p>The proposed restitution order is "unsupported, unnecessary and unjustified," Hwang's lawyers said. They also suggested that it was pointless, saying Hwang's net worth is less than 0.6% of the amount sought by the government and includes a number of jointly held assets.</p>

<p>Hwang was convicted in July of misleading Wall Street banks into helping him inflate the value of Archegos' highly concentrated portfolio to as high as $36 billion before the bubble burst. Its counterparties lost some $10 billion, and the scandal was a major factor in the later demise of Credit Suisse Group AG.</p>

<p>Though the government is asking US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein to sentence Hwang to more than two decades behind bars, his lawyers are asking for no prison time at all.</p>

<p>In Monday's filing, Hwang's lawyers made a similar argument against restitution as they did against prison. They said prosecutors haven't shown that the losses suffered by the banks were directly caused by Hwang's conduct.</p>

<p>The case is US v. Hwang, 22-cr-240, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi reviewed progress in the disengagement of troops in Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh in a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit.</p>

<p>It was the first high-level engagement between the two sides after completion of the disengagement process in the two friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the mountainous region.</p>

<p>After his talks with Mr. Wang, Mr. Jaishankar said that both sides also exchanged views on the next steps in the India-China bilateral ties.</p>

<p>"On the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Rio, met CPC Politburo member and FM Wang Yi of China," the external affairs minister posted on X late on Monday.</p>

<p>"We noted the progress in the recent disengagement in the India-China border areas. And exchanged views on the next steps in our bilateral ties. Also discussed the global situation," he said.</p>

<p>Brazil is hosting the G20 Summit on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>Indian and Chinese militaries completed the disengagement exercise in Demchok and Depsang last month after the two sides reached an agreement to resolve the festering border row.</p>

<p>The two sides also resumed patrolling activities in the two areas after a gap of almost four-and-a-half years.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bryan Johnson, a millionaire tech entrepreneur at the forefront of the longevity movement, is renowned for his bold attempts to reverse ageing, enhance the health span, and push the boundaries of human lifespan to 150 years. However, his latest anti-ageing experiment took an unexpected turn.</p>

<p>On November 14, Johnson shared a striking close-up on Instagram, revealing a swollen, red face following an attempt to inject a "donor's" fat into his face to regain a youthful appearance. The procedure, dubbed "Project Baby Face," was Johnson's response to his gaunt look after significant weight loss on his strict 1,950-calorie diet.</p>

<p>"I got really lean and lost a lot of fat-especially in my face. My biomarkers were improving, but I looked gaunt," he explained in his post. "People thought I was on the brink of death."</p>

<p>Just 30 minutes after the procedure, his face was still bloated. "Immediately following the injections, my face began to blow up," he added. "And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn't even see. It was a severe allergic reaction," he wrote.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi's hazardous air quality was a key focus at COP29, as experts warned about the health risks of air pollution and called for immediate global action.</p>

<p>Aarti Khosla, Director of Climate Trends, said that Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) had reached dangerous levels, with some areas recording particulate pollution above 1,000 microgram per cubic metre. "Pollution comes from many sources like black carbon, ozone, burning fossil fuels, and farm fires. We need solutions that tackle all of these," she said.</p>

<p>Khosla also explained that low wind speeds during the La Niña weather pattern are trapping pollutants in the air, making the situation worse. "While we discuss major global issues, millions of people's health is at risk. We must act fast," she said.</p>

<p>Courtney Howard, Vice-Chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, shared her experience from Canada, where wildfires forced the evacuation of 70 per cent of her population in 2023. "This was expensive, even for a rich country like ours. Poorer nations need financial help to deal with such disasters," she said.</p>

<p>Howard also criticised the lack of funds for health care, despite massive subsidies given to large corporations. "We are giving USD 1 trillion to corporations making huge profits, but we say there's no money for health care. We must fund health to protect everyone," she said.</p>

<p>Enkhun Byambadorj, Co-Founder of Breathe Mongolia, highlighted the serious air pollution problem in his country. "Children in cities have 40 per cent lower lung capacity compared to those in rural areas. The air we breathe is a choice we make as a society, but it's hurting our children's future," he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced the relaunch of the stalled talks for a free trade agreement with India and said Britain will seek a "new strategic partnership".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced the relaunch of the stalled talks for a free trade agreement with India and said Britain will seek a “new strategic partnership”.</p>

<p>After his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 summit on Monday, Mr Starmer said, “A new trade deal with India will support jobs and prosperity in the UK – and represent a step forward in our mission to deliver growth and opportunity across our country”.</p>

<p>A statement from his office about their meeting said, “The UK will seek a new strategic partnership with India, including a trade agreement, as well as deepening co-operation in areas like security, education, technology, and climate change.</p>

<p>PM Modi in a post on X said, “For India, the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with the UK is of immense priority”. “In the coming years, we are eager to work closely in areas such as technology, green energy, security, innovation, and technology. We also want to add strength to trade as well as cultural linkages”, he added.</p>

<p>He called his meeting with Mr Starmer “extremely productive”. This was his first meeting with Mr Starmer, who was elected in July defeating Labour Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</p>

<p>Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the two leaders were confident their negotiators would forge a "balanced, mutually beneficial and forward looking Free Trade Agreement". It said that India would be opening two new consulate generals – or deputy high commissions – in Belfast and Manchester to better serve the Indian diaspora.</p>

<p>MEA also mentioned that PM Modi raised the thorny issue of alleged economic offenders from India living in Britain whom New Delhi wants extradited. Foremost among those India is seeking is Vijay Mallaya, the one-time high-flying liquor and airline entrepreneur, who has avoided extradition for several years. Others include diamond merchant Nirav Modi and cricket administrator Lalit Modi.</p>

<p>After Brexit – Britain's departure from the European Union – it has sought to broaden economic relations with India and other countries. British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said, “Striking a deal (with India) is important to deliver this Government's core mission of driving economic growth”.</p>

<p>Mr Starmer's statement said, “The UK is committed to negotiating a trade deal with India – one of the fastest growing economies in the world”. About the British priorities in a trade agreement, Reynolds mentioned “lowering Indian tariffs to help British firms export to this dynamic market”. “Boosting investment which already supports over 600,000 jobs across both countries”, is another, he said.</p>

<p>“India is the fifth largest economy in the world and a vital trading partner for the UK. We believe there is a good deal to be done here that works for both nations”, he added “A deal with India would boost the UK's trading relationship, worth £42 billion ($53.22 billion) in the 12 months to June 2024”, the prime minister's office said.</p>

<p>“UK exports to India are worth £16.6 billion($19.77 billion).”</p>

<p>Trade talks between India and Britain had dragged on for several years and were dropped in March.</p>

<p>Since then, the government in Britain has changed with the Conservatives yielding to Labour, and PM Modi winning an election for a third term. One of the issues in those negotiations was increasing visas for students and businesspeople from India.</p>

<p>For Britain, it was lowering duties on whiskey and automobiles, and easier access to Indian markets for its service sector.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like Saturn, Earth may have also had its ring system circling the planet 466 million years ago.</p>

<p>These rings seem to have existed during the Ordovician Period when the Earth's life forms and plate tectonics witnessed significant changes after a peak in meteorite strikes, a study published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters said.</p>

<p>The researchers have based their hypothesis on the positioning of nearly two dozen impact craters -- all placed within 30 degrees of the Earth's equator. This signals that these meteoroids might have rained down from a rocky ring around the planet, the study said.</p>

<p>Andrew Tomkins, a geologist and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said it was "statistically unusual" getting 21 craters all relatively close to the equator. "It shouldn't happen. They should be randomly distributed," Tomkins, also the lead author of the study, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/18/science/earth-saturn-ring-asteroid-study/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>Besides shedding light on the origins of the spike in meteorite impacts, the latest hypothesis further tries to answer an unexplained event in history -- the global deep freeze, which remains among the coldest climate events in the planet's history.</p>

<p>Near the end of the Ordovician, this period is considered one of the coldest in the last 500 million years, Earth.com reported.</p>

<p>Scientists have suggested the ring system might have cast a shadow over the Earth, thereby blocking sunlight and causing temperatures to drop on the planet.</p>

<p>Earlier, scientists suggested a large asteroid broke apart within the solar system and created the meteorites that hit the Earth during the Ordovician Period. However, Tomkins claimed such an impact could have likely randomly distributed the strikes like the craters on the Moon.</p>

<p>In the latest study, the researchers hypothesise that a large asteroid, measuring around 7.5 miles (12 kilometres) in diameter, had reached the planet's Roche limit -- the distance at which the celestial body gets enough gravitational pull to break the approaching body.</p>

<p>This may have taken place around 9,800 miles (15,800 kilometres) from the planet if the measurements of past rubble-pile asteroids are to be considered.</p>

<p>Tomkins claimed the asteroid might have been largely hit by other collisions.</p>

<p>He added that the right might have formed along the equator due to the planet's equatorial bulge -- similar to the ones of Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G20 leaders met in Rio de Janeiro on Monday for talks on climate change, ongoing wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon, and more, at a forum that highlighted differences between world powers but also delivered some successes.</p>

<p><strong>Here are five key takeaways from the summit:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3><strong>No climate breakthrough</strong></h3>

<p>Hopes were high that G20 leaders would jumpstart stalled UN climate talks taking place in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>In their final declaration, however, they merely recognized the need for "substantially scaling up climate finance from billions to trillions from all sources."</p>

<p>Crucially, they did not say who would provide the trillions.</p>

<p>They also did not reiterate a commitment made at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai last year for a "just, orderly, and equitable transition" away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"They haven't stepped up to the challenge," Mick Sheldrick, co-founder of the Global Citizen campaign group said.</p>

<h3><strong>Ukraine war</strong></h3>

<p>The war in Ukraine dominated discussions at the G20, a day after the United States gave Kyiv the green light to strike Russian territory with American-supplied long-range missiles.</p>

<p>Russia vowed a "response" if hit.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping, who together with Brazil has been pushing for Kyiv to enter peace talks with Russia, urged the G20 to help "cool" the war.</p>

<p>In their final statement, G20 leaders said they welcomed "all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace" in Ukraine.</p>

<p>While condemning, as at last year's G20 summit, the "threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition," they made no mention of Russian aggression.</p>

<h3><strong>Lebanon, Gaza ceasefire calls</strong></h3>

<p>The leaders of the G20 -- which mixes steadfast Israel allies such as the United States and Argentina with countries like Turkey that are more supportive of Palestinians -- called for "comprehensive" ceasefires in both Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>They said the Gaza ceasefire should be in line with a US-proposed UN resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire in the territory in return for the release of all hostages by Hamas.</p>

<p>It also called for a Lebanon ceasefire "that enables citizens to return safely to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line" that separates Lebanese and Israeli armed forces.</p>

<h3><strong>Tax the super-rich</strong></h3>

<p>The G20 endorsed the idea of cooperating to make sure "ultra-high-net-worth individuals are effectively taxed," delivering a victory to summit host Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>

<p>It said though that such cooperation should be "with full respect to tax sovereignty" and involve "debates around tax principles" as well as coming up with anti-avoidance mechanisms.</p>

<p>An economist specializing in inequalities who was tapped by the Brazilian G20 presidency to write a report on the issue, Gabriel Zucman, hailed the "historic decision."</p>

<h3><strong>Alliance against hunger</strong></h3>

<p>One of the issues dearest to President Lula was forging a global alliance against hunger, and he received an early success by launching that initiative at the start of the summit, getting 82 countries to sign on.</p>

<p>The alliance aims to unite international efforts to provide financing in the campaign against hunger, and to replicate programs that have proved successful in some countries.</p>

<p>The goal is to reach half a billion people by the end of the decade, reducing what Lula -- who grew up in poverty -- has called a preventable "scourge that shames humanity."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the Competition Commission imposed a Rs 213-crore penalty on Meta in relation to WhatsApp privacy policy, the company said it disagrees with the watchdog's decision and plans to appeal.</p>

<p>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday asked WhatsApp to refrain from sharing user data with other applications, owned by Meta, for advertising purposes for a period of five years.</p>

<p>India's competition watchdog imposed a penalty of Rs 213.14 crore on the social media giant for unfair business ways with respect to WhatsApp privacy policy update done in 2021.</p>

<p>Besides, the competition watchdog has directed Meta to cease and desist from anti-competitive practices.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meta-fined-25-4-million-by-india-antitrust-body-whatsapp-data-sharing-blocked-for-5-years-7050158"><strong>Also Read: Meta Fined $25.4 Million By India, WhatsApp Data Sharing Blocked For 5 Years</strong></a></p>

<p>Meta and WhatsApp have also been asked to implement certain behavioural remedies within a defined timeline to address the anti-competition issues, according to a CCI order.</p>

<p>A Meta spokesperson said that the company disagrees with the CCI's decision and plans to appeal.</p>

<p>"As a reminder, the 2021 update did not change the privacy of people's personal messages and was offered as a choice for users at the time. We also ensured no one would have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of the WhatsApp service because of this update," the Meta spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Meta further said the update was about introducing optional business features on WhatsApp, and provided further transparency about data collection and usage.</p>

<p>The Meta spokesperson added since that time, WhatsApp has been incredibly valuable to people and businesses, enabling organisations and government institutions to deliver citizen services through COVID and beyond, and as well as supporting small businesses in furtherance of the India economy.</p>

<p>"WhatsApp is able to do all of this because it offers services supported by Meta. We are committed to finding a path forward that allows us to continue providing the experiences that people and businesses have come to expect from us," the Meta spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, CCI has barred WhatsApp from sharing data collected on its platform with other Meta companies or Meta company products for advertising purposes for five years.</p>

<p>On sharing of WhatsApp user data for purposes other than advertising, the regulator said WhatsApp's policy should include a detailed explanation of the user data shared with other Meta companies or Meta company products.</p>

<p>"This explanation should specify the purpose of data sharing, linking each type of data to its corresponding purpose," it said.</p>

<p>The watchdog also said that sharing of user data collected on WhatsApp with other Meta companies or Meta company products for purposes other than for providing WhatsApp services shall not be made a condition for users to access WhatsApp Service in India.</p>

<p>On sharing of WhatsApp user data for purposes other than for providing WhatsApp services, CCI said all users in India (including users who have accepted 2021 update) will be provided with the choice to manage such data sharing by way of an opt-out option prominently through an in-app notification.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's allies voiced vehement criticism Monday of President Joe Biden's decision to let Ukraine use US-supplied long-range missiles for attacks inside Russia, accusing him of a dangerous escalation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With two months left in office, lame-duck US President Biden made a major policy change that yields to a long-standing request from Ukraine as it fights the Russian invasion, now in its third year.</p>

<p>The new policy and Biden's pledge to speed up military aid to Ukraine come as the United States prepares for Trump to take over as president in January, having questioned US assistance throughout the war.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war, but has not provided details of how he would do so.</p>

<p>With Russia gaining ground and increasing talk of negotiations, Ukraine is wary of being at a disadvantage when it comes to hashing out a peace settlement.</p>

<p>Moscow has pledged an "appropriate" response if the US-supplied missiles are in fact used against Russia, and Trump's team accused Biden of escalating the war for political reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a daily briefing, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller accused Russia of escalation by accepting a deployment of North Korean soldiers to fight Ukrainian forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Miller noted that Biden, not Trump, was still the US president -- for now.</p>

<p>Biden's move, however, complicates things for Trump's incoming administration.</p>

<h3><strong>'A whole new war'</strong></h3>

<p>"It's another step up the escalation ladder and nobody knows where this is going," Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be national security adviser, told Fox News.</p>

<p>"No one anticipated that Joe Biden would ESCALATE the war in Ukraine during the transition period. This is as if he is launching a whole new war," Richard Grenell, who was acting Director of National Intelligence during Trump's first term, wrote on X.</p>

<p>"Everything has changed now -- all previous calculations are null and void. And all for politics," Grenell said.</p>

<p>For now, Grenell does not have a job in the incoming administration but his name had come up as a possible Secretary of State before Trump finally decided to go with Senator Marco Rubio.</p>

<p>Also weighing in was Donald Trump Jr., who wrote on X: "The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives."</p>

<p>Trump himself has not spoken publicly on Biden's change of heart regarding the long-range missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He is the only person who can bring both sides together in order to negotiate peace, and work towards ending the war and stopping the killing," said Trump spokesman Steven Cheung.</p>

<h3><strong>Race against time</strong></h3>

<p>Ahead of Trump's return to power, Biden appears to be attempting to ringfence support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>And as the war hits 1,000 days, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga will visit the US Congress on Tuesday seeking to drum up support.</p>

<p>Trump, who takes office on January 20, has said he could end the war "in 24 hours" and has questioned the more than $60 billion in military aid that the United States has given Ukraine since the war started.</p>

<p>"How do we get both sides to the table to end this war? What's the framework for a deal and who is sitting at that table?" said Waltz.</p>

<p>"Those are the things that I and President Trump, of course, will be working with."</p>

<p>Shortly after his election victory on November 5 over Kamala Harris, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called the conversation "constructive."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November 27 marks seven years since Meghan Markle, then an actress, blogger, and Los Angeles native, stood beside Prince Harry in Kensington Palace's Sunken Garden to announce their engagement.</p>

<p>Since becoming the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan has been one of the most talked-about figures worldwide. However, as 2024 unfolds, questions are emerging about her unusually low profile, according to a report by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/17/entertainment/where-has-meghan-markle-gone-questions-grow-about-the-duchess-of-sussex/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>.</p>

<p>The report highlighted that Meghan's media presence during the first half of 2024 has been notably minimal. Unlike 2023, which saw her attending several high-profile events, this year has been characterized by near-total silence. Her sole media appearance was a brief interview alongside Prince Harry on a U.S. breakfast show to promote the Archewell Foundation's Parents Network. Beyond that, there have been no new TV projects, podcasts, or major public engagements.</p>

<p>This stark contrast has left fans and commentators speculating. While Prince Harry has remained active with public appearances, Meghan's quiet year has sparked curiosity. Is she intentionally stepping back, or is there another reason for her absence?</p>

<p>At the start of 2024, there were signs of a potentially busy year ahead for Meghan. In February, she and Prince Harry travelled to Vancouver to promote the 2025 Winter Invictus Games, where Meghan's chic snow-inspired outfits drew attention. In March, she delivered a keynote panel at the SXSW festival in Austin for International Women's Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around the same time, Meghan teased the launch of her business venture, American Riviera Orchard (ARO), aimed at celebrating food, gardening, and entertaining. In April, Netflix announced her involvement in a new cooking and lifestyle series. These developments suggested a full schedule and a continued public presence.</p>

<p>However, much of what was anticipated for 2024 has not come to fruition. The ARO Instagram account remains dormant, the TV series has yet to debut, and her public appearances have been sparse. What initially seemed like a year brimming with professional milestones has instead turned into one of quiet retreat, leaving observers wondering what might come next.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In his upcoming memoir retired US Army Lieutenant General Herbert Raymond McMaster alleges that Russian President Vladimir Putin manipulated former President Donald Trump by exploiting his ego.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herbert Raymond McMaster, a retired United States Army lieutenant general who served as the 25th National Security Advisor from 2017 to 2018, claimed in his new memoir how Russian President Vladimir Putin influenced former President Donald Trump during his time in office. He also claimed that Putin exploited Trump's ego for his own advantage.</p>

<p>All these bold claims appeared in McMaster's book <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/at-war-with-ourselves-h-r-mcmaster?variant=41223421394978"><em>'At War With Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House'</em></a>, which was published by HarperCollins and will hit the bookstalls on August 27.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/21/trump-putin-hr-mcmaster-memoir"><em>The Guardian</em></a> obtained a copy and outlined McMaster's account of the relationship between Putin and Trump. "Putin, a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump's ego and insecurities with flattery," McMaster writes.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-made-rs-2-crore-from-bible-sales-holds-rs-8-crore-in-crypto-report-6349300"><strong>Also Read | Donald Trump Made Rs 2 Crore From 'Bible' Sales, Holds Rs 8 Crore In Crypto: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>"Putin had described Trump as 'a very outstanding person, talented, without any doubt' and Trump had revealed his vulnerability to this approach, his affinity for strongmen, and his belief that he alone could forge a good relationship with Putin," McMaster continues.</p>

<p>"Like his predecessors George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Trump was overconfident in his ability to improve relations with the dictator in the Kremlin. The fact that most foreign policy experts in Washington advocated for a tough approach to the Kremlin seemed only to drive the president to the opposite approach," he writes.</p>

<p>McMaster clarifies that Trump developed his obsession with the Mueller report, which investigated Russian interference in the US presidential election in 2016. This fixation made it difficult to discuss anything related to Putin or Russia with him.</p>

<p>According to McMaster, Trump linked every topic involving Russia to the report and to accusations from Democrats and other critics that his campaign, and Trump himself, had colluded with Russia's disinformation efforts to influence the election.</p>

<p>Although special counsel Mueller found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy, he found out that the Trump campaign tried to conceal its contacts with Russian officials by hiding the truth several times. Further, Trump tried to interfere with or obstruct the investigation as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much-anticipated visit to conflict-hit Ukraine, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk said India could play an essential and constructive role in resolving the Russia-Ukraine war. Mr Tusk also said that PM Modi's visit to Ukraine will be "historic".&nbsp;PM Modi has expressed his concern over the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia, asserting that India supports dialogue and diplomacy for early restoration of peace and stability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poland PM also noted that PM Modi has confirmed his willingness that he is ready for a peaceful, and rightful end to war.</p>

<p>In a joint press meeting with PM Modi in Warsaw, Mr Tusk said, "We began with a clarification on very emotional issues. PM Modi confirmed his willingness that he is ready for peaceful, rightful and immediate end to war. We believe that India can play an essential and very constructive role. So, this announcement is very important for us. PM, in 10 hours you will visit Ukraine. We believe that your visit to Ukraine will be historic."</p>

<p>PM Modi today said India firmly believes that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/answer-to-any-problem-not-in-battlefield-pm-modi-on-ukraine-conflict-6393006">no problem can be solved on the battlefield</a>, adding that it is ready to provide all possible co-operation for the restoration of peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p>After<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-meets-polish-counterpart-donald-tusk-discusses-bilateral-ties-6392402"> holding wide-ranging talks with his Poland counterpart</a>, PM Modi said, "The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of deep concern for all of us. India firmly believes that no problem can be solved on the battlefield."</p>

<p>"The loss of innocent lives in any crisis has become the biggest challenge for the entire humanity. We support dialogue and diplomacy for early restoration of peace and stability," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the strategic ties between the two countries. This is the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Poland in nearly half a century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the second leg of his two-nation trip, PM Modi will be in Kyiv for around seven hours on Friday. He will leave for the Ukrainian capital onboard a train this evening and the journey will take around 10 hours. It will be the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asia's first known case of a new, deadlier Mpox virus strain has been confirmed in Thailand. The patient who has been tested positive for the new strain landed in Bangkok on August 14.</p>

<p>The patient had travelled from Africa to the United Kingdom before landing in Thailand.</p>

<p>After multiple lab tests on the 66-year-old European patient, it was confirmed that he was infected with mpox Clade 1b, according to The Department of Disease Control.</p>

<p>"Thailand's Department of Disease Control wishes to confirm the lab test result which shows mpox Clade 1b in a European patient," said the department in an official statement.</p>

<p>"We have monitored 43 people who have been in close contact with the patient and so far they have shown no symptoms, but we must continue monitoring for a total of 21 days," the department added.</p>

<p>Thailand so far has detected a staggering 800 mpox Clade 2 cases since 2022.</p>

<p>No mpox case has been detected in India as of now. In order to ensure safety of the nation's citizens, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/aiims-issues-protocol-for-handling-mpox-patients-as-cases-rise-globally-6379031" target="_blank">All India Institute for Medical Sciences</a> (AIIMS) has issued a protocol for handling suspected cases of mpox in India</p>

<p>For suspected, confirmed cases of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-airports-borders-on-alert-as-global-monkeypox-mpox-cases-rise-10-points-6372392" target="_blank">Mpox in India</a>, government hospitals in Delhi have been directed to set up isolation rooms</p>

<p>Authorities in airports, ports and borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan, have been directed by the centre to remain on high alert about passengers who show any symptoms of the virus.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is Mpox?</strong></h2>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines it as "an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick."</p>

<h2><strong>How Does The Virus Spread?</strong></h2>

<p>In Humans, it spreads through touch, kissing, or sex. In the case of a pregnant person being diagnosed with the virus, they may pass it on to their unborn child, says WHO. People diagnosed with diseases such as HIV are at an increased risk of facing complications from the virus</p>

<h2><strong>Can The Virus Be Prevented?</strong></h2>

<p>According to WHO, the virus "can be prevented by avoiding physical contact with someone who has mpox. Vaccination can help prevent infection for people at risk."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz may not have been present at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday evening, but his fashion sense was certainly felt. On Tuesday, former US President Barack Obama praised Walz's signature flannel shirts, saying they "don't come from some political consultant, they come from his closet."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Obama on Tim Walz: Let me tell you something.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The next day, Walz's wife, Gwen, reacted to Obama's comment by posting a photo of her husband sewing a button on one of his beloved flannel shirts. "It's so true, @BarackObama. Tim loves his flannels," she wrote on X.</p>

<p>Obama reposted the photo, expressing his admiration for Walz. "I love this guy. Watch tonight to hear from @Tim_Walz - a man who knows what leadership looks like - and how to fix his own flannels."&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The exchange came just before Tim Walz accepted his party's nomination for vice president on Wednesday. Walz's flannel style has been a hallmark of his folksy, down-to-earth persona, and it appears to have resonated with voters. His convention address was met with enthusiasm from the packed arena.</p>

<p>Walz thanked the delegates for "bringing the joy" to the election. "We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason: We love this country," he said, as thousands of delegates held up 'Coach Walz"' placards in red, white and blue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tim Walz's speech was filled with intimate details about his family's struggles, including their battle with infertility. He spoke about the importance of respecting others' choices, saying, "In Minnesota, we respect our neighbours and the personal choices they make and even if we wouldn't make those same choices for ourselves we've got a golden rule: mine your own damn business."</p>

<p>A heartwarming clip shared on social media showed Walz's son, Gus, in tears beside his mother and sister, Hope, as they clapped and cheered for the governor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine extends the geopolitical scope of India's foreign policy. No Indian Prime Minister has visited Poland for the last 45 years. In recent years, Poland has acquired considerable weight within the European Union (EU). It is a large country in size and population, and it has seen impressive economic growth since 1992, making it the EU's sixth-largest economy.</p>

<p>Modi has visited several countries that had not seen a prime ministerial visit from India for a very long time. This is part of a strategy to enlarge India's global footprint in line with our aspirations to play a bigger role on the world stage. In that sense, a visit to Poland would have seemed overdue.</p>

<h2><strong>A Ukraine Visit Had Become Unavoidable</strong></h2>

<p>No Indian Prime Minister has visited Ukraine since its independence in 1991. India has had productive ties with Ukraine, especially in the defence area, but these have been adversely affected by its conflict with Russia flowing from the regime change in the country in 2014. Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to visit Ukraine. Whether the conditions for a prime ministerial visit to Ukraine at the strictly bilateral level exist currently can be debated. At the geopolitical level, however, it could be argued that a visit had become more or less unavoidable.</p>

<p>Poland's hostility to Russia, anchored in history, is profound. The country's current president and the foreign minister in particular, as well as the prime minister, reflect it in their statements. This visceral animus towards Russia also explains the depth of Poland's ties with the US. Since 2008, Poland has hosted elements of the US anti-ballistic missile shield that the Russians believe is targeted against them, though the US claims that it is directed against Iran's missile capability. Poland strongly backs Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. As it happens, the western part of Ukraine is historically linked to Poland.</p>

<h2><strong>Is This An Appropriate Time?</strong></h2>

<p>It can be argued that India needs to reach out to Central and East European countries to expand its political footprint within the EU, with which it seeks to strengthen ties. The issue, however, is whether it is opportune to do so at this moment when both Ukraine and Poland are locked up in a military confrontation with Russia as front-line states with US and NATO support.</p>

<p>A proxy war is being conducted against Russia through Ukraine, with full Polish support, with the declared goal of imposing a strategic defeat on Russia, causing its economic collapse and isolating it internationally, even if these goals have not been met yet. The question arises whether we need to defer to Russia's sensitivities and concerns when it has been our privileged strategic partner for decades and has stood by us when we were under pressure from the West.</p>

<p>To what extent we should show solidarity with Russia and shun its adversaries when we have no quarrels with them, and, in this context, to what degree we should preserve the independence of our foreign policy and our strategic autonomy vis a vis all our major partners in the East and the West, are pertinent questions.</p>

<p>One can, of course, argue that we have not been deterred from forging increasingly close ties with the US, which is the principal promoter of the proxy war against Russia, or from our efforts to expand ties with the EU, or, within it, with countries like France and Germany, who are fuelling this proxy war too. This logic should dictate that we should not be inhibited from reaching out to Ukraine and Poland.</p>

<h2><strong>The Limits Of Foreign Policy</strong></h2>

<p>But then, foreign policy is not based on logic or principles applied mechanically. Policymakers have to assess where the balance of interests lies and the likely cost of not weighing the consequences of options taken. If we want to keep Russia firmly on our side, are there options we should eschew to avoid misunderstanding or create a perception that we are harming Moscow's legitimate interests? We can, of course, assume that Russia is a mature power with great experience in diplomacy, and that it can assess whether a decision taken by us is to further our legitimate national interest and not intended to hurt Russia's interests. India and Russia need not be on the same page on everything. Even the US and its allies in Europe have differences.</p>

<p>The issue in the case of Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine at this time is that both countries have eschewed the language of dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the Ukraine conflict, with Ukraine and its NATO backers favouring some military success on the ground in order to force Russia to come to the negotiating table. This strategy assumes that Russia wants to avoid a war with NATO, which gives room to the military alliance to support limited escalatory actions in order to keep imposing costs on Moscow. This is the NATO version of an attrition strategy that Russia mirrors when it assumes that NATO will get tired of supporting the war as it is imposing costs on member states, and that public fatigue is already setting in.</p>

<h2><strong>Being Consistent</strong></h2>

<p>From India's point of view, after Modi's visit to Russia for the annual summit with a clear intention to develop stronger economic ties, and the signal given to the West once again that India will preserve the equities of its ties with Moscow, a visit to Ukraine could be put on the agenda.</p>

<p>Modi seems to have told Putin during his visit that Zelenskyy was pressing him to visit Ukraine and that he planned to go. Putin, apparently, did not demur. It could be reasoned that for Modi to counsel dialogue and diplomacy in Russia as well as internationally, and then baulk at visiting Ukraine as part of promoting his message of dialogue and diplomacy on Ukrainian soil, would have seemed inconsistent.</p>

<h2><strong>The Kursk Incursion By Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>Regrettably, Zelenskyy, by launching his highly symbolic incursion into Kursk a few days before Modi's visit, has undercut its purpose. The US and others have been prodding India to play a helpful role in promoting a resolution of the conflict in Ukraine in view of New Delhi's close ties with Moscow. They have been disingenuous in promoting this line. If the US wants to seriously engage in a dialogue with Russia to find ways to end the conflict, it does not need India's intercession or that of any other country. Russia has said many times in the past that the key to a solution lies in US hands, not those of Europe or Ukraine.</p>

<p>In his post on X before departure, Modi said that in Ukraine, he wanted to "share his perspectives on the peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict" with Zelenskyy. This intriguing message suggests that he has a vision of how this conflict could be ended, which means he has in mind a broad perspective plan. In Moscow, Modi had said that he had well understood how Putin perceived the situation. But now, after Kursk, the Russian position has hardened, with Putin stating that there is no longer any room left for talks.</p>

<h2><strong>A Tricky Time In The US</strong></h2>

<p>No doubt, Zelenskyy will share his perspectives with Modi. And then what? Will India get into some sort of a mediatory role? Is that feasible when the US is in the throes of the presidential election, with Biden a lame-duck president who cannot change course because any retreat towards a search for peace after fuelling the conflict all these years could do damage to the Democratic party, as it would imply a failure of Biden's Ukraine policy?</p>

<p>Even if Zelenskyy's decision to make a territorial incursion into Russia has undermined Modi's peace effort, India could always claim that in view of the worsening of the situation, Modi's message against escalation and in favour of peace had become even more pressing and relevant.</p>

<p>Significantly, <em>The Economist </em>sees Modi's visit to Ukraine as a "redemption", implying that India has sinned and now it was seeking forgiveness from the West. This underlines how the West sees Modi's visit. Presumably, this arrogant and presumptuous journal believes Modi is awaiting absolution from the high priests of defunct British imperialism.</p>

<p>Moving on, the actress, known for her roles in <em>The Office</em> and <em>The Mindy Project, </em>shared a personal story, shedding light on her connection to Harris and their shared Indian heritage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She introduced herself as "the woman who courageously outed Kamala Harris as Indian in an Instagram cooking video". This light-hearted remark referred to an event several years ago when Harris, then a California senator, visited Kaling's home to film a cooking segment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She wasn't Madam Vice President then; she was my senator, and we were filming a video where she came to my home to cook dosas, a South Indian dish," Kaling recounted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reflecting on their meeting, Kaling described the immediate bond they formed, despite her initial nervousness about hosting a senator. "It's not every day that a senator comes over, and I was pretty nervous, but when she arrived, we immediately hit it off," she shared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She recalled how they connected over their shared love for their mothers, both of whom died from cancer. "Both of our mothers were immigrants from India who came to America and committed their lives to serving others," Kaling said. Mindy Kaling's mother was an OB-GYN, while Harris' mother was a scientist dedicated to finding a cure for cancer.</p>

<p>One of the memorable moments for Kaling was discovering Harris' culinary skills. "But the thing I remember the most about the Vice President is that Kamala Harris can cook," Kaling said. She fondly recalled Harris' thoughtfulness, particularly towards Kaling's daughter, Kit. "She was so much better than me, but she also knew my family was watching. So as she gently corrected my sloppy dosa, she was complimenting me every step of the way, making sure that my daughter heard how good of a cook I am."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kaling used this anecdote to highlight Harris' character. "She had no desire to be seen as better than anyone else. She just wanted my kid to be impressed with her mom," the actress said. &nbsp;"It is that warmth, that generosity of spirit that I know she will bring to the White House as our next president," she endorsed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russia-Ukraine conflict rages on, entering its 31st month, with no end in sight. The battle for Bakhmut, a crucial Ukrainian city, has been one of the most intense, leaving destruction and devastation in its wake on both sides. The town, once a vibrant salt mining hub with a population of 70,000, has become a symbol of the conflict's brutality and endurance.</p>

<p>The city's devastation extends beyond its battlefield; it now houses a poignant symbol of Ukraine's resilience. The National University of Ukraine, renowned for producing Olympic champions, has been repurposed as a rehabilitation center for soldiers wounded in the war. Vadim, a Ukraine war veteran, shares how he's still fighting a battle after severely injuring his legs in Bakhmut.</p>

<p>"I fought in Kyiv and Bakhmut. The war is like hell. A Russian missile hit me, and I was blown away, hitting my head and fainting," he tells NDTV. Vadim suffered severe leg injuries, leaving him with a 50-50 chance of regaining mobility.</p>

<p>"I can't stand on my legs now. There is a 50-50 chance of getting back on my legs," he says. &nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>Despite his ordeal, Vadim remains optimistic, inspired by his mental strength and the resilience of his family. His 19-year-old son, injured thrice, returned to the battle each time, while another son currently fights on the frontlines.</p>

<p>"I am quite optimistic," he says with a determined smile. "If I can get better, it will inspire other soldiers too. Mental strength is 100% very important. If your brain is defeated, your body will be too."</p>

<p>The battle for Bakhmut, a salt mining town, has been the longest and bloodiest, with both sides suffering heavy losses. Wagner, a private Russian mercenary group, claimed victory last year after an intense 224-day battle, but Ukraine disputes this.</p>

<p>As the conflict intensifies, Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive, capturing towns and villages in the Kursk region. The biggest attack on Russian soil since World War II has rattled Russia and penetrated several kilometres into Russia's Kursk region. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine now controls over 1,250 square kilometres and 92 settlements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Searches resumed Thursday for the last person missing after a superyacht carrying UK tech tycoon <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-tech-tycoon-mike-lynch-daughters-body-found-on-yacht-wreck-report-6387632" target="_blank">Mike Lynch</a> sank off Sicily, with divers recovering a fifth body from the wreck.</p>

<p>Specialist divers working with an underwater robot on Wednesday pulled up four bodies from the wreck of the "Bayesian", while another was pulled up on Thursday morning, according to AFP reporters.</p>

<p>The grim discovery brings the death count so far to six, after the body of a man believed to be the yacht's chef was found shortly after the ship went down in a storm before dawn on Monday.</p>

<p>There was no official identification of the bodies, but Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah were among the six passengers missing.</p>

<p>The 56-metre (185 feet) British-flagged sailing boat had been anchored some 700 metres off Porticello, near Palermo on the north of the Italian island, when it was struck by a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-a-waterspout-may-have-sunk-uk-tech-tycoon-mike-lynchs-yacht-6385210" target="_blank">waterspout</a> -- akin to a mini-tornado.</p>

<p>It sank within minutes.</p>

<p>Fifteen people were rescued, including Lynch's wife and a woman with a one-year-old baby.</p>

<p>Lynch and his daughter, his lawyer Christopher Morvillo and his wife Neda, and Jonathan Bloomer, the chair of Morgan Stanley International, and his wife Judy, were all reported missing.</p>

<p>Many questions remain about why the yacht sank, and on Thursday the head of the company which built the boat said the tragedy could have been avoided.</p>

<p>"Everything that was done reveals a very long summation of errors," said Giovanni Costantino, head of the Italian Sea Group, which includes the Perini Navi company that built "Bayesian".</p>

<p>He told Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper that bad weather was forecast and all the passengers should have been gathered at the assembly point, all the doors and hatches closed.</p>

<p>Security camera footage of the ship from the shore showed the lights on its mast going out, which Costantino said indicated a short circuit, meaning that the ship had already taken on water.</p>

<p>"A Perini ship resisted Hurricane Katrina, a category 5 (hurricane). Does it seem to you that it can't resist a tornado from here?" he told the newspaper.</p>

<p>"It is good practice when the ship is at anchor to have a guard on the bridge, and if there was one he could not have failed to see the storm coming.</p>

<p>"Instead it took on water with the guests still in the cabin... They ended up in a trap, those poor people ended up like mice."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 90-foot-tall bronze murti of Lord Hanuman, unveiled near Houston, symbolising "a new milestone in the cultural and spiritual landscape of America," has become the latest landmark in Texas visible from miles away, and the third tallest sculpture in the US.</p>

<p>The Statue of Union, as it has been named, is one of the tallest statues in the world and holds several other distinctions: it is the tallest Hanuman murti outside India, the tallest in Texas, and the third tallest statue in the United States, surpassed only by the Statue of Liberty in New York (151 feet) and the Pegasus and Dragon in Hallandale Beach, Florida (110 feet), the organisers said.</p>

<p>The 'Statue of Union' Hanuman murti, which was unveiled at the Sri Ashtalakshmi Temple in Sugar Land, about 35-odd km from here, during a grand Prana Prathishta Mahotsavam ceremony from August 15 to 18, symbolises "selflessness, devotion, and unity," the organisers said, adding, the murti is named so to "honour Hanuman's pivotal role in reuniting Lord Ram and Sita."</p>

<p>"This awe-inspiring structure is the result of the visionary efforts of His Holiness Sri Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji, a Padma Bhushan awardee, and a renowned Vedic scholar, who envisioned the project as a spiritual epicentre for North America," the organiser said in a statement.</p>

<p>The festivities commenced on August 15, coinciding with India's Independence Day and the core of the celebrations unfolded on August 18, with the grand Pran Prathistha ceremony. "The rituals, led by Sri Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji and overseen by a multitude of Vedic priests and scholars, were a powerful display of devotion and spirituality," the statement said.</p>

<p>The ceremony featured a helicopter showering flowers upon the murti, sprinkling of sacred water, and placing of a 72-foot-long garland around Hanuman's neck amid thousands of devotees chanting the names of Shri Ram and Hanuman in unison.</p>

<p>The statue stands tall not only as a symbol of Hanuman's indomitable spirit but also as a new milestone in the cultural and spiritual landscape of America, embodying the principles of devotion, strength, and unity for all who come to witness its grandeur, the organisers added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift may have been absent from the Democratic National Convention (DNC), but her presence was still felt through her music. On the second night of the convention, her chart-topping hit <em>Shake It Off </em>took centre stage during the roll call vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event featured a unique musical twist, with DJ Cassidy curating a playlist of 62 songs to represent each state and territory. From Lil Jon's <em>Turn Down for What </em>for Georgia to Michael Jackson's <em>Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough </em>for Indiana, the music selections brought a lively spirit to the proceedings.</p>

<p><em>Shake It Off</em> was a fitting choice for Rhode Island, given Taylor Swift's ties to the state. She owns a home in Watch Hill on the island. The home has become a cultural landmark, celebrated in her music and famous for its star-studded Fourth of July parties.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the only Taylor Swift reference of the night.</p>

<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, "Donald Trump is like an old boyfriend who you broke up with, but he just won't go away. He spent the last four years trying to get back into a relationship with the American people. Bro, we broke up with you for a reason!" There is no reason for us to "get back together," he said, quoting Swift's hit song <em>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.</em></p>

<p>Colorado Governor and 'Swiftie' Jared Polis also referenced the song during his address at the DNC. "As a Redditor, gamer, entrepreneur and Swiftie from the free state of Colorado, I'm excited by Kamala Harris' vision of protecting and expanding our personal freedom, internet freedom and economic freedom," he said, adding the Democratic party does not consist of "weirdos who can tell people who can and can't have kids."</p>

<p>"We're never going back like never ever ever ever," he stated.</p>

<p>This comes as Swift has yet to officially endorse a candidate in the 2024 race, despite polls suggesting her support could significantly boost the chances of both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, Mississippi delegate Kelly Jacobs handed out thousands of Taylor Swift-themed bracelets at the event. Jacobs also made a statement on the first day of the convention, wearing a body-length sign that read "Storm the ballot box like they stormed the Capitol on Jan 6" and distributing homemade "Swifty Voter" friendship bracelets.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The historian will make the official prediction for the 2024 White House race after the Democratic convention.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Ronald Reagan's re-election triumph amid economic recession to Bill Clinton's victory against George HW Bush, Allan Lichtman, known as the 'Nostradamus' of US Presidential Polls has correctly predicted crucial poll contests in the country. Now, the expert has said that independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr's dropping out of the race for the White House will help Democrat candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign.</p>

<p>On his YouTube livestream, Mr Lichtman, according to his election prediction system, said that Mr Kennedy's exit and endorsement of former US President Donald Trump would help Ms Harris. "(Kennedy's) endorsement of Trump has nothing to do with the keys - (it) doesn't turn a key one way or the other." The expert was referring to his "13 keys to the White House," a groundbreaking method that revolutionised election forecasting.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://newsweek.com/allan-lichtman-rfk-kamala-harris-kennedy-drop-out-2024-election-trump-1942253"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, he stated that he "hasn't definitively called the 'third party' key, but said 'it certainly doesn't look like (Kennedy) is going to rebound."</p>

<p>"I'm still reserving judgement," he added.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Mr Lichtman said that he currently prefers Democratic US Vice President Kamala Harris to her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. He expressed his opinion to News Nation, saying that "a lot would have to go wrong for Harris to lose." He predicted that Democrats presently hold six of the 13 keys. A main competition, a short- and long-term economy, policy changes, the absence of controversy, and the charisma of a challenger are some of these. "Right now, Democrats have lost three keys" by switching to Harris, he told News Nation.</p>

<p>The expert claimed that the Democrats' significant defeat in the 2022 midterm elections cost them the "party mandate". He added that Ms Harris no longer had the "incumbency" and "charisma" keys.</p>

<p>However, in order for him to forecast a Harris defeat, Democrats would need to lose three additional seats according to his prediction model. However, he says that is unlikely to occur.</p>

<p>The historian will make the official prediction for the 2024 White House race after the Democratic convention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the third day of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the chants of "Om Shanti, Shanti" echoed in the hall and the priest conducting the prayers urged Americans to choose a leader who believes in the concept of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'.</p>

<p>In an example of inclusivity in the US and growing influence of the Indian community there, a senior Hindu priest from the Sri Siva Vishnu Temple in Maryland, Rakesh Bhatt conducted Vedic prayers today, seeking blessings for unity across the nation.</p>

<p>At the Convention, Rakesh Bhatt remarked, "Even if we have differences, when it comes to the nation, we have to be united."</p>

<p>"Let our minds think together. Let our hearts beat as one. All for the betterment of society. May this make us powerful so we can unite and make our nation proud," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Bhatt also urged America to choose a leader who believes in the Vedic concept of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the whole world is one family).'</p>

<p>He further mentioned, "We are one universal family. Truth is our foundation and always prevails. Lead us from unreal to real, from darkness to the light, and from death to immortality. Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti."</p>

<p>Replying to the prayer conducted by Bhatt, Ajay Bhutoria, Deputy National Finance Chair of the Democratic Party stated, "Rakesh Bhatt's Hindu prayer at the DNC today is a significant moment, showcasing the Democratic Party's commitment to inclusivity and diversity."</p>

<p>"It is heartening to see the rich cultural and spiritual traditions of the Indian American community being honoured on such a prominent stage. This moment reflects the growing influence and recognition of our community within the fabric of American society," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Bhatt is a Madhwa priest from Bengaluru who has trained in Rig Veda and Tantrasaara (Maadhva) Agama, under his guru, Pejavar Swamiji of Udupi Ashta Matha, Karnataka.</p>

<p>He received his English and Kannada degrees from Osteen College, Bengaluru, and his Sanskrit degree from Jayachamarajendra College.</p>

<p>To acquire Vedic knowledge he later joined Udupi Ashta Matha and worked at the Badrinath and Raghavendra Swami Koil, Salem, before joining Sri Sri Vishnu Temple in July 2013.</p>

<p>Also, the Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz accepted his party's nomination for vice president at the Democratic National Convention and expressed gratitude.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunmen opened fire on a school van in Pakistan's Punjab province on Thursday, killing two children and wounding five other people.</p>

<p>The incident took place in the Dheri Kot area of Attock district, some 400 kms from Lahore.</p>

<p>According to police, the school van was going to drop children at their school when it came under fire from unidentified gunmen.</p>

<p>"Some seven children aged between five and 10 were injured in the attack. They were shifted to hospital where two of them succumbed to their wounds while the condition of another two is said to be critical," the police said and added the van driver also suffered injuries.</p>

<p>Senior police officer Sardar Ghayas Gul told reporters that police teams have been constituted to arrest the gunmen with the help of CCTV footage. He said the police are probing the matter from all aspects whether it is a terrorism-related incident or the driver had enmity with someone.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and said that those involved in this heinous crime of targeting a school van would not escape justice.</p>

<p>The Chief Minister directed the police to ensure the early arrest of the shooters.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari have condemned the attack on school children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[SB 1047, introduced by Wiener, aims to enact what his office has called "common sense safety standards" for companies that make large AI models above a specific size and cost threshold.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is opposing a bill in California that would place new safety requirements on artificial intelligence companies, joining a chorus of tech leaders and politicians who have recently come out against the controversial legislation.</p>

<p>The San Francisco-based startup said the bill would hurt innovation in the AI industry and argued that regulation on this issue should come from the federal government instead of the states, according to a letter sent to California State Senator Scott Wiener's office on Wednesday and obtained by Bloomberg News. The letter also raised concerns that the bill, if passed, could have "broad and significant" implications for US competitiveness on AI and national security.</p>

<p>SB 1047, introduced by Wiener, aims to enact what his office has called "common sense safety standards" for companies that make large AI models above a specific size and cost threshold. The bill, which passed the state Senate in May, would require AI companies to take steps to prevent their models from causing "critical harm," such as enabling the development of bioweapons that can cause mass human casualties or by contributing to more than $500 million in financial damage.</p>

<p>Under the bill, companies would need to ensure AI systems can be shut down, take "reasonable care" that artificial intelligence models don't cause catastrophe and disclose a statement of compliance to California's attorney general. If businesses don't follow these requirements, they could be sued and face civil penalties.</p>

<p>The bill has received fierce opposition from many major tech companies, startups and venture capitalists who say that it's an overreach for a technology still in its infancy and could stifle tech innovation in the state. Some critics of the bill have raised concerns that it could drive AI companies out of California. OpenAI echoed those concerns in the letter to Wiener's office.</p>

<p>"The AI revolution is only just beginning, and California's unique status as the global leader in AI is fueling the state's economic dynamism," Jason Kwon, chief strategy officer at OpenAI, wrote in the letter. "SB 1047 would threaten that growth, slow the pace of innovation, and lead California's world-class engineers and entrepreneurs to leave the state in search of greater opportunity elsewhere."</p>

<p>OpenAI has put conversations about expanding its San Francisco offices on hold amid concerns about uncertainty with California's regulatory landscape, according to a person familiar with the company's real estate plans who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.</p>

<p>In a statement, Wiener defended the proposed legislation and said OpenAI's letter "doesn't criticize a single provision in the bill." He also said the argument about AI talent leaving the state "makes no sense" because the law would apply to any companies that conduct business in California, regardless of where their offices are located. A representative for Wiener's office pointed to two prominent national security experts who have publicly supported the bill.</p>

<p>"Bottom line: SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill that asks large AI labs to do what they've already committed to doing, namely, test their large models for catastrophic safety risk," Wiener said. "SB 1047 is well calibrated to what we know about foreseeable AI risks, and it deserves to be enacted."</p>

<p>Critics argue the bill will hamper innovation by requiring companies to submit details about their models to the state government, as well as prevent smaller open-source developers from creating startups for fear of being sued.</p>

<p>Last week, in an effort to address some of the pushback, Wiener amended the proposed legislation to eliminate criminal liability for tech companies that are not in compliance, added a protection for smaller open-source model developers and got rid of the new proposed "Frontier Model Division." Previously, developers could incur criminal penalties for intentionally submitting false information about their safety plans to the government under penalty of perjury. OpenAI rival Anthropic, which has a reputation for being more safety-oriented than its competitors, has previously said it would support the bill with some of these amendments.</p>

<p>But even after the amendments were introduced, the bill has continued to rack up opponents, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who released a statement calling it "ill-informed." A group of Democratic members of Congress also publicly opposed the bill. OpenAI and other tech industry firms have retained lobbyists who have been working on the bill, according to state filings.</p>

<p>In the letter, OpenAI said it has been engaging with Wiener's office for several months on the bill but ultimately does not support it.</p>

<p>"We must protect America's AI edge with a set of federal policies - rather than state ones - that can provide clarity and certainty for AI labs and developers while also preserving public safety," according to the letter. OpenAI also said having a clear federal framework would "help the US maintain its competitive advantage against countries like China and to advance democratic governance and values around the world."</p>

<p>OpenAI argued that federal agencies such as the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Commerce and the National Security Council are better suited to govern critical AI risks than state-level California government agencies. The company said it supports several proposed pieces of federal legislation such as the Future of AI Innovation Act, which provides congressional backing for the new US AI Safety Institute.</p>

<p>"As I've stated repeatedly, I agree that ideally Congress would handle this," Wiener said in the statement. "However, Congress has not done so, and we are skeptical Congress will do so. Under OpenAI's argument about Congress, California never would have passed its data privacy law, and given Congress's lack of action, Californians would have no protection whatsoever for their data."</p>

<p>SB 1047 is set to be voted on in the California state assembly sometime this month. If passed, it will ultimately move to the desk of California Governor Gavin Newsom. While Newsom has not indicated whether he will veto the bill, he has publicly spoken about the need to promote AI innovation in California while mitigating its risks.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may look like any other ordinary doll but it's not. It has gained notoriety for all the wrong reasons. Meet the world's "most haunted doll", reportedly possessed by the spirit of a jilted bride -- Elizabeth. It is said to have attacked 17 men so far and is currently at the Haunted Objects Museum in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Lee Steer, a 37-year-old paranormal investigator, became the owner of the doll for £866&nbsp;(Rs&nbsp;95,100) on eBay after learning of its purported hostility towards men.</p>

<p>Ms Steer claimed the doll had attacked men, leaving some with physical injuries, the New York Post reported. He's been among those at the receiving end of the doll's hostility. In contrast, Elizabeth doesn't harm any women around her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lee Steer experienced a burning sensation on his neck during an investigation in the museum's bridal doll room along with his 32-year-old partner, Sarah Carter. Later, he also discovered scratches on his back, which resembled a pentagram. "It seems like the doll has a hatred towards men. There have been well over 15 people who have come to me to say they have been scratched. It is all men and never a woman that it has attacked," Mr&nbsp;Steer told The NY Post. Sarah has been avoiding the bridal doll room due to her discomfort with its presence.</p>

<p>Besides physical attacks on men, Mr Steer revealed that the haunted doll also set off fire alarms, moved objects around the room, threw a perfume bottle across the room, and performed many other activities. During one paranormal investigation, he mentioned Elizabeth caused electronic interference in video footage, and the words 'bride' and 'haunting' mysteriously appeared repeatedly.</p>

<p>Another 34-year-old paranormal investigator, Jon-Paul Kenny, experienced a similar encounter with the doll while filming a live TikTok session in the museum. Mr Kenny recalled, "I felt someone grab my shirt, and my skin was touched. It was 100% the bridal doll that did this to me. I wasn't scared, but it put me on edge."</p>

<p><strong>"Acting out of jealousy"</strong></p>

<p>According to a report in The Daily Star, Mr Steer said the spirit within the doll might be acting out of jealousy, as the museum recently acquired a famous artefact from the horror film series <em>The Conjuring, </em>which features a possessed doll named 'Annabelle'.</p>

<p>He explained, "Why she (Elizabeth) is doing it is a mystery. Some people think she was treated badly by a man and some think her wedding went wrong so this is why she haunts a bridal doll."</p>

<p>Mr Steer added that the doll's behaviour could also stem from the fact that "Elizabeth has always been the centre of attention in the museum" and she's feeling a bit of jealousy.</p>

<p>"We've got famous items from<em> The Conjuring</em> now and maybe she is feeling a bit forgotten so she is making herself known in the most extreme way. I suspect it to be the most haunted doll," he concluded.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Polls show the race remains close, but Harris is moving slightly ahead - a remarkable turn of events, given that only a month ago Trump seemed to be gaining a steadily tightening grip over Joe Biden.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to drop out of the race for the White House, US media reported on Wednesday, with the independent candidate due to make a major address later in the week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to drop out of the race for the White House, US media reported on Wednesday, with the independent candidate due to make a major address later in the week.</p>

<p>The New York Times and CNN reported that Kennedy, whose support was at 8.7 percent in a nationwide poll by The Hill this week, would back Republican nominee Donald Trump upon dropping out.</p>

<p>Analysts say that in the tight race between the Democratic Party's Kamala Harris and Trump for the presidency, the votes of Kennedy's supporters could determine the outcome in some battleground states.</p>

<p>Kennedy, the scion of America's most famous political clan, is an environmental lawyer and long-time vaccine skeptic whose campaign struggled to gain traction with mainstream voters.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, his campaign said he would make an address to the nation on Friday from the swing state of Arizona, where Trump is also due to hold a campaign event that day.</p>

<p>"Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will address the nation live on Friday about the present historical moment and his path forward," read a brief statement from RFK Jr.'s campaign.</p>

<p>The New York Times on Wednesday cited three anonymous sources as saying Kennedy would end his campaign and potentially endorse Trump.</p>

<p>CNN cited two anonymous sources who reported Kennedy was expected to suspend his campaign on Friday.</p>

<p>AFP has reached out to Kennedy's campaign for comment on the reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a podcast interview this week, Kennedy's running mate Nicole Shanahan hinted that he could withdraw in favor of Trump.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee told CNN on Tuesday that he would "certainly" be open to Kennedy playing a role in his administration if he was elected.</p>

<p>"He's a brilliant guy. He's a very smart guy," Trump told CNN. "I've known him for a very long time.</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I'd be open to it."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Democratic luminaries including the Obamas enthusiastically support Kamala Harris for US president at their party's convention, an unlikely band of rebels is joining the effort: Republicans urging fellow conservatives to ditch Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The message is nothing new -- several Republicans have spoken out against Trump over the years. But their presence at this week's carefully orchestrated Democratic confab has amplified the call for conservatives and independents to reconsider their election choice in November.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear to my Republican friends at home watching," Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia where Trump sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election, said Wednesday from the convention stage.</p>

<p>"If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024 you're not a Democrat, you're a patriot," he boomed.</p>

<p>Slamming the recently convicted -- and twice-impeached -- former president as "a direct threat to democracy," Duncan said he was aiming his remarks at the millions of Republicans and independents he knows are "sick and tired of making excuses" for Trump.</p>

<p>"These days our party acts more like a cult, a cult worshipping a felonous thug," said Duncan.</p>

<p>Multiple Republicans have offered similar messages in Chicago, as the Harris campaign seeks to peel off as many Republicans and independent voters as possible in an election that is going down to the wire.</p>

<p>Former White House communications director Stephanie Grisham, who had close access to Trump, took the stage Tuesday slamming her ex-boss as a liar with "no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth."</p>

<p>"I saw him when the cameras were off. Behind closed doors, Trump mocks his supporters, he calls them basement dwellers," she said.</p>

<p>Grisham, who was also first lady Melania Trump's chief of staff, mentioned how she had gone from "a true believer" to a disaffected close advisor who wanted out, and recalled a turning point during the 2021 US Capitol riot by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>"On January 6 I asked Melania if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there's no place for lawlessness or violence," Grisham said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She replied with one word: 'No.'"</p>

<p>Grisham resigned that day, "because I love my country more than my party," she said, to loud applause, adding that Harris "has my vote."</p>

<p>- 'Kidnapped by extremists' -</p>

<p>John Giles, mayor of Mesa, Arizona, and a self-described "lifelong Republican" who claims late senator John McCain as his hero, was equally blunt.</p>

<p>He told the convention his Republican Party "has been kidnapped by extremists and devolved into a cult: the cult of Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Giles's message to Americans like him who are in the political middle: "John McCain's Republican Party is gone, and we don't owe a damn thing to what's been left behind."</p>

<p>Organizers aired a video Wednesday showing former Trump voters explaining why they were flipping to Harris.</p>

<p>"I made a grave mistake," Florida voter Rich Logis said via video about how he had jumped headlong into Trump's MAGA movement. "But it's never too late to change your mind," Logis said.</p>

<p>Olivia Troye, a former counter-terrorism advisor for Trump's vice president Mike Pence, addressed the convention, while high-profile Republican never-Trumper Adam Kinzinger, an ex-congressman, takes the stage Thursday, the closing night.</p>

<p>Trump frequently assails such critics as traitors to the cause, and it remains unclear how persuasive they will be.</p>

<p>David Urban, a Republican advisor to Trump's 2016 campaign, dismissed any substantial impact.</p>

<p>But he told CNN the appearance by Georgia's Duncan "may give people permission to vote for Kamala Harris" in the state.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[DNC's maiden night averaged 20 million viewers across 13 networks on Monday, comfortably surpassing the audience for the first three days of the RNC held last month in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When former US President Barack Obama stepped onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), the atmosphere was electric. It was none other than Michelle Obama, the former first lady, who introduced the 44th President to the attendees, calling him "the love of my life". The two, all smiles, then hugged before Mr Obama, one of the most charismatic speakers, took to the dais.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the delegates and the supporters of the Democratic Party who patiently listened to the former president. People at home, too, watched him speak, data show. The second night of the Democratic Convention reached an average of 20.6 million viewers on Tuesday, courtesy of the Obamas.</p>

<p>The average viewership of the Democratic National Convention was 20 million on Monday, according to Nielsen.</p>

<p>Like the night before, data from 12 networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC, Scripps News, CNN, CNNe, FOX Business, FOX News Channel, MSNBC, Newsmax, NewsNation and PBS -- were compiled.</p>

<p>DNC's maiden night averaged 20 million viewers across 13 networks. It surpassed the audience for the first three days of the Republican National Convention (RNC) held last month in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The Nielsen data show that the DNC's viewership on the second day jumped above the night's average to reach 21.6 million when former US President Barack Obama addressed the crowd.</p>

<p>Viewership for the RNC stood at 18.1 million, 14.8 million and 18 million, respectively, during the first three days, as per Nielsen. Donald Trump, who is eyeing another term as US president in the November 5 elections, headlined the final night of the convention. At the time, the viewership averaged 25.4 million, with the peak recorded at 28.4 million.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Barack Obama said, "We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos."</p>

<p>Referring to Trump's first term as US president, he stated that people have seen that movie before, and "we all know that the sequel is usually worse".</p>

<p>As the audience started to boo Trump, Obama recalled the popular phrase from his 2016 DNC speech, when Trump competed against Hillary Clinton: "Don't boo. Vote."</p>

<p>According to TV analyst Michael Mulvihill, the DNC also witnessed significantly higher viewers percentage-wise.</p>

<p>Mulvihill, who is the president of insights and analytics at FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment and Tubi, shared on social media site X that the DNC had 11.9 per cent of sampled households watching across 44 major metro areas on Tuesday, while the RNC earlier had 7.7 per cent rating, which is a difference of over 50 per cent.</p>

<p>Further, he pointed out that the DNC beat the RNC on the maiden night by 21 per cent in the overnight figures, besides 10 per cent in the full nationals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

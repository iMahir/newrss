       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 75 Indians have been evacuated from war-torn Syria where the rebels have toppled the Bashar al-Assad government and are set to form a government on their own. The Indian nationals have safely crossed to Lebanon and will return by commercial flights to India, the External Affairs Ministry said late last night.</p>

<p>The ministry said the evacuees included 44 'zaireen' (pilgrims) from Jammu and Kashmir, who were stranded at Saida Zainab.</p>

<p>The development follows requests from Indian nationals in Syria and an assessment of the security situation, the ministry said, adding that the Indian embassies in Damascus and Beirut coordinated the evacuation.</p>

<p>Some Indians, however, remain in Syria. The government has advised them to stay in touch with the embassy in Damascus via the helpline number +963 993385973, also on WhatsApp, and email ID hoc.damascus@mea.gov.in.</p>

<p>Rebel forces, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, captured capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning 12-day offensive, ending five decades of brutal rule by the Assad clan. Assad, a Kremlin ally, fled to Russia before the rebels breached his palace and has reportedly been granted asylum.</p>

<p>Mohammad al-Bashir, who has been appointed the transitional prime minister by the rebels till March 1, has called for "stability and calm", in his first interview with Al Jazeera television.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the US has reached out to the rebels and urged them to run an inclusive process to form a transitional government instead of assuming automatic leadership. An official said the Biden administration in the US is also in touch with Donald Trump's team over the matter.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier called Syria a "mess" and said the US should not be involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's naval deployments in the East China Sea and South China Sea are elevated but consistent with other large exercises in the past, a U.S. military official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The assessment contrasted with statements from Taiwan that described the deployments as the largest in nearly three decades.</p>

<p>"The PRC military activity is elevated in the region, consistent with levels we have seen during other large exercises," the official said, using the country's official name, the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p>China's military has yet to comment and has not confirmed it is carrying out any exercises.</p>

<p>China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory over the island's rejection, had been expected to launch drills to express its anger at President Lai Ching-te's tour of the Pacific that ended on Friday, which included stopovers in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam.</p>

<p>But the U.S. official did not link the deployments to Lai's travels.</p>

<p>"We do not see the activity in the East China Sea and South China Sea as a response to President Lai's transit," the official said.</p>

<p>"This activity is part of a broader increase in the PLA's military posture and military exercises over the last several years. These activities are destabilizing and risk escalation."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 127 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Sudan on Monday and Tuesday by barrel bombs and shelling from the warring sides, rights activists said.</p>

<p>The 20-month-old war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been turning increasingly bloody as ceasefire efforts have stalled, and crises elsewhere have dominated world attention.</p>

<p>The army has stepped up airstrikes in the half of the country that the RSF controls, while the RSF has staged raids on villages and intense artillery strikes. Both have targeted densely populated civilian areas.</p>

<p>More than eight barrel bombs hit the market in the North Darfur town of Kabkabiya on Monday, the pro-democracy Al-Fashir Resistance Committee said. Emergency Lawyers, a human rights group, said more than 100 had been killed and hundreds wounded.</p>

<p>The army has frequently targeted towns in North Darfur with airstrikes as it fights the RSF for control of the state capital, al-Fashir, its last foothold in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It denied responsibility for the attack on Kabkabiya, while insisting that it had the right to target any location used by the RSF for military purposes. The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>An image shared by Emergency Lawyers showed shrouded bodies in a mass grave.</p>

<p>Video verified by Reuters showed bloodied bodies strewn around the market. It also showed fires burning and people being carried from the wreckage of stores and fruit stalls.</p>

<p>People can be heard crying and screaming in the footage, while others pray for those who were killed. One man is heard saying "People are dying wholesale".</p>

<p>The video also shows armed men in the headwraps typically worn by RSF soldiers on motorcycles.</p>

<p>An activist from Kabkabiya said that, while there were typically a few soldiers in the market and other parts of the town, the vast majority of those present were civilians.</p>

<p>He said 87 bodies had been identified, but that some were too charred or mutilated to identify.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the RSF aimed heavy artillery fire at an army-controlled sector of Omdurman, part of Khartoum state, residents said.</p>

<p>Emergency Lawyers said at least 20 people had been killed, including at least 14 who were riding on a bus that was hit. The state government, controlled by the army, said 65 people had been killed, and that other casualties had been transferred to nearby Al-Naw Hospital.</p>

<p>Images circulating on social media not verified by Reuters showed shrouded bodies on the street amid vehicle wreckage.</p>

<p>The United Nations has said more than 30 million people need aid, and some 12 million have fled their homes.</p>

<p>Famine has been declared in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where shelling on Tuesday killed seven people, according to Adam Rojal, spokesperson of the Coordinating Committee for Displaced People.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed corruption charges against him as 'ridiculous' in court on Tuesday, becoming the country's first sitting premier to face criminal trial.</p>

<p>Israeli media called it a "historic day" as Mr Netanyahu faced charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust in three separate cases while running a country at war.</p>

<p>But Mr Netanyahu rejected the charges, saying: "There's no corruption, no fraud. It is just ridiculous."</p>

<p>He also lashed out at the media during almost a full day of testimony, saying most of the Israeli public was right-wing but the media was "98 per cent on the other side".</p>

<p>The trial has already heard from various witnesses, including former close aides of Mr Netanyahu who testified against him.</p>

<p>Asked how much the charges bothered him, he said: "If I tell you it's a drop in the ocean that would be an exaggeration".</p>

<p>"I'm busy with matters of world importance."</p>

<p>On Monday, at a press conference, he said he had been waiting for years to present his side.</p>

<p>"It has been eight years that I have waited for this day, eight years of wanting to present the truth, eight years waiting to completely demolish these absurd and baseless accusations against me," he said, labelling the cases a "relentless witch hunt".</p>

<p>Outside the court supporters of the prime minister chanted "Netanyahu, the people support you", while protesters chanted "Bibi to prison".</p>

<h3><strong>Luxury Goods</strong></h3>

<p>"If, at the end of the trial, it is determined that Mr Netanyahu be sent to prison, then he must go to prison," said Sarah Kritzman, a psychologist protesting outside the court.</p>

<p>"I don't think there should be any plea bargain or any kind of pardon just because he is the prime minister."</p>

<p>The trial, which has been delayed many times since it began in May 2020, is scheduled to last for months, with an appeals process that could further prolong matters.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, who filed multiple requests to delay the proceedings based on the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>In the first case, Mr Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours.</p>

<p>Among the alleged benefactors are Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian business executive James Packer.</p>

<p>The other two cases allege that Mr Netanyahu attempted to negotiate more favourable coverage in two Israeli media outlets.</p>

<p>One involves alleged attempts by the prime minister to reach a deal with Arnon Mozes, publisher of the popular Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage by agreeing to weaken the status of a rival daily newspaper.</p>

<p>The other alleges Mr Netanyahu received favourable coverage on the popular news website Walla, owned by his close friend Shaul Elovitch, in exchange for smoothing the way for a telecoms merger sought by Elovitch.</p>

<p>Since returning to power in late 2022, Mr Netanyahu's coalition government has clashed with the country's judiciary and law enforcement officials and sparked mass protests by trying to advance legislation that would weaken the courts.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu's critics insist the legal cases will finally serve justice to a highly corrupt politician who will do anything to stay in power.</p>

<p>They also accuse him of intentionally prolonging the 14-month conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon to evade justice.</p>

<h3><strong>'Important Milestone'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said the lengthy and divisive trial had now reached "an important milestone".</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, he said, not only faced a conflict of interest being both prime minister and a criminal defendant, but the trial was "putting him in direct confrontation with important institutions in the state, especially the justice ministry".</p>

<p>On Monday, around a dozen ministers in Mr Netanyahu's coalition sent a letter to attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara requesting the trial be postponed considering events in Syria and the overall security situation.</p>

<p>The letter followed similar calls by ministers and requests from the prime minister's legal team to postpone his testimony because of Israel's wars and his busy schedule.</p>

<p>The prosecution has argued that it is in the public interest for the trial to conclude as quickly as possible and the court has denied all such petitions, although it has agreed to begin trial days slightly later and occasionally reduce the hearings from three to two days a week due to the prime minister's work.</p>

<p>Other Israeli leaders have been convicted in criminal cases, including former prime minister Ehud Olmert who resigned before his trial began, but Mr Netanyahu is the first to take the stand as sitting prime minister.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Syria's new transitional prime minister on Tuesday said it was time for "stability and calm" in the country, two days after longtime president Bashar al-Assad was toppled by rebels in a lightning offensive.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's new transitional prime minister on Tuesday said it was time for "stability and calm" in the country, two days after longtime president Bashar al-Assad was toppled by rebels in a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>The rebels appointed Mohammad al-Bashir as the transitional head of government to run the country until March 1, a statement said.</p>

<p>"Now it is time for this people to enjoy stability and calm," Bashir told Qatar's Al Jazeera television in his first interview since being appointed.</p>

<p>Assad fled Syria as an Islamist-led opposition alliance swept into the capital Damascus over the weekend, bringing to an end five decades of brutal rule by his clan. A senior official told US broadcaster NBC that the ousted Syrian leader was now in Moscow.</p>

<p>Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the Islamist leader who headed the rebel offensive, had previously announced talks on a transfer of power and vowed to pursue former senior officials responsible for torture and war crimes.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, he sought to allay fears over how Syria would be ruled, telling British broadcaster Sky News the country was "exhausted" by war and would not be heading back into one.</p>

<p>"Syria will be rebuilt... The country is moving towards development and reconstruction. It's going towards stability," he said.</p>

<p>"People are exhausted from war. So the country isn't ready for another one, and it's not going to get into another one."</p>

<p>His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is rooted in Syria's Al-Qaeda branch and is proscribed by many Western governments as a terrorist organisation, though it has sought to moderate its image.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged all nations to support an "inclusive" political process in Syria, saying the United States would eventually recognise a government if it meets such standards.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Unity, inclusiveness' -</strong></p>

<p>Blinken said the future government of Syria should be "credible, inclusive and non-sectarian".</p>

<p>Laying out US priorities, Blinken said the new government must "uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities" and allow the flow of humanitarian assistance.</p>

<p>The United States wanted the next government to "prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism", he added.</p>

<p>Although they no longer hold any territory in Syria, the jihadists of the Islamic State group remain active.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said IS fighters killed 54 government troops after capturing them as they fled across the vast Syrian desert.</p>

<p>The UN envoy for Syria said the groups that forced Assad to flee must transform their "good messages" into actions on the ground.</p>

<p>"They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness," Geir Pedersen said.</p>

<p>"What we need not to see is... that this is not followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us," he added.</p>

<p>EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned of the risks of sectarian violence and a resurgence of extremism. "We must avoid a repeat of the horrific scenarios in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan," she said.</p>

<p>Syria's nearly 14-year civil war killed 500,000 people and forced half the country to flee their homes, millions of them finding refuge abroad.</p>

<p><strong>- Thousands missing -</strong></p>

<p>The fall of Assad has sparked a frantic search by families of the tens of thousands of people held in his security services' jails and detention centres.</p>

<p>As they advanced towards Damascus, the rebels released thousands of detainees, but many more remain missing.</p>

<p>Syria's White Helmet rescuers on Tuesday called on Russia to pressure Assad into providing maps of secret jails and lists of detainees as they race against time to release prisoners.</p>

<p>A large crowd gathered Monday outside Saydnaya jail, synonymous with the worst atrocities of Assad's rule, to search for relatives, many of whom had spent years in captivity, AFP correspondents reported.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for my brother, who has been missing since 2013. We've looked everywhere for him, we think he's here, in Saydnaya," said 52-year-old Umm Walid.</p>

<p>Crowds of freed prisoners wandered the streets of Damascus, many maimed by torture, weakened by illness and emaciated by hunger.</p>

<p>The United Nations said whoever ended up in power in Syria must hold Assad and his lieutenants to account.</p>

<p>UN investigators who for years have been gathering evidence of horrific crimes called Assad's ouster a "game-changer" because they will now be able to access "the crime scene".</p>

<p>Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, vowed on Tuesday: "We will not hesitate to hold accountable the criminals, murderers, security and army officers involved in torturing the Syrian people."</p>

<p>- Strikes -</p>

<p>While Syrians were celebrating Assad's ouster, the Israeli military said it had conducted hundreds of strikes on Syria over the past two days.</p>

<p>Pedersen, the UN special envoy, called on Israel to stop.</p>

<p>"We are continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. This needs to stop," he said.</p>

<p>But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Syria's new rulers that he would respond "forcefully" if they allow "Iran to re-establish itself in Syria, or permits the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah".</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah meanwhile said it hoped that Syria's new rulers would "take a firm stand against Israeli occupation, while preventing foreign interference in its affairs".</p>

<p>The Britain-based Observatory said Israeli strikes had "destroyed the most important military sites in Syria".</p>

<p>The monitor said the strikes targeted weapons depots, naval vessels and a research centre that Western governments suspected of having links to chemical weapons production.</p>

<p>Israel, which borders Syria, also sent troops into the UN-patrolled buffer zone east of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The UN official in New York told AFP late Tuesday that Israeli forces were occupying seven locations in the buffer zone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel backer the United States said the incursion must be "temporary", after the United Nations said Israel was violating the 1974 armistice.</p>

<p>The Israeli defence minister said the military had orders to "establish a sterile defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats in southern Syria, without a permanent Israeli presence."</p>

<p>Fighting also continued in the north of the country, where battles between Turkish-backed and Kurdish-led forces left 218 people dead over the last three days, according to the Observatory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Indo-Pacific Commander, Admiral Samuel Paparo, expressed confidence in the US military's ability to defeat China in the Pacific. However, he warned that the US technical advantage over China is rapidly shrinking, Taipei Times reported citing The Washington Post report.</p>

<p>While addressing the Reagan Defence Forum on Saturday, Paparo emphasised the need for the US to maintain its technical lead over China. He highlighted two key areas for improvement: enhancing missile technology and developing a secure communications network that can withstand cyber attacks.</p>

<p>Further, he said, "Although the US is able to hit long-distance and difficult targets with its advanced cruise missile system, each launch costs more than USD 1 million. By contrast, drones, which are relatively cheap to build and develop, can be remotely controlled to fight on the front lines through a computer."</p>

<p>As per The Washington Post report, Paparo stated that "Russia and North Korea had reached an agreement on Moscow providing fourth-generation Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets in exchange for Pyongyang sending troops to help in the fight against Ukraine."</p>

<p>Pyongyang, rather than Moscow, proposed sending North Korean troops to Ukraine, Paparo said, adding that the condition was set so that Pyongyang could also obtain ballistic missile re-entry technology and submarine-related technology from Moscow, as per Taipei Times.</p>

<p>According to Paparo, North Korea on October 31 tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that reached an altitude of 7,000km.</p>

<p>"Even though Pyongyang continues to test long-range missiles with adequate range to reach the US ... the US has not yet seen evidence that North Korea has mastered the difficult task of building re-entry vehicles that could contain nuclear warheads, and that could withstand atmospheric resistance and heating when returning from space at a speed of 7km per second. This may help explain why the testing continues," he said.</p>

<p>"Chinese President Xi Jinping had given his military leaders the task of being ready to take Taiwan by 2027, even in the face of US military involvement, but it does not represent a decision to attack that year or any particular year," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stating that Israel has "no intention of interfering" in Syria's internal affairs, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned to take "necessary" measures if the current regime allows Iran to re-establish itself in Syria or transfers weapons to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs. However, we do intend to do what is necessary for our security. As such, I approve the Air Force bombing of strategic military capabilities left by Syrian military. So that they will not fall into the hands of the jihadists. This is similar to what the British Air Force did when it bombed the fleet of the Vichy regime, which was cooperating with the Nazis, so that it would not fall into the Nazis' hands," Netanyahu said in a video address on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We want to have relations with the new regime in Syria, but if this regime allows Iran to re-establish itself in Syria, or allow the transfer of Iranian weapons, or weapons of any kind to Hezbollah or attack us, we will respond forcefully and we will exact a heavy price. What happened to the previous regime will also happen to this one," he added.</p>

<p>On Sunday, when the Syrian rebels entered Damascus, forcing President Bashar al-Assad to flee from the country, ending his over two-decade rule in the country, Netanyahu hailed the collapse calling it a "historic day" for the Middle East region.</p>

<p>Netanyahu had further acknowledged that while the collapse presents great opportunities, it also poses significant dangers. He extended a 'hand of peace' for all beyond Israeli borders to live in peace with Israel.</p>

<p>Netanyahu had also shared a video on X and stated, "This is a historic day for the Middle East. The collapse of the Assad regime, the tyranny in Damascus, offers great opportunity but also is fraught with significant dangers. We send a hand of peace to all those beyond our border in Syria: to the Druze, to the Kurds, to the Christians, and to the Muslims who want to live in peace with Israel."</p>

<p>Following the Syrian Army abandoning its positions, Netanyahu on Sunday said that he had ordered the Israeli Army to take over these positions to ensure that no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel.</p>

<p>"This collapse is a direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad's main supporters. It set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its suppression. But it also means we have to take action against possible threats. One of them is the collapse of the Separation of Forces agreement from 1974 between Israel and Syria. This agreement held for 50 years. Last night it collapsed," he had said.<br />
Notably, the head of Syria's main opposition group abroad Hadi al-Bahra Syrian said on Sunday that Damascus is now "without Bashar al-Assad."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Tuesday evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, two days after rebel forces overthrew President Bashar Assad's authoritarian government.</p>

<p>The evacuation, coordinated by the embassies of India in Damascus and Beirut, was put into effect following an assessment of the security situation, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>"The Government of India today evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, following recent developments in that country," it said in a late-night statement.</p>

<p>"The evacuees included 44 'zaireen' from Jammu and Kashmir who were stranded at Saida Zainab. All Indian nationals have safely crossed over to Lebanon and will return by available commercial flights to India," it said.</p>

<p>The MEA said the government accords the highest priority to the safety and security of Indian nationals abroad.</p>

<p>"Indian nationals remaining in Syria are advised to stay in touch with the Indian Embassy in Damascus," it said.</p>

<p>"The government will continue to monitor the situation closely," the MEA added.</p>

<p>The Syrian government collapsed on Sunday as the rebels seized control of the capital Damascus after capturing several other prominent cities and towns. Assad fled the country after the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) took control of Damascus, marking the end of his family's 50-year rule.</p>

<p>Russian state media reported that Assad is in Moscow and will be given asylum. His nearly 14-year tenure was marked by civil war, bloodshed and brutal crackdown on his political opponents.</p>

<p>The MEA Monday said it is monitoring the unfolding developments in Syria and advocated a peaceful and inclusive Syrian-led political process going forward in that country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outgoing US President Joe Biden on Tuesday branded his successor Donald Trump's economic plans a "disaster" in a speech hailing his own legacy in office.</p>

<p>Biden said Trump's threats to impose huge tariffs on imports were a "major mistake" and urged the Republican to abandon proposed tax cuts.</p>

<p>The lame-duck president's speech comes after Trump won a second term largely on the back of US voters' anger at the high cost of living under the Democrats.</p>

<p>"I pray to God the president-elect throws away Project 2025. I think it'd be an economic disaster for us and the region," Biden said in his speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, referring to a conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Coughing frequently because of a cold, Biden said US consumers would pay the price for the tariffs that Trump has vowed to slap on US neighbors Mexico and Canada and on Asia-Pacific rival China.</p>

<p>Together they are the three biggest US trading partners.</p>

<p>"I believe this approach is a major mistake," Biden added.</p>

<p><strong>- Shadow president -</strong></p>

<p>The White House had touted Biden's speech as a "major address on his economic legacy" as the 82-year-old looks to the history books with less than six weeks left in office.</p>

<p>Biden dropped out of the 2024 race against Trump in July due to concerns about his age and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump comfortably defeated at the November polls.</p>

<p>Trump's inauguration is not until January 20 but he has already become something of a shadow president, making pronouncements on the economy and foreign policy and being feted by world leaders.</p>

<p>Biden has meanwhile kept a relatively low profile since the November 5 election, but he came out swinging in defense of his own record in front of an audience of economists.</p>

<p>He contrasted his "middle-out, bottom-up economic playbook" with what he called Trump's failed promise of "trickle-down economics" in which tax cuts for the wealthy are supposed to boost incomes across the board.</p>

<p>Biden also touted achievements including the US economy's recovery from the Covid pandemic and his huge investments in green technology and industry.</p>

<p>"President-elect Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history, which is the envy of the world," said Biden.</p>

<p>But the departing president said he regretted not signing his own name to Covid stimulus checks sent out to Americans, like Trump had done.</p>

<p>"I also learned something with Donald Trump. He signed checks for people for 7,400 bucks," he said. "And I didn't -- stupid!"</p>

<p>Biden ended his speech with a broader plea for US leadership in a troubled world, even as Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to take a more isolationist stance.</p>

<p>"If we do not lead the world, what nation leads the world? Who pulls Europe together? Who tries to pull the Middle East together?"he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.</p>

<p>Astronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.</p>

<p>The three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.</p>

<p>Because the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED</strong></h2>

<p>The team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.</p>

<p>His team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.</p>

<p>The team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or&nbsp; minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>Carbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.</p>

<h2><strong>INSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY</strong></h2>

<p>While scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.</p>

<p>It helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.</p>

<p>Gravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.</p>

<h2><strong>THE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE</strong></h2>

<p>The astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.</p>

<p>The facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.</p>

<p>The APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.</p>

<p>The ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.<br />

<p>Brazil's 79-year-old President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is recovering from emergency surgery after suffering an intracranial hemorrhage, has a long history of health problems and mishaps.</p>

<p>But just as in politics, the hyperactive leftist -- who is half-way through his third term -- has bounced back from every misfortune.</p>

<h2><strong>- Lost a finger -</strong></h2>

<p>In 1964, when he was a metalworker in a car parts factory, Lula lost the little finger on his left hand in a workplace accident.</p>

<p>Lula, who was 19 at the time, said that a press broke and, when he tried to fix it, his finger was crushed.</p>

<p>He went on to become a trade union leader before entering politics.</p>

<h3><strong>- Hypertension scare -</strong></h3>

<p>Lula was forced to cancel a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2010 after being admitted to hospital with alarmingly high blood pressure.</p>

<p>He was 64 years old at the time and nearing the end of his second term.</p>

<p>Doctors said he was suffering from stress and fatigue after a bout of flu.</p>

<p>He was discharged from hospital after a few hours and subsequently quit smoking after fifty years.</p>

<p><strong>- Larynx cancer -</strong></p>

<p>After leaving power in 2011, at 66, he was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>

<p>Doctors announced he had made a full recovery the following year, although his once-booming voice was left with a hoarseness that became a trademark on his campaign trail return.</p>

<p>During the 2022 presidential race, which marked his stunning return to power after a year and a half behind bars on corruption charges, some of his opponents questioned his health because of his weak voice.</p>

<p>Three weeks after his re-election, he underwent surgery to remove a lesion from his vocal cords.</p>

<h3><strong>- Hip replacement -</strong></h3>

<p>In September 2023, he received a hip replacement to relieve pain that had been bothering him for over a year.</p>

<p>Lula suffers from osteoarthritis, or wear and tear on the cartilage that protects joints.</p>

<p>The image-conscious president has since published videos of himself doing exercises in the presidential residence.</p>

<h3><strong>- Bathroom fall -</strong></h3>

<p>On October 19, 2024, he fell in his bathroom and hit his head, for which he received stitches.</p>

<p>Following that accident, he canceled his participation in a meeting of the BRICS bloc in Russia and worked from his official residence for several days.</p>

<h3><strong>- Hemorrhage in head -</strong></h3>

<p>Doctors on Monday discovered an intracranial hemorrhage related to the fall, for which the president underwent emergency surgery in the early hours of December 10 in Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>His medical team assured he did not suffer any brain damage.</p>

<p>He will remain under observation in intensive care for the next 48 hours and will remain hospitalized until next week, doctors said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump believes birthright-citizenship is "ridiculous" and wants to end it after taking office on January 20th. A guarantee that has been enshrined in the Constitution for more than 150 years.</p>

<p>The United States grants citizenship to children born within its borders, regardless of the citizenship of its parents. However, that will soon change.</p>

<p>"We're going to have to get it changed," Mr. Trump said in an interview. "We'll maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it." Although he had raised this issue during his first term as well, nothing substantial happened.</p>

<p>"It's not the practice of every country, and Trump and his supporters have argued that the system is being abused and that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen," Russell A Stamets, Partner at Circle of Counsels, told Business Standard.</p>

<p>The right of birthright citizenship is based on the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and is well-established under US law, so elimination would encounter significant legal challenges.</p>

<p>The 14th Amendment says, "All persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."</p>

<p>Trump and other opponents of this policy say that this enables "birth tourism", a phenomenon where pregnant women enter the US specifically to give birth in order for their children to have US citizenship before coming back to their home countries.</p>

<p>"Simply crossing the border and having a child should not entitle anyone to citizenship," said Eric Ruark, director of research for NumbersUSA, which argues for reducing immigration, as per the Associated Press.</p>

<p>Trump also said, "I don't want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back", which means legal citizens would also be expelled in order to keep families together.</p>

<p>A 2011 factsheet by the American Immigration Council says that removing birthright citizenship would affect everyone, and it will get difficult for American parents to prove citizenship of their children.</p>

<p>"Our birth certificates are proof of our citizenship. If birthright citizenship were eliminated, US citizens could no longer use their birth certificates as proof of citizenship," the factsheet says.</p>

<p>According to Pew Research's analysis of the 2022 US Census, about 4.8 million Indian-Americans are living in America, of which 34 per cent, or 1.6 million, were born in the country. These individuals are citizens of the United States under the current law. If Trump were to abolish this law, 1.6 million Indians will be impacted.</p>

<p>However, the president cannot amend the Constitution and an executive effort to restrict the right would amount to violation of the 14th Amendment.</p>

<p>"I don't take his statements very seriously. He has been saying things like this for almost a decade," Alex Nowrasteh, vice president at the pro-immigration Cato Institute told the Associated Press. "He didn't do anything to further this agenda when he was president before."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight people were killed and three more injured when a six-storey residential building collapsed in central Cairo on Tuesday, Egypt's health ministry said.</p>

<p>Nine ambulances were dispatched to the scene as rescuers worked to "lift rubble and search for any wounded or bodies", health ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghaffar said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I woke up to a sound of a huge explosion," Waleed Mohamed, 38, told AFP near the site of the rubble.</p>

<p>He said he and fellow neighbours ran "towards the building and saw it collapsed, the gas pipe exploded and everything was destroyed," he said.</p>

<p>A restoration order had been issued in 1993 for the building, which was constructed in the 1960s in Cairo's lower-middle income Al-Waili neighbourhood, according to district head Ahmed Awad, state newspaper Al-Ahram reported.</p>

<p>But "the building's residents had appealed the order and it was not executed," the official said.</p>

<p>Neighbouring buildings were evacuated Tuesday as a precautionary measure, according to a statement from Cairo governorate.</p>

<p>A large number of the buildings in central Cairo have gone unrestored since they were built in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p>Greater Cairo -- a sprawling metropolis home to over 26 million people -- has seen a number of deadly building collapses in recent years, both due to the dilapidated state of some and, at times, failure to comply with building regulations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's atomic bomb survivors' group Nihon Hidankyo accepted its Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday, pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons that are resurging as a threat 80 years after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.</p>

<p>One of the three Nihon Hidankyo co-chairs, 92-year-old Nagasaki survivor Terumi Tanaka, demanded "action from governments to achieve" a nuclear-free world.</p>

<p>The prize was presented at a time when countries like Russia -- which has the world's largest nuclear arsenal -- increasingly brandish the atomic threat.</p>

<p>"I am infinitely saddened and angered that the 'nuclear taboo' threatens to be broken," Tanaka told dignitaries at Oslo's City Hall, some clad in traditional Norwegian bunads or Japanese kimonos.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats as he presses the war in Ukraine. He signed a decree in November lowering the threshold for using atomic weapons.</p>

<p>In a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro a few days later, the Russian army fired a new hypersonic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, although in this instance it had a regular payload.</p>

<p>Nihon Hidankyo works to rid the planet of the weapons of mass destruction, relying on testimonies from survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, known as "hibakusha".</p>

<p>The US bombings of the Japanese cities on August 6 and 9, 1945 killed 214,000 people, leading to Japan's surrender in World War II.</p>

<p><strong>Burnt bodies</strong></p>

<p>Tanaka was 13 years old when Nagasaki was bombed, the epicentre just three kilometres (1.8 miles) west of his home. Five members of his family were killed.</p>

<p>He was upstairs reading a book when the A-bomb was dropped.</p>

<p>"I heard the explosion and all of a sudden saw a bright white light, which surrounded everything and everything became silent," he recalled.</p>

<p>"I was really surprised. I felt my life in danger."</p>

<p>Rushing to the ground floor, he lost consciousness when two glass doors, blown out by the detonation, fell on him, though the glass did not break.</p>

<p>Three days later, he and his mother went searching for their relatives. That was when they realised the scope of the disaster.</p>

<p>"When we reached a ridge over the hills, we could look down over the city and that was when, for the first time, we saw that there was absolutely nothing left. Everything was black and charred."</p>

<p>He saw gravely wounded people fleeing the city, burnt bodies on the roadside. He and his mother cremated his aunt's body "with our own hands".</p>

<p>"I was numb, not able to feel anything."</p>

<p>Nihon Hidankyo's ranks are dwindling with every passing year. The Japanese government lists around 106,800 "hibakusha" still alive today. Their average age is 85.</p>

<p><strong>'Uphold nuclear taboo'</strong></p>

<p>For the West, the nuclear threat also comes from North Korea, which has increased its ballistic missile tests, and Iran, which is suspected of seeking to develop nuclear weapons though it denies this.</p>

<p>Nine countries now have nuclear weapons: Britain, China, France, India, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the United States, and, unofficially, Israel.</p>

<p>"Our movement has undoubtedly played a major role in creating the 'nuclear taboo'," Tanaka said.</p>

<p>"However, there still remain 12,000 nuclear warheads on Earth today, 4,000 of which are operationally deployed, ready for immediate launch."</p>

<p>In 2017, 122 governments negotiated and adopted a UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), but the text is considered largely symbolic as no nuclear power has signed it.</p>

<p>While all ambassadors stationed in Oslo were invited to Tuesday's ceremony, the only nuclear powers in attendance were Britain, France, India, Pakistan and the United States. Russia, China, Israel and Iran were not present, the Nobel Institute said.</p>

<p>Expressing concern about the world entering "a new, more unstable nuclear age", Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman Jorgen Watne Frydnes warned that "a nuclear war could destroy our civilisation".</p>

<p>"Today's nuclear weapons ... have far greater destructive power than the two bombs used against Japan in 1945. They could kill millions of us in an instant, injure even more, and disrupt the climate catastrophically," he warned.</p>

<p>Later, the Nobel laureates for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics received their prizes from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf at a separate ceremony in Stockholm, followed by a banquet for some 1,250 guests.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh on Tuesday acknowledged 88 incidents of communal violence against minorities, primarily Hindus, following the ouster of then-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.</p>

<p>Interim government head Muhammad Yunus' press secretary Shafiqul Alam also said that 70 people have been arrested in those incidents.</p>

<p>He made the disclosure a day after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri flagged regrettable incidents of attacks on minorities and conveyed India's concerns, including those related to the safety and welfare of minorities, during his meetings with the Bangladeshi leadership.</p>

<p>A total of 88 cases have been filed in incidents related to minorities from August 5 to October 22, Alam told reporters.</p>

<p>"The number of cases and arrests is likely to increase as new incidents of violence have also been reported in (northeastern Sunamganj, (central) Gazipur, and other areas," he said.</p>

<p>He added that there might be cases where some victims were members of the previous ruling party.</p>

<p>The government has so far insisted that other than a few incidents, Hindus were not attacked because of their faiths.</p>

<p>"Some attacks targeted individuals who were former members of the ruling party or they were the result of personal disputes. Nevertheless, since violence occurred, the police are taking appropriate action," he said.</p>

<p>Alam said that details regarding the incidents that took place after October 22 will be shared soon.</p>

<p>There have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in Bangladesh in the last few weeks that triggered strong concerns in New Delhi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Argentine court on Tuesday dismissed rape charges against two French international rugby players accused of assaulting a woman after playing a match in the country, the players' lawyers said.</p>

<p>"As we expected, the French players have been acquitted because the (sexual) act was consensual, meaning there was no crime and no doubt that they are innocent," defense attorney German Hnatow said after the hearing in the city of Mendoza.</p>

<p>Hugo Auradou and Oscar Jegou, both 21, were arrested two days after winning their first international caps for France against Argentina in Mendoza, about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) west of the capital Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Their 39-year-old accuser, whom they met in a nightclub on the night of their July 6 match, said they assaulted her viciously in a hotel room.</p>

<p>Auradou, a lock with French club Pau, and Jegou, a flanker with the club La Rochelle, insisted they had consensual sex with the woman after a night of drinking.</p>

<p>The players were kept in preventive custody for a little over a week and then under house arrest for nearly a month before being allowed to return to France in September after prosecutors said the case against them appeared flimsy.</p>

<p>The prosecution later called for the charges of aggravated rape -- a charge used for gang rape -- to be dropped.</p>

<p>The players, who returned to their Top 14 teams in France, were not present in Argentina for Tuesday's ruling.</p>

<p>Their Parisian lawyer, Antoine Vey, on Tuesday hailed their "judicial rehabilitation."</p>

<p>He added that for the players' "clubs, families and the (French rugby) federation, it was a day they have been waiting for and, which, I hope, will close the difficult chapter that they experienced."</p>

<p>The complainant has not yet announced whether she plans to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>The accusations against Auradou and Jegou, coupled with racist remarks by full-back Melvyn Jaminet, for which he was sent home and given a 34-week suspension, overshadowed the French team's summer tour of Argentina.</p>

<p>French rugby federation president Florian Grill last month announced an overhaul of disciplinary measures in the wake of the scandals.</p>

<p>He also vowed to put an end to the kind of "fourth and fifth half" post-match celebrations that took place in Mendoza.</p>

<p>"There will be financial or sporting sanctions" in the future, he continued regretting in previous years "a form of acceptance of these excesses which could sometimes even be organised."</p>

<p>"We cannot take all the positives from rugby, ask brands and partners to associate their image with our presupposed values and not respect them," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

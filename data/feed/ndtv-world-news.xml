       <description><![CDATA[In a one-minute video posted on Facebook on Sunday, Lawful-Sanders said, "effective immediately I am no longer an on-air host at WURD."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Radio host Andrea Lawful-Sanders who recently interviewed US President Joe Biden and claimed that the questions asked of President were provided in advance has resigned from WURD Radio, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/07/media/biden-interview-radio-host-philadelphia/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The interview featured pre-determined questions provided by the White House, which violates our practice of remaining an independent media outlet accountable to our listeners," Sara Lomax, president and CEO of the Philadelphia-based station, announced in a statement posted Sunday on its <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://wurdradio.com/2024/07/07/accountability-access-and-a-path-forward-why-black-media-matters/">website</a></em>. "As a result, Ms. Lawful-Sanders and WURD Radio have mutually agreed to part ways, effective immediately."</p>

<p>WURD is Pennsylvania's sole Black-owned talk radio station. Ms Lomax emphasized that the station prides itself on being an independent and trustworthy voice for its main audience of Black Philadelphians. She stated that using pre-provided questions "jeopardizes that trust and is not a practice that WURD Radio engages in or endorses as a matter of practice or official policy."</p>

<p>"WURD Radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other Administration," she added.</p>

<p>Lawful-Sanders, who hosted "The Source," interviewed Biden last week, asking him four questions about the election's stakes, his achievements, his debate performance, and his message to undecided voters. In a Saturday interview with CNN's Victor Blackwell, she revealed that these questions were among eight recommended to her by Biden's aides prior to the interview.</p>

<p>"The questions were sent to me for approval. I approved them," she said.</p>

<p>In a one-minute video posted on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/443556475259170"><em>Facebook </em></a>on Sunday, Lawful-Sanders said, “effective immediately I am no longer an on-air host at WURD. I tendered my resignation yesterday. It was accepted.”</p>

<p>She then thanked “all of you who played a part in this journey, including WURD Radio.” She went on to say that she is “grateful,” and that “Life is moving. Things are shifting and changing. And, in a day or so you'll hear more.”</p>

<p>The move has intensified the ongoing controversy surrounding Biden's sharpness, following his lackluster performance in the first presidential debate hosted by CNN. Many top Democrats have expressed frustration and concern over his debate performance, with some suggesting that he should reconsider accepting the party's nomination.</p>

<p>"If the White House is trying now to prove the vim, vigor ... of the president, I don't know how they do that by sending questions first before the interview so that the president knows what's coming," said Ms Blackwell.</p>

<p>Ms Blackwell further revealed that both Lawful-Sanders and Earl Ingram, host of "The Earl Ingram Show" in Milwaukee who also interviewed the president this week, asked Biden "essentially the same questions."</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson did not deny the campaign provided questions, but said, "We do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions."</p>

<p>"It's not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer. These questions were relevant to the news of the day - the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he'd delivered for black Americans," spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>However, the spokesperson later said that it will no longer suggest questions to interviewers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions they please, moving forward we will refrain from offering suggested questions," a source familiar with the Biden booking operation told CNN.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), an alliance of parties hastily assembled after President Emmanuel Macron called a surprise snap parliamentary election, looked set to score a shock win in Sunday's vote over the far right and the ruling centrists.</p>

<p>If initial projections are confirmed, Macron will be required to name a prime minister from the bloc. The initial estimates are typically accurate.</p>

<p>The NFP - made up of the Communist Party, the hard left France Unbowed, the Green party and the Socialist Party - has not said who would be its pick for prime minister. The following are some of its best-known figures:</p>

<h2><strong>Jean-Luc Melenchon, Hard Left France Unbowed Party</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/1bfh2fqo_jeanluc-melenchon-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Jean-Luc Melenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party.</p>

<p>He ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.</p>

<p>A fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing some voters while horrifying others with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies.</p>

<h2><strong>Marine Tondelier, Leader Of The Greens</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/7d40ep0o_marine-tondelier-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Tondelier, 37, grew up in Henin-Beaumont, a town in northern France that is well-known as a bastion of the far-right National Rally (RN) and its leader Le Pen.</p>

<p>Tondelier has a long record of opposing the RN.</p>

<p>She was elected as an opposition member of the town's municipal council in 2014. She documented her experiences working under an RN mayor and what she described as the oppressive atmosphere generated by the far-right administration in a 2017 book entitled "News from the Front".</p>

<p>Tondelier was also elected to a northern regional council in 2021, and she became leader of France's best-known ecologist party, the Greens, the following year.</p>

<h2><strong>Raphael Glucksmann, Socialist Party</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/4lk4lpl8_raphael-glucksmann-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Raphael Glucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections in early June. It obtained nearly 14% of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion.</p>

<p>Glucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili.</p>

<p>He advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion.</p>

<h2><strong>Laurent Berger, Former CFDT Trade Union Leader</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/ctana8e_laurent-berger-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Laurent Berger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the RN.</p>

<p>Berger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slammed Seoul Monday for recent military drills near the border, saying the South must be "suicidal" and warning of a "terrible disaster".</p>

<p>After Pyongyang sent multiple barrages of trash-carrying balloons across the border, Seoul last month fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and resumed live-fire drills on border islands and by the demilitarised zone that divides the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong, who is a key regime spokesperson, said this was "an undisguised war game (and) an inexcusable and explicit provocation that aggravates the situation," according to a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.</p>

<p>South Korea's border drills were "suicidal hysteria, for which they will have to sustain terrible disaster," she added.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong said it was "clear to everyone... the riskiness of the above-said reckless live ammunition firing drills of the ROK army coming nearer to the border of the DPRK," referring to the South by its official name, the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>If Seoul's exercises breach the North's sovereignty, Kim Yo Jong warned: "our armed forces will immediately carry out its mission," without giving further details.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with Pyongyang ramping up weapons testing as it draws ever closer to Russia.</p>

<p>Seoul and Washington have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for use in the war in Ukraine -- which would violate rafts of sanctions on both countries.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the nuclear-armed North declared Seoul its chief enemy, and has jettisoned agencies designed for outreach and diplomacy with Seoul, while ramping up security along the shared border.</p>

<p>North Korean soldiers have crossed the border three times in recent weeks, likely accidentally Seoul's military says, while they were working to lay mines, clear foliage and build likely anti-tank barriers.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong also criticised recent trilateral drills between the United States, South Korea and Japan, saying they were "the height of confrontational hysteria".</p>

<p>"The war drumbeats clearly showed that the US and other hostile forces' rash manoeuvres for military hegemony in the region have crossed the red line," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida man is facing a felony robbery charge after allegedly attempting to withdraw 1 cent from a bank in Sumter County, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/06/us-news/florida-man-michael-fleming-tries-to-withdraw-1-cent-from-bank-gets-hit-with-robbery-charge/"><em>New York Post</em></a>. The Sumter County Sheriff's Office's arrest affidavit states the incident occurred just before 2 pm on Saturday at the Chase Bank on US-441 in Lady Lake.</p>

<p>The man, identified as Michael Fleming, entered the bank, filled out a withdrawal slip for 1 cent, and handed it to a teller. The teller reportedly informed Fleming that he couldn't withdraw just a penny.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-he-has-cleaned-a-lot-of-toilets-elon-musk-responds-6053618">Also Read|&nbsp;Nvidia's Jensen Huang Says He Has ''Cleaned A Lot Of Toilets'', Elon Musk Responds</a></p>

<p>"So you want me to say the other word?" Fleming reportedly told the bank teller, according to the arrest report. No further details about their conversation were provided in the affidavit, but deputies stated that the teller was afraid of potential violence and called law enforcement.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived, Fleming was still inside the bank and was taken into custody, the affidavit said. He was transported to the Sumter County Sheriff's Office, where he agreed to speak with deputies after being read his Miranda Rights.</p>

<p>Although the details of this conversation were redacted from the report, deputies stated they had probable cause to believe Fleming violated Florida's robbery laws, according to the affidavit.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old man was then taken to the Sumter County Detention Center, where he remains on $5,000 bond as of Tuesday afternoon, according to online jail records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic and appalling incident, a father has been arrested for the heinous act of burying his 15-day-old daughter alive in Tharushah, as reported by ARY News.</p>

<p>Police officials disclosed that the father, identified as Tayyab, confessed to this grievous deed, citing financial constraints that prevented him from affording medical treatment for his infant daughter. Tayyab admitted to placing the newborn in a sack before burying her.</p>

<p>A case has been formally lodged against Tayyab, who has admitted guilt in the matter. Authorities have indicated that pursuant to a court directive, the child's grave will be opened for forensic examination through postmortem procedures, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>In a separate incident that took place in Lahore's Defence B area, where a husband and wife allegedly subjected a 13-year-old domestic worker to severe abuse, including stripping and physical torture.</p>

<p>Following a complaint filed by the worker's mother, law enforcement promptly registered a First Information Report (FIR) against the accused, Hassam. Hassam has been detained in connection with the incident, while efforts to apprehend his wife are reportedly ongoing.</p>

<p>According to the FIR, Tehreem was subjected to continued physical abuse, including being stripped naked, allegedly over suspicions of theft. Her mother asserted in the FIR that her daughter sustained fractures to her hand and nose during the ordeal.</p>

<p>The Superintendent of Police (SP) Cantt assured that those responsible for the reprehensible acts against Tehreem would be brought to justice swiftly, ARY News reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The champagne was on ice at the far-right National Rally's (RN) headquarters, but the celebratory mood swiftly turned to disbelief when the first projected results from Sunday's parliamentary election appeared on TV screens.</p>

<p>For days, Marine Le Pen had confidently predicted that her party would triumph with an outright majority and her protege Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Instead, the National Rally was on course to come third, behind a left-wing alliance and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc.</p>

<p>It was undone to a large extent by tactical dealmaking between centrist and leftist opponents, who pulled more than 200 candidates from three-way races to avoid splitting the anti-RN vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The projected result brought to a shuddering halt what had appeared to be the far right's relentless rise in France, carefully engineered by Le Pen who had sough to clean up her party's image and tap the grievances of voters angry over living costs, strained public services, and immigration.</p>

<p>To be sure, Le Pen and her party have suffered disappointment before, most recently her 2022 defeat to Macron in the presidential election, and have managed to bounce back more strongly than before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But for now, the outcome was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<p>"The results are disappointing and they don't represent what French people want," said Jocelyn Cousin, 18, who had come to party HQ expecting a victory party.</p>

<p>The RN's momentum had appeared unstoppable after it trounced the centrists in European elections in early June and came first, ahead of the hastily assembled leftist New Popular Front, in the first round of the parliamentary vote on June 30.</p>

<p>Le Pen and Bardella attributed their party's setback on Sunday to the what Bardella called the "disgraceful alliance" the anti-RN forces, who he said had caricatured the party and disrespected its voters.</p>

<p>But IPSOS pollster Brice Teinturier pointed to the RN's own shortcomings, including revelations before the run-off that several of its candidates had expressed xenophobic views, raising questions over whether the party had really ditched its more toxic past.</p>

<p>"What happened is also that RN candidates themselves showed in this campaign that they either were not ready or had in their ranks candidates that are antisemitic, xenophobic or homophobic," Teinturier told France 2 television.</p>

<p><strong>'TIDE IS RISING'</strong></p>

<p>Florent de Kersauson, an RN candidate in Brittany in western France, acknowledged the fallout had been damaging. But he also said voters may have felt the party was arrogant in predicting an absolute majority.</p>

<p>"I thought it was strange that they said that," said Kersauson, who lost his race against a pro-Macron candidate. "It seemed like something that was very hard to achieve."</p>

<p>Bardella and Le Pen strove to put a brave face on their result. The party had increased its share of seats in the National Assembly to a record high, they noted, vowing to keep fighting until they won power.</p>

<p>"The tide is rising, but it didn't rise quite high enough this time," said Le Pen, who is likely to mount her fourth presidential campaign in 2027. "Our victory has merely been delayed."</p>

<p>That was also the feeling among many of the supporters gathered at party HQ in Paris.</p>

<p>"I see our victory coming. People are going to understand that the National Rally is not so horrible. I believe it will happen in 2027. I have a lot of hope and I'll continue to fight," said Elea da Cunha, 17.</p>

<p>Frederic-Pierre Vos, a close associate of Le Pen and former RN party lawyer elected in a constituency north of Paris, said the hung parliament thrown up by the election would mean an ungovernable France, providing fresh opportunities for RN in 2027.</p>

<p>Yet despite the party's fighting talk, Sunday's outcome was a clear setback.</p>

<p>Business newspaper Les Echos ran a front page showing a grim-faced Bardella with the headline "la claque" or "the slap".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several top House Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections, CNN reported.</p>

<p>The sentiments were revealed during a leadership call organised by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday, aimed at gauging the opinions of ranking members and leaders before the return of members to Washington this week.</p>

<p>According to sources familiar with the call, the discussion was dominated by apprehensions regarding the potential damage Biden's candidacy could inflict on the Democratic ticket and the party's prospects of reclaiming the House majority. Jeffries, however, did not disclose his own stance on whether Biden should continue running for re-election, leaving the issue open for debate among the participants, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>The call saw a notable division among House Democrats, with a greater number of lawmakers advocating for Biden to step aside than those who voiced support for his candidacy.</p>

<p>Notable figures among those opposing Biden included Representatives Mark Takano, Adam Smith, Jim Himes, Joe Morelle, Jerry Nadler, and Susan Wild. Conversely, Representatives Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott were reported to have spoken in favour of Biden, underscoring the internal divisions within the party leadership.</p>

<p>One of the primary concerns raised during the nearly two-hour call was the perceived risk of losing the opportunity to secure a House majority if Biden were to remain the Democratic nominee. Several participants expressed a preference for Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the ticket, viewing her as a potentially stronger candidate.</p>

<p>"It was pretty brutal," remarked a senior Democratic aide anonymously to CNN, describing the intensity of the discussions that unfolded during the private call among House leaders.</p>

<p>The aide indicated that no immediate decisions regarding formal demands or actions, such as a White House meeting or a letter to Biden, were expected before the full Democratic caucus convenes on Tuesday. Jeffries reportedly emphasised that members would be allowed to voice their opinions freely and make their own judgments on the matter.</p>

<p>Another senior House Democrat revealed that sentiment within the caucus overwhelmingly supports Biden stepping aside. The member emphasised that while there is respect for Biden's lengthy career in public service, there is a growing consensus that the party needs to strategise effectively to move forward.</p>

<p>Tuesday's scheduled caucus meeting was anticipated to be a pivotal moment for Biden, according to sources within the Democratic Party. Many Democrats dissatisfied with Biden's recent debate performance are awaiting Jeffries' public stance on the matter. Thus far, Jeffries has maintained a cautious approach, refraining from publicly endorsing any particular course of action as he continues to assess the sentiments within his caucus.</p>

<p>President Biden, meanwhile, appeared confident during a visit to battleground Pennsylvania, affirming his belief in the Democratic Party's unified support behind him. When questioned by the press, Biden unequivocally asserted that the party continues to stand behind him, CNN reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least five Democratic lawmakers expressed their view on Sunday that President Joe Biden should step down from the US presidential election scheduled for November 5, according to multiple news reports.</p>

<p>The lawmakers -- Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano, Joe Morelle, Ted Lieu and Adam Smith -- expressed their view in this regard during a Democratic Party phone call organised to discuss Biden's disastrous debate performance against his Republican rival, Donald Trump, in Atlanta on June 27.</p>

<p>Biden himself has described his performance as "a bad night". His approval ratings have come down and his own party colleagues have started questioning his health and ability to govern the country for the next four years. Biden has asserted that he is staying in the race and exuded confidence that he will win the election against Trump in November.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had convened a virtual meeting of his party colleagues in the House of Representatives to discuss the evolving political scenarios after the June 27 presidential debate between Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>The virtual meeting was billed as a "listening session" to get inputs from members about the viability of Biden's candidacy, "The New York Times" reported, adding that it was clear before the call that many top Democrats felt strongly that Biden had to go.</p>

<p>Congressman Smith, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said it is time for Biden to go, according to two people familiar with the call, the daily reported. The four other Congressmen also felt the same and believed it was time for Biden to exit the race.</p>

<p>"Lieu was the highest-ranking person in the House Democratic leadership to support pressing for Biden to not seek reelection," "The Washington Post" reported.</p>

<p>"The developments opened a wide crack in Biden's wall of support, bringing the number of House Democrats publicly or privately saying he should step aside to about 10. They included the top Democrats on the Judiciary, Armed Services and Intelligence committees. The defections cast further doubts on Biden's path forward, even as he largely controls his own fate thanks to sweeping the Democratic presidential primaries," "The Wall Street Journal" reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Biden and his team appeared defiant to such a call and asserted that he is in the race. Biden himself has exuded confidence that he would defeat Trump in November.</p>

<p>Biden was in Pennsylvania on Sunday, addressing rallies and meeting people in the key battleground state.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian writer <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/5-classic-short-stories-of-canadian-noble-laureate-alice-munro-who-died-at-92-5663690">Alice Munro's daughter</a> said Sunday that her stepfather sexually abused her as a child and that her mother was told but stayed with him, in a damning account published after the Nobel laureate's death.</p>

<p>Andrea Robin Skinner wrote in the Toronto Star that she was nine when, in 1976, "one night, while she (Munro) was away, her husband, my stepfather, Gerald Fremlin, climbed into the bed where I was sleeping and sexually assaulted me."</p>

<p>She wrote that when she was alone with Fremlin -- who died in 2013 -- he "exposed himself during car rides, told me about the little girls in the neighborhood he liked, and described my mother's sexual needs."</p>

<p>Skinner said that, when she was 25, she shared everything that had happened with Munro -- but acclaimed author decided to stay with Fremlin, whom she wed in the 1970s after her first marriage ended.</p>

<p>"She reacted exactly as I had feared she would, as if she had learned of an infidelity," Skinner wrote of Munro.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We all went back to acting as if nothing had happened. It was what we did," she added.</p>

<p>At 38, Skinner said she took her allegations to the police after Munro complimented her husband in a New York Times interview. Fremlin pleaded guilty in 2005 to indecent assault.</p>

<p>"What I wanted was some record of the truth, some public proof that I hadn't deserved what had happened to me," Skinner wrote.</p>

<p>"I also wanted this story, my story, to become part of the stories people tell about my mother," she added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Emmanuel Macron has avoided his nightmare scenario of the far right coming to power in France but still faces an unprecedented challenge steering his country and the remainder of his presidency through an uncertain future.</p>

<p>Macron's centrist forces performed more strongly than expected in the legislative elections, projected to come in second behind the resurgent left, with the far right that won the first round on June 30 in only third place.</p>

<p>Yet as he prepares to fly to the United States for a NATO summit in Washington, he now faces a number of headaches including a left that now believes it has a mandate to govern, his own unpopularity, and open dissent among some of his most influential allies.</p>

<p>There is still palpable anger among Macron's allies over his decision to call snap legislative elections three years ahead of time after his party was trounced in EU Parliament elections last month.</p>

<p>The president argued that a "clarification" was needed in French politics.</p>

<p>"The decision to dissolve the National Assembly, which was supposed to be a moment of clarification, has instead led to uncertainty," his former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Sunday in an unusually sharp barb.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who said he would offer his resignation Monday but was also prepared to stay on, said in an extraordinary show of dissent after the election that he "did not choose this dissolution".</p>

<h3><strong>'The question now'</strong></h3>

<p>The government's strategy of employing a so-called Republican Front for the centre and left to team up to block the far right appears to have worked.</p>

<p>But the election will mark a turning point in Macron's presidency with three years of his term still to run until 2027, with the very mixed new parliament inevitably becoming a far more important actor.</p>

<p>Macron appeared in no hurry on this occasion to make a rapid and theatrical decision, with an aide briefing media that the president preferred to analyse the full results before jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p>The president is confident "and is not going for a small majority", the aide said. "The question now is who is going to govern and have a majority."</p>

<p>Philippe raised the prospect of a broad coalition that would take in parties from right to left via the centre, but exclude the far-right National Rally (RN) and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI).</p>

<p>So far the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) has not fractured even if the LFI's firebrand figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon is a constant source of tension.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne, who leads Macron's party, ruled out that Melenchon "and a certain number of his allies" would govern France.</p>

<p>But Laurent Wauquiez, a senior figure among traditional right-wing lawmakers, who won his seat, appeared to rule out entering into any coalition with Macron.</p>

<h3><strong>'Tide is rising'</strong></h3>

<p>Macron's own popularity has hit such a low that he stayed totally out of the final week of the election campaign, not making a single comment in public as the vastly more popular Attal took the lead.</p>

<p>After voting Sunday he mingled with well-wishers in Le Touquet, but did not repeat his walk through the fashionable Channel resort in a bomber jacket and baseball cap as he did in the June 30 first round, seen as arrogant by some supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political manoeuvring will intensify beneath him. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who won his seat, has made it clear he plans to be a leading voice in the new parliament, possibly in alliance with the faction of Philippe.</p>

<p>And while the far right was defeated in these elections, its three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said she believed this would have no impact on her ambition to win the Elysee Palace in 2027.</p>

<p>"The tide is rising. It did not rise high enough this time, but it continues to rise and, consequently, our victory has only been delayed," Le Pen said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement said on Sunday it launched its "largest" air operation, sending explosive drones at a mountaintop Israeli military intelligence base in the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>It is the latest incident among escalating cross-border exchanges of fire that have triggered global alarm.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Hamas ally, has traded almost daily fire with Israeli forces since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Announcing "the largest operation" carried out by its aerial forces, Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters sent "multiple, successive squadrons of drones to target the reconnaissance centre" on Mount Hermon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said an explosive drone "fell in an open area in the Mount Hermon area" but there were "no injuries".</p>

<p>Attacks as well as rhetoric have escalated in recent weeks, spurring fears of an all-out conflict between Israel and Hezbollah which last went to war in 2006.</p>

<p>The Lebanese movement said the drone attack was part of its "response" to the killing of an operative in a strike Saturday deep into east Lebanon around 100 kilometres (60 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>The Mount Hermon attack targeted intelligence systems, "destroying them and starting a major fire", Hezbollah said.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant visited troops on Mount Hermon earlier on Sunday, his office said.</p>

<p>In two additional statements, the military said its air defences "successfully intercepted" several "aerial targets" that crossed from Lebanon after sirens sounded in the Golan Heights area.</p>

<p>Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and later annexed it in a move largely unrecognised by the international community.</p>

<p>The Israeli strike on Saturday killed "a key operative in Hezbollah's Aerial Defence Unit", the military has said.</p>

<p>Throughout Sunday, Hezbollah announced four more attacks on Israeli military sites across the border with barrages of rockets as well as some guided missiles. Israeli authorities reported four wounded.</p>

<p>Gallant, in a video from Mount Hermon, said that "even if there is a ceasefire" in Gaza, "we will continue fighting and doing everything necessary to bring about the desired result" in the campaign against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed at least 497 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, at least 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed, according to the authorities.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of residents have been displaced from the border areas in both southern Lebanon and northern Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All ten elderly residents of a Uruguayan nursing home died Sunday after an early-morning fire from which the lone caretaker was the only person to escape, authorities said.</p>

<p>Eight women and two men died from the blaze at the six-roomed facility in the city of Treinta y Tres in the South American country's east, according to an official statement.</p>

<p>Firefighters found the main entrance shuttered on their arrival, it added. Once inside, they found a fire in the living room with smoke having spread throughout the facility.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old caretaker had managed to get out safely through a garage, said the statement.</p>

<p>Seven of the residents died on the scene from smoke inhalation, while three others were rushed to hospital in a critical condition, but did not survive.</p>

<p>The incident came just ten days after a fire at another nursing home for the elderly and people with psychiatric disorders in the city of Melo, also in Uruguay's east.</p>

<p>In that case, a 77-year-old man and 72-year-old woman died in hospital after they were evacuated with 40 other residents.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's new defence minister pledged on Sunday to deliver more artillery guns, ammunition and missiles to Ukraine, stressing London's ongoing support for Kyiv during a visit to the southern city of Odesa.</p>

<p>John Healey, appointed defence minister Friday by new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was visiting the port city, a frequent target of Russian missile and drone strikes, on his first international trip.</p>

<p>"There may have been a change in government, but the UK is united for Ukraine," Healey said, according to a statement published by Britain's defence ministry.</p>

<p>Healey pledged a new package of assistance including artillery guns, 250,000 rounds of ammunition, de-mining vehicles, small military boats, missiles and other equipment, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>In Odesa, he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An alliance of French left-wing parties was on course Sunday to beat the far right and President Emmanuel Macron's coalition in a stunning outcome to parliamentary elections that plunges France into new political uncertainty.</p>

<p>No one group won an absolute majority in the second round of the poll, which leaves France without any clear path to forming a new government three weeks before the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>But after winning the June 30 first round by a clear margin, the results were a major disappointment for the far-right National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen, even if her forces are set to boast about their biggest ever contingent in parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron's centrist alliance will have dozens fewer members of parliament, but held up better than expected.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would offer Macron his resignation on Monday but was ready to serve "as long as duty demands", notably in light of the imminent Games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New Popular Front (NFP) -- formed last month after Macron called snap elections -- brought together the previously deeply divided Socialists, Greens, Communists and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) together in one camp.</p>

<p>But projections by major polling agencies showed the NFP set to be the largest bloc in the new National Assembly with 177 to 198 seats, Macron's alliance on 152 to 169 seats and the RN on 135 to 145 seats.</p>

<p>This means no group is even close to the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority and it remains unclear how a new government can be formed.</p>

<p>Macron, who has yet to speak in public about the projections, is calling for "prudence and analysis of the results", said an aide, asking not to be named.</p>

<h3><strong>'Historic occasion'</strong></h3>

<p>Firebrand leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of LFI and the controversial figurehead of the NFP coalition, demanded that the left be allowed to form a government.</p>

<p>"Its constituent parts, the united left, have shown themselves equal to the historic occasion and in their own way have foiled the trap set for the country," he said.</p>

<p>Only one week ago, some polls had indicated the RN could win an absolute majority with Le Pen's 28-year-old lieutenant Jordan Bardella becoming prime minister.</p>

<p>Instead, he expressed fury.</p>

<p>Bardella dubbed the local electoral pacts that saw the left and centrists avoid splitting the anti-RN vote as an "alliance of dishonour".</p>

<p>He said it had thrown "France into the arms of Jean-Luc Melenchon's extreme left".</p>

<p>Le Pen, who wants to launch a fourth bid for the presidency in 2027, declared: "The tide is rising. It did not rise high enough this time, but it continues to rise and, consequently, our victory has only been delayed."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week saw more than 200 tactical-voting pacts between centre and left-wing candidates in seats to attempt to prevent the RN winning an absolute majority.</p>

<p>This has been hailed as a return of the anti-far right "Republican Front" first summoned when Le Pen's father Jean-Marie faced Jacques Chirac in the run-off of 2002 presidential elections.</p>

<p>There had been fears a strong RN showing would weaken France's resolve in backing Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the result would lead to "disappointment" in Russia and "relief" in Ukraine. Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez welcomed France's "rejection of the far right".</p>

<h3><strong>Tense campaign</strong></h3>

<p>The election campaign, the shortest in French history, was marked by a febrile national mood, threats and violence -- including racist abuse -- against dozens of candidates and canvassers.</p>

<p>Some 30,000 police were deployed to keep order, and many voters expressed fears that rioting could erupt in some cities after the results were announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turnout was nevertheless high, with left-wing and centrist candidates urging supporters to defend democratic values and the rule of law -- while the far right scented a chance to upend the established order.</p>

<p>In key individual battles, Le Pen's sister Marie-Caroline narrowly lost out on being a lawmaker, but former president Francois Hollande will return to frontline politics as a Socialist member of parliament.</p>

<p>The question for France now is if this alliance of last resort can support a stable government, dogged by a huge RN bloc in parliament led by Le Pen herself as she prepares a 2027 presidential bid.</p>

<p>"The decision to dissolve the National Assembly, which was supposed to be a moment of clarification, has instead led to uncertainty," said former prime minister and Macron ally Edouard Philippe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Any Gaza ceasefire deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until its objectives are met, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as talks over a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war were expected to restart.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any Gaza ceasefire deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until its objectives are met, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as talks over a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war were expected to restart.</p>

<p>Five days after Hamas accepted a key part of the plan, two officials from the Palestinian militant group said the group was awaiting Israel's response to its latest proposal.</p>

<p>Netanyahu was scheduled to hold consultations late on Sunday on the next steps in negotiating the three-phase plan that was presented in May by U.S. President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>It aims to end the war and free around 120 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas has dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before it would sign an agreement. Instead, it said it would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, a Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>But Netanyahu said he insisted the deal must not prevent Israel from resuming fighting until its war objectives are met. Those goals were defined at the start of the war as dismantling Hamas' military and governing capabilities, as well as returning the hostages.</p>

<p>"The plan that has been agreed to by Israel and which has been welcomed by President Biden will allow Israel to return hostages without infringing on the other objectives of the war," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>The deal, he said, must also prohibit weapons smuggling to Hamas via the Gaza-Egypt border and should not allow for thousands of armed militants to return to northern Gaza.</p>

<p>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns is to meet with the Qatari prime minister and the Israeli and Egyptian intelligence chiefs on Wednesday in Doha, said a source familiar with the issue who asked not to be further identified.</p>

<p>Burns is also expected to visit Cairo this week, along with an Israeli delegation, Egypt's Al Qahera News TV reported on Sunday, citing a high-ranking source.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the talks said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel, and would end the war.</p>

<p>"We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation's response," one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be identified.</p>

<p>Another Palestinian official with knowledge of the ceasefire deliberations said Israel was in talks with the Qataris and that a response was expected within days.</p>

<h3><strong>Protests In Israel</strong></h3>

<p>In Israel, protesters took to the streets across the country to press the government to agree to the Gaza ceasefire deal, which would bring back hostages still being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>They blocked rush-hour traffic at major intersections across the country, picketed politicians' houses and briefly set fire to tyres on the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway before police cleared the way.</p>

<p>In Gaza, Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>Among them were Ehab Al-Ghussein, the Hamas-appointed deputy minister of labour whose wife and children were killed in May, and three other people killed in a strike at a church-run school in western Gaza City sheltering families, Hamas media and the Civil Emergency Service said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that after it took steps to minimise the risk of civilians being harmed there, it struck militants who were hiding in the school, as well as a facility in the vicinity where weapons were being made.</p>

<p>In central and northern areas of Rafah, on the southern Gaza border with Egypt, Israeli tanks deepened their raids. Health officials there said they had recovered three bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the eastern part of the city.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, an allied militant group, said fighters had attacked Israeli forces in several locations Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces had killed 30 Palestinian gunmen in Rafah in the past day, and that one of its soldiers was killed in combat.</p>

<p>In Shejaia, an eastern suburb of Gaza City, the military said its forces had killed several gunmen, and located weapons and explosives. It published a drone video showing gunmen, some appearing to be wounded or dead, in a house.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately verify the video.</p>

<p>The conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when fighters led by Hamas, which controlled Gaza, attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<p>More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military onslaught, according to Gaza health officials, and the coastal enclave has largely been reduced to rubble.</p>

<p>Gaza's health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but officials say most of the dead throughout the war have been civilians. Israel has lost 324 soldiers in Gaza, and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The civil defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said a strike Sunday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians killed at least four people, the second such Israeli attack in two days.</p>

<p>The Israeli military, which has long accused Palestinian operatives of using schools and other civilian infrastructure, confirmed the strike "in the area of the school" in Gaza City.</p>

<p>It said in a statement the school complex was used as a hideout and housed "a Hamas weapons manufacturing facility".</p>

<p>The civil defence agency said Ihab al-Ghusain, the Hamas government's deputy labour minister, was among those killed in the strike on the Holy Family school.</p>

<p>The strike came a day after a UN-run school in the central Nuseirat refugee camp was hit, in an attack that the Gaza health ministry said killed 16 people and drew condemnation from the United Nations. Israel said militants were hiding there.</p>

<p>Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli accusations that militants were hiding in civilian infrastructure.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the Gaza Strip's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war, now in its 10th month, and many have taken shelter in UN-run schools across the besieged territory.</p>

<p>The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, expressed outrage at the repeated attacks on its premises.</p>

<p>"Another day. Another month. Another school hit," UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on social media platform X.</p>

<p>UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told AFP that 190 -- or more than half -- of the agency's facilities in Gaza have been hit, "some more than once", since the war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"When the war started we closed the schools and they became shelters," she said.</p>

<p>Up to Thursday, 194 UNRWA workers had been killed, Touma added.</p>

<p>Since then, the UN agency reported separately that another two were killed in an Israeli attack on Saturday.</p>

<p>There have been 450 "incidents" involving UNRWA buildings during the war, Touma said, saying the damage is "unprecedented in the history of the UN".</p>

<p>"Any hits on UN facilities are shocking and there has been a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law in regard to this conflict," she added.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hamas official said Sunday the Palestinian group was ready to discuss a hostage release deal with Israel even without a "complete" ceasefire.</p>

<p>The apparent easing of Hamas's position comes as long-stalled diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage release have gathered pace with a new proposal and meetings hosted by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.</p>

<p>"Hamas had previously required that Israel agree to a complete and permanent ceasefire," the top official told AFP as the war entered its 10th month.</p>

<p>But mediators have offered assurances "that as long as the... negotiations continued, the ceasefire would continue", said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Israel, which vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the group's October 7 attack that sparked the war, has repeatedly rejected demands for a permanent ceasefire.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden announced a plan in late May that included an initial six-week truce and the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.</p>

<p>Talks quickly stalled but a US official said Thursday that a new text from Hamas "moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal".</p>

<p>Egypt's state-linked Al-Qahera News said late Saturday that Cairo was "hosting Israeli and American delegations" and mediators were in contact with Hamas amid "intensive Egyptian meetings this week with all parties".</p>

<p>In Israel, anti-government protesters demanding a hostage release deal blocked roads in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv on a nationwide "disruption day" from 6:29 am, the time Hamas launched their attack on October 7.</p>

<p>Data scientist Yoni Peleg, 34, said protesters were crying "out for help... to end the war" and pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Israel has said it would send a delegation to continue talks with Qatari mediators, though a government spokesman said Friday there were still "gaps" with Hamas.</p>

<p>An official with knowledge of the mediation said US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William Burns would also go to Qatar this week.</p>

<p>If full negotiations start, Hamas expects them to take between two to three weeks, according to the official from the Islamist movement.</p>

<h3><strong>Schools hit</strong></h3>

<p>The fighting and bombardment in Gaza raged on unabated, with witnesses reporting strikes and shelling in the central Bureij refugee camp, the far-southern Rafah city and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Palestine Red Crescent said two children were among six dead when a house in central Gaza was hit, and paramedics reported nine fatalities in two strikes on Gaza City in the north of the coastal territory.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent said Israeli drones were firing in Gaza City's Shujaiya district, which has seen intense battles for nearly two weeks.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that in Shujaiya, its troops killed "several" militants and dismantled militant infrastructure.</p>

<p>The military issued on Sunday an evacuation order for a nearby area of Gaza City. Similar orders in the past have preceded military incursions.</p>

<p>Israeli forces were also "conducting operations" in Rafah and around the municipality building in nearby Khan Yunis, which according to the military was being used by Hamas fighters.</p>

<p>The latest Gaza health ministry toll includes 16 people killed Saturday in a strike on a UN-run school turned shelter in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's military said the school had been used by militants.</p>

<p>Another strike Sunday on a church-run school in Gaza City killed at least four people, said the civil defence agency.</p>

<p>Israel's military confirmed the strike "in the area of" Holy Family School, which it said served as a militant hideout.</p>

<h3><strong>Plea for 'caution'</strong></h3>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, a Hamas ally, fired rocket salvoes at northern Israel in the latest cross-border clashes that have sparked fears of a full-scale war.</p>

<p>Since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces and Hezbollah have exchanged almost daily cross-border fire, with attacks and rhetoric escalating in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Israel on Saturday struck deep inside eastern Lebanon, killing a Hezbollah operative.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had targeted an Israeli army base west of Tiberias "in response to the... assassination" carried out the day before, later claiming more barrages of rockets.</p>

<p>Israeli officials reported four people wounded by shrapnel, including a 31-year-old man who was "in serious and stable condition", according to the Galilee Medical Center.</p>

<p>Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in his first telephone conversation with Netanyahu on Sunday, said the border clashes were "concerning" and urged all sides to exercise "caution".</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Starmer said he also "set out the clear and urgent need for a ceasefire" in Gaza as well as hostage release and "an immediate increase" in aid into the besieged territory.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, meeting troops in the annexed Golan Heights, said "we continue to fight" even if a deal with Hamas is reached.</p>

<p>"I very much hope that we will be able to reach it", Gallant said, according to a statement from his office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday called on all sides to exercise "caution" on the border between Israel and Lebanon, in his first telephone conversation since he was elected with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Starmer told his counterpart the "situation on the northern border of Israel was very concerning, and it was crucial all parties acted with caution", a spokesperson for his 10 Downing Street office said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement on Sunday fired another 20 rockets at northern Israel, leaving one person injured there, the latest cross-border attacks launched in solidarity with Gaza's Palestinian group Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near daily fire with the Israeli army across Lebanon's southern border since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked Israel last year, triggering the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Discussing the conflict, the prime minister reiterated his condolences for the mass loss of life during the October 7 attacks, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"He then set out the clear and urgent need for a ceasefire, the return of hostages and an immediate increase in the volume of humanitarian aid reaching civilians."</p>

<p>In his conversation with Netanyahu, Starmer added that it was also "important to ensure the long-term conditions for a two-state solution were in place, including ensuring the Palestinian Authority had the financial means to operate effectively".</p>

<p>Efforts towards a truce are continuing with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoping to halt the worst-ever Gaza war, which has caused mass civilian casualties and devastated the coastal territory.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said the prime minister also spoke by phone to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.</p>

<p>Starmer told Abbas that his "longstanding policy on recognition to contribute to a peace process had not changed, and it was the undeniable right of Palestinians".</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel's military offensive has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

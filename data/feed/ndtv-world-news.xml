       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rare bearcat that died in a UK zoo is set to be frozen for future study and preservation. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/11/rare-bearcat-died-uk-zoo-frozen-21402669/#:~:text=An%20extremely%20rare%20'bearcat'%20who,of%2018%20on%20July%2031."><em>Metro</em></a>, Penh, the Cambodian binturong who lived at Drusillas Park in East Sussex, died at the age of 18 on July 31.&nbsp;He was one of only three of this type of species in European zoos and had spent 14 years in England. The decision to freeze the bearcat was to preserve its body and genetic material for potential research and educational purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As binturongs face the looming threat of extinction in their native Southeast Asian habitats due to rampant deforestation, conservation efforts rely on the help of wildlife sanctuaries. By freezing Penh's body, scientists can tap into its genetic legacy, fueling the fight to protect this extraordinary animal and its dwindling population.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the zookeepers at Drusillas Park are left saddened by the loss of their beloved Penh, a cherished member of their animal family. ''A true gentleman, lover of tomatoes, and a sweet and gentle soul, he will be missed by his keepers and our visitors. But Penh's legacy will live on,'' Drusillas Park said in a statement on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The park added, ''The loss of Penh is of great sadness, but through this collaboration, his genetic legacy will live on, contributing to the conservation of binturongs for years to come. Together, we are ensuring that future generations will continue to witness the wonderful diversity of the natural world.''</p>

<p>Animal charity Nature's SAFE has been given the task of&nbsp;cryogenically preserving Penh's body, freezing his genetic material, including his sperm and skin cells. By preserving his genetic material, conservationists hope to one day use it to breed more bearcats, helping to ensure the long-term survival of the unique species.</p>

<p>Headkeeper Gemma, who was charged with delivering Penh's cell tissue to Nature's SAFE said, ''It felt very bittersweet, I've worked with Penh for over a decade so although I felt sad, it was also a positive feeling knowing it was not necessarily the end for him. The team at Nature's SAFE lab immediately tested Penh's sperm sample and we had confirmation that it was viable.''</p>

<h2><strong>What is a bearcat?</strong></h2>

<p>A bearcat, also known as a binturong (Arctictis binturong), is a unique and fascinating animal native to Southeast Asia. Despite its name, it's neither a bear nor a cat, but a member of the Viverrid family, related to civets and genets. Bearcats are relatively large, with adults reaching up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in length and weighing around 20-40 pounds (9-18 kilograms). They have a distinctive coat with a mix of grey, white, and black fur, and a long, bushy tail.</p>

<p>Bearcats inhabit forests and grasslands in countries like Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. They're solitary, nocturnal, and excellent climbers, often resting in trees during the day.&nbsp;They're omnivores, feeding on fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals.</p>

<p>They are listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflict.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 28-year-old woman has become the first deaf woman to be crowned Miss South Africa after a divisive competition, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l5nrge372o.amp"><em>BBC</em></a>. Mia Le Roux, who was diagnosed with profound hearing loss when she was aged one, expressed her hope in her victory speech that her success will inspire those who feel excluded to pursue their "wildest dreams, just like I am." She also said that she wished to help those who were "financially excluded or differently abled".</p>

<p>Ms Le Roux was declared the pageant winner after finalist Chidimma Adetshina, aged 23, withdrew due to criticism regarding her Nigerian origin and allegations regarding her mother's identity. Notably, Ms Adetshina was born in South Africa to a Nigerian father and a South African mother, but the family came from Mozambique.</p>

<p>South Africa's Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie, the leader of the Patriotic Alliance party also questioned Ms Adetshina's identity to represent in the contest. "We truly cannot have Nigerians compete in our Miss SA competition. I wanna get all facts before I comment but it gives funny vibes already," he said on X.</p>

<p>Ms Adetshina said that the entire event felt like "black-on-black hate," bringing attention to the specific form of xenophobia known as "Afrophobia" that exists in South Africa and targets other Africans. She said that although there were other contestants with South Asian and European names among the 16 women, she was the only one getting most of the criticism.</p>

<p>The country's Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said on August 6 that the department was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/Leon_Schreib/status/1820781492642910542">investigating her citizenship </a>at the request of the Miss South Africa organisation. Following the investigation, the ministry revealed: "Prima facie reasons exist to believe that fraud and identity theft may have been committed by the person recorded in home affairs records as Chidimma Adetshina's mother." As per <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/miss-south-africa-contestant-withdraws-after-mother-is-accused-of-identity-theft">the Guardian,</a></em> the statement added, "An innocent South African mother, whose identity may have been stolen as part of the alleged fraud committed by Adetshina's mother, suffered as a result because she could not register her child."</p>

<p>On August 8, the 23-year-old took to Instagram to announce her decision to withdraw from the competition. "After much careful consideration, I have made the difficult decision to withdraw myself from the competition for the safety and well-being of my family and I. With the full support of the Miss South Africa Organisation, I leave with a heart full of gratitude for this amazing experience," she wrote.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praising the Centre for giving refuge to Sheikh Hasina after she was forced to resign as Bangladesh Prime Minister amid violent protests, Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor told NDTV that the power shift in the neighbouring country is not a cause for worry for India.</p>

<p>Asked about his views on how the developments in Bangladesh would impact its ties with India, Mr Tharoor said, "Our fundamental interest lies in close and friendly relations with Bangladesh, our basic commitment is to the well-being of Bangladesh people, the State comes second and any individual leader comes third."</p>

<p>"We are with the people of Bangladesh, we were with them in 1971, we have been with them through thick and thin, even when they had governments who were less than friendly to us, we have managed to keep our relationship on an even keel and certainly there should be no deterioration in that relationship in time to come," he added.</p>

<p>On the interim government headed by Nobel peace prize winner and Grameen Bank founder Muhammad Yunus, he said it's no cause for anxiety for New Delhi. "I know Muhammad Yunus personally, he is a highly respected figure. I suppose he is somewhat close to Washington rather than being seen as close to Jamaat e Islami or Pakistani ISI. If you look at the overall composition of the interim government, there doesn't seem to be any particular reason for India to feel any anxiety about countries hostile to us having put their stamp on this interim government," he said.</p>

<p>The big concern for India, he said, has always been whether Pakistan and China will fish in troubled waters. "In this kind of context, there is always a possibility that the Pakistani ISI could have had a hand in some outrageous incidents of violence during the agitation, that the Chinese who have a strong presence in Bangladesh might have seen this as an opportunity to expand their influence, those are things people watching relations in the subcontinent are most concerned about. But certainly there is no implication of anything in the composition of the interim government or the initial statements of Mr Yunus that would give us any cause for worry," he said, underlining the interim leader's call for peace and protection of minorities.</p>

<p>On India giving refuge to Sheikh Hasina following her ouster, Mr Tharoor had words of praise for the Narendra Modi government. "If we had not helped her, it would have been a disgrace for India. Nobody would have wanted to be our friend if we had treated our friend badly. Sheikh Hasina is a friend of India and India is a friend of her. And when a friend is in trouble, you don't look twice before you help them, keep them safe. That's exactly what India has done. I applaud the government for doing it. I would have wanted nothing less. As an Indian, we have certain standards we stand for in the world. The government has done right thing to bring her here and ensure her safety," he said.</p>

<p>"How long she wishes to remain is not for us. You don't call someone to your house and ask them when are you leaving. My view is we wait and see, how long she feels she can stay before she moves on. There are practical considerations before moving to any other country, there ae visa considerations, other issues. For now, She is with us and we should be proud of the fact that we have stood by a friend when her personal safety was in danger," Mr Tharoor said.</p>

<p>In his response to a question on whether the Indian government should raise concerns regarding attacks on minorities more forcefully, he conflicting reports are coming out of Bangladesh. "There certainly have been some attacks, no one can deny it, no one should deny it. It's a fact. At the same time, there is no doubt that there are also stories coming out that Bangladeshi Muslims are guarding Hindu homes and temples, So there is a bit of good news also during all the bad news," he said.</p>

<p>The Congress leader saw hope in Muhammad Yunus's address after taking charge of the interim government. "Prof Yunus's statement that the government stands by the minorities and urges people to be calm and stop acts of violence, that's a very good sign. Any continuing violence will be definitely instigated by those elements in Bangladesh's society who have traditionally been anti-Indian, anti-Hindu and will do whatever it takes to create the conditions of disorder that may give them the opportunity to fish in troubled waters. But for now, I don't believe there is any one authority who wants to see that situation continue," he said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, who had to step down after protests against reservation in Bangladesh snowballed into a movement demanding her ouster, has been in India for nearly a week now. Following her arrival, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar chaired an all-party meeting and briefed leaders from Opposition parties on the situation and the government's plan. The Opposition has assured full support to the Centre on tackling this crisis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A statue meant to commemorate the liberation of Bangladesh has been destroyed by "anti-India vandals", Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said today. Mr Tharoor shared an image of the broken statue which depicted the moment Pakistan surrendered after the 1971 war.</p>

<p>"Sad to see images like this of statues at the 1971 Shaheed Memorial Complex, Mujibnagar, destroyed by anti-India vandals," the Thiruvananthapuram MP said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). &nbsp;</p>

<p>"This follows disgraceful attacks on the Indian cultural centre, temples, and Hindu homes in several places, even as reports came in of Muslim civilians protecting other minority homes and places of worship," he added.</p>

— Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/1822830968702750934?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The 1971 war not only liberated Bangladesh but also dealt Pakistan a crushing blow. The statue depicted the signing of the 'Instrument Of Surrender' by Pakistan Army Major-General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi to the Indian Army and Bangladesh's Mukti Bahini. Major-General Niazi surrendered with his 93,000 troops before Lt General Jagjit Singh Aurora, then General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of India's Eastern Command. This was the largest military surrender since World War II.</p>

<p>A student-led uprising in Bangladesh has led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and several other top officials. At least 450 people were killed in more than a month of deadly protests that led to Hasina's exit on August 5.</p>

<p>Hasina faces allegations of murder, forced disappearance, money laundering, and corruption, and must face the law, Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, a senior member of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party said.</p>

<p>The protests have also been severely harsh on Hindus residing in the country who have been subjected to several attacks against Hindu households, temples, and businesses. Hindus are the largest minority faith in mostly Muslim Bangladesh and are considered a steadfast support base for Hasina's party, the Awami League.</p>

<p>Members of minority communities in the violence-hit nation have faced more than 205 incidents of attacks across 52 districts since the fall of the government.</p>

<p>Shashi Tharoor urged the new caretaker government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammed Yunus, to take urgent steps to restore law and order.</p>

<p>"The agenda of some of the agitators is quite clear. It is essential that Muhammed Yunus and his interim government take urgent steps to restore law &amp; order in the interests of all Bangladeshis, of every faith. India stands with the people of Bangladesh at this turbulent time, but such anarchic excess can never be condoned," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A report of white smoke coming from a landing Singapore Airlines plane forced a runway at Japan's Narita Airport to close temporarily on Monday, officials said, though responders found no signs of fire and no one was injured.</p>

<p>The smoke prompted six fire engines and two ambulances to rush to the scene, and Narita's runway B was closed from around 7:40 am (2240 GMT), shortly after the flight landed at the gateway to Tokyo, airport and fire officials said.</p>

<p>"We received a report of white smoke rising from the left engine," a Narita city fire official told AFP.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of fire and no one was injured, she said, adding that firefighters left the scene after observing the plane for over an hour.</p>

<p>The plane was carrying 276 passengers and crew members, local media said.</p>

<p>The flight reported the smoke to the airport after landing, an airport official told AFP.</p>

<p>"It communicated that there was a possibility that it experienced a problem when it landed," a spokesman at Narita International Airport told AFP.</p>

<p>Pieces of tyre were found on the runway, the spokesman said, adding there was no further information to offer about the incident.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[It said within 10 minutes researchers were able to find on X propaganda videos from UK government-proscribed terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tech industry counter-terrorism organisation is concerned over content posted on Elon Musk's X by Palestinian militant group Hamas and is worried about the social media platform's membership on its board, The Sunday Times reported.</p>

<p>Members of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) believe the group's credibility is undermined by X's membership and position on its board, according to The Sunday Times. The GIFCT also includes major social media groups Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Alphabet's YouTube.</p>

<p>X Corp and the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Sunday Times said that X, formally known as Twitter, is now the easiest social media platform to find Hamas videos, citing the Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that combats extremism and antisemitism.</p>

<p>It said within 10 minutes CST researchers were able to find on X propaganda videos from UK government-proscribed terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p>According to The Sunday Times, a statement in the GIFCT's independent advisory committee annual 2023 report expressing concern over online trust and safety was directed at X.</p>

<p>The advisory body said it had become "increasingly concerned by significant reductions in online trust and safety capabilities for certain platforms, and a perceived decrease in the priority of the issue, negatively impacting companies' ability to moderate extremist content online".</p>

<p>The Sunday Times said Musk had let banned extremists back on to X, allowed anyone to pay for a verification mark and sacked a large part of its content moderation team, as part of the billionaire's strategy of turning X into a "free speech" platform.</p>

<p>The GIFCT was created in 2017 under pressure from U.S. and European governments. The Sunday Times said X, a founding member of the organisation, was now failing to make its full financial contribution to the anti-organisation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The traditional red, yellow, and green lights will be used for most of the time until practically all cars are autonomous vehicles.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us are aware that the traffic light colours- red, yellow (also known as amber), and green, are arranged vertically or horizontally in that order. These are the same across the globe and have been the same for over a century. Scientists have now proposed a fourth colour for these lights for driverless vehicles, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/11/traffic-lights-getting-a-new-colour-3-21379750/?ico=mosaic_news"><em>Metro UK.</em></a></p>

<p>There are no completely driverless cars on the road, given autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a relatively new concept. Waymo, a self-driving taxi company, has nearly reached the fifth level, or SAE4, in California and Arizona. Teslas and other AVs are growing in popularity as well. Meanwhile, self-driving cars are not currently permitted on UK roads with a few exceptions. However, the Automated Vehicles Act may allow them as early as 2026. This indicates that autonomous and human-driven vehicles will soon co-exist on the roads.</p>

<p>Amid this, North Carolina State University engineers are putting forth a "white light" at traffic lights, which would enable self-driving cars to assist with traffic flow and communicate with human drivers to inform them about what is happening. The goal, according to study head Dr Ali Hajbabaie, was to use the AVs' computer capability to determine which vehicles were where.</p>

<p>"The white phase concept incorporates a new traffic signal, so that human drivers know what they are supposed to do. Red lights will still mean stop. Green lights will still mean go. And white lights will tell human drivers to simply follow the car in front of them," he said.</p>

<p>Dr Hajbabaie along with his team made several computer simulations to visualise how the new system, which could improve travel time, fuel efficiency and safety, would work. The findings are published in the Journal of Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering. According to the proposal, AVs would be able to wirelessly communicate with computers that manage traffic signals as well as with one another. When a sufficient number of autonomous vehicles approach the intersection, the new traffic signal system will activate. Any non-automated vehicles would just need to follow the vehicle in front of them, and the white light would communicate to onlookers that the AVs are coordinating their motions to move traffic through the crossing.</p>

<p>However, the traditional red, yellow, and green lights will be used for most of the time until practically all cars are autonomous vehicles, and the system will operate just as it has for more than a century. The team also found out that the white light concept "improves traffic efficiency for both vehicles and pedestrians."</p>

<p>"If at some point in the future we see almost universal adoption of AVs, our models suggest that delays at intersections would decrease by more than 25%. More realistically, we will eventually see a lower percentage of wirelessly connected AVs on the road, but there would still be meaningful improvements in traffic time," the scientist added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The network will keep providing 11 hours of television content every day, from 6 am to 5 pm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cartoon Network website, which had been online since 1998, was removed from the internet on August 8, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/cartoon-network-shuts-down-warner-bros-discovery-max-signup-1236101422/"><em>Variety</em></a>. Previously a portal with a video-heavy homepage for shows like 'Teen Titans Go!', 'The Powerpuff Girls', 'Adventure Time', and 'Steven Universe', users are now redirected to Max, another Warner Bros. Discovery streaming platform, where they can see their favourite cartoons.</p>

<p>A pop-up message welcoming visitors to the Max website said, "Looking for episodes of your favourite Cartoon Network shows? Check out what's available to stream on Max (subscription required)." The welcome message also encouraged current cable subscribers to use "Connected apps" in addition to watching shows on their televisions. "Sign up for Max, where you can also create a Kids Profile with rating restrictions and additional privacy protections to keep it fun and kid-friendly! Cable subscribers, continue to enjoy your favourite CN programming on your TV and connected apps as well!" it added.</p>

<p>A Cartoon Network spokesperson told the outlet in a statement, "We are focusing on the Cartoon Network shows and social media where we find consumers are the most engaged and there is a meaningful potential for growth." They also said that the network will keep providing 11 hours of television content every day, from 6 am to 5 pm.</p>

<p>CartoonNetwork.com is the victim of the ongoing streaming war among online portals. It also seems like a cost-cutting measure meant to entice viewers to pay for Max. The parent firm Paramount Global removed the websites for Comedy Central, MTV News, and CMT in June. In February, Paramount also cancelled the preschool-focused channel Noggin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Cartoon Network website went live in July 1998, which was roughly six years after the cable network's October 1992 launch. It also existed as an AOL channel as early as 1996. Last month, a rumour that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ripcartoonnetwork-become-the-top-trend-is-the-channel-shutting-down-rumour-video-6067053">Cartoon Network was shutting down </a>sent shockwaves on social media and #RIPCartoonNetwork became the top trend. The rumour started with a video posted on X (formerly Twitter) by the account "Animation Workers Ignited", which claimed that the channel was "dead". However, it was clarified that the channel was not shutting down.</p>

<p>The channel is adapting to changes in the media landscape and has new programming in development, including spin-offs of popular shows.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hindu community in Bangladesh spending anxious hours in the wake of resignation of Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister and facing the spillovers of the violent protests over a quota-related issue in the South Asian nation on Sunday came out on streets in large numbers in the port city of Chittagong, demanding safety for their lives, properties and places of worship while proclaiming 'Bangladesh is our motherland and we won't go anywhere'.</p>

<p>There have been reports of widespread and targeted violence against the Hindus in Bangladesh, with the matter being taken note by the UN which called out the interim Bangladeshi government led by Mohammed Yunus to safeguard the minorities.</p>

<p>Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Yunus, who was sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday, has also condemned the attacks on the minority communities, terming them as "heinous".</p>

<p>"Are they not the people of this country? You (students) have been able to save this country; can't you save some families? They are my brothers... we fought together, and we will stay together,” the Nobel Prize winner told students at a Bangladeshi university recently.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Hindus and other minorities - under the aegis of ‘Bangladesh Hindu, Buddha, Christian Unity Group - took out a massive protest rally against the alleged attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina resigned in the aftermath of violent protests on August 5 and fled the country. Hindus in Bangladesh have been traditional supporters of Hasina's Awami League party.</p>

<p>"Our soil, our mother is Bangladesh. We will never leave our mother," read one of the placards seen during the protest rally.</p>

<p>"Save Bangladeshi Hindu Society. Save Hindus!" another appeal read.</p>

<p>Sunday's protests saw the participation of people belonging to numerous minorities led by the Hindus, a prominent minority group in the country.</p>

<p>The protesters also waved the Bangladeshi national flag along with a saffron-colour flag depicting Lord Ram with 'Jai Shri Ram' written.</p>

<p>He also urged the students, who are at the forefront of the protests, to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from any harm</p>

<p>The protesting Hindus, in Chittagong, also questioned why their places of worship are being attacked.</p>

<p>"We need answers. Why is this happening to us? We want to live in peace. Let us live," read another placard at the site of the protest rally.</p>

<p>"Why are our sisters and mothers being physically harassed," another hand-written note on cardboard flashed during the 'demand for justice rally' read.</p>

<p>Since August 5, at least 232 people have reportedly died in various attacks and conflicts across Bangladesh while there have also been at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts against the minorities since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government.</p>

<p>According to media reports, over 100 Hindus and other minorities have been killed across the country since the fall of the previous government.</p>

<p>The Chittagong protests on Sunday witnessed overwhelming emotions with the minorities expressing their anger, anxiety and apprehensions, with the hope that authorities taking necessary steps to address their worries.</p>

<p>Ironically -- considering the current unrest in the country -- 'AMAR SONAR BANGLA' placard also featured during the protests. Translating to 'My Golden Bengal', it is the national anthem of Bangladesh written by the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore who is also the composer of the Indian national anthem.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Over 300 Indian Americans and Bangladeshi-origin Hindus gathered in Houston to protest the violence against Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a powerful yet peaceful display of solidarity, over 300 Indian Americans and Bangladeshi-origin Hindus gathered at Sugar Land City Hall in Houston on Sunday morning to protest the horrific acts committed by Islamist extremists targeting Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. The air was thick with emotion as attendees united for a cause that resonated deeply with their identities and beliefs.</p>

<p>Organizers passionately called on the Biden Administration to take immediate and decisive action to prevent further atrocities and to protect vulnerable minority communities in Bangladesh. The recent surge in violence against Hindu communities poses an urgent and alarming threat to peace and stability in the region, and the time to act is now.</p>

<p>The organizers passionately called for immediate protection and safety for all religious minorities in Bangladesh, urging the US government to refuse to remain a silent bystander as these heinous crimes against humanity unfold.</p>

<p>They encouraged Bangladeshi Hindus to stay vigilant and unite in monitoring the ongoing situation, taking necessary initiatives collectively in any emergency.</p>

<p>The vigil, aptly titled "Save Hindus in Bangladesh," was organized by the Global Voice for Bangladesh Minorities, an umbrella organization representing major Houston Hindu groups, including Maitri, Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America, HinduAction, HinduPact, Houston Durgabari Society, ISKCON, Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora, and many more.</p>

<p>Participants raised their placards high, bearing passionate messages demanding an end to the violence and atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The crowd erupted with fervour as slogans like "Stop Hindu Genocide," "Stand Up and Speak Out Now," "Hindu Lives Matter," and "We0 Won't Run, We Won't Hide, Stop Hindu Genocide" rang out, echoing their urgent plea for justice.</p>

<p>Quoting the timeless words of Mahatma Gandhi, "To forgive and accept injustice is cowardice," along with the poignant words of Martin Luther King Jr., the organizers passionately declared, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."</p>

<p>Achlesh Amar, one of the speakers representing VHP and HinduAction, addressed the packed crowd with unwavering conviction, proclaiming, "We strongly condemn the assault on the Hindu community for their pluralistic beliefs. We stand united in unwavering solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Bangladesh. We demand immediate action from the Bangladeshi government to bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure the safety and security of all its citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs!"</p>

<p>Amar also shared a heartfelt statement from Deepti Mahajan, co-convener of HinduPACT.</p>

<p>"With the coup in Bangladesh, the 10 million Hindus are sitting on a ticking bomb of genocide," she warned, her voice trembling with urgency. "Reports from within Bangladesh reveal unimaginable torture, killings, and the burning of Hindu temples, alongside harrowing stories of women subjected to unspeakable abuse. This instability poses a grave danger not only to Hindus but also to the very foundations of democracy in countries like India and the US. It is an inevitable threat to Hindus in Pakistan as well. We need the eyes and ears of all Western nations focused on this crisis in Asia, and we demand safety for all minorities in Bangladesh!"</p>

<p>A Bangladeshi-origin American woman present at the vigil spoke with palpable emotion, her voice breaking as she shared, "The horrific acts of violence back home are devastating. When we call home and hear about these brutal acts every single day, it tears us apart. So many innocent lives have been lost! Places of worship have been burned or vandalized, and women have been horrifically abused. This must stop now! We cannot stand idly by while our people suffer!"</p>

<p>The gathering was a powerful reminder that the struggle for justice knows no borders. United by love and compassion, they stood together to demand action, to raise their voices against oppression, and to ensure that the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh does not go unheard.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe's largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europe's largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation.</p>

<p>The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, which has a presence at the vast six-reactor facility, said its experts had seen strong, dark smoke coming from the northern area of the plant in southern Ukraine following multiple explosions.</p>

<p>Russian state news agencies, TASS and RIA, cited the country's nuclear energy company Rosatom as saying the main fire was extinguished shortly before midnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>The fire comes less than a week after Ukraine's forces launched their largest incursion into Russian territory since the war started in 2022, a surprise move that has brought conflict into a new phase, after weeks of Moscow's battlefield gains.</p>

<p>Ukraine's nuclear power company Energoatom said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that one of the cooling towers and other equipment were damaged.</p>

<p>Russia's TASS agency also reported, citing Rosatom's statement, that a cooling tower was damaged. Citing local Russian emergency ministry representatives, TASS said it was a non-functioning tower.</p>

<p>Russia captured the plant from Ukraine shortly after launching its full-scale invasion on its smaller neighbour in 2022, an attack described by Moscow as a "special operation".The plant's six nuclear reactors are in cold shutdown.</p>

<h3><strong>TRADING BLAME</strong></h3>

<p>By early Monday, it was not clear what caused the fire that started at around 8 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Sunday.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of lighting the fire which he said was visible from the Kyiv-held city of Nikopol, which looks out onto the Russian-held plant.</p>

<p>Evgeny Balitsky, a Russian-installed official in the occupied south of Ukraine, accused Kyiv's forces of causing the fire by shelling the nearby city of Enerhodar which, like the plant, was captured by Russia soon after its February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>The IAEA said there had been no reported impact on nuclear safety at the site.</p>

<p>"Team was told by (the nuclear plant) of an alleged drone attack today on one of the cooling towers located at the site," it wrote on X.</p>

<p>Ukraine's Energoatom said Russia's "negligence" or arson could have sparked the fire. Without providing evidence, it also said Russia uses the plant's cooling towers to store military equipment and explosives.</p>

<p>Russia's officials in turn, including Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, accused Kyiv of deliberately trying to destroy the plant and sow "nuclear terror."</p>

<p>Zelenskiy published grainy video showing belching black smoke that appeared to be coming out a cooling tower with a blaze burning at its foot.</p>

<p>"Currently, the radiation indicators are normal. But as long as Russian terrorists retain control over the nuclear plant, the situation is not and cannot be normal," he said.</p>

<p>The six reactors at the plant located close to the front line of the war in Ukraine are not in operation but the facility relies on external power to keep its nuclear material cool and prevent a catastrophic accident.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have routinely accused each other of endangering safety around it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greek authorities have ordered the evacuation of Marathon town, the birthplace of the Marathon race, due to a raging wildfire.</p>

<p>Residents of Marathon were on Sunday asked to move towards the neighbouring settlement of Nea Makri, Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Climate Crisis and Civil Protection ministry, following the evacuation of six settlements in the area.</p>

<p>Facilities of the Athens Olympic Athletic Center (OAKA), the main venue of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, approximately 30 km from Marathon, opened to host many of the evacuees overnight, Greek national broadcaster ERT reported.</p>

<p>Eight people were transferred to hospitals with mainly respiratory problems, according to the latest information provided by health ministry officials.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, firefighters were trying to contain the front which extends several kilometres in the northeastern Attica region, according to the Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>The fire broke out around 3 p.m. local time in Varnavas, around 35 km from Athens. The fire spread fast fueled by hot and windy weather and thick plumes of smoke from the blaze have covered a large part of Athens.</p>

<p>The smoke has also reached as far as about 100 km from Varnavas, a settlement near Marathon, due to strong winds, which reached up to eight on the Beaufort scale, according to Greek meteorologists.</p>

<p>Approximately 400 firefighters supported by 29 water-dropping airplanes and helicopters, 110 fire engines, military squads and many volunteers have been working to contain the front, a Fire Brigade spokesperson told a press briefing in Athens.</p>

<p>Another big wildfire, breaking out earlier on Sunday near Megara town in western Attica, has been taken under control.</p>

<p>In both cases, mostly forested areas were scorched, and local officials reported some damage to houses.</p>

<p>Over the past 24 hours, firefighting forces have responded to 40 wildfires across Greece, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Authorities have advised people to remain on alert these days as high temperatures in several regions may increase fire risk there.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, the Fire Brigade has responded to dozens of wildfires fronts every day. Greece experiences numerous wildfires each summer in connection to heatwaves and arson.</p>

<p>This year, two people have lost their lives in wildfires while 20 were reported dead last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Global youth unemployment is at its lowest level for 15 years, the United Nations said Monday, though not all regions have yet recovered from the Covid-19 slump.</p>

<p>The number of 15- to 24-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training (NEET) is concerning, the UN's labour agency said, adding that the post-Covid-19 pandemic recovery has not been universal in all regions.</p>

<p>"Young people in certain regions and many young women are not seeing the benefits of the economic recovery," the International Labour Organization said.</p>

<p>At 64.9 million, the total number of unemployed young people worldwide in 2023 was the lowest since the start of the millennium, the ILO said.</p>

<p>At 13 percent, the youth unemployment rate last year represents a 15-year low and a fall from the pre-pandemic rate of 13.8 percent in 2019, it said.</p>

<p>"It is expected to fall further to 12.8 percent this year and next," it added.</p>

<p>"The picture, however, is not the same across regions. In the Arab States, East Asia and South-East Asia and the Pacific, youth unemployment rates were higher in 2023 than in 2019."</p>

<p><strong>NEET worries</strong></p>

<p>The ILO's Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024 report cautioned over the growing casualisation of work for young people -- and the widening gap in the supply of young graduates and the number of suitable jobs for them to take up.</p>

<p>It said too many young people were NEETs and opportunities to access decent jobs were limited in emerging and developing economies.</p>

<p>The NEET rate stood at 20.4 percent in 2023 -- and two in three NEETs are women.</p>

<p>The NEET rate was 28.1 percent for young women in 2023, and 13.1 percent for young men.</p>

<p>Globally, more than half of young workers are in the informal employment.</p>

<p>Only in high- and upper-middle-income economies are the majority of young workers today in regular, secure work.</p>

<p><strong>Insecurity</strong></p>

<p>"None of us can look forward to a stable future when millions of young people around the world do not have decent work and as a result, are feeling insecure and unable to build a better life for themselves and their families," said ILO chief Gilbert F. Houngbo.</p>

<p>"Peaceful societies rely on three core ingredients: stability, inclusion, and social justice; and decent work for the youth is at the heart of all three," the former prime minister of Togo added.</p>

<p>The report said that despite the positive economic and labour market signals, surveys show young people are increasingly anxious about the future.</p>

<p>"Many young people today feel stressed about job loss and job stability, the state of the economy, a lack of social mobility across generations, and their prospects for eventual financial independence," it said.</p>

<p>Houngbo said this could be because most available jobs "are temporary and lack social protection".</p>

<p>"We have seen very little progress in getting more young people in decent jobs, and this in fact has been the overall trend for the last 20 years," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An ATR-72 turboprop plane operated by regional carrier Voepass crashed on Friday in a residential area near Sao Paulo, Brazil, killing all 62 passengers aboard.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ATR-72 turboprop plane operated by regional carrier Voepass crashed on Friday in a residential area near Sao Paulo, Brazil, killing all 62 passengers aboard.</p>

<p>Investigators have recovered the plane's so-called black box containing voice recordings and flight data, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days, the head of Brazil's aviation accident investigation center, Cenipa, said on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DID THE CRASH OCCUR?</strong></p>

<p>The plane was bound for Sao Paulo from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed at around 1:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) in Vinhedo, some 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>The aircraft was flying normally until 1:21 p.m., when it stopped responding to calls, and radar contact was lost at 1:22 p.m., Brazil's air force said in a statement. The plane did not report any emergency.</p>

<p>Videos of the event show that the sky was apparently clear when the plane started spiraling in an unusual circling motion.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WILL EXPERTS BE LOOKING FOR?</strong></p>

<p>US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse said investigators would look at aspects like weather and examine to what extent the engines and controls were functioning properly, to help identify what caused the loss of control.</p>

<p><strong>COULD WEATHER CONDITIONS HAVE CAUSED THE CRASH?</strong></p>

<p>Videos of the crash analyzed by aviation experts led some to speculate that ice had built up on the plane. On Friday, Voepass said ice was predicted at the altitudes in which the plane was flying, but that it should have been within an acceptable level.</p>

<p>Brazilian aviation engineer and crash investigator Celso Faria de Souza said he is almost certain ice caused the accident, judging from the video.</p>

<p>ATR-72 planes have experienced issues with icing, with a crash in 1994 in the US state of Indiana killing 68, after the plane was unable to bank due to ice buildup. After that incident, manufacturer ATR improved its de-icing system. In 2016 in Norway an ATR-72 experienced issues after ice accumulated on the plane, but the pilot was able to regain control.</p>

<p><strong>COULD THE ENGINE HAVE FAILED?</strong></p>

<p>John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the Brazil crash footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.</p>

<p>It may have been an engine failure on one side, mismanaged by the crew, which would lead to the rotation downward, said Hansman.</p>

<p><strong>ARE MULTIPLE POINTS OF FAILURE POSSIBLE?</strong></p>

<p>Air crashes could be due to any number of factors, according to experts. Among them could be ice, engine failure or human error. In many instances there is more than one cause, said Robert A. Clifford, a lawyer who represented some of the families of crash victims in the 1994 accident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A helicopter crashed into the roof of a hotel in the popular northern Australian tourist town of Cairns, killing the pilot and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of guests, authorities said on Monday.</p>

<p>Emergency crews were called at about 2 a.m. on Monday (1600 GMT on Sunday) after a twin-engine helicopter collided with the hotel roof, causing a fire on top of the building and triggering evacuations, Queensland state police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police said forensic investigations were underway to formally identify the pilot. He was declared dead at the scene.</p>

<p>"There were no injuries sustained by people on the ground," the police statement said.</p>

<p>The crash occurred at Hilton's Double Tree Hotel in the city of Cairns, a major gateway to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, Australian media reported.</p>

<p>Two of the helicopter's rotor blades came off and one landed in the hotel pool, media reports said.</p>

<p>The forensic crash unit will work with Australia's transport safety regulator to prepare an accident report, police said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel expanded evacuation orders in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip overnight, forcing tens of thousands of Palestinian residents and displaced families to leave in the dark as explosions from tank shelling reverberated around them.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was attacking operatives from the Hamas group - which administered Gaza before the war - who were using those areas to stage attacks and fire rockets.</p>

<p>On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike on a school where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in Gaza City killed at least 90 people, according to the civil defence service, prompting an international outcry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant command post, an allegation the two groups rejected as a pretext, and killed 19 operatives.</p>

<p>In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, the evacuation instruction covered districts in the centre, east and west, making it one of the largest such orders in the 10-month-old conflict, two days after tanks returned to the east of the city.</p>

<p>The announcement was posted on X and in text and audio messages to residents' phones: "For your own safety, you must evacuate immediately to the newly created humanitarian zone. The area you are in is considered a dangerous combat zone."</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations' agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, said people in Gaza were trapped and had nowehere to go.</p>

<p>"Some are only able to carry their children with them, some carry their whole lives in one small bag. They are going to overcrowded places where shelters are already overflowing with families. They have lost everything and need everything," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said it had struck around 30 Hamas military targets in the previous 24 hours, including military structures, anti-tank missile launch posts, and weapons storage facilities.</p>

<p>The Islamic Jihad armed wing said fighters fired mortar bombs against Israeli forces massing in the eastern areas of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday, an Israeli airstrike near the Khan Younis market at the center of the city killed four Palestinians and wounded several others, medics said.</p>

<p>Lines of smoke rose from areas where Israeli planes carried attacks in the eastern and western parts of the city. Residents said two multi-floor buildings were bombed.</p>

<p>Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the war broke out last October and the toll is rising by the day, the Gaza health ministry says.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians but Israel says at least a third are fighters. Israel says it has lost 329 soldiers in Gaza. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel began its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<h3><strong>Tens Of Thousands Forced To Leave Overnight</strong></h3>

<p>Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, according to the United Nations, while their narrow strip of land has largely been reduced to a wasteland of rubble.</p>

<p>Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas in the enclave. Areas designated as humanitarian zones, like Al-Mawasi in western Khan Younis where residents were being sent, have been bombed several times by Israeli forces.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands left their homes and shelters in the middle of the night, heading west toward Mawasi and north toward Deir Al-Balah, already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of displaced people.</p>

<p>"We're exhausted. This is the 10th time I and my family have had to leave our shelter," said Zaki Mohammad, 28, who lives in the Hamad housing project in western Khan Younis, where the occupants of two multi-floor buildings were ordered to leave.</p>

<p>"People are carrying their belongings, their children, their hopes and their fears and running towards the unknown, because there is no safe place," he told Reuters via a chat app. "We are running from death to death."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.</p>

<p>The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.</p>

<p>A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead", the maritime authorities said.</p>

<p>The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres (6 miles) north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.</p>

<p>Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.</p>

<p>In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.</p>

<p>The death count this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.</p>

<p>He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket", on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine".</p>

<p>A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.</p>

<p>"This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.</p>

<p>As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to an AFP tally of British government figures.</p>

<p>That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.</p>

<h3><strong>'Smuggler networks'</strong></h3>

<p>After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.</p>

<p>Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.</p>

<p>French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.</p>

<p>Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.</p>

<p>The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since withdrawing from the election, has said he acted under pressure from fellow Democrats and out of a determination to see Donald Trump beaten.</p>

<p>Explaining his shock exit in new detail, Biden said party colleagues standing for reelection feared he was damaging their chances as his age and mental abilities came to dominate the campaign.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since ending his second-term bid on July 21 after his flailing debate performance against Trump triggered a slow-burning Democrat revolt against him.</p>

<p>In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week and broadcast on Sunday, the president appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."</p>

<p>"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he explained.</p>

<p>"I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic you'd be interviewing me about," he continued.</p>

<p>He singled out former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a party heavyweight whose refusal to explicitly back his campaign was seen by many as pivotal.</p>

<p>"You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say (something)... I thought it'd be a real distraction," Biden said.</p>

<p>"A critical issue for me still is -- not a joke -- maintaining this democracy.</p>

<p>"I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is -- we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."</p>

<h3><strong>Helping Harris</strong></h3>

<p>Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery -- and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.</p>

<p>Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since Biden's withdrawal, as Harris enjoys a surge in support that has left Trump and the Republicans struggling.</p>

<p>The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to push for a second.</p>

<p>"I thought of myself as being a transition president -- I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth -- but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.</p>

<p>As Harris holds huge rallies in swing states, Trump's light schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, J.D. Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.</p>

<p>Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about child care, asylum seekers and abortion.</p>

<p>In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."</p>

<p>"I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.</p>

<p>He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.</p>

<p>"If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash.</p>

<p>Biden in his CBS interview warned that Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, if he wins... watch what happens," he said. "He's a genuine danger to American security.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A head tilt to see a chart microseconds before the bullet's impact saved former US President Donald Trump from certain death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A TikTok account, PointConsciousness, tracked the trajectory of the ballistic with a graphic showing how the head tilt saved Trump from losing his life at the rally in Pennsylvania's Butler.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Almost two seconds before the bullet's impact, the right side of Mr Trump's head was in the round's trajectory. A second later, the former US President leaned toward his left and tilted his head slightly right - the AR-15 rifle's bullet grazed his right ear, with blood spattering on his face.</p>

<p><strong>How A Chart Saved Mr Trump's Life</strong></p>

<p>Trump, a hardliner on immigration issues, told Texas Congressman Ronny Jackson, also a doctor, a few hours after the assassination attempt as to how a chart saved his life. In an interview with the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/us/politics/trump-chart-rally.html">New York Times</a>, Mr Jackson recounts what Mr Trump told him over the phone.</p>

<p>The chart featured statistics on immigration during President Joe Biden's regime.</p>

<p>Mr Trump credited the border patrol for "saving his life". He was referring to a chart with immigration statistics on a screen to his right. He tilted his head to take a look at the chart, and that is when the bullet hit his ear, narrowly missing his head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Jackson's nephew was also injured at the rally, he wrote on X. "Thankfully his injury was not serious and he is doing well. My family was sitting in the front, near where the President was speaking. They heard shots ringing out - my nephew then realized he had blood on his neck and something had grazed and cut his neck. He was treated by the providers in the medical tent. Thank you to all those that have reached out to check on him. "</p>

<p>Jason Vecchio, a man who attended the Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, told NDTV. Mr Vechhio, who was 150 steps away from the stage, said that it was a very positive experience until the former president was shot at and then a kind of "confusion and fear set in".</p>

<p>"Those bullets whizzed by him, hit the machine and the boom came down because it hit a hydraulic line. We see Secret Service jump on top of him, to shield him and protect him. It wasn't like instantly that we knew what was going on. Sounded like gunfire because I have been around firearms. We got down and heard the gunfire stop. At that point, I ran over to the fence, hopped over the fence and took cover under a police car just because I wasn't sure if there was a secondary shooter or if a shooter was in the crowd. No one had any idea where the shooter was. So I just wanted to be in the safest place I could be in.</p>

<p>"And then we all watched Trump stand up and put his fist in the air and we all stood up and started chanting. It was quite an experience. It was quite a moving moment to see him stand up after we all just thought he died. And then I walked over to the fence and walked over to my buddies and together we opened the fence and started funnelling everybody through the exit," said Mr Vechhio, recounting what he saw at the event.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt has changed the course of the presidential election campaign, with the Republican party more united and rallying behind its candidate, Donald Trump. Probe agencies are still searching for clues on what led to Crooks attacking Mr Trump.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, responsible for protecting US political leaders, has faced backlash over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was allowed to take a position on a roof some 500 feet from Trump.</p>

<p>Footage has emerged of people sighting the gunman on the roof and trying to warn security before he opened fire. According to CBS News, there were three snipers stationed inside the building the shooter used. The operations plan had them stationed inside the building looking out windows toward the Trump rally. Crooks took out a rangefinder and the Secret Service sniper radioed to the command post, CBS News reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Officers believe that the shooter might have used an air conditioning unit to get on top of the roof.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Britain's new Labour government set out its first package of proposed laws on Wednesday as Prime Minister Keir Starmer tries to deliver on his promise to rebuild the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's new Labour government set out its first package of proposed laws on Wednesday as Prime Minister Keir Starmer tries to deliver on his promise to rebuild the country.</p>

<p>The King's Speech - given by the monarch but written by government ministers - opens the new session of parliament.</p>

<p>Below are some of the government's key policy plans:</p>

<p><strong>PLANNING REFORM</strong></p>

<p>A Planning and Infrastructure Bill will seek to increase the number of homes built each year and simplify the process for approving key infrastructure projects by speeding up the time it takes to get planning permission.</p>

<p>The government signalled the planning bill would restrict the ability of local people to block new developments saying there would be "democratic engagement with how, not if, homes and infrastructure are built".</p>

<p><strong>WORKERS' RIGHTS</strong></p>

<p>An Employment Rights Bill will ban companies imposing zero-hour contracts, outlaw fire and rehire tactics and strengthen workers' rights by providing parental leave, sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal to all workers.</p>

<p>The bill will also make it unlawful to sack a woman who has had a baby for six months after her return to work, except in specific circumstances, and make flexible working the default when people start jobs.</p>

<p><strong>ECONOMIC SAFEGUARDS</strong></p>

<p>A Budget Responsibility Bill will guarantee that any government making significant tax and spending changes would be subject to an independent forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the official budget watchdog.</p>

<p>This is intended to avoid a repeat of former prime minister Liz Truss's 2022 mini-budget, a $50-billion package of unfunded tax cuts which was delivered without an independent assessment, triggering a meltdown in financial markets.</p>

<p><strong>ILLEGAL MIGRATION</strong></p>

<p>The government wants to pass a new border security bill that will give law enforcement agencies counter-terrorism powers to target the gangs who bring tens of thousands of people to Britain in small boats every year.</p>

<p>This will include stop and search powers for border officers and stronger penalties for advertising people smuggling. Labour scrapped the previous Conservative government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.</p>

<p><strong>HOUSING REFORM</strong></p>

<p>Renters will be able to challenge unreasonable rent increases. The Renters' Rights Bill will abolish no fault evictions, end "rental bidding wars", and make it illegal for landlords to discriminate against families with children or those receiving benefits.</p>

<p><strong>FINANCIAL REGULATIONS</strong></p>

<p>The government's new financial bills will seek to encourage consolidation of smaller pension schemes, improve the process for rescuing failed banks by expanding the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and give new powers to a new auditing regulator.</p>

<p><strong>CLIMATE AND ENERGY</strong></p>

<p>The government will pass legislation to set up the centrepiece of its green energy plans, GB Energy, backed by 8.3 billion pounds ($11 billion), to co-invest in leading technologies and help support capital-intensive projects.</p>

<p><strong>RAILWAYS</strong></p>

<p>It will bring rail franchises back under government control when private contracts expire. It will seek to boost east to west connectivity in northern England but will not relaunch a high-speed railway between Birmingham and Manchester.</p>

<p><strong>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS</strong></p>

<p>As part of plans to reform parliament's upper chamber, the House of Lords, it will remove the right of hereditary peers - passed down through family lines indefinitely and without election - to sit and vote. There are 92 hereditary peers out of more than 800 members.</p>

<p><strong>CRIME AND PUNISHMENT</strong></p>

<p>The new crime and policing bill will introduce a ban on so-called "ninja swords", seek to crack down on shoplifting and target people involved in harassment and drinking alcohol in public.</p>

<p><strong>CYBER SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>A Cyber Security and Resilience Bill will update Britain's regulation in a similar manner to the EU's proposed Cyber Resilience Act, forcing companies to report incidents including ransomware incidents to give more data on cyber attacks.</p>

<p><strong>DEVOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>An English Devolution Bill will give mayors and other local leaders more say over economic decisions including on transport and jobs.</p>

<p>Power in Britain is centralised compared to other large economies with many funding decisions made in London. The government says further devolution will help boost productivity and bring about more balanced economic growth.</p>

<p><strong>CONVERSION THERAPY</strong></p>

<p>It plans to ban so-called conversion therapy, which targets lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people with the aim to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>

<p>It said any ban must not cover legitimate psychological support to people exploring their sexual orientation or gender identity. The previous Conservative government had sought to introduce similar legislation.</p>

<p><strong>SMOKING</strong></p>

<p>The government plans to gradually phase out the sale of cigarettes as first announced by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Children born on or after Jan. 1, 2009 will never be able to legally buy cigarettes under a planned bill.</p>

<p><strong>PRIVATE SCHOOLS</strong></p>

<p>Labour plans to end some tax breaks given to fee-paying schools and to use that money to raise standards in government-run schools.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video recording of a private phone call between former US President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was leaked on social media earlier this week. The clip, which was first shared on X by Bobby Kennedy III, offers a first-person account of how Mr Trump remembers his July 13 assassination attempt. In the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/JesseMatchey/status/1813199401097306459">video</a>, he revealed that the gunshot injury "felt like the world's largest mosquito," and expressed his shock when he found out that the gunman fired an AR-15. He also recalled his conversation with President Joe Biden after the shooting.</p>

<p>"It was very nice actually. He (Joe Biden) called me, and he said, 'How did you choose to move to the right?'" Mr Trump told RFK Jr. "I said, 'I was just showing a chart, I didn't have to tell him the chart was on all the people pouring into our country," he continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, Mr Trump went on to say that the gunshot injury "felt like the world's largest mosquito".</p>

<p>Donald Trump was hit in the ear in an apparent assassination attempt by a gunman at a campaign rally today in Pennsylvania on Saturday. The 78-year-old former president was rushed off stage with blood streaked across his face after the shooting, while the shooter and a bystander were killed and two spectators were critically injured.</p>

<p>In an interview with the <em>New York Post</em>, Mr Trump expressed gratitude for his Secret Service detail and called the attempted assassination a day earlier "a very surreal experience." "I'm not supposed to be here, I'm supposed to be dead," he said.</p>

<p>Recounting the incident, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/it-was-god-alone-who-prevented-the-unthinkable-trump-on-assassination-attempt-6104182">Mr Trump </a>added that had he not turned his head slightly to the right to read a chart, he would be dead by now. At that moment, a bullet grazed his ear, tearing off a small piece and splattering blood on his forehead and cheek. Secret Service agents swiftly jumped in, screaming at him to "get down" and tackled him to the ground like "linebackers" before rushing him to a hospital. He even showed off a bruise on his arm from where they grabbed him.</p>

<p>Donald Trump praised the Secret Service for quickly taking down the shooter, who was 130 yards away on a roof. He described the agents' actions as "fantastic" and said they did a great job. He even pointed to his nose to show where they hit the shooter.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two K9 teams from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have reached Paris as part of the 10 K9 teams from various organisations selected to provide security to various venues of the upcoming Paris Olympics, 2024, scheduled from July 26 to August 11.</p>

<p>K9s Vast and Denby, both Belgian Shepherd Malinois, aged five and three years, respectively, left for Paris on July 10 and reached the same day. The Belgian Shepherd Malinois breed is considered to be the most preferred combat dog by security forces worldwide.</p>

<p>Besides the two K9s from the CRPF, the other eight are from Assam Rifles, Sashastra Seema Bal, the National Security Guard, and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.</p>

<p>"Two K9s are selected from each of the Central Armed Police Forces (CRPF). A total of 10 K9s, along with their handlers, have been deployed to secure the various venues of the Paris Olympics. They have been deployed at the request of the French government," said other Central government officials, privy to the development and seeking anonymity.</p>

<p>CRPF K9s Vast and Denby were selected for the job after going through a series of stringent tests held at the Dog Breeding and Training School of CRPF.</p>

<p>"They (Vast and Denby) also underwent specialised training for nearly 10 weeks before their deployment, focusing on the assignments they were likely to be given," said the CRPF.</p>

<p>The handlers of the two K9s, too, were put through rigorous physical training, besides basic classes in the French language, before their departure, said the CRPF in a statement.</p>

<p>The deployment is likely to last until the completion of the Summer Olympic Games in 2024, where athletes from 196 nations are likely to participate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 13-year-old Israeli boy hiking with his father on Mount Carmel stumbled across an 1,800 year-old bronze ring engraved with the image of the mythological Roman goddess Minerva, the Israel Antiquities Authority said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"While hiking I noticed a small green item and picked it up. It was corroded, and at first, I thought it was just a rusty bolt. I thought about heating it, but then fortunately I understood it was a ring. At home, I saw it had an image on it. At first glance, I thought it was a warrior," said Yair Whiteson, of Haifa.</p>

<p>The ring, preserved in its entirety, features the image of a helmeted naked figure holding a shield in one hand and a spear in the other.</p>

<p>Yair, accompanied by his father, who had just returned from a four-month stint in the army reserves, was passing through Khirbet Shalala, an area known for its remains of a Roman farmstead and a nearby ancient rock quarry. Yair's curiosity was piqued by a small, green item lying on the ground. "I'm curious about fossils and rocks and love to collect them," Yair explained, adding that it became apparent that this was not a fossil.</p>

<p>Recognising the potential value of the ring, the family contacted the Antiquities Authority.</p>

<p>Dr Eitan Klein and Nir Distelfeld of the Antiquities Authority identified the figure as Minerva from Roman mythology, also known as Athena in Greek mythology.</p>

<p>"Yair's identification of the figure as a warrior is very close to reality," they explained. "This goddess, who was very popular during the Roman period in the Land of Israel, was considered, among other things, as the goddess of war and military strategy, and also as the goddess of wisdom."</p>

<p>The researchers dated the ring back to the Late Roman Period, the 2nd-3rd Century CE.</p>

<p>Khirbet Shalala also features burial caves at the edge of the quarry, raising speculation about the ring's origins.</p>

<p>"The ring may have belonged to a woman who lived on this farm. Or, it might have fallen from a quarry worker, or it may have been a burial offering from these nearby graves. There are many possibilities," the researchers noted.<br />
The ring will be displayed in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the world prepares for what's likely to be a neck-and-neck contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in US polls, there's another aspect of these elections worth taking note of - its India connection.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been an eventful month in US politics ahead of the November 5 presidential elections. First, President Joe Biden came under severe criticism for what many described as an abysmal performance in the first presidential debate. And then, last Saturday, his Republican counterpart Donald Trump was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania. The former president survived the attack with a minor injury on his ear.</p>

<p>As the world prepares for what's likely to be a neck-and-neck contest between the two candidates, there's another aspect of these elections worth taking note of - its India connection.</p>

<p>Four years ago, it was Kamala Harris, who created history when she became the US Vice President. This time, there's another individual with roots in India. It's Usha Vance, the wife of JD Vance, who is former President Donald Trump's running mate.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris traces her roots in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu where her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born. Ms Shyamala went to the US as a teenager to pursue a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. There, she met Donald J. Harris, and the two got married in 1963. They had two daughters, Kamala Harris (born 1964) and Maya.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Usha Chilukuri Vance was born to immigrant parents from Chilakaluripeta, Andhra Pradesh. She graduated from Yale University with a degree in History, then earned her M.Phil in Early Modern History from Columbia University, and a JD in Law from Yale Law School. She has worked in prestigious law firms and at the US Supreme Court as a legal clerk.</p>

<p>If Biden wins, Kamala Harris will continue her role as Vice President. However, if Trump and Vance emerge victorious, Usha Vance will become the Second Lady and will live at the Naval Observatory.</p>

<p>Recent polls show the popularity of candidates among US voters. According to YouGov, Kamala Harris is liked by 49 per cent of people, while only 28 per cent approve of JD Vance. The poll also shows that many Americans are still deciding what they think about Vance, who is still little-known in presidential politics.</p>

<p>A year ago, in July 2023, Republican and Indian-origin <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hirsh-vardhan-singh-announces-2024-presidential-bid-becomes-3rd-indian-american-to-join-crowded-republican-party-hopefuls-4251326">Hirsh Vardhan Singh</a> announced his bid for the US President in 2024 against Donald Trump who was facing legal challenges. He had filed his candidacy and declared himself a "lifelong Republican" and "America First" conservative. He also referred to himself as the "only pureblood candidate" because he "never gave in to the COVID vaccinations."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine doing a 36-hour shift in a hospital and then turning up willingly the next day to chip away the imperfections to become a beauty queen? That is what Shruti Hegde, a doctor and a beauty queen from Hubli, Karnataka, has been doing since 2018.</p>

<p>This Kannadiga's hard work has paid off though.</p>

<p>A little over a month ago, on June 10, Shruti Hegde became India's first Miss Universal Petite, a pageant that was started in 2009 to give opportunity to shorter women, who found themselves often dwarfed by the amazonian standards when it comes to height.</p>

<p>The pageantry is held in Tampa, Florida in the United States of America, every year.</p>

<p>“It was not easy for sure. I realised that being a doctor is a lot more work than I initially thought. Yes, it becomes too much at times. But I don't think I will be choosing one over the other. Instead, I want to find a balance between both,” said Hegde to PTI.</p>

<p>When she took the pageantry route, Hegde said she never gave much thought to winning.</p>

<p>“I am always wanting to do new things, and I guess it is almost every small-town girl's dream – to be a beauty queen. So, I thought I'll just give it a try. It helped that I had a mother who is keener than me that I should do what I want to do,” said Hegde.</p>

<p>That is how Hedge found herself signing up for Miss Dharwad contest in 2018. But when she won the contest, things took a serious turn.</p>

<p>“During the course of the contest, I realized that I was learning a lot of life lessons too – the kind that will help me be a better person and be better equipped to tackle any kind of situation. So, I decided to give my all to it, and see where it took me,” said Hegde, who is currently pursuing MD in dermatology and working as an intern at a hospital in Tumakuru, a city about 70 km away from Bengaluru.</p>

<p>But she soon hit the next roadblock. Not only did a small town like Hubballi have the necessary means for all the preparations required to become a beauty queen, but she also had to take a break and deal with a medical emergency.</p>

<p>“In 2019, I was diagnosed with benign ovarian and uterine tumours and had to undergo open surgery. This ate up two years of my life – 2019 and 2020 – as I recuperated. I thought that was the end of my pageantry career for a while. Again, my mother wouldn't let me off so easily. She stood behind me like a rock,” said Hegde.</p>

<p>And so, Hegde said she bounced back, went tripping all over India, taking classes to get herself the poised look of a beauty queen.</p>

<p>“There's so much to it – diction, clothing, walking… And initially, you will have to spend for all that, in lakhs and lakhs. But by now nothing could stop me, I wanted to go all the way,” said Hedge.</p>

<p>Once she won a big title – the second runner up of Miss Asia International India 2023 – financial strain lessened a lot, said Hegde.</p>

<p>“I started getting sponsors for my clothes and stuff. Which was a relief because earlier I had only a couple of outfits that I was forced to wear to different pageantries,” Hegde.</p>

<p>As expected, pageantry opened other doors in the entertainment industry. Since 2023, Hegde said she has been receiving offers to act in serials and films.</p>

<p>“Again, I ventured into it cautiously. Started first with serials. But the film that I just finished shooting for, ‘Sharanara Shakti', made me realise a film career may not be a bad thing,” added Hegde.</p>

<p>Hegde said she just played a dancer in the period film that traces the life of the 12th century philosopher, poet and social reformer Basavanna.</p>

<p>“I realised that the Kannada film industry is again opening itself, making it possible for films like ‘Sharanara Shakti'. It's perhaps the best time to be an actor here. I have now decided to take that plunge and see where it goes,” said Hegde.</p>

<p>Hegde added that she is shooting right now for ‘Janumadata', another odd-ball film that explores the undercurrent of the tense relationship between a father and son.</p>

<p>“I play the lead this time – the girlfriend who encourages the guy to face things head-on even as he struggles to accept his father as he is,” said Hegde.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a significant departure from tradition, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have changed the surnames of their children. Recently, the couple launched its new website, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://sussex.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721292383731000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1fTMnJd6dlVe7rK2TRlQcr" href="http://sussex.com/" target="_blank">sussex.com</a>, where many noticed the change, the Mirror reported.</p>

<p>Princess Lilibet and Prince Archie have now taken the surname Sussex, instead of Mountbatten-Windsors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1960, Mountbatten-Windsor was decreed by the Privy Counsel, the official advisors to the late Queen Elizabeth II. The surname is applied to the male-line descendants of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source told The Times that the reality behind Harry and Meghan's new website is "very simple — it's a hub for the work the Sussexes do and it reflects the fact the family have, since the King's coronation, the same surname for the first time."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The source noted this was a "big deal for any family."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It represents their unification and it's a proud moment," the source added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the couple's decision to use their children's royal titles has come as a bit "surprising," with many accusing them of boasting their links to the Britain's Royal family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you open the website, the homepage welcomes users to the official site of "The Office of Prince Harry &amp; Meghan, The Duke &amp; Duchess of Sussex". Besides this, it also features a special coat of arms, especially designed for Meghan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The website also offers a detailed bio for each of them -- Harry and Meghan -- separately.</p>

<p>"Prince Harry lives in California with his wife Meghan, and their two children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet," reads Harry's bio.</p>

<p>Mentioning their children as 'Prince' and 'Princess' has caused "surprise," a source told Mirror.</p>

<p>Archie and Lilibet weren't provided the titles at the time of birth because back then they were not grandchildren of the monarch. After Charlies became the King in 2022, the two of them became the grandchildren of a Monarch, thereby changing their status.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is little more than an afterthought for attendees at the Republican National Convention, who are gathered this week to crown Donald Trump as their party's nominee for this November's election.</p>

<p>"I don't believe all that," said Jack Prendergast, from New York, who believes that human activity does just as much harm to the planet as "when a volcano goes off."</p>

<p>"Trump is going to drill pipelines and we'll become the leading supplier of energy in the world, in the gas and the oil," Prendergast told AFP.</p>

<p>And the former president has promised as much -- adopting the slogan "drill, baby, drill" to sum up his fossil fuel-friendly approach.</p>

<p>Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord during his first term, on Monday appointed a fellow climate skeptic as his running mate: Ohio Senator J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old, who would become Trump's vice president if they are elected, has previously accused Democrats of stirring up fears about climate change for political gain.</p>

<p>The two men will run on a 5,000-word Republican platform adopted on Monday by the party's delegates which makes no mention of plans for climate change or renewable energy.</p>

<p>Instead, it promises to end "green" policies it deems "socialist," and says the United States will become the world's number one oil and natural gas producer -- a position it already holds, according to official data.</p>

<p>Trump himself has said he is opposed to wind power -- a widely-touted alternative to fossil fuels -- as he is convinced it "kills all the birds."</p>

<h2><strong>'Bright future'&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Climate groups such as the Sunrise Movement have criticized the Republican platform, saying the party "has made it clear that they're happy to make the climate crisis worse."</p>

<p>But for Stephen Perkins of the American Conservation Coalition -- perhaps the only booth at the Republican convention focused on preserving the planet -- you have to take Trump's comments with "a grain of salt."</p>

<p>"I think that some of his comments are meant to be more entertaining than policy positions," said the 29-year-old, wearing a striped blue polo shirt.</p>

<p>His organization is hoping to show what a "conservative approach to environmental policy and climate policy look like," which he thinks could entice younger voters.</p>

<p>But he concedes it's a "slow process," with older Republicans averse to agreeing to action on climate change.</p>

<p>According to a Yale survey published on Tuesday, more than two-thirds of Americans do believe in the existence of climate change.</p>

<p>However, that does not necessarily translate into support for Democratic President Joe Biden, who has pushed through several initiatives to combat global warming during his time in office.</p>

<p>Perkins instead believes Biden is at the mercy of a "radical sect" of progressives "that doesn't engage in nuance." His convention stand shows the word "destruction" alongside images of left-wing environmental activists throwing soup at a work of art.</p>

<p>If he had it his way, he would show that "we have a bright future ahead" despite the challenges of climate change, instead of "the doom and gloom."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The news has sparked a frenzy on social media, with many noticing that the couple unfollowed each other on Instagram and deleted all photos of each other from their profiles. Some speculated the pair had blocked each other, while others wondered if Ms Sheikha Mahra's account had been hacked.</p>

<p>“Bad news. God bless you,” a user commented under the post.</p>

<p>Another wrote, “I am proud. Your Decision.”</p>

<p>A user applauded the princess for her “courage and bravery”, saying, “It is just a phase of life and it will continue with good and bitterness and life doesn't stop for anybody.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, someone asked, “But the divorce will occur from Husband's side, right? And Wife has to choose Khul'?"</p>

<p>The couple got married in May last year, and they welcomed their daughter 12 months later. Ms Sheikha Mahra had gushed about her "most memorable experience" giving birth, thanking her doctor and hospital staff for their care. In photos, her husband, Sheikh Mana, was seen cradling their little one in his arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just weeks ago, the princess had shared a cryptic post on Instagram, cuddling with her baby, writing, "Just the two of us." Was that a possible hint at the trouble brewing beneath the surface?&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece's most visited tourist attraction, the Athens Acropolis, is to close during the hottest hours of Wednesday, authorities said as a heatwave scorches the country.</p>

<p>Tourists won't be able to visit the Parthenon and other ancient masterpieces atop the UNESCO-listed archaeological site between noon and 5:00 pm local time (0900-1400 GMT), the culture ministry said.</p>

<p>The limited closure -- which is the second announced in just over a month -- comes as Greece's national weather service predicted temperatures above 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.</p>

<p>Greece's earliest-ever heatwave forced the Acropolis to close for the hottest hours of the day for two days in a row in June.</p>

<p>A record number of almost four million visitors flocked to the Acropolis in 2023, its popularity boosted in part due to tourists arriving on cruise ships calling in at the nearby port of Piraeus.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As questions swirl over how a would-be assassin managed to get anywhere near Donald Trump, some conservatives are blaming the Secret Service for hiring the women agents who threw themselves into the line of fire to protect the former president.</p>

<p>Women are too short, too weak -- and in some cases, too overweight -- to protect someone like Trump, according to people on the US political right who accused the Secret Service of "woke" hiring practices they say nearly got the former president killed.</p>

<p>Several women can be seen among the black-suited, sunglass-clad agents racing to shield Trump with their bodies as the gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, before hustling him from the stage and into a waiting car and safety.</p>

<p>But they, along with their boss Kimberly Cheatle -- only the second-ever woman director of the federal agency tasked with protecting presidents current, former and would-be -- are now caught in the intense scrutiny over the nearly catastrophic attack.</p>

<p>"There should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women," right-wing activist Matt Walsh wrote on X, in one typical post.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service. #sarcasm," tweeted Republican congressman Tim Burchett.</p>

<p>Burchett was referring to Cheatle's previous job as director of global security for Pepsi -- a post she held for several years before returning to the Secret Service, where she had previously spent nearly three decades.</p>

<p>With the phrase DEI -- diversity, equity and inclusion -- he was invoking one of the most popular conservative fronts in the culture wars: the so-called "wokeification" of the workplace as employers strive to diversify their hiring practices beyond white men.</p>

<p>The first women were sworn in as Secret Service agents in 1971. CBS News reported last year that the agency aims to have 30 per cent women recruits by 2030.</p>

<p>"I'm very conscious ... of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women," Cheatle told CBS at the time.</p>

<p>The wildly popular conservative Libs of TikTok account cited that interview in a post also blaming hiring practices for the Trump shooting that has received more than 10 million views on X.</p>

<p>"The results of DEI. DEI got someone killed," it read.</p>

<h3><strong>'Secret Service A-team'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Diverse hiring practices accelerated in 2020 after the George Floyd killing forced America into a new reckoning over racism and inclusivity.</p>

<p>But they have seen a growing backlash from conservatives in recent months who complain they unfairly disadvantage white workers in general, and white men in particular.</p>

<p>None other than Ohio Senator J.D. Vance -- Trump's newly-announced running mate -- has spearheaded a recent bill to do away with such efforts.</p>

<p>"DEI is racism, plain and simple. It's time to outlaw it nationwide, starting with the federal government," he tweeted last month as the bill was introduced.</p>

<p>Such practices at the Secret Service faced scrutiny as recently as May, when Congress launched an investigation after a female agent in Vice President Kamala Harris's detail reportedly got into an altercation with colleagues.</p>

<p>The incident raised concerns about this agent's hiring, Kentucky Republican James Comer said in a letter to Cheatle -- specifically, whether staff shortages "had led the agency to lower once stricter standards as a part of a diversity, equity and inclusion effort."</p>

<p>The Secret Service did not immediately respond to questions from AFP.</p>

<p>But in response to the Comer letter, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told US media that Secret Service employees "are held to the highest professional standards... at no time has the agency lowered these standards."</p>

<p>Cheatle has shrugged off calls for her resignation since the shooting, and the agency has agreed to cooperate with an independent review ordered by President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Comer has also announced that Cheatle will appear before a congressional panel on July 22 for a hearing on the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Biden -- in whose detail Cheatle served when he was vice president -- told NBC News on Monday that he feels "safe with the Secret Service," though he agreed it was an "open question" whether they should have anticipated the shooting.</p>

<p>When Trump made his first public appearance after the shooting, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday, he appeared to be surrounded by an all-male Secret Service detail.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[San Francisco, July 17 (IANS) Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday said he will move the headquarters of its aerospace company as well as social media platform X from the US state of California.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk today said he will move the headquarters of its aerospace company as well as social media platform X from the US state of California.</p>

<p>Musk's decision came after California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law that prevents schools from requiring employees to notify parents if students want to use names or pronouns other than what's on their birth certificates.</p>

<p>"This is the final straw. Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies," the tech billionaire posted.</p>

<p>"SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas," Musk added.</p>

<p>He further said that he did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that "laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children".</p>

<p>"Authorities keep saying it will get better, but it doesn't. Last week was the worst experience ever. Crime is allowed to run rampant in California," the Tesla CEO lamented.</p>

<p>Musk has already shifted Tesla headquarters from California to Texas.</p>

<p>An X user posted: "Congratulations on making this choice. The beautiful thing about a republic of 50 states is that if one state becomes tyrannical, we have the choice as Americans to leave and go somewhere that better reflects our values".</p>

<p>The SpaceX headquarters will be moved out of Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, a SpaceX complex and launch site near Brownsville, Texas.</p>

<p>X social media platform will also move its headquarters from San Francisco, California to Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>"Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building," said Musk.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran on Wednesday rejected what it called "malicious" accusations by US media implicating it in a plot to kill former US president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>CNN reported Tuesday that US authorities received intelligence from a "human source" weeks ago on an alleged Iranian plot against the former president, prompting his protection to be boosted. Other US outlets also reported the alleged plot.</p>

<p>CNN said the alleged plot was not linked to Saturday's shooting at a Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania, in which the former president was wounded and a supporter killed.</p>

<p>The US National Security Council said it had been "tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years" after Tehran threatened revenge for the 2020 killing of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in neighbouring Iraq.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations called the accusations "unsubstantiated and malicious".</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said Iran "strongly rejects any involvement in the recent armed attack against Trump".</p>

<p>He added however that Iran remains "determined to prosecute Trump over his direct role in the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani".</p>

<p>Soleimani headed the foreign operations arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, overseeing Iranian military operations across the Middle East.</p>

<p>Trump ordered his killing in a drone strike just outside Baghdad airport.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world reacted with horror 10 years ago when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.</p>

<p>The crash came in the early stages of a war in which Moscow seized the Crimean Peninsula from Kyiv and stoked an insurgency by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine's east.</p>

<h3><strong>What happened?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The doomed flight took off from Amsterdam on a bright summer's day on July 17, 2014.</p>

<p>Among the passengers were Dutch HIV/AIDS expert Joep Lange, on his way to a conference in Melbourne, and Jeroen and Nicole Wals and their four children, who were Malaysia-bound on a holiday.</p>

<p>At 4:19 pm (1319 GMT), while flying over eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region where pro-Russian separatist rebels were battling Ukraine forces, the plane exploded in mid-air, at an altitude of 33,000 feet (10.1 kilometres).</p>

<p>All 298 people on board were killed, 196 of them Dutch, as well as 43 Malaysians and 38 Australians.</p>

<p>A later reconstruction of the jet using some of the wreckage revealed the horror of the plane's last moments.</p>

<p>"The forward section of the aircraft was penetrated by hundreds of high-energy objects coming from the warhead," a Dutch-led international investigation heard.</p>

<p>"As a result of the impact and the subsequent blast, the three crew members in the cockpit were killed immediately and the aeroplane broke up in the air."</p>

<p>The investigators said some of the passengers may have known for up to 90 seconds that they were about to die.</p>

<h3><strong>Who was held responsible?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Russia and Ukraine immediately traded blame for the plane's downing.</p>

<p>The international probe in 2016 found "irrefutable evidence" that the plane was downed by a Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missile system which was transported from Russia to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Investigators later determined that the missile originated in a Russian military brigade based in the western city of Kursk.</p>

<p>Russia denied that any anti-aircraft missile crossed the border.</p>

<p>In June 2019, four senior figures in east Ukraine's self-styled rebel Donetsk People's Republic, Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov of Russia, and Leonid Kharchenko of Ukraine were charged with murder.</p>

<p>They were accused of bringing the missile system to the launch site in eastern Ukraine (but not of actually pressing the button).</p>

<p>The investigators said there were "strong indications" that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the supply of the missile.</p>

<h3><strong>Was anyone convicted?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>After a two-and-a-half-year trial, a Dutch court in November 2022 convicted Girkin, Dubinsky, and Kharchenko in absentia of murder and intentionally causing an aircraft to crash and sentenced them to life in prison.</p>

<p>The three refused to take part in the legal proceedings or acknowledge their roles in the incident.</p>

<p>Pulatov was acquitted.</p>

<p>Russia dismissed the court verdict as politically motivated.</p>

<p>In January 2024, Girkin was jailed for four years in Russia for repeatedly criticising the Kremlin for not pursuing a more aggressive offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In 2023, the MH17 crash investigators suspended their work, saying there was not enough evidence to prosecute more suspects.</p>

<h3><strong>Has justice been served?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>An investigation against Russia is still ongoing at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency.</p>

<p>The Netherlands and Ukraine have also jointly taken a case against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, however, hope is fading that any of those responsible will ever be brought to justice.</p>

<p>"In the end, we were unable to put anyone behind bars," Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told public broadcaster NOS on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the disaster.</p>

<p>"That sense of justice is there, but ultimately not as it should have been," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American singer Ingrid Andress has revealed that she was "drunk" when she performed the national anthem at the Major League Baseball's (MLB) Home Run Derby and is seeking treatment now.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Andress, 32, addressed her out-of-tune performance of the 'Star-Spangled Banner' at the Globe Life Field in Texas' Arlington on Monday evening and announced that she would check into a rehab facility for required help.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/e093z2NoJo">pic.twitter.com/e093z2NoJo</a></p>
— Ingrid Andress (@IngridAndress) <a href="https://twitter.com/IngridAndress/status/1813261515257999679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"I'm not gonna bulls*** y'll, I was drunk last night. I'm checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need," she wrote. Andress later apologised to her fans and the MLB for the same.</p>

<p>"I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country for that rendition. I'll let y'all know how rehab is. I hear it's super fun," she added.</p>

<p>Soon after Andress' performance, social media was abuzz with criticism.</p>

<p>Many speculated the singer struggled with more than just the in-ear issues on stage. Her performance, according to reports, started off-key and even strained for high notes.</p>

<p>Several termed it among the worst national anthem performances ever heard during a major professional sporting event, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>Some social media users compared it to Fergie's rendition before the 2018 NBA All-Star game.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Ingrid Andress?</strong></h2>

<p>Andress came into the limelight after her appearance in the second season of The Sing-Off as a part of the Pitch Slapped group in 2010. While the group got eliminated early, Andress returned to the show as part of another group, Delilah, in the next season.</p>

<p>In 2020, she debuted her first album, Lady Like, which topped the Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.</p>

<p>She was later nominated for the Best New Artist Grammy in 2021. However, she lost to rapper Megan Thee Stallion.</p>

<p>While her most recent album -- Good Person -- was released in 2022, Andress is now gearing up for the release of her new single Colorado 9 next week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronauts often report that the joy of eating is lost in space. Food that tastes fabulous on Earth may become <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899900702009358?via%3Dihub">bland and boring in orbit</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, despite carefully designed diets, space travellers often <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/human-adaptation-2021-final.pdf">struggle to eat enough to meet their energy needs</a>.</p>

<p>What's going on here? We carried out some experiments on Earth to find out, using virtual reality (VR) and a simulated spacecraft environment to study how space travel might affect a person's sense of smell and experience of food.</p>

<p>We discovered that some smells seem much more intense in a space-like environment – and earlier theories about how zero gravity affects the body can't be the whole story. Our results, <a href="https://ifst.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijfs.17306">published</a> in the International Journal of Food Science and Technology, could help design the space menus of the future.</p>

<h2>Eating is a complicated experience</h2>

<p>Eating is a multi-sensory experience that involves sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch.</p>

<p>To enjoy the flavour of food – say, when biting into an apple – we need a combination of sensations, including taste (sweet, sour), smell (the complex combination of apple aromas), texture (the crunch), colour (green, red), and touch (firmness). If any of these senses is dulled, our enjoyment of food will not be the same.</p>

<p>The experience of food in space is very different from what we are used to on Earth.</p>

<p>One possible explanation for why space travellers experience taste differently involves the lack of gravity. Without gravity, bodily fluids are not drawn towards the feet but instead <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb10622.x">shift towards the head</a>, leading to a sensation <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1541-4337.12633">like having a blocked nose</a>. If you've ever had a cold, you know how difficult it is to taste and enjoy food without your sense of smell.</p>

<p>But could there be other reasons?</p>

<h2>The importance of environment</h2>

<p>In space, the environment is unfamiliar and consistently monotonous. Could this change our perception of food?</p>

<p>Context heavily contributes to the eating experience. Studies have shown that eating the same meal in <a href="https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-82188b09-5e0d-341c-a5c2-826baefddca6">different settings</a> can lead to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329302001891">varying opinions</a> about the meal. Think about enjoying a picnic sandwich in a scenic park versus eating the same sandwich quickly at your work desk.</p>

<p>A spacecraft is an enclosed and confined environment, an airtight container in which you are surrounded by wiring and equipment and with no boundary between work and personal space. Imagine being in a pandemic-grade lockdown for multiple years with limited food and essential goods (and a persistent blocked nose).</p>

<p>One <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/joss.12254">taste-test study</a> compared airline meals consumed in three settings: a classic sensory laboratory environment (quiet, closed or semi-closed cubicles – like a voting booth), a semi-realistic aircraft environment simulated in a laboratory using aircraft furnishings, and an actual flight.</p>

<p>Passengers in the simulated aircraft environment enjoyed their meals about as much as passengers on an actual flight did. (Both of them liked it less than the people in the lab environment did.) This suggests the aircraft environment has a significant influence on food enjoyment.</p>

<h2>Bringing space to Earth</h2>

<p>Research involving humans in space is very challenging. Space missions typically involve at most <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-facts-and-figures/">six or seven crew members</a>, which limits the sample size for experiments and the predictive power of the results.</p>

<p>Moreover, for food research, each person has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221479931500048X">unique sensory experiences</a> and responses toward them. This makes it challenging to understand how different individuals perceive smells in space, let alone food aromas.</p>

<p>So we set out to recreate space on Earth. Using VR, we simulated the environment of the International Space Station.</p>

<p>The VR setup let us obtain data about participants' feelings regarding food stimuli “in the moment”, rather than waiting for them to take off the headset and asking them questions afterwards. VR is a vital training environment for astronauts because of its unmatched ability to create a realistic sense of presence, crucial for studying what it is like to live in a spacecraft.</p>

</figure>

<p>Our study is the first to involve a significant sample size (54 people) to capture the variation of individuals' personal experiences of aromas and taste in simulated isolated settings.</p>

<p>In our study comparing everyday aromas, some scents were perceived differently in the virtual International Space Station environment compared to the partitioned booth environment.</p>

<h2>Molecular magic of aroma</h2>

<p>Aromas are <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemistry/articles/10.3389/fchem.2022.820749/full">a complex blend of molecules</a> with unique chemical structures, influencing how they interact with the olfactory receptors in the nose to form distinctive smells.</p>

<p>Our study suggests that only specific aroma compounds are perceived differently in space-like environments. We found that sweet-smelling molecules tended to be perceived more strongly.</p>

<p>Vanilla and almond, which both contain the sweet, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b05845">almond- or cherry-scented</a> compound benzaldehyde, smelled stronger in our VR space station than in the control environment. By contrast, there was no difference in perception of the lemon aroma.</p>

<p>This knowledge could be used in designing space meals. For example, the sweet aromas could be used as flavour enhancers or additives to bring out other flavours and add depth.</p>

<p>Understanding how these aroma compounds interact with each other, and finding the right concentration levels is essential. And of course, no single flavour will suit everybody's taste.</p>

<h2>Earthly implications</h2>

<p>A better understanding of how smell is perceived in space-like environments could inspire ways to create personalised diets based on each astronaut's unique sensory experiences and preferences.

<p>What do actors Amitabh Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Shilpa Shetty, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, National Stock Exchange (NSE) MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan, and Indian industrialists Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani have in common? They've all been targets of deepfake videos that used their personas to peddle weight loss drugs and medication for diabetes, and promote fraudulent money-making schemes on social media.</p>

<p>Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have ushered in a new era of technological disruption, with deepfakes emerging as a particularly concerning challenge for India's information integrity and public discourse.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Political Misinformation</strong></h2>

<p>In the buildup to the recent Lok Sabha elections, significant numbers of people in India had already been targeted by audio and audio-visual deepfakes, although these were mainly attempts to scam them in various ways. Around the Lok Sabha elections, there were also initial fears that political deepfakes could be used to try to influence voters.</p>

<p>These fears were only justified when the election campaign got underway. Fake clips showing Bollywood actors Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi were circulated widely. However, ultimately, it may be said that while there were instances of deepfakes being used for mudslinging, targeted political attacks and even spreading misinformation about exit polls, parties used technology largely for their own voter outreach and engagement and to overcome language barriers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deepfakes were also used by parties to 'resurrect' their dead leaders to enhance the emotional connection with voters. In Tamil Nadu, an AI-generated voice message from former chief minister J. Jayalalithaa, who died in 2016, was circulated to criticise the current governing party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK in turn used AI-generated videos of their own deceased leader, M. Karunanidhi, to praise his son and current chief minister, M.K. Stalin.</p>

<h2><strong>Cheapfakes vs Deepfakes</strong></h2>

<p>While the risk posed by AI-generated content during the elections wasn't as deep as expected, even edited videos were often misattributed as AI-generated or "deepfake" content. For instance, an edited video of Union Home Minister Amit Shah that was circulated before the polls falsely claimed that he promised to scrap reservations for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) if elected. While the clip was edited using simple video editing tools, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and several mainstream media organisations mislabelled it as a "deepfake".</p>

<p>It is important to remember that deepfakes are AI-generated media created using machine learning algorithms that can map one person's face onto another's body, and even alter their speech. Creating such media requires significant computational power. In contrast, 'cheapfakes' are manipulated media created using relatively simple editing tools. They are less sophisticated than deepfakes but can still effectively spread misinformation. They continue to be used widely in India.</p>

<h2><strong>What India Should Do</strong></h2>

<p>From detection algorithms for deepfakes to media literacy for cheapfakes, India can and should develop more targeted countermeasures for the various kinds of manipulated media.</p>

<p>The creation of deepfakes, which was once a complex and time-consuming process, has increasingly become very accessible. The turnaround time has reduced from days to minutes, even seconds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such rapid evolution in technology poses a significant challenge for fact-checkers and content moderators, who struggle to keep up with the pace of misinformation. Fact-checkers in India have found it an uphill battle to debunk deepfake content when it is spread at speed and scale or during heightened activity, such as election seasons. The disparity in the speed of information dissemination underscores the urgent need for more efficient and streamlined verification processes. A multifaceted approach is required to safeguard the integrity of its democratic processes. This approach must encompass technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and a shift in societal mindsets.</p>

<h2><strong>The Way Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>While deepfakes have become increasingly difficult to detect, developing AI-powered tools to identify and counter such manipulated content holds promise. Tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI have pledged to work closely with the Indian government and voters to protect access to truthful information. However, the effectiveness of the currently proposed measures, such as labelling and watermarking, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Continued innovation and collaboration in this domain is paramount. By leveraging AI-powered tools, fact-checkers and content moderators can expedite the time it takes to discover false claims, pre-empt them before they cause harm and, in time, even automate deepfake detection, freeing up valuable human resources to focus on more nuanced and contextual analysis. This shift in mindset, from viewing AI as the ultimate verifier to understanding its role in supporting human verification, can lead to more efficient and effective strategies for combating deepfake-driven misinformation.</p>

<p>The Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU) initiative, a first-of-its-kind collaboration of academics, researchers, startups, tech platforms, and fact-checkers, is an example of notable efforts in this area.</p>

<p>Fostering a media-literate population is also crucial to counter deepfakes. Educating the public about the risks and the need to verify information can empower them to navigate digital content with scepticism and resilience.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Learning From Others</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian government's initial reluctance to regulate AI seems to be ebbing as technology's potential for misuse becomes clearer. Recently, following a controversy over Google's Gemini chatbot, the government issued an advisory that reminded intermediaries to take action against AI-generated content that violates the provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Rules, which includes the spread of patently false or untrue information. The advisory also states that where software allows for the creation of deepfakes, it should also label or embed the content with unique identifying data that can be used to determine how the content was created, and by which user.</p>

<p>The deepfake challenge is not unique to India; it is a global phenomenon that requires a coordinated international response. The European Union will seek to regulate high-risk AI systems through its Artificial Intelligence Act. The UK, too, has tasked its regulators with developing rules for various sectors and use-cases. The US Department of Commerce may also issue guidance on labelling and watermarking deep fakes and develop standards for red-teaming AI models, which can have multiple uses.</p>

<p>India ought to develop a unique framework that suits its information environment. This can not only effectively counter the use of harmful deepfakes but also protect free speech and useful innovation (like developing generative AI tools that can help address language barriers).</p>

<h2><strong>Don't Drop the Guard</strong></h2>

<p>As many as 86% of Indians who were surveyed recently said that they believe misinformation and deepfakes will impact future elections and that candidates should be stopped from using generative AI in their promotional content. While the risk has not become as pronounced for now, the steady proliferation of deepfake videos of celebrities, industrialists, and news anchors promoting false medical and financial solutions shows the technology's potential for perpetuating financial fraud. Amid this, the exploitation of ordinary citizens remains a primary concern.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To navigate this challenge, India must embrace AI's potential to streamline the verification process. By learning from global best practices, India can safeguard the democratic foundations of its elections and empower its citizens to navigate the digital landscape with confidence.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service is facing intense scrutiny after a shooter opened fire on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally, and questions have emerged about why no sniper team was positioned on the building from which the shots were fired. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has attributed the absence of a sniper team to the "sloped roof" of the building, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-rally-shooting-unacceptable-secret-service-director-abc-exclusive/story?id=111962314">ABC News</a>, Cheatle explained, "That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. The decision was made to secure the building from inside."</p>

<p>The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had a clear line of sight of Trump from the roof, which was approximately 130 yards away. Using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle, Crooks opened fire, injuring Trump and two others, and killing firefighter Corey Comperatore. Secret Service snipers ultimately killed Crooks.</p>

<p>Despite acknowledging the agency's missteps, Cheatle refused to step down, stating, "It was unacceptable, and it's something that shouldn't happen again. The buck stops with me."</p>

<p>The incident has spurred a wave of criticism toward the Secret Service for failing to fulfil its "no fail" responsibility of protecting high-profile figures. President Joe Biden announced an independent review of the agency's handling of the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, and Republican leaders in Congress have also called for an investigation.</p>

<p>Key questions remain about the safety roles at the rally and why the roof used by Crooks was not secured. Cheatle noted that the building where the shooter was located was in the "outer perimeter" of the rally, which was the responsibility of local police. "There was local police in that building -- there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building," she said, though she did not clarify how the shooter was able to access the roof.</p>

<p>The attack has prompted the Secret Service to vow full cooperation with the independent review. Cheatle stated, "The Secret Service is working with all involved federal, state, and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again. We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President Biden yesterday and will participate fully."</p>

<p>The rally, held in Butler, Pennsylvania, was interrupted when multiple gunshots rang out. Trump, visibly injured with blood on his ear and cheek, was swiftly surrounded by Secret Service agents and rushed to safety. The shooter and a bystander were killed, and two spectators were injured.</p>

<p>Newly surfaced video supports witness reports that they had alerted police to the shooter on the roof. According to the Washington Post, shots targeting Trump were fired 86 seconds after the first attempts to warn the police.</p>

<p>In response to the incident, Biden has ordered a comprehensive review of security at the rally and at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is expected to be the party's presidential nominee. Additionally, Secret Service protection has been extended to independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, whose candidacy could impact key swing states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bodies of six foreign nationals were found in a luxury hotel room in central Bangkok on Tuesday, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six people have been discovered dead in a suite of a Bangkok hotel, sparking a wave of confusion and speculation across the city. Initially reported as a shooting, authorities have since debunked these claims, focusing instead on a harrowing possibility: poisoning.</p>

<p>The victims, all Vietnamese nationals, including two with dual US citizenship, were found in a room at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel.</p>

<p>The cleaning staff discovered the bodies at 4.30 pm on the fifth floor of the hotel. Police were called, and PM Thavisin arrived soon after. "There were no signs of a struggle," the prime minister told a press conference at the hotel.</p>

<p>Thai police, in a subsequent press conference, revealed that preliminary investigations indicated no signs of physical altercation or robbery. Instead, suspicions turned towards a lethal ingestion of a toxic substance, possibly cyanide.</p>

<p>"One of the six dead caused this incident using cyanide," said Noppasil Poonsawas, deputy commander of investigations at Bangkok's Metropolitan Police Bureau, in a press conference. "We are confident that one of the six conducted the crime."</p>

<p>But photos released by police of a bloodless crime scene showed plates of untouched Thai food, and two thermos flasks of coffee and cups.</p>

<p>The police chief said they needed to find out why this happened, adding it was a "killing", not a suicide.</p>

<p>The motive behind this tragic incident remains unclear as authorities delve deeper into the backgrounds of the deceased. Some of the victims were visiting Thailand for the first time, while others were familiar with the country's attractions.</p>

<p>The area where the incident occurred is popular with tourists and has many shopping malls and attractions. There was a shooting in the area last year in which three people were killed. Thailand's tourism industry has been recovering slowly from the pandemic, with 28 million visitors in 2023, up from 11 million the previous year.</p>

<p>The government hopes to attract 35 million visitors in 2024 and generate $55 billion in revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

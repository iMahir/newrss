       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven people, including a six-year-old and 16-year-old, were killed when a bus overturned east of Vicksburg, Mississippi, early Saturday, Warren County Coroner Doug Huskey said.</p>

<p>The two young victims were siblings, according to the coroner.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Highway Patrol said the incident took place around 12:40 a.m. on Interstate 20 near Bovina in Warren County when a 2018 Volvo commercial passenger bus traveling westbound left the roadway and overturned.</p>

<p>Thirty-seven passengers were transported to different hospitals with unknown injuries, the agency said. It said the co-driver was not transported.</p>

<p>"Anytime you have people injured or killed, it's tragic but when you have a situation like this where you have multiple fatalities and multiple injuries, it makes it even worse," Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace told an ABC affiliate.</p>

<p>Huskey said most of the passengers on the bus were Latin American.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi said on Saturday that they attacked a Liberia-flagged container vessel for a second time in the latest action against commercial shipping in the Gulf of Aden.</p>

<p>Yemeni military spokesperson Yahya Saree's televised statement did not specify when the latest attack on the MV Groton took place.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said in an advisory note that two missiles exploded on Friday in close proximity to the vessel, 130 nautical miles east of Yemen's Aden. It said the crew was safe. There was no mention of damage to the vessel.</p>

<p>"The operation was carried out by the naval, UAV, and the missile forces ... This is the second targeting of the ship since it was previously targeted on Aug. 3," Saree said.</p>

<p>Houthi have sunk two vessels during a nine-month drone and missile campaign against commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>

<p>They say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip and likely will continue if a ceasefire is not reached.</p>

<p>In one of their most recent attacks, the Houthis carried out multiple assaults against Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which is carrying about 1 million barrels of oil.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crew member on Mike Lynch's yacht has spoken of being thrown into the water and efforts to rescue passengers as a storm sank the vessel off Sicily this month, in a disaster that killed the British tech tycoon and six other people.</p>

<p>Matthew Griffiths, who was on watch duty on the night of the tragedy, told investigators that the crew members did everything they could to save those on board the Bayesian, according to comments reported by Italian news agency Ansa.</p>

<p>Griffiths, the boat's captain James Cutfield, and ship engineer Tim Parker Eaton have been placed under investigation by the Italian authorities for potential manslaughter and shipwreck. Being investigated does not imply guilt and does not mean formal charges will follow.</p>

<p>"I woke up the captain when the wind was at 20 knots (23 mph/37 kph). He gave orders to wake everyone else," Ansa quoted Griffiths as saying.</p>

<p>"The ship tilted and we were thrown into the water. Then we managed to get back up and tried to rescue those we could," he added, describing the events of the early hours of Aug. 19, when the Bayesian had been anchored off the Sicilian port of Porticello.</p>

<p>"We were walking on the walls (of the boat). We saved who we could, Cutfield also saved the little girl and her mother," he said, referring to passenger Charlotte Golunski and her one-year-old daughter. In all there were 15 survivors of the wreck.</p>

<p>Cutfield exercised his right to remain silent when questioned by prosecutors on Tuesday, his lawyers said, saying he was "worn out" and that they needed more time to build a defence case. Parker Eaton has not commented on the investigation.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Raffaele Cammarano said last week that the vessel was most likely hit by a "downburst", a very strong downward wind.</p>

<p>However, the sinking has puzzled naval marine experts, who said a vessel like the Bayesian, built by Italian high-end yacht manufacturer Perini, should have withstood the storm and, in any case, should not have sunk as quickly as it did.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in the town of Termini Imerese, near Palermo, have said their investigation will take time, with the wreck yet to be salvaged from the sea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday suggested his support for the decriminalization of marijuana, saying taxpayer dollars should not be wasted arresting people carrying "personal amounts."</p>

<p>"In Florida, like so many other states that have already given their approval, personal amounts of marijuana will be legalized for adults with Amendment 3," Trump said about an effort in his home state to legalize the possession and purchase of up to 3 ounces for adults over the age of 21.</p>

<p>"Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the voters, so it should be done correctly."</p>

<p>Trump, who is the Republican nominee for president, said state lawmakers should create laws that ban use of marijuana in public spaces.</p>

<p>He added that someone should not be a criminal in one state when marijuana use is legal in others.</p>

<p>"We do not need to ruin lives and waste taxpayer dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl laced marijuana," Trump said.</p>

<p>Marijuana is legal in some form in nearly 40 states.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A new blood test developed by scientists can detect glioblastoma, a deadly brain cancer, in just 60 minutes using a small blood sample.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have created a novel method for detecting brain cancer that is faster and less invasive than typical surgical biopsies. The newly developed 'liquid biopsy' uses only 100 microlitres of blood and can detect biomarkers associated with glioblastoma-the most prevalent and lethal type of brain tumour-in just one hour.</p>

<p>The test, which is more accurate than any known approach for detecting glioblastoma, is described by its researchers as having "near turn-key functionality." A team of researchers from the University of Notre Dame in the United States collaborated with Australian scientists to develop the new approach. While still in its early stages, this proof of concept marks a huge step forward in brain cancer diagnosis.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.nd.edu/news/researchers-develop-affordable-rapid-blood-test-for-brain-cancer/"><em>release by University Of Notre Dam</em></a>, the average glioblastoma patient survives 12-18 months after diagnosis. The crux of the diagnostic is a biochip that uses electrokinetic technology to detect biomarkers, or active Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (EGFRs), which are overexpressed in certain cancers such as glioblastoma and found in extracellular vesicles.</p>

<p>"Extracellular vesicles or exosomes are unique nanoparticles secreted by cells. They are big - 10 to 50 times bigger than a molecule - and they have a weak charge. Our technology was specifically designed for these nanoparticles, using their features to our advantage," said Hsueh-Chia Chang, the Bayer Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Notre Dame and lead author of the study about the diagnostic published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06385-1"><em>Communications Biology.</em></a></p>

<p>The challenge for researchers was two-fold: to develop a process that could distinguish between active and non-active EGFRs, and create a diagnostic technology that was sensitive yet selective in detecting active EGFRs on extracellular vesicles from blood samples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Fatman Scoop has died, his family and manager announced Saturday, after the 53-year-old artist suffered a medical emergency while performing on stage, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of hip-hop.</p>

<p>Scoop, best known for the hit tracks "Be Faithful" and "It Takes Scoop," collapsed on stage at Hamden Town Center Park, Connecticut and was taken to hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, US media reported.</p>

<p>Medical staff apparently attempted to administer CPR while he was still on the stage, according to a video of the incident obtained by celebrity news site TMZ. He was then carried away on a stretcher.</p>

<p>In a post on his Instagram account, his family wrote that "it is with profound sadness and very heavy hearts that we share news of the passing of the legendary and iconic Fatman Scoop."</p>

<p>"Fatman Scoop was known to the world as the undisputed voice of the club. His music made us dance and embrace life with positivity," they wrote.</p>

<p>Scoop's manager Birch Michael confirmed his death on Facebook, writing: "I love you Scoop. Thank you so much for everything you gave to me."</p>

<h3><strong>'Want to dance'</strong></h3>

<p>Hip-hop star Missy Elliott wrote on X that Scoop's "voice and energy have contributed to many songs that made the people feel happy and want to dance for over two decades. Your impact is huge and will be never be forgotten."</p>

<p>Radio host Shelley Wade posted a photograph of herself with Scoop, writing: "We are losing too many of our hip-hop legends too soon. Rest easy, Scoop."</p>

<p>Scoop briefly became embroiled in a political row in Australia in 2018 when the country's then-prime minister Scott Morrison posted a clip that featured his hit "Be Faithful."</p>

<p>Morrison, a conservative evangelical Christian, deleted the post after his critics said the entertainer's lyrics were inappropriate and unparliamentary.</p>

<p>"It's quite clear that that is not a song on my playlist," he later told reporters in Sydney.</p>

<p>The uproar prompted a response from Scoop, who tagged Morrison in an Instagram post saying: "I am humbled to have my voice rocking in the highest offices of the Australian Government!"</p>

<p>The rapper defended his lyrics: "It's a fun PARTY SONG that has no NEGATIVITY or HARM in it!!" before extending Morrison a backstage invite to a festival appearance in Australia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its ban of X, which went into effect on Saturday, Brazil joins a small club of countries to have taken similar measures against the social network, most of them run by authoritarian regimes.</p>

<p>Beyond permanent bans, some nations have temporarily restricted access to X, formerly Twitter, which has often been used by political dissidents to communicate.</p>

<p>These have included Egypt in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprisings, Turkey in 2014 and 2023, and Uzbekistan around that country's 2021 presidential election.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the others.</p>

<p><strong>China</strong></p>

<p>Beijing banned Twitter in June 2009 -- before it secured the prominent place it enjoyed in Western media and politics for much of the 2010s.</p>

<p>The block came two days before the 20-year anniversary of the government's crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations in the capital's Tiananmen Square.</p>

<p>Since then, many Chinese people have turned to home-grown alternatives such as Weibo and WeChat.</p>

<p><strong>Iran</strong></p>

<p>Twitter was also blocked by Tehran in 2009, as a wave of demonstrations broke out following a contested June presidential election.</p>

<p>The network has nevertheless been used since then to pass information to the outside world about dissident movements, including the demonstrations against Iran's repression of women's rights since late 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Turkmenistan</strong></p>

<p>Isolated Central Asian country Turkmenistan blocked Twitter in the early 2010s alongside many other foreign online services and websites.</p>

<p>Authorities in Ashgabat surveil closely citizens' usage of the internet, provided through state-run monopoly operator TurkmenTelecom.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea</strong></p>

<p>Pyongyang opened its own Twitter account in 2010 in a bid to woo foreigners interested in the country.</p>

<p>But the application has been blocked along with Facebook, Youtube and gambling and pornography websites since April 2016.</p>

<p>Internet access beyond a few government websites is under tight government watch in the hermit regime, with access restricted to a few high-ranking officials.</p>

<p><strong>Myanmar</strong></p>

<p>X has been blocked since February 2021, when authorities took aim at the app for its use by opponents of the military coup that overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government.</p>

<p>Since then, the junta has kept a tight grip on internet access in Myanmar.</p>

<p><strong>Russia</strong></p>

<p>Access to Twitter was throttled from 2021 by Moscow, which complained the site was allowing users to spread "illegal content".</p>

<p>A formal ban came in March 2022, just after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Many Russian users continue to connect to X via VPN services that allow them to get around the block.</p>

<p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p>

<p>X has been banned since parliamentary polls in February this year.</p>

<p>Pakistan's government, backed by the army, say the block is for security reasons.</p>

<p>Former prime minister Imran Khan -- now in jail -- was targeted by widespread allegations of fraud spread via the platform against his opposition party.</p>

<p><strong>Venezuela</strong></p>

<p>Nicolas Maduro, who was declared winner of July's presidential election despite grave suspicions of fraud, ordered access to X suspended for 10 days on August 9 as security forces were violently putting down nationwide demonstrations.</p>

<p>The block has remained in place beyond the expiry of the 10-day period.</p>

<p><strong>Brazil</strong></p>

<p>The country's block on X has come from the judiciary, via Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes.</p>

<p>He has highlighted the reactivation of accounts that had been ordered suspended by Brazilian courts.</p>

<p>Users connecting to X via a VPN face a fine of 50,000 reais ($8,900) per day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations Security Council needs urgent reforms and India should get its rightful place as a permanent member of the top UN body, says former Singapore diplomat professor Kishore Mahbubani.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview to NDTV's Sonia Singh, Mr Mahbubani talked about the much-needed reforms in the United Nations, saying that he believes the United Kingdom should give up its permanent seat at the UN Security Council (UNSC) for India.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no question that India is the third-most powerful country in the world today after the United States and China. And that Great Britain is no longer 'great'," he said.</p>

<p>Explaining why the UK should relinquish its seat, Mr Mahbubani mentioned that the UK has not used its veto power for decades, fearing backlash. "So, the logical thing for the UK to do is give up its seat to India," he said.</p>

<p>Speaking on the UN reforms, he said the founders of the UN ensured that all great powers of the time had vested interests in the organisation in order to make it work.</p>

<p>"The lesson that (UN's founders) learned from the collapse of the League of Nations early in the 20th century is that if a great power leaves, the organisation collapses," the former diplomat said.</p>

<p>"But they also believed that you must have the great powers of today, not the great powers of yesterday. Unfortunately, they didn't create a mechanism for changing the seats," he said.</p>

<p>"Another reason for the UK to give up its seat is that it will free them up to act independently," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an exclusive interview to NDTV's Sonia Singh, former Singaporean diplomat Professor Kishore Mahbubani said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to both Russia and Ukraine signifies how India has "arrived as a major geopolitical actor".</p>

<p>"How many leaders in the world can comfortably visit both Russia and Ukraine and be received warmly by both countries. Very few countries in the world. And the fact that Prime Minister Modi can do that is a sign of how India has arrived as a major geopolitical actor," Mr Mahbubani said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi visited Russia and met President Vladimir Putin in July to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries. During his discussions with President Putin, PM Modi reiterated India's stand and emphasised on "peaceful resolution of the conflict around Ukraine through dialogue and diplomacy including engagement between both parties".</p>

<p>Showcasing India's ability to manage good relations with most nations, Prime Minister Modi visited Ukraine within weeks of his Russia visit, making it the first-ever visit by an Indian PM to Ukraine since the European country's formation after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Hailing the trip as "historic", Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky signed four documents with India on a wide range of issues.</p>

<p>"We (India) are not neutral. From the very beginning, we have taken a side. And we have chosen the side of peace. We have come from the land of Buddha where there is no place for war," PM Modi had said in his opening remarks during the talks.</p>

<p>Professor Mahbubani also spoke about how India could play a bigger role in the world if given a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).</p>

<p>"The greatest hope for India to play a role globally, for example, giving it a permanent membership in the UN Security Council will enable India to do much more in terms of creating a better world," he said.</p>

<p>India has been vying for a permanent seat at UNSC, with countries like Russia, France, the US, and the UK all endorsing India's bid, China being the only hindrance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan lodged a protest with China after one of its naval survey vessels entered Japanese waters on Saturday, the second incursion into its territory by the Chinese military in less than a week.</p>

<p>An uptick in Chinese military activity near Japan and around Taiwan in recent years has stoked concerns in Tokyo. Japan has responded with a defence buildup that it says aims to deter Beijing from using military force to push its territorial claims in the region.</p>

<p>The ship was detected off the coast of Kagoshima Prefecture, in Japan's southwest, at around 6 a.m. local time (2100 GMT Friday), and departed within two hours, the country's defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Tokyo registered its "strong concern and protest over this incident" with a Chinese embassy official, the foreign ministry said in a statement that also referenced the first airspace intrusion by a Chinese military plane on Monday.</p>

<p>Tokyo told Chinese diplomats earlier this week that Monday's violation of it airspace was "utterly unacceptable."</p>

<p>A telephone call to the Chinese embassy in Tokyo went unanswered when Reuters called outside regular business hours.</p>

<p>Saturday's incident was the tenth time in the past year that a Chinese naval survey ship has sailed through Japan's territorial waters, and the 13th time if submarines and other intelligence-gathering vessels are included, according to national broadcaster NHK.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least six people were dead as Typhoon Shanshan crept eastward through Japan on Saturday, drenching large areas with torrential rain, triggering landslide and flood warnings hundreds of kilometres from the storm's centre.</p>

<p>Footage on national broadcaster NHK showed homes with roofs partly sheered off while cars drove wheels-deep on flooded roads in the country's southwest. The storm made landfall in Kyushu on Thursday, bringing record levels of rainfall.</p>

<p>One person was missing and more than 100 have been injured, said Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency. More than 35,000 homes were without power in southern Kyushu's Kagoshima prefecture, according to Kyushu Electric.</p>

<p>Shanshan, centred in the Pacific Ocean some 480 km (300 miles) southwest of Tokyo at 12:50 p.m. (0350 GMT), triggered heavy rain as far away as the northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido, despite being downgraded to a tropical storm on Friday. Winds were gusting up to 25 metres per second (90 kph, 55 mph).</p>

<p>Authorities have issued flood and landslide warnings around the country since the storm's arrival, halting air and rail services and shutting factories.</p>

<p>The storm is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression over the weekend but is expected to continue to bring heavy rain, NHK reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norwegian Princess Martha Louise married American self-proclaimed shaman Durek Verrett on Saturday, a union of two alternative therapy devotees that has raised eyebrows in Norway.</p>

<p>Martha Louise, a 52-year-old divorcee, claims to be a clairvoyant who can speak with angels, a gift she has shared -- and profited from -- in books and courses.</p>

<p>Verrett, 49 and from California, calls himself a "sixth-generation shaman" and sells pricey gold medallions that he says save lives.</p>

<p>"I'm very spiritual, it's just so nice to be with a person who embraces it," Martha Louise said on Instagram after the couple announced their engagement in June 2022.</p>

<p>The pair tied the knot Saturday afternoon at a hotel in the hills of Geiranger, a picturesque village on the shores of a fjord on Norway's west coast.</p>

<p>The ceremony took place under a white tent, concealing the party, with the couple having sold exclusive photo and video rights to the ceremony.</p>

<p>Martha Louise wore a traditional white wedding dress and a tiara given to her by her grandfather, King Olav, on her 18th birthday, according to photos taken by Norwegian press.</p>

<p>Durek wore a black suit with a gold cummerbund.</p>

<p>Aside from 87-year-old King Harald and Crown Prince Haakon who wore dark suits, the royal family was dressed in traditional Norwegian dress, called bunad, made of embroidery and wool fabrics.</p>

<p>Festivities kicked off Thursday with a meet-and-greet party for the more than 350 guests.</p>

<p>According to Verrett, the nuptials are actually a renewal of the couple's vows.</p>

<p>The spiritual guide, who counts Hollywood celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow and Antonio Banderas among his followers, claims he was a pharaoh in a previous life and Martha Louise was his wife.</p>

<p>The couple's eccentricity has ruffled feathers in no-nonsense Norway, as has their disregard for science and their use of their royal ties for commercial gain.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion over her role, Martha Louise relinquished her royal duties in November 2022. She kept her title but agreed not to use it in her commercial endeavours.</p>

<p>She has however violated the agreement several times since then, most recently when she and Verrett released a "wedding gin" for sale in Norway that bore her princess title on the label.</p>

<p>"Seeing as the agreement has not been respected, it's time to take away Martha Louise's princess title before King Harald sees his life's work destroyed even further," historian and royal expert Trond Noren Isaksen wrote in an op-ed in July.</p>

<p>The couple has also angered Norwegian media by signing deals with Hello! magazine and Netflix for exclusive coverage of the wedding.</p>

<h3><strong>Falling popularity</strong></h3>

<p>Martha Louise has three daughters from her first marriage to Norwegian author Ari Behn, who killed himself three years after their 2016 divorce.</p>

<p>She is fourth in line to the Norwegian throne; her younger brother Crown Prince Haakon is due one day to succeed King Harald.</p>

<p>Norway's royal family has been largely spared from scandal -- until recently.</p>

<p>Martha Louise and Verrett have contributed to an erosion of public support for the monarchy, from 81 percent in 2017 to 68 percent, a poll by public broadcaster NRK showed this week.</p>

<p>A recent scandal involving the 27-year-old son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit -- from a relationship prior to her marriage to Crown Prince Haakon -- has also contributed.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Marius Borg Hoiby admitted to a cocaine- and alcohol-fuelled assault on his girlfriend, and two ex-girlfriends have since come forward with similar claims.</p>

<p>Four in 10 Norwegians said their view of the royal family had grown more negative in the past year, with many citing Martha Louise, Verrett or Hoiby as the reason, the poll showed.</p>

<h3><strong>Witch hunts and quacks</strong></h3>

<p>Martha Louise has accused the media of pursuing a witch hunt against her.</p>

<p>But it is Verrett who has received the most criticism, labelled a "charlatan and a quack" in the press.</p>

<p>In one of his books, he suggested that cancer was a choice, and recommended exercises to remove "imprints" from women's vaginas left by previous sexual partners.</p>

<p>On his website, he sells a $222 "Spirit Optimizer" medallion which he says helped him overcome Covid.</p>

<p>While Verrett has acknowledged his beliefs may be unsettling for some, he claims he is a victim of racism.</p>

<p>"White people write all this hate and death threats to us... because... they don't want to see a black man in the royal family," he said on Instagram in June 2022.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, King Harald -- who fought for years to be allowed to marry Queen Sonja, a commoner -- has said little about his future son-in-law, referring only to a "culture clash".</p>

<p>He has described him as "a great guy and very funny".</p>

<p>"We've agreed to disagree" on some things, the king said in November 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes on Saturday killed at least 48 people in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian health authorities said, as clashes took place in central and southern areas of the enclave ahead of the planned start of a polio vaccination campaign.</p>

<p>The United Nations is due to start vaccinating some 640,000 children in the territory against polio, relying on daily eight-hour pauses in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas in specific areas of the besieged enclave.</p>

<p>Yousef Abu Al-Reesh, Gaza's deputy minister of health, said vaccination teams would try to get to as many areas as possible to ensure wide coverage but he said only a comprehensive ceasefire could guarantee enough children are reached.</p>

<p>"If the international community truly wants this campaign to succeed, it should call for a ceasefire, knowing that this virus does not stop, and can reach anywhere," he told reporters at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>On Saturday, medics administered vaccines on some of the children at Nasser Hospital wards in a symbolic move before the official campaign begins.</p>

<p>The campaign follows confirmation last week that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>WHO officials say at least 90% of the children need to be vaccinated twice with four weeks between doses for the campaign to succeed, but it faces huge challenges in Gaza, which has been largely destroyed by nearly 11 months of war.</p>

<p>On Saturday, as more than 2,000 medical and community workers prepared for the start of the campaign, medics in Nuseirat, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, medics said separate Israeli strikes killed at least 19 people, including nine members of the same family.</p>

<p>More than 30 other people were killed in a series of strikes in other areas of Gaza, medics said.</p>

<p>Residents and militant sources said fighters from Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and other groups fought against Israeli forces in the northern Gaza Zeitoun neighborhood, where tanks have been operating for days, and in Rafah, near the border with Egypt.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement it continued to operate in the central and southern Gaza Strip. It said troops killed militants and dismantled military infrastructure in Gaza City, while they located weapons and killed gunmen in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.</p>

<p>In Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, families returned to their areas after the army ended a 22-day offensive it said was aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. Footage showed large areas were flattened, and buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.</p>

<p>Medics said they recovered at least nine bodies from the area where the army operated.</p>

<p>The latest episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed more than 40,600 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry. Nearly the entire Gaza population of 2.3 million has been displaced and the enclave has a hunger crisis. Israel faces genocide allegations at the World Court that it denies.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Israel forces pushed on with a military operation in the city of Jenin. Drones and helicopters circled overhead while the sound of sporadic firing could be heard in the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent Russian media outlet Mediazona said Saturday according to its estimates more than 66,000 Russian military personnel have died during the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Mediazona has been drawing up a list of known soldier deaths in conjunction with the BBC Russian Service using open-source data.</p>

<p>Previously in April, they announced they had found more than 50,000 names of Russians killed.</p>

<p>Mediazona said Saturday that "as of August 30, we know the names of 66,471 Russian soldiers killed in the war".</p>

<p>The list has gone up by more than 4,600 in the last four weeks, it said, while stressing this was not a definitive figure since many soldiers' deaths are not made public.</p>

<p>Anastasia Alekseyeva, a journalist at Mediazona, stressed that the latest death numbers were "not linked to Ukraine's offensive in the Kursk region or Russia's advance in the east".</p>

<p>This is because researchers are still working through a backlog of death reports, she said.</p>

<p>The report found that 172 conscripts doing national service have been killed in the war, with the highest figures in early months.</p>

<p>However these figures may be inexact since conscripts can sign professional army contracts and some may have done so without telling relatives, Mediazona editor Dmitry Treshchanin said.</p>

<p>According to Mediazona's breakdown, the region with the largest absolute number of deaths -- 2,578 -- is the southern republic of Bashkortostan, which has a large Muslim population.</p>

<p>The most represented age group overall was 33-35 (6,877 deaths).</p>

<p>More than 12,000 of the dead were prisoners, after Russia sought to recruit inmates by promising them freedom after a period on the front line.</p>

<p>But numbers have dropped recently, Alekseyeva said: "evidently the recruitment drive is not as active".</p>

<p>Mediazona and the BBC along with volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022, using open-source information from official reports and the media, as well as using satellite images of Russian cemeteries to estimate the number of new graves.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that almost 700,0000 Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Moscow rarely talks about the losses it has sustained in what it calls a "special military operation".</p>

<p>The defence ministry in September 2022 said 5,937 soldiers had been killed in combat.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the first two years of the war.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete slabs and sheet metal were piled high alongside streets in Jenin on Saturday, as residents assessed the damage from Israel's latest West Bank raid even as explosions persisted nearby.</p>

<p>The scars of ongoing clashes in the occupied Palestinian territory, which began on Wednesday as part of what Israel has described as a counter-terrorism operation, were everywhere: collapsed walls, uprooted trees, tiled roofs covering mounds of rubble.</p>

<p>Bulldozers rumbled through the streets on the first day of the raid, clearing the way for Israeli soldiers while tearing up the asphalt and piercing underground pipes, residents of one neighbourhood in east Jenin told AFP.</p>

<p>Three days later, with fighting elsewhere in the city continuing, "we are cut off from the world", Taher al-Saadi said.</p>

<p>"The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work."</p>

<p>He added: "The bakeries are at a standstill. We can't find milk for the children."</p>

<p>Israel raids are not unusual in Jenin, whose refugee camp is a bastion for armed groups fighting Israel.</p>

<p>But the operation launched on Wednesday was unusually large and long, hitting multiple West Bank cities at once and, in Jenin, showing no sign of letting up.</p>

<p>"I think it's the worst day since the start of the raid," Wisam Bakr, director of Jenin Government Hospital, said on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We hear from time to time clashes and sometimes there is big bombing."</p>

<h3><strong>'Dark days'</strong></h3>

<p>Not far from where Faiza Abu Jaafar lives, an 82-year-old man was shot dead on Friday by an Israeli sniper, residents say, bringing to 20 the number of Palestinians killed in the operation so far.</p>

<p>Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have said at least 13 of the dead were members of their armed wings.</p>

<p>While Israeli military vehicles and bulldozers left the area near her home on Saturday morning, apparently heading for Jenin's refugee camp, Abu Jaafar said she and her relatives were still shaken.</p>

<p>"It's very hard, for the children and for everyone. We are afraid, we are terrified, look at all the damage," she said, standing amid piles of rubble.</p>

<p>"We are living in dark days."</p>

<p>Just how dark is still unclear, as Jenin governor Kamal Abu al-Rub told AFP that even he does not know exactly what is happening inside the camp, where the latest fighting appeared to be concentrated.</p>

<p>"The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access," he said.</p>

<p>"Neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there."</p>

<p>The Israeli army has denied cutting off access to hospitals, saying it has positioned its forces to prevent militants from gathering in them while allowing ambulances to come and go.</p>

<p>Violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The United Nations said on Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Nineteen Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said the forces involved in the current raid, which began on Wednesday, were fewer than the number who carried out a large-scale raid in July 2023 that left 13 dead.</p>

<p>Yet Abu al-Rub, the Jenin governor, said the latest operation made him think of a notorious 2002 battle in Jenin that left dozens of Palestinians and Israelis dead.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Shoshani explicitly rejected the comparison, saying the ongoing operation in the West Bank was not "extremely different" from regular activity.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[By analyzing seismic waves generated by large earthquakes, geophysicists identified a region where these waves slow down as they pass through the outer core.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have unravelled a doughnut-like structure buried deep within Earth's swirling outer core of molten metal. The exciting discovery was reported in a new study published in Science Advances.</p>

<p>The discovery was made by a research team that analysed seismic waves generated by large earthquakes. The expert team included Professor Hrvoje Tkalcic, a geophysicist from the Australian National University. These waves travel through Earth, giving scientists information about its internal composition.</p>

<p>As <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn5562">Professor Tkalcic explained</a>, the researchers focused on how these seismic waves were slowing down while passing through a certain portion of the outer core near its boundary with the mantle.</p>

<p>"By understanding the paths of those waves and their travel times, we reconstructed their journey through the Earth's outer core," he added.</p>

<p>These waves were slower, indicating that a torus-shaped, or doughnut-shaped, region within the outer core was orientated parallel to the equator. This finds a new layer of complexity to the structure at the interior of the Earth.</p>

<p>The authors of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn5562">study write,</a> "Thermochemical inhomogeneities in the Earth's outer core that enhance our understanding of the geodynamo have been elusive. Seismic constraints on such inhomogeneities would provide clues on the amount and distribution of light elements in the core apart from iron and nickel."</p>

<p>"Here, we present evidence for a low-velocity volume within the outer core via the global coda correlation wavefield. Several key correlogram features with a unique sensitivity to the liquid core show variations with wave paths remarkably slower in the equatorial than polar planes. We constrain a torus structure at low latitudes with 2% lower velocity than the surrounding liquid outer core via waveform modeling. We propose a thermochemical origin for such a low-velocity torus, providing important constraints on the dynamical processes of the Earth's outer core," the author said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five people were killed and 46 injured in a Ukrainian attack on the southwestern Russian city of Belgorod late on Friday, the local governor said, the latest in a series of strikes by Ukraine on the city in recent months.</p>

<p>Vyacheslav Gladkov said 37 of the injured, including seven children, were taken to hospitals in the city, which lies 40 km (25 miles) north of the border with Ukraine.</p>

<p>Video filmed from inside a vehicle, posted on social media and purporting to show the attack, showed a car being blown up while moving along a road. Seconds later another explosion is seen metres away. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.</p>

<p>Russia's Foreign Ministry condemned the attack.</p>

<p>"Once again we call on all responsible governments and relevant international structures to strongly condemn this brutal terrorist attack and publicly distance themselves from the Kyiv regime and its Western curators who commit such crimes," it said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The ministry added that Russia's "special military operation" will continue until it reaches all the goals including Ukraine's "demilitarisation and de-nazification".</p>

<p>Russia's Investigation Committee said on its Telegram channel that it had initiated a criminal case into the attack.</p>

<p>Authorities also reported that a woman was injured on Saturday during Ukrainian shelling of the border town of Shebekino in the Belgorod region.</p>

<p>Ukraine has staged frequent attacks on Belgorod and other Russian border regions in recent months, with the city the focal point of the attacks.</p>

<p>Ukraine and Russia say they do not deliberately target civilians in the war that began when Russia sent thousands of troops into its smaller neighbour in February 2022.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The search and rescue operation for an Indian woman who fell into a sinkhole in Malaysia eight days ago has been halted at the site in Jalan Masjid India, Kuala Lumpur, the fire and rescue department said as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/kl-sinkhole-search-for-victim-halted-at-jalan-masjid-india-continues-at-sewage-plant" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Straits Times.</a></p>

<p>However, rescue efforts would continue at the Pantai Dalam IWK sewage plant, the department added.</p>

<p>Findings revealed it was too risky to continue search and rescue using scuba diving methods, the department's director-general Nor Hisham Mohamad told The Straits Times.</p>

<p>Strong underground water currents, limited space for rescuers and the presence of debris and hard blockages are some of the risk factors that led to the decision, Mr Nor Hisham said, according to state news agency Bernama.</p>

<p>"When we saw the entry point, which was about two feet (60cm) wide, we were really worried that they might get stuck. There was a 'piston effect' from the water, making it impossible for them to retreat, which is very dangerous," he was quoted as saying by Bernama.</p>

<p>"Besides posing a high risk to scuba divers, there are also obstructions difficult for divers to navigate," he said.</p>

<p>Indian tourist Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, who frequently travelled to Singapore and Malaysia for business, disappeared after falling into an 8 metre-deep sinkhole on August 23. She was on her way to a temple when the ground suddenly caved in. Her husband and son were able to escape the collapse.</p>

<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Friday assured tourists that Kuala Lumpur is safe, adding that any areas considered to be at risk of turning into sinkholes will be dealt with immediately. During a visit to Penang, he told reporters that a geotechnical study had found the cause of the incident.</p>

<p>Monitoring the situation, the Indian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur had explained how the search operation for the woman was being carried out and that it was in touch with the woman's family members.</p>

<p>"Officers are also in touch with the family members to extend continued support," it said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu had directed officials from the Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu (APNRT) Society to ensure that the search operations are conducted effectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A helicopter with 22 people aboard, most of them tourists, has gone missing in Russia's Kamchatka peninsula in the far east, regional authorities said Saturday.</p>

<p>"Today at about 1615 (0415 GMT) communication was lost with a Mi-8 helicopter...which had 22 people on board, 19 passengers and three crew members," Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on Telegram.</p>

<p>Rescue teams in helicopters have been searching into the night for the missing aircraft, focusing on a river valley that the helicopter was due to fly along, Russian authorities said.</p>

<p>The Mi-8 is a Soviet-designed military helicopter that is widely used for transport in Russia.</p>

<p>The missing helicopter had picked up passengers near the Vachkazhets ancient volcano in a scenic area of the peninsula known for its wild landscapes and active volcanoes.</p>

<p>A source in the emergency services told TASS news agency that the helicopter disappeared from radar almost immediately after taking off and the crew did not report any problems.</p>

<p>The local weather service said that there was poor visibility in the area of the airport.</p>

<p>Accidents involving planes and helicopters are very frequent in Russia's far eastern region, which is sparsely populated and where there is often harsh weather.</p>

<p>In August 2021, a Mi-8 helicopter with 16 people on board including 13 tourists crashed into a lake in Kamchatka due to poor visibility, killing eight.</p>

<p>In July the same year, a plane crashed as it came in to land on the peninsula, with 22 passengers and 6 crew aboard, all of whom were killed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after a four-year-old kid unintentionally smashed an ancient jar at an archaeological museum in Israel, he was invited to the assemblage again on Saturday for a guided tour. Ariel Geller hit the headlines a few days ago when he accidentally shattered a 3500-year-old jar, placed at the entrance of the Hecht Museum in Haifa.</p>

<p>BBC shared a video of Ariel's visit to the museum. It featured him dressed in a white t-shirt and denim shorts. He also wore a blue hat. The 4-year-old was accompanied by his parents, Anna and Alex Geller, on this guided tour. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c623dpev3x4o">In a video interview with BBC</a>, Anna talked about the incident and revealed that she was distracted by her daughter when Ariel accidentally damaged the ancient jar.</p>

<p>The boy "pulled the jar slightly" because he was "curious about what was inside," said Ariel's father, Alex. He added that when he saw his son next to the shattered pieces, he was "in shock" and immediately assumed that "my child hadn't done it."</p>

<p>"At first, I was in shock," Alex remarked. "Then I felt a bit angry with him." Later, the couple went up to a security guard and admitted what transpired. However, they were not prepared for what came next. "Instead of levying penalties or fines, they extended an invitation for us to return," Alex stated.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boy-accidentally-shatters-3-500-year-old-rare-jar-at-israel-museum-6438540">Reacting to the mishap</a>, the museum's head Inbal Rivlin told Israeli news outlet Ynet, "The museum is not a mausoleum but a living place, open to families (and) accessible. We are appealing to parents: Don't be afraid. Things like this happen. We will fix (the jar) and put it back."</p>

<p>The museum estimates that the jar was made between 2200 and 1500 BC, and was probably used to transport regional goods like olive oil and wine. It was found during central Israel's Samaria excavations, and the museum has owned it for thirty-five years.</p>

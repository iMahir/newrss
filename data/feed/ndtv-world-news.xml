       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wife of the firefighter, who was killed during an attack at a Donald Trump rally, received a call from President Joe Biden after the tragedy struck her family on Saturday. Helen Comperatore, however, did not talk to Biden and said Trump hadn't reached out, reported New York Post.</p>

<p>"I didn't talk to Biden. I didn't want to talk to him. My husband was a devout Republican and he would not have wanted me to talk to him," said Corey Comperatore's wife.</p>

<p>Corey, father of two children, was shot by a sniper's bullet during the assassination attempt on Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump survived the attack but a bullet pierced his right ear. He was seen with a bloodied face with his fist in the air as the Secret Service agents bundled him to safety.</p>

<p>When the shots were heard, Corey shouted "Get down" and shielded his family from the bullets with his body. He died while two other rallygoers were wounded in the chaos.</p>

<p>His wife, Helen, said though Trump hadn't contacted her, Biden's call wasn't welcome.</p>

<p>"I don't have any ill will towards Joe Biden. I'm not one of those people that gets involved in politics. I support Trump. That's who I'm voting for, but I don't have ill will towards Biden. He didn't do anything bad to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did," she said.</p>

<p>The gunman who targeted Trump was identified as Thomas Mathew Crooks, a 20-year-old. He was shot dead by snipers on the spot. The FBI, which is probing the assassination bid, is still trying to find motive behind the attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dodging a bullet at a rally and seeing the US Supreme Court bolster his presidential immunity claims this month, Donald Trump was handed another gift Monday: the dismissal of his classified documents case.</p>

<p>As the only president ever to be twice impeached -- and twice acquitted -- and the country's only ex-president convicted of criminal charges, the septuagenarian has often struggled to stay afloat.</p>

<p>His blunders, multitude of scandals and vitriolic statements have shocked millions of Americans. Many heads of state see him as a danger to global stability and the fight against global warming, and he has stood accused of indulging far-right groups and disparaging immigrants.</p>

<p>But each time he is said to be sunk, he roars back to the surface, and this week he is heading into Milwaukee riding very high.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Republican National Convention will overlook Trump's vows of vengeance against his political enemies and swat aside his various legal woes to formally nominate him as the party's flagbearer going into the November election against President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the brash billionaire who burst onto the political landscape a decade ago as a super disruptor and champion of conservatives, appears unstoppable.</p>

<p>"It sure seems he's on a roll," Texas alternate delegate Orlando Dona, wearing Trump pins and a straw-colored cowboy hat, told AFP.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old Dona, like many conservatives, believes the various cases against Trump have been politically motivated, "and he is coming out of all this justified."</p>

<p>As for the shooting, some are chalking it up to divine intervention.</p>

<p>"I personally think it was the hand of God," Wisconsin former governor Scott Walker told AFP at the convention.</p>

<p>Walker, who ran for president against Trump briefly in 2016, said Trump the man has earned a reputation for taking on anything.</p>

<p>"He's never going to stop being a fighter," he said. "And I think people here realize he's fighting for them, and these wins are not just about wins for him, they're wins for the American people."</p>

<p>'A lot of obstacles'</p>

<p>Trump earned the nickname "Teflon Don" for weathering a multitude of storms.</p>

<p>The #MeToo movement precipitated the downfall of dozens of powerful Americans. Not Trump, despite multiple accusations of sexual abuse, a 2023 civil trial finding of liability for the sexual assault of writer E. Jean Carroll, and an alleged affair with pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>After an explosive "Access Hollywood" tape emerged in 2016 in which Trump makes degrading remarks about women and boasted about groping their genitals, some Republican heavyweights withdrew their support, and he was predicted to lose the female vote.</p>

<p>That collapse didn't happen, and he won the White House a month later.</p>

<p>Now, it appears he will pull off another miracle, avoiding three of the four lawsuits he had been facing before the election.</p>

<p>"If the story of even the last 18 months teaches us anything, there were a lot of obstacles that were put up to president Trump, and the fact that he's gotten through them shows, I think, part of what gives me faith in this country," businessman and former 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy told reporters at the convention.</p>

<p>"As Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long but it bends towards justice," Mr Ramaswamy said. "I believe that's exactly what it is doing in recent months, days, and over the last year of president Trump's journey as well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican JD Vance, picked by Donald Trump as his running mate for the US elections, has been kind to the former president in the past. A harsh critic in the past, the Ohio Senator had called Trump a "moral disaster" and "America's Hitler".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican JD Vance, picked by Donald Trump as his running mate for the US elections, has been kind to the former president in the past. A harsh critic in the past, the Ohio Senator had called Trump a "moral disaster" and "America's Hitler".</p>

<p>But now a Vice-Presidential nominee, he finds himself "overwhelmed with gratitude" to be running alongside Trump. "What an honour...he delivered peace and prosperity once, and with your help, he'll do it again," said a confident Vance on X.</p>

<p>A White House candidate usually picks a running mate who can appeal to new voters or compensate for weaknesses in image or policy - though Trump has picked a white conservative like himself.</p>

<p>In a 2016 message to a former law school roommate, Vance had said he went "back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical as***le like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler," Washington Post reported.</p>

<p>Josh Mclaurin, the roommate, had shared the message on social media in 2022 when Vance was contesting the Senate race.</p>

<p>Vance had also called Trump a "cultural heroin" and a "new pain reliever" - who promised easy solutions to social problems of suffering communities, but "could not fix what ails them".</p>

<p>"Trump's promises are the needle in America's collective vein... Trump is cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit. But he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they'll realize it," he had written in a 2016 piece for the Atlantic Magazine.</p>

<p>He had also said he "can't stomach Trump" in a 2016 interview.</p>

<p>"I think that he's noxious and is leading the White working class to a very dark place," he told NPR's Terry Gross.</p>

<p>Vance had lamented Trump's video of bragging about groping women. His now-deleted online post read: "Fellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man. Lord help us."</p>

<p>Another post, which too stands deleted, called Trump "reprehensible". "Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this, I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us," the post read.</p>

<p>Vance had even admitted he was "never Trump guy" and never liked Trump, in an interview with Charlie Rose.</p>

<p>He had also called the then-president a "moral disaster" and "just another opioid", and agreed in public that Trump was a "total fraud" who didn't care about the people.</p>

<p>The list runs long.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, a Republican US Senator from Ohio, expressed gratitude on Tuesday for being picked as the running mate of US presidential candidate Donald Trump and called it an "honour" to run alongside him. He said that Trump has delivered it once and will do it again.</p>

<p>In a post on X, JD Vance stated, "Just overwhelmed with gratitude. What an honor it is to run alongside President Donald J. Trump. He delivered peace and prosperity once, and with your help, he'll do it again. Onward to victory!"</p>

What an honor it is to run alongside President Donald J. Trump. He delivered peace and prosperity once, and with your help, he'll do it again.<br />

— J.D. Vance (@JDVance1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1813062451853738415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>His statement comes after former US President Donald Trump made his pick for Vice President, selecting JD Vance as his running mate on Monday. Trump confirmed Vance's candidature through a post on Truth Social.</p>

<p>"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio," Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>After years of criticising Trump, Vance has embraced the populist ideology of the former president; this choice further elevates him.</p>

<p>After getting support from Trump in a fierce Republican primary, Vance--a venture entrepreneur and the author of the best-selling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy"--was elected to the US Senate in 2022, according to CNN.</p>

<p>"JD honorably served our Country in the Marine Corps, graduated from Ohio State University in two years, Summa Cum Laude, and is a Yale Law School Graduate, where he was Editor of The Yale Law Journal and President of the Yale Law Veterans Association. J.D.'s book, 'Hillbilly Elegy,' became a Major Best Seller and Movie, as it championed the hardworking men and women of our Country. JD has had a very successful business career in Technology and Finance, and now, during the Campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond....," Trump further said in his post.</p>

<p>"...As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Congratulations to Senator J.D. Vance, his wife, Usha, who also graduated from Yale Law School, and their three beautiful children. MAGA2024!" the post added.</p>

<p>Marco Rubio of Florida and Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota, who were considered to be the frontrunners in the race, are now out of it. Vance has been a supporter of Trump in the Senate and frequently casts votes in the former president's favour.</p>

<p>He echoed Trump's criticism of increasing aid by opposing a bill aimed at assisting Ukraine earlier this year. He is also close with Donald Trump Jr., according to CNN report. According to the report, Vance--a veteran, author, and former venture capitalist--was one of the contenders who obtained vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents.</p>

<p>In 2017, Vance returned to Ohio and continued to work in venture capital. He and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, whom he met at Yale, have three children. Usha Vance, born Usha Chilukuri, is an attorney who has carved out a successful career in the legal field.</p>

<p>Born to Indian immigrant parents, she grew up with a strong emphasis on education and hard work in a San Diego, California, suburb. Usha attended Yale University and also graduated from Yale Law School.</p>

<p>While at Yale, Usha served as managing editor of the Yale Journal of Law &amp; Technology and executive development editor of The Yale Law Journal, according to a biography from the Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson law firm.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harmeet Dhillon, a civil rights attorney and Republican Party leader led Sikh prayer 'ardas' at the Republican National Convention in the presence of presidential nominee Donald Trump, in Milwaukee today.</p>

<p>Ms Dhillon, who previously served as the vice chairwoman of the California Republican Party, said she was honoured to recite the ardas, usually offered by the Sikh community worldwide before any new endeavour. It is done to thank God and seek protection and help in upholding values such as humility, truth, and justice for all.</p>

<p>Ms Dhillon pointed out to the gathering that as a member of a Sikh immigrant family, she must follow the practice of covering one's head while offering prayers as a sign of respect.</p>

<p>In her prayer, she called America a "safe haven" that allows people to freely worship according to their faith.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, who was officially declared the Republican Presidential Candidate for the upcoming 2024 US elections, was present at the convention. This marks his first public appearance since he survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, he picked his critic-turned-ally JD Vance as his potential vice president.</p>

<p>Ms Dhillon recalled the last 48 hours after Trump's assassination attempt as one of the most "intense" and "fearful" events. She also called Trump one of the most fearless people in the face of adversity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA['Sohu' claims to be 20 times faster in running transformers like ChatGPT than Nvidia's flagship- H100s, betting on transformer ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) chipset.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The reason why you are able to ask ChatGPT "how to eat a mango without spilling it" and much more is Nvidia's H100 and B200 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These magical chipsets that power AI chatbots have propelled Nvidia to become the frontrunners of the AI hardware industry, with market capitalization reaching the 3 trillion-dollar mark-more than Microsoft and Apple last month.</p>

<p>But now, a relatively young startup founded by two Harvard dropouts have set their eyes on their share of the AI hardware pie. Etched, the California based startup, is looking to disrupt the AI chipset market with their transformer ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) chip called Sohu.</p>

<p>Sohu claims to be 20 times faster in running transformers like ChatGPT than Nvidia's flagship- H100. The B200, which is the more powerful Nvidia offering than H100, is reportedly 10 times slower then Sohu, according to the claims made by the company based on emulation tests.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Source: X/@Etched" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/mfs4l3n8_etched-ai-chip_625x300_16_July_24.jpeg" title="Source: X/@Etched" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Source: X/@Etched</p>
</div>

<p>Sohu is taking an entirely different approach to providing high computational power to run billions of parameters (Variables that are used in training an AI Model) for transformer models. Unlike GPUs that can do multiple computationally heavy tasks (like rendering graphics in real time), Etched is choosing to create a specialised chip that caters to only transformer AI models - ones that run ChatGPT, Sora (OpenAI's text to video AI model) and Google's Gemini.</p>

<p>What this means is it cannot run other AI models like Convolutional Neural Networks (used for image recognition). This opens up the possibility of exploring new AI products by developers that were till now not possible due to limited power on GPUs.</p>

<p>For example, Sohu can potentially lead to a real-time translator that can hear and read Hindi, Gujarati or Tamil and respond back in French, English and German. Of course, such multimodal and multilingual translation needs more than just the computational power, but in theory, it opens up the possibility.</p>

<p>Another multimodal application of transformers that the chipset might tap into is integrating visual and language areas. This essentially means that such a model will understand both text and images simultaneously, throwing open the possibility of visual questions and answers- like an interview.</p>

<p>But all of this remains a theory. Etched has raised 120 million USD on 25 June to make it a reality, with a real timeline as to an actual release of the Sohu ASIC remaining elusive.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today we announced our $120M fundraise to bring Sohu to the world. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/EdLudlow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@edludlow</a> for hosting us! <a href="https://t.co/khzMPAofng">https://t.co/khzMPAofng</a> <a href="https://t.co/Q4SeuUjP2h">pic.twitter.com/Q4SeuUjP2h</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Etched has claimed it already has "tens of million dollars" worth of hardware reserved in preorders. The company has also secured a deal with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) to fabricate the 4-nanometer chip, promising the deal is going to help "ramp up our first year of production."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 20-year-old who allegedly tried to assassinate former US President Donald Trump at his campaign rally, made a series of stops in and around to collect arms and ammunition before the incident, the CNN reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 20-year-old who tried to assassinate former US President Donald Trump at his campaign rally in Pennsylvania made a series of stops to stock up on ammo before the attack, the CNN reported.</p>

<p>Thomas Matthew Crooks also practised firing at a shooting range on Friday, a day before the Trump rally. The next morning, Crooks went to the Home Depot to buy a five-foot ladder. He then bought 50 rounds of ammunition from a gun store, the report said.</p>

<p>Sources say he used the same ladder to climb the building from where he opened fire at the 78-year-old Republican nominee.</p>

<p>Crooks was gunned down by the Secret Service agents after he attacked Trump. Investigators are trying to piece together a timeline of his actions leading up to the failed assassination bid. The motive remains unknown.</p>

<p>Even after breaking into his phone and searching his computer, officials still haven't found evidence that would suggest political or ideological impetus for the shooting, law enforcement sources told CNN.</p>

<p>Trump survived with a nicked ear during his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday after Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at him. The attack left him with a bloodied face as the former president said the bullet pierced his "upper part of right ear".</p>

<p>The early details that have emerged about Thomas Matthew Crooks show that he was a math whiz, working an entry-level job near his hometown in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He graduated high school in 2022 with a reputation as a bright but "quiet" classmate.</p>

<p>His counselor at Bethel Park High School described him as "respectful" and said he never knew him to be political.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With investigators still searching for clues about what may have led <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/thomas-matthew-crooks-donald-trump-rally-shooter-wanted-to-join-schools-shooting-club-he-was-rejected-6108539" target="_blank">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> to attack Donald Trump, new details that have emerged in the case show that the 20-year-old was spotted by three police snipers minutes before he opened fire at the former US president.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The 78-year-old Republican presidential candidate was injured in an assassination attempt at his campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/first-photo-of-thomas-matthew-crooks-20-year-old-loner-who-shot-at-trump-6107465" target="_blank">Crooks</a>, a resident of nearby Bethel Park, had climbed on a rooftop with a rifle in hand to attack Trump. He, however, was killed by a US Secret Service sniper minutes after he opened fire, which killed a bystander and injured two spectators.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting US political leaders, has since then faced backlash over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was allowed to take position on a roof some 500 feet from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/shooter-who-fired-at-trump-had-explosives-in-his-car-report-6105229" target="_blank">Trump</a>, who is pitted against US President Joe Biden in the November 5 elections.</p>

<p>Mobile footage has emerged of people sighting the gunman on the roof and trying to warn security before he opened fire.</p>

<p>According to CBS News, there were three snipers stationed inside the building the shooter used during Saturday's shooting. The operations plan had them stationed inside the building looking out windows toward the Trump rally.</p>

<p>One of the snipers inside saw Crooks outside and looking up at the roof, observing the building and disappearing, a local law enforcement officer told CBS News. The 20-year-old then came back, sat down, and looked at his phone. At that point, one of the snipers took a picture of him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crooks took out a rangefinder and the Secret Service sniper radioed to the command post, CBS News reported. He then disappeared again and came back a third time with a backpack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Secret Service snipers called in with information that he had a backpack and said he was walking toward the back of the building. Officers believe that the shooter might have used an air conditioning unit to get on top of the roof.</p>

<p>By the time other officers came for backup, he had climbed on top of the building and was positioned above and behind the snipers inside the building, CBS News reported citing an officer.</p>

<p>Two other officers who heard the sniper's call tried to get onto the roof. State police started rushing to the scene, but by that time, a Secret Service sniper had already killed Crooks, the officer said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The body of a spade-toothed whale -- a species so rare it has never been seen alive -- appears to have washed up on a New Zealand beach, scientists say.</p>

<p>The remains of the obscure, five-metre (16.4 foot) long, beaked creature were found near a river mouth in southern Otago province on July 4, government researchers said.</p>

<p>It was identified by marine-mammal experts from New Zealand's Department of Conservation and the national museum, Te Papa, as a male spade-toothed whale.</p>

<p>A DNA investigation has been launched to confirm its classification, the scientists said.</p>

<p>"Spade-toothed whales are one of the most poorly known large mammalian species of modern times," said the conservation department's coastal Otago operations manager, Gabe Davies.</p>

<p>"Since the 1800s, only six samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand," Davies said in a statement Monday.</p>

<p>"From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge."</p>

<p>The find was fresh enough to offer the first opportunity for a spade-toothed whale to be dissected, the conservation department said.</p>

<p>The species is "so rare next to nothing is known about them", it said.</p>

<p><strong>'International importance'</strong></p>

<p>The body of the whale has been placed in cold storage and genetic samples have been sent to the University of Auckland as curators of the New Zealand Cetacean Tissue Archive.</p>

<p>It may take several weeks or months for the DNA to be processed and a final identification confirmed.</p>

<p>"The rarity of the whale means conversations around what to do next will take more time because it is a conversation of international importance," the conservation department said.</p>

<p>The species was first described in 1874 from just a lower jaw and two teeth collected from the Chatham Islands off the east coast of New Zealand.</p>

<p>That sample, along with skeletal remains of two other specimens found in New Zealand and Chile, enabled scientists to confirm a new species.</p>

<p>But because so few specimens have been found and there have been no live sightings, little is known about the spade-toothed whale and it is classified as "data deficient" under New Zealand's Threat Classification System.</p>

<p>The first intact specimen was from a mother and calf stranding in Bay of Plenty in 2010, the New Zealand conservation department said.</p>

<p>A further stranding in 2017 in Gisborne added one more specimen to the collection.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's well known that as far as the climate crisis goes, time is of the essence.</p>

<p>Now a study out Monday shows that the melting of the polar ice caps is causing our planet to spin more slowly, increasing the length of days at an "unprecedented" rate.</p>

<p>The paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that water flowing from Greenland and Antarctica is resulting in more mass around the equator, co-author Surendra Adhikari of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's like when a figure skater does a pirouette, first holding her arms close to her body and then stretching them out," added co-author Benedikt Soja of ETH Zurich.</p>

<p>"The initially fast rotation becomes slower because the masses move away from the axis of rotation, increasing physical inertia."</p>

<p>Earth is commonly thought of as a sphere, but it's more accurate to call it an "oblate spheroid" that bulges somewhat around the equator, a bit like a satsuma.</p>

<p>What's more, its shape is constantly changing, from the impacts of the daily tides that affect the oceans and crusts to longer-term effects from the drift of tectonic plates, and abrupt, violent shifts caused by earthquakes and volcanoes.</p>

<p>The paper relied on observational techniques like Very Long Baseline Interferometry, where scientists can measure the difference in how long it takes for radio signals from space to reach different points on Earth, and use that to infer variations in the planet's orientation and length of day.</p>

<p>It also used the Global Positioning System, which measures Earth's rotation very precisely, to about one-hundredth of a millisecond, and even looked at ancient eclipse records going back millennia.</p>

<h3><strong>Implications for space travel&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>If the Earth turns more slowly, then the length of the day increases by a few milliseconds from the standard measure of 86,400 seconds.</p>

<p>A currently more significant cause of slowdown is the gravitational pull of the Moon, which pulls on the oceans in a process called "tidal friction" that has caused a gradual deceleration of 2.40 milliseconds per century over millions of years.</p>

<p>But the new study comes to a surprising conclusion that, if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases at a high rate, the effect of a warming climate will be greater than that of the Moon's pull by the end of the 21st century, said Adhikari.</p>

<p>Between the year 1900 and today, climate has caused days to become around 0.8 milliseconds longer -- and under the worst-case scenario of high emissions, climate alone would be responsible for making days 2.2 milliseconds longer by the year 2100, compared to the same baseline.</p>

<p>That might not sound like a great deal, and certainly not something that humans are able to perceive.</p>

<p>But "there are definitely a lot of implications for space and Earth navigation," said Adhikari.</p>

<p>Knowing the exact orientation of Earth at any given moment is crucial when attempting to communicate with a spaceship, such as the Voyager probes that are now well beyond our solar system, where even a slight deviation of a centimetre can end up being kilometres off by the time it reaches its destination.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump and Joe Biden have both stressed "unity" in the wake of the stunning assassination attempt on the Republican presidential contender, but any shift to a more civil political discourse is likely to be short-lived.</p>

<p>For months, the two campaigns have shredded the other's candidate with a ferocity that exceeds the already bruising nature of US political races, and observers say there is little chance of that dynamic being altered in any significant way.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, both men struck a moderate tone and avoided language that could escalate the febrile political atmosphere.</p>

<p>Biden called on Americans to "lower the temperature" in an address from the Oval Office, and Trump said it was "more important than ever that we stand united."</p>

<p>The two men even spoke to each other on the phone -- after refusing to so much as shake hands at their televised debate last month.</p>

<p>"In the immediate aftermath of a national tragedy or a near-tragedy, politicians want to appear empathetic and say the kinds of healing things people want to hear," Roy Gutterman, an expert in communications law at Syracuse University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"I am sure it will not take long for the vitriol to start flowing" again, he added.</p>

<h3><strong>Mockery and insult&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has always favored an extremely aggressive stance towards political opponents, whom he has collectively described as "vermin."</p>

<p>His personal attacks on Biden have ranged from theatrically mocking the president's stammer to labeling him a "mental catastrophe."</p>

<p>Biden for his part refused to even mention Trump by name earlier in the race, and in recent months the president and his campaign have sharpened and personalized their messaging about Trump as an "unhinged" would-be dictator with the "morals of an alley cat."</p>

<p>Their June 27 debate, meanwhile, descended into an argument about who was the worst president in US history.</p>

<p>"I am hopeful, if skeptical, that political rhetoric in the US will get less hateful and driven by rage," Peter Loge, director of George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That American politics has often been awful doesn't mean it needs to always be awful."</p>

<p>In an interview with NBC on Monday, Biden admitted it was a mistake to call for Trump to be put in the "bullseye" days before the assassination attempt, but he defended his repeated warnings that the former president poses an existential threat to American democracy</p>

<p>That line of attack is one his campaign has identified as resonating with key independent voters, and it is not one they are likely to drop or moderate.</p>

<p>The same day, after Trump formally won the Republican nomination at his party's convention, Biden's campaign blasted his newly unveiled running mate J.D. Vance as a "far-right MAGA extremist."</p>

<p>Trump meanwhile posted a message on his Truth Social platform accusing Biden of conducting an "elections interference conspiracy" and weaponizing the justice system against his political enemies.</p>

<h3><strong>'Loudest voices'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"Extremists on both sides of the political spectrum seem to have the loudest voices these days," Gutterman said.</p>

<p>"They probably do not spend too much time weighing on a more moderate voice of reason or calls for peace or moderation."</p>

<p>As the race to the White House heats up, political pundits have called on both campaigns to tone down the rhetoric -- while urging the media to hold them accountable if they cross the line.</p>

<p>"The media needs to treat political violence as abnormal and destructive," Loge said.</p>

<p>"One way to do that is to call out all of the politicians who told everyone to calm down yesterday, and who start shouting tomorrow."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A “hacktivist” group has claimed responsibility for a major data breach at Disney. The group, called “Nullbulge”, says it leaked around 1.2 terabytes of information from Disney's internal Slack channels. This data includes messages, files, unreleased projects, raw images, computer codes and some login credentials.<br />
<br />
In an email to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/15/business/internal-disney-slack-leak-hacker-group/index.html ">CNN</a> on Monday, Nullbulge explained they accessed Disney's Slack through an insider who had cookies, allowing them entry. The email mentioned the insider initially tried to remove them but eventually allowed them “right back in before the second time.”<br />
<br />
Last week, the hacking activist group published 1.2&nbsp;TB of data, purportedly from Disney's Slack archive, which allegedly contained nearly 10,000 channels with extensive information, including sensitive data about unreleased projects and internal websites. The leaked data was initially posted on BreachForums but has since been removed. However, it remains accessible on various mirror sites, as per Wired.<br />
<br />
NullBulge, the group based out of Russia, claims to protect artists' rights and ensure fair compensation. They target companies that violate one of three "sins" – promoting cryptocurrencies, using AI-generated artwork or stealing from artists or platforms that support them. In the email, they claimed that Disney was their target due to “how it handles artist contracts, its approach to AI, and its pretty blatant disregard for the consumer.”<br />
<br />
Roei Sherman, Field CTO at Mitiga Security, reviewed the leaked data and confirmed, “All of it looks legit – a lot of URLs, conversations of employees, some credentials, and other content,” as per Wired.<br />
<br />
He commented on the breach, saying he was not surprised that a giant like Disney could be affected at this scale, saying, “Companies are getting breached all the time.” He said “data theft from the cloud and software-as-a-service platforms” were common these days because it was "easier for attackers and holds bigger rewards".<br />
<br />
He warned, “Disney will probably be targeted a lot more now by opportunistic threat actors.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told two top Israeli officials Monday of the "unacceptably high" civilian casualties in Israel's bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, his spokesman said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has launched several deadly attacks in recent days including on a refugee camp and multiple UN-run schools where civilians were sheltering.</p>

<p>In response, Hamas said it was pulling out of ceasefire negotiations, causing prospects for a truce and hostage release deal to dwindle further.</p>

<p>Blinken received two influential Israeli officials -- Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi -- "to express our serious concern about the recent civilian casualties in Gaza."</p>

<p>Casualties "still remain unacceptably high. We continue to see far too many civilians killed in this conflict," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Israeli strikes killed more than 90 people in the Al-Mawasi camp near Khan Yunis, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said.</p>

<p>AFP reported sirens wailing and women screaming as children were pulled bloody and unmoving from the wreckage in Al-Mawasi, which Israel had declared a "safe zone".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the bombardment targeted two people -- the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, and his close associate Rafa Salama who the army said was killed.</p>

<p>A Hamas official said Sunday that Deif was "well and directly overseeing" operations, though doubts remained.</p>

<p>The two Israeli officials told Blinken that "they do not have certainty yet" about Deif's fate, according to Miller.</p>

<p>The bilateral discussions also focused on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, humanitarian aid for Gaza and post-war plans, he said.</p>

<p>The visit comes several few days before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to address the US Congress on July 24.</p>

<p>"We continue to hear from Israel directly that they want to reach a ceasefire and that they're committed to the proposal that they put forward," Miller said.</p>

<p>The United States has strongly defended Israel since the October 7 attacks by Hamas, in which 1,195 people, mostly civilians, were killed, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>During the attack, the militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive has killed at least 38,584 people, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Gaza health ministry.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has been under mounting political pressure over the plight of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"We are incredibly troubled by the ongoing deaths of Palestinians in Gaza," Miller said Monday, when asked about US weapons provided to Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump on Monday announced US Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate for the November Presidential polls.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump on Monday announced US Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate for the November Presidential polls. The announcement came ahead of the former president's surprise appearance at the Republican National Convention, just two days after he survived an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, will join Trump on the ticket to challenge President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election.</p>

<p><strong>Who is JD Vance?</strong><br />
<br />
1. JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother struggling with addiction. His father left the family when Vance was a toddler. He grew up with his grandparents; his grandmother “Mamaw” was a “blue dog” Democrat and a devout Christian who owned 19 handguns.<br />
<br />
2. Vance served in the US Marine Corps after high school, including a tour in the Iraq War. He then pursued higher education, graduating from The Ohio State University and Yale Law School. Until 2017, he worked at a venture capital firm.<br />
<br />
3. Before entering politics, Vance gained national attention with his memoir <em>Hillbilly Elegy,</em> which was later adapted into a Netflix movie.<br />
<br />
4. JD Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Chilukuri Vance. They met at Yale Law School and got married in Kentucky in 2014. In addition to a traditional ceremony, they had a separate Hindu ceremony conducted by a Hindu priest. They have three children.<br />
<br />
5. Vance was once a vocal critic of Donald Trump, calling him an “idiot” and “reprehensible” and comparing him to Hitler in earlier interviews in 2016. However, he has now transformed into one of Trump's steadfast allies, rarely missing an opportunity to defend him. Although his name was long mentioned as a potential political candidate, Vance seized the chance to run for Ohio's Senate seat in 2022 after Republican Senator Rob Portman decided not to seek re-election. His campaign struggled initially but gained momentum after receiving a $10 million donation from his former boss, Peter Thiel. Despite being in a predominantly Republican state, Vance's past criticism of Donald Trump posed a hurdle to his election. He managed to mend things with the former President for his previous remarks and secure Trump's endorsement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Loneliness affects everyone at different times. Although it is well-documented that men are less likely than women to talk about feelings and to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560805/">seek help</a>, our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-18770-w">research</a> found men's work arrangements can be a significant contributor.</p>

<p>We found loneliness was highest among men in their late 40s but it also occurred at other times, often shaped by how they perceived their careers and income.</p>

<p>This suggests the workplace and societal expectations around work are important in men's experiences of loneliness.</p>

<h2>Measuring loneliness</h2>

<p>Our findings are based on an analysis of yearly data from 12,117 Australian men, aged 15 to 98, collected for over 19 years for the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) <a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda">Survey</a>.</p>

<p>We measured loneliness by examining men's responses to a question asking whether they agreed with the statement: “I often feel very lonely”. The responses range from one (completely disagree) to seven (completely agree).</p>

<p>We then used statistical techniques to ensure we were measuring loneliness and not similar constructs, such as social isolation.</p>

<p>We also used methods that examined how much of men's loneliness was uniquely due to their social relationships (for example, their romantic relationships or friendships), versus other aspects of their lives, such as their living situation or their working arrangements.</p>

<h2>The role of work</h2>

<p>Given loneliness is a social problem, we were not surprised to find problems in men's social relationships, particularly their romantic relationships, friendships and family relationships were linked with loneliness. However, we were surprised to see work also played a significant role.</p>

<p>Men who were unemployed or in insecure jobs experienced more loneliness than those with stable employment. Job loss can impact a person's identity and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621006717">limits the social connections work typically provides</a>. Unemployment also limits income, making it harder to afford social activities. Insecure “gig” work, with its often unpredictable and long hours spent alone, <a href="https://theconversation.com/working-in-isolation-can-pose-mental-health-challenges-heres-what-anyone-can-learn-from-how-gig-workers-have-adapted-194712">disrupts work-life balance and can isolate people</a>.</p>

<p>Our research suggests societal expectations also worsen loneliness for some men. We measured the degree to which men agreed with the statement: “It is not good for a relationship if the woman earns more than the man”.</p>

<p>Men, particularly middle-aged men, who believed they should be the main breadwinners in a household were lonelier than those without this belief.</p>

<p>This suggests traditional views around work in the context of heteronormative relationships can be damaging to social connection.</p>

<p>This once mainstream view not only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211126/">harms relationships</a> but is also unrealistic when surviving on a single income is increasingly difficult for many households.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Men who believed men, not women, should be the main breadwinner were more lonely.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-white-coat-protective-goggles-face-1708180012">Marion Weyo/Shutterstock</a></span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Improving men's personal relationships is only one way to reduce male loneliness. The work sector and social pressures around work should also adapt.</p>

<h2>Shifting social norms</h2>

<p>Public stereotypes that make men feel solely responsible for household income need to shift. Public awareness and education campaigns <a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/pdf/S2405-8440(21)00763-5.pdf">can help shift gender norms and stereotypes</a> by building knowledge and awareness, and may therefore reduce loneliness.</p>

<p>Helping men attain better work-life balance <a href="https://theconversation.com/helping-men-get-work-life-balance-can-help-everyone-43000">can help everyone</a>. Such change, however, requires major cultural shifts which take time. A shorter term solution, particularly for men at retirement age, is volunteering.</p>

<p>Volunteering provides purpose and opportunities to socialise, although <a href="https://csrm.cass.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/docs/2023/10/Ongoing_trends_in_volunteering_in_Australia.pdf">recent evidence</a> suggests volunteering has not returned to pre-COVID levels.</p>

<h2>How governments can help</h2>

<p>Increasing casualisation of the workplace and the growth of the gig economy offer flexibility but also decrease job security. Our research shows job insecurity or unemployment rates contribute to male loneliness.</p>

<p>Government amendments to the Fair Work Act should help reduce job insecurity by allowing the Fair Work Commission to set fair minimum standards, including access to dispute resolution for “employee-like” workers, such as Uber drivers, who work through a digital platform.</p>

<p>Governments can also support activities of interest to men by ensuring regular funding for programs like <a href="https://mensshed.org/">Men's Sheds</a> or opportunities to <a href="https://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/wp-content/uploads/Volunteering-Australia-%E2%80%93-Navigating-change-and-charting-a-new-course-volunteering-in-recent-times.pdf">work with animals</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092430/">Social prescribing</a> – where a GP or other health worker links patients with resources and activities to improve health and reduce loneliness – can also involve men in roles which best fit their needs and interests.</p>

<h2>How employers can help</h2>

<p>Thankfully, workplaces can do a lot to reduce loneliness. A recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681323000010">review</a> suggests employers can:</p>

<p>1) Create opportunities for social connection, for example, dedicating time for non-work activities such as designing communal areas in offices to support connection.</p>

<p>2) Support flexible and remote, potentially isolated workers by fostering workplace connections using virtual spaces such as online dinners, while still encouraging work-life balance.</p>

<p>3) Foster a people focused culture by building employee autonomy, tolerating mistakes and providing mentoring opportunities.</p>

<p>The relationship between managers and workers is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/73/9/557/7591258">especially important</a> for well-being, because managers can shape working conditions, model positive behaviour and improve staff knowledge, but few interventions target this area.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance branded China the biggest threat to America in one of his first interviews since being named Donald Trump's running mate, underscoring the likely hawkish stance of their administration toward Beijing if elected.</p>

<p>The Ohio Senator made the remarks in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday local time. When asked about the war in Ukraine, Vance said Trump would negotiate with Moscow and Kyiv to "bring this thing to a rapid close so America can focus on the real issue, which is China."</p>

<p>Senator JD Vance, a Republican from Ohio and Republican vice-presidential nominee, during the Republican National Convention (RNC) at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US, on Monday, July 15, 2024. The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee will go on as scheduled, despite an assassination attempt against former</p>

<p>"That's the biggest threat to our country and we are completely distracted from it," he said, shortly after joining the Republican presidential ticket.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden and his challenger Trump are jockeying to be seen as tough on China as they head toward an election rematch in November. Trump has promised to hike tariffs on China across the board if reelected, vowing a 60% tax on all Chinese imports. Biden has already announced a new 100% levy on electric cars from the world's No. 2 economy.</p>

<p>US spies believe that China has no clear preference between the two candidates, Bloomberg News previously reported.</p>

<p>Vance, 39, was tapped by Trump days after a failed assassination attempt on the former president upended what had already been a chaotic presidential contest.</p>

<p>It's not the first time Vance has criticized China. The venture capitalist-turned-senator previously called for "broad-based tariffs" on Chinese goods and advocated for bringing American manufacturing back home to reduce dependency on Beijing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Misinformation and conspiracy theories were spreading online after an assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on Saturday.</p>

<p>Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was alleged to have shot at the Republican presidential candidate from a rooftop during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding Trump's right ear. One spectator died and two others were injured.</p>

<p>Reuters has fact-checked some of the most widely shared narratives online.</p>

<p><strong>Misidentified shooters</strong></p>

<p>Within hours of the shooting, an image surfaced online of a man dressed in a black sweatshirt, hat and black sunglasses. Social media posts said the man was "Antifa extremist" Mark Violets and that he was named by local police as the suspect in the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>However, the man in the photograph is Marco Violi, who had nothing to do with the shooting. Violi is an Italian sports writer who shares content on the Italian soccer team AC Roma.</p>

<p>In a statement emailed to Reuters and shared on his social media, Violi said he was in Rome and had awoken at 2 a.m. to numerous messages, adding that he "categorically denied any involvement in the situation."</p>

<p>Violi was not the only individual to have been misidentified in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.</p>

<p>Viral posts also misidentified another man, Maxwell Yearick, as the shooter. In 2016, various media outlets reported that Yearick, who does not resemble Crooks, was arrested outside a Pittsburgh Trump rally after an altercation with police.</p>

<p><strong>Altered Images, False Claims Shooting Was Staged&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Doctored images of Trump and Secret Service agents smiling on stage surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The fake images were shared to support claims that the assassination attempt had been "staged" as a ploy to boost Trump's popularity in November's election.</p>

<p>The original photographs were captured by an Associated Press photographer and show Trump and the agents with serious facial expressions.</p>

<p>The FBI on Sunday said Crooks acted alone and the agency had yet to identify a motive.</p>

<p><strong>Predictive Programming Conspiracy Theories</strong></p>

<p>Predictive programming is a conspiracy theory, often revived in the aftermath of a major news event, that suggests governments and powerful groups provide indications of planned events to the public by embedding predictions in books, TV shows and movies.</p>

<p>Within an hour of the attempted assassination, a fabricated screenshot resurfaced of a cartoon of Trump in a casket and was described as a scene from the TV series "The Simpsons."</p>

<p>But this image has made the rounds on social media since at least 2017.</p>

<p>Matt Selman, an executive producer for the show, told Reuters in an email that the screenshot never appeared on the show, adding that it is "all too easy to create fake Simpsons 'predictions' like these for the purpose of misleading people."</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman has acknowledged that he heavily relied on advice from his friend, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, to grow OpenAI after ChatGPT became a global sensation. In a joint interview with Mr Chesky at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the OpenAI CEO mentioned that while many people offered help once ChatGPT gained popularity in late 2022, Mr Chesky was the only one who truly pitched in, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/sam-altman-airbnb-ceo-gave-me-hours-of-advice-on-growing-openai.html"><em>CNBC Make It </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>"Everything just went crazy for me," Mr Altman said. "Brian would sit down with me for about three hours every other week and provide a list of things I needed to do. He'd point out where I was behind, what I was messing up, and what I needed to proactively consider."</p>

<p>Five days after ChatGPT launched to the public, it surpassed 1 million users. By January 2023, the platform had 100 million monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according to CNBC Make It. As the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company experienced rapid growth, Chesky became a close confidant, Altman noted. Mr Chesky was "almost always right," Altman added, saying, "I learned to just always shut up and follow the advice."</p>

<p>Elaborating on the impact of Mr Chesky's advice on OpenAI's business, Altman mentioned that his friend guided him on hiring decisions and how to "map" out the company's strategy.</p>

<p>Recently, Mr Chesky pointed out that Mr Altman was "probably not thinking enough about" the political consequences of the company's generative AI technology, the OpenAI CEO said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk said he plans to commit roughly $45 million each month to a new fund backing Donald Trump for US president, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</p>

<p>Musk's donations will go to a political group dubbed America PAC, which will focus on promoting voter registration, early voting and mail-in ballots among residents in swing states ahead of the November general election, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Musk is one of several major backers of the new fund, with others reportedly including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, former US ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft and cryptocurrency investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.</p>

<p>The Tesla founder formally endorsed Trump's candidacy for US president on Saturday after the former president survived a shooting at a political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Musk, the wealthiest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $250 billion, has grown increasingly friendly with Trump over the course of the 2024 US election.</p>

<p>In March, the two met in person during a donor breakfast hosted at the Florida residence of billionaire Nelson Peltz.</p>

<p>Though individual campaign donations in the United States are capped at $3,300 per person, loopholes in the campaign finance system allow political mega-donors to contribute to funds known as political action committees or "PACs," which support candidates.</p>

<p>Trump previously decried mail and absentee voting, but has backtracked on his criticisms after it became clear Democrats had an edge among mail voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles and Queen Camilla were quickly taken away from an event in Jersey on Monday due to a security scare.</p>

<p>Queen Camilla was eating ice cream when a member of the royal staff whispered something to her. At the same time, King Charles was approached by his protection officer and informed that they needed to leave immediately.</p>

<p>Both Charles and Camilla were then escorted to the nearby Pomme d'Or hotel for safety.</p>

<p>Matt Taylor, founder of Jersey Sea Salt, told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/breaking-king-charles-queen-camilla-33249399"><em>Daily Mirror </em></a>he was talking to the King before being approached by his security detail.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/former-boxers-single-punch-results-in-mans-permanent-brain-injury-6115035#pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories"><strong>Also Read | Former Boxer's Single Punch Results In UK Man's Permanent Brain Injury</strong></a><br />
<br />
He said, "He stopped at the stall and said, 'Ooh, sea salt.' And I said, 'Come and have a chat, sir'. Then his security appeared and grabbed me and said, 'He has to go, now.'</p>

<p>"He didn't seem panicked, but he was quite stern. They just ushered him out. It's a shame, as he'd stopped to chat with us of his own accord."</p>

<p>A concern raised by a member of the visit team led to this security alert, which was later determined to be a false alarm after a full background check. The event resumed shortly afterward.</p>

<p>This false alarm occurred just days after an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was hit in the ear by a bullet and then swiftly taken to the ground by Secret Service agents, who returned fire and killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Hamas official on Saturday dismissed optimistic talk by US President Joe Biden that a Gaza truce is nearer after negotiations in the Gulf emirate of Qatar.</p>

<p>"To say that we are getting close to a deal is an illusion," Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri told AFP. "We are not facing a deal or real negotiations, but rather the imposing of American diktats."</p>

<p>He was responding to Biden's comment Friday that "We are closer than we have ever been."</p>

<p>Biden spoke after two days of talks in Qatar where Washington tried to bridge differences between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas which have been at war for more than 10 months in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Previous optimism during months of on-off truce talks has proven unfounded.</p>

<p>But the stakes have risen significantly since the late July killings in quick succession of Fuad Shukr, a top operations chief of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Their deaths prompted promises of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah and fears of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Trying to avert a broader conflict, Western and Arab diplomats have been shuttling around the region to push for a Gaza deal which they say could help avert a wider conflagration.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed back to the region this weekend in a bid to help seal a deal.</p>

<p>Hamas officials have objected to "new conditions" from Israel in the latest proposal drawn up by Washington.</p>

<p>Israel's delegation expressed "cautious optimism" about the prospects for an agreement after returning from Doha, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Saturday.</p>

<p>"There is hope that the heavy pressure on Hamas from the United States and mediators will lead to the removal of their opposition to the American proposal, potentially allowing a breakthrough in the negotiations," it said.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy urged all parties to "engage positively and flexibly" in the negotiations.</p>

<p>"We underline the importance of avoiding any escalatory action in the region which would undermine the prospect for peace," they added.</p>

<p>"There is too much at stake."</p>

<h3><strong>Strikes in Lebanon, Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>As efforts towards a truce continued, so did the killing in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli air strike in the southern Nabatieh area killed 10 Syrians, including a woman and her two children.</p>

<p>The strike was among the deadliest in south Lebanon since the onset of near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah following the start of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it struck a Hezbollah weapons storage facility.</p>

<p>In Hamas-run Gaza, the civil defence authority said an Israeli air strike killed 15 people from a single Palestinian family. The deaths in Al-Zawaida helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death count to 40,074.</p>

<p>"We are in the morgue seeing indescribable scenes of limbs and severed heads and children who are dismembered," said Omar al-Dreemli, a relative.</p>

<p>Israel's military told AFP that overnight its forces had struck "terrorist infrastructure" in central Gaza from which rockets were being fired.</p>

<p>"Reports were received that as a result of the strike, civilians in an adjacent structure were killed. The incident is under review," it said.</p>

<p>The war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and healthcare infrastructure, leaving children vulnerable to preventable diseases.</p>

<p>The United Nations appealed Friday for seven-day pauses in the fighting so it could vaccinate children against polio, as the Palestinian health ministry reported Gaza's first polio case in 25 years.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bring them home'</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says 332 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza campaign since the ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees", the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are working to finalise details of a framework agreement initially outlined by Biden in May. He said Israel had proposed it.</p>

<p>Thousands rallied in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities on Saturday demanding a deal that would bring home the remaining Gaza hostages.</p>

<p>"We all know there's a real possibility for a deal," said Mor Korngold, hostage Tal Shoham's brother.</p>

<p>"These are crucial hours for my brother, for the hostages, for the soldiers, for those displaced from their homes, for the entire country."</p>

<p>In a joint statement after two days of talks in Qatar, the mediators said they would meet in Cairo "before the end of next week", hoping to seal an agreement.</p>

<h3><strong>Gazans on the move again</strong></h3>

<p>As truce talks took place, thousands of civilians were on the move again after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders ahead of imminent action in central-southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"During each round of negotiations, they exert pressure by forcing evacuations and committing massacres," said Issa Murad, a Palestinian displaced to Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>Over the past day, troops expanded operations around Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis including by "eliminating" Hamas who had fired munitions toward Nirim, just outside Gaza, Israel's military said Saturday.</p>

<p>Witnesses told AFP air strikes hit the Hamad residential towers in the city's northwest.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in the northern city of Jenin that Israel's military said targeted a "terrorist cell".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike in the occupied West Bank on Saturday that the Israeli military said targeted a "terrorist cell" in the Jenin area.</p>

<p>"Two bodies were transferred to Jenin public hospital after the occupiers (Israeli forces) bombed a car in the centre of the city," the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was carried out by an "Israeli drone".</p>

<p>The military said in a statement that it had carried out an "air strike on a terrorist cell in the Jenin area".</p>

<p>Video footage posted online showed a vehicle on fire in the middle of a street, while some images showed a crowd around a charred car, trying to open the doors.</p>

<p>"There are dead people in the car," shouts a man as a stretcher is brought by rescue workers.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, violence has flared in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967 and separated geographically from Gaza by Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Since October 7, at least 635 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers, according to an AFP count based on Palestinian official figures.</p>

<p>During the same period, at least 18 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks, according to Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's far-eastern Kamchatka Peninsula early Sunday morning local time, according to the regional earthquake monitoring service.</p>

<p>The local emergencies ministry said tremors were felt along the coast including in the region's capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.</p>

<p>"Operational teams of rescuers and firefighters are inspecting buildings," the regional branch of Russia's emergencies ministry in the Kamchatka region said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The earthquake struck at a depth of nearly 50 kilometres (30 miles) just after 7:00 am local time, some 90 kilometres east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the United States Geological Survey reported.</p>

<p>The US National Tsunami Warning Center had initially issued a tsunami threat, but later said the threat had passed. Local authorities never issued a tsunami alert.</p>

<p>Several aftershocks were recorded after the initial quake, but of lower intensity, the Kamchatka branch of Russia's Unified Geophysical Service reported on its website.</p>

<p>The peninsula lies on a seismically active belt surrounding most of the Pacific Ocean known as the "Ring of Fire", and is home to more than two dozen active volcanoes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza has recorded its first polio case in 25 years, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for pauses in the Israel-Hamas war to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children.</p>

<p>Tests in Jordan confirmed the disease in an unvaccinated 10-month-old from the central Gaza Strip, the health ministry in Ramallah said.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, Gaza, now in its 11th month of war, has not registered a polio case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory's wastewater in June.</p>

<p>"Doctors suspected the presence of symptoms consistent with polio," the health ministry said. "After conducting the necessary tests in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the infection was confirmed."</p>

<p>The case emerged shortly after Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children.</p>

<p>Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five.</p>

<p>The UN health and children's agencies said they had made detailed plans to reach children across the besieged Palestinian territory and could start this month.</p>

<p>But that would require pauses in the 10-month old war between Israel and Hamas, they said.</p>

<p>"Preventing and containing the spread of polio will take a massive, coordinated and urgent effort," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.</p>

<p>"I am appealing to all parties to provide concrete assurances right away guaranteeing humanitarian pauses for the campaign."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization and UN children's fund UNICEF said they were planning two seven-day vaccination drives across the Gaza Strip, starting in late August, against type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2).</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that type 2 poliovirus had been detected in samples collected in Gaza on June 23.</p>

<p>"These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination," the agencies said in a statement said.</p>

<h3><strong>Regional public health issue</strong></h3>

<p>After 25 years without polio, its re-emergence in the Gaza Strip would threaten neighbouring countries, it added.</p>

<p>"A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region."</p>

<p>During each round of the campaign, the health ministry in Gaza, alongside UN agencies, would provide "two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age".</p>

<p>More than 1.6 million doses of nOPV2 were expected to transit through Israel's Ben Gurion Airport "by the end of August", the statement added.</p>

<p>The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza passed 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and Hamas casualties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The UN's nuclear watchdog warned on Saturday that the safety situation at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was "deteriorating" following a nearby drone strike.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN's nuclear watchdog warned on Saturday that the safety situation at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was "deteriorating" following a nearby drone strike.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Russia accused Ukraine of dropping an explosive charge on a road near the occupied plant in southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The plant, which was seized by Russia's forces early in the war, has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out.</p>

<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts on site were informed of the detonation near essential plant facilities on Saturday and immediately visited the area, the agency said in a statement.</p>

<p>They reported that the damage "seemed to have been caused by a drone equipped with an explosive payload," impacting the road between the plant's two main gates.</p>

<p>"Yet again we see an escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers facing the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant," IAEA head Rafael Grossi said in the statement.</p>

<p>"I remain extremely concerned and reiterate my call for maximum restraint from all sides," he said.</p>

<p>The "nuclear safety situation" at the plant was "deteriorating," the statement added.</p>

<p>The IAEA team on site reported "intense" military activity over the past week in the area, including very close to the plant, it added.</p>

<p>"The team has heard frequent explosions, repetitive heavy machine gun and rifle fire and artillery at various distances from the plant," it said.</p>

<p>Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IAEA has repeatedly urged restraint, saying it fears reckless military action could trigger a major nuclear accident at the plant.</p>

<p>Kyiv and Moscow traded blame last weekend after a fire broke out at a cooling tower at the plant.</p>

<p>IAEA experts were able to visit the base of the cooling tower but have requested further access to assess the situation, according to the Vienna-based IAEA.</p>

<p>The fire resulted in "considerable damage", but there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety, the agency said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican Donald Trump said on Saturday he believed Democrat Kamala Harris will be easier to beat than President Joe Biden even as some polls showed her edging ahead in the race for the Nov. 5 presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Saturday he believed Democrat Kamala Harris will be easier to beat than President Joe Biden even as some polls showed her edging ahead in the race for the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump, the former president, spoke at a rally in Wilkes-Barre in northeastern Pennsylvania, a state looming large in the campaign. Vice President Harris will conduct a bus tour of western Pennsylvania starting in Pittsburgh on Sunday, ahead of the kickoff of the Democratic National Convention on Monday in Chicago.</p>

<p>"I believe she will be easier to beat than him," said Trump, referring to her as "radical" and a "lunatic."</p>

<p>Trump has sought to portray Harris as far left on a number of policies. At the rally, he highlighted her previous call for a ban on fracking, an industry important to the state. Harris' campaign has recently indicated she would not support a ban.</p>

<p>He also continued to attack Harris on personal terms, even as some political analysts say such comments could hurt Trump with moderate voters.</p>

<p>"Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person," Trump said, adding that he was displeased by the illustration of Harris on the cover of the latest issue of Time magazine. "I'm much better looking than her."</p>

<p>In a meandering speech, Trump repeated his false claim that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud, dismissed the threat of climate change and said his plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on foreign goods would not act as a tax on U.S. consumers, an assertion that most economists contest.</p>

<p>The Mohegan Sun Arena, where Trump appeared, has a capacity of roughly 8,000 and was nearly full when he started speaking. But the crowd began to thin after the one-hour mark. He spoke for more than 100 minutes in total.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states, along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that helped power Trump's upset victory in 2016. Biden, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, flipped the trio back to the Democrats in 2020.</p>

<p>With 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to secure the White House, compared with 15 in Michigan and 10 in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania may be the biggest prize in this year's election and potentially tip the balance for either candidate.</p>

<p>Harris' entry into the race after Biden ended his reelection bid last month has upended the contest, erasing the lead Trump built in the final weeks of Biden's campaign. Harris is leading Trump by more than two percentage points in Pennsylvania, according to the poll tracking website FiveThirtyEight.</p>

<h3><strong>BLANKETING AIRWAVES WITH ADS</strong></h3>

<p>Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by about 44,000 votes, a margin of less than one percentage point, while Biden prevailed by just over 80,000 votes in 2020, a 1.2-point margin.</p>

<p>Both campaigns have made the state a top priority, blanketing the airwaves with advertisements. Of the more than $110 million spent on advertising in seven battleground states since Biden dropped out in late July, roughly $42 million was in Pennsylvania, more than twice any other state, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing data from the tracking site AdImpact.</p>

<p>Democratic and Republican groups have already reserved $114 million in ad time in Pennsylvania from late August through the election, more than twice as much as the $55 million reserved in Arizona, the next highest total, according to AdImpact.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign said on Saturday it planned to spend at least $370 million on digital and television ads nationwide between the Labor Day holiday on Sept. 2 and Election Day.</p>

<p>The battleground states - seen as critical for winning the election - also include Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.</p>

<p>New polls published on Saturday by the New York Times found Harris leading Trump among likely voters in Arizona, 50% to 45%, and in North Carolina, 49% to 47%, and narrowing the former president's leads in Nevada, 47% to 49%, and in Georgia, 46% to 50%. A pollster from the Trump campaign said the poll results underestimated the Republican candidate's support.</p>

<p>Trump will give remarks on the economy at a campaign event in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday. His running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance, will hold an event in Philadelphia that day as well.</p>

<p>Trump's trip to Wilkes-Barre in Luzerne County was aimed at solidifying support among the white, non-college-educated voters who lifted him to victory in 2016. The blue-collar county voted Democratic for decades before swinging heavily toward Trump in 2016, mirroring other similar regions around the country.</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will make multiple stops across Allegheny and Beaver counties on Sunday, the campaign said. The tour is the first time Harris, Walz and their spouses have campaigned together since their first rally as a presidential ticket in Philadelphia earlier this month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Instead, the government of Olaf Scholz will bank on money generated from frozen Russian assets to continue supporting Kyiv, and is not planning "additional aid" to the 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) set aside in next year's budget.</p>

<p>This year, aid from Berlin amounted to 8 billion euros.</p>

<p>To compensate, Germany is counting on "the creation, within the framework of the G7 and the European Union, of a financial instrument using frozen Russian assets, said a separate source from inside the ministry of finance.</p>

<p>German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said in its weekend edition that the move was part of an agreement between the chancellor, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and Finance Minister Christian Lindner.</p>

<p>Lindner is a member of junior coalition partner the Liberal party.</p>

<p>Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that "the security of Europe depends on Germany's political will to continue to play a frontline role in supporting Ukraine".</p>

<p>The 2025 budget has been the subject of fierce discussions between the government coalition of Liberals, the Greens and the Social Democrats.</p>

<p>Lindner has asked other ministries to make savings in order to respect a constitutional rule that aims to prevent the state from taking on too much debt.</p>

<p>However the budget is still subject to discussions before being adopted by the end of the year. The finance ministry said Saturday it was open to considering extra spending for Ukraine on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Ukraine's allies have been working for several months on a mechanism to allow part of the $300 billion of Russian assets frozen worldwide to be used to support Kyiv in its war with Moscow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Firefighters were battling a strong forest fire in Turkey's Aegean city of Izmir for a third day on Saturday, AFP reporters said, a day after hundreds of local people in nearby villages had to be evacuated.</p>

<p>Firefighters said they had partially beaten back the flames that have been threatening the port city over the last three days, although fires were still burning in the nearby forests.</p>

<p>In the northern suburb of Ornekkoy, AFP journalists saw the charred remains of several buildings and vehicles in an industrial zone while grey smoke billowed into the sky.</p>

<p>"We don't know what to do. Our workplace is located in the middle of the fire. We have lost our livelihood," said 48-year-old Hanife Erbil, who earns a living collecting paper and plastic waste.</p>

<p>The pine trees that once crowned the surrounding hills were also burned.</p>

<p>"It was such a beautiful route, it smelled of pine trees everywhere. It makes me want to cry," said taxi driver Ayhan.</p>

<p>The smell of smoke was hanging over the city, the third most-populated in Turkey.</p>

<p>Firefighters from other Turkish cities have been sent as reinforcements and the army has been mobilised.</p>

<p>"Everyone is working hard. I'm on my 36th hour of service. We can say the fire is partially under control," said Izmir firefighter Arjin Erol.</p>

<h3><strong>Evacuations</strong></h3>

<p>The fire started on Thursday and spread quickly to residential areas by winds blowing at 50 kilometres (30 miles) an hour.</p>

<p>Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 900 residents in five affected districts had been evacuated Friday night in Izmir.</p>

<p>On Saturday, those villages remained empty for security reasons, except for a handful of volunteers who left food and water for animals living in the forest, AFP journalists saw.</p>

<p>Wild animals, cats and dogs died in the fire but no human victim has yet been reported.</p>

<p>The fire damaged 16 buildings and affected 78 people, with 29 of them admitted to hospital, the Turkish health ministry said.</p>

<p>"Currently, two planes and eleven helicopters are continuing to intervene," said Agriculture and Forestry Ministry Ibrahim Yumakli, after the strong winds had earlier grounded the helicopters and water bombers.</p>

<p>Residents of the city should not be worried, he added.</p>

<p>Four helicopters were dropping water on the flames throughout the day, backed by two planes, AFP journalists witnessed.</p>

<p>Around 1,600 hectares (3,900 acres) have been affected, the minister said, adding that the challenging terrain was making it difficult to put out the fire at its origin.</p>

<h3><strong>Fresh flames</strong></h3>

<p>Five other fires continue to rage in forest areas in other cities in Turkey, including northwestern Bolu and Aydin in the west.</p>

<p>And new fires broke out again in Izmir late on Saturday engulfing several districts including Bayindir and the popular holiday resort of Cesme, local mayor Cemil Tugay said on social media.</p>

<p>The authorities have controlled the fire in Cesme that lies across the Greek island of Chios, he said.</p>

<p>Officials said seven people were detained in Izmir over alleged links to the fire.</p>

<p>To come to the aid of its regional ally, Azerbaijan has sent a water bomber plane, the Turkish presidency announced.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change makes extreme weather events including heatwaves more likely, longer lasting and more intense, increasing the risk of wildfires.</p>

<p>In June, a fire that broke out in Mardin in southeastern Turkey claimed the lives of 15 people.</p>

<p>Observers however say Turkey has made progress since it was hit by the worst fires in its history in 2021.</p>

<p>At the time President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government was criticised for its failure to mobilise due to a lack of planes and helicopters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media platform X said on Saturday it would close its operations in Brazil "effective immediately" due to what it called "censorship orders" from Brazilian judge Alexandre de Moraes.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The decision to close the ? office in Brazil was difficult, but, if we had agreed to <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alexandre</a>'s (illegal) secret censorship and private information handover demands, there was no way we could explain our actions without being ashamed.</p>

<p>X claims Alexandre Moraes secretly threatened one of its legal representatives in the South American country with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content from its platform. Brazil's Supreme Court, where Alexandre Moraes has a seat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The X service remains available to the people of Brazil, billionaire Elon Musk's platform said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Alexandre Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts, as he investigates so-called "digital militias" that have been accused of spreading fake news and hate messages during the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>Alexandre Moraes opened an inquiry earlier this year into the billionaire after Musk said he would reactivate accounts on X that the judge had ordered blocked. Musk has called the Alexandre Moraes' decisions regarding X "unconstitutional."</p>

<p>After Musk's challenges, X representatives reversed course and told Brazil's Supreme Court that the social media giant would comply with the legal rulings.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing X in Brazil in April told the Supreme Court that "operational faults" have allowed users who were ordered blocked to stay active on the social media platform, after Alexandre Moraes had asked X to explain why it allegedly had not fully complied with his decisions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday his forces were "strengthening" their positions in Russia's Kursk region, where Kyiv has been mounting a major ground offensive for more than 11 days.</p>

<p>His comments came a day after Moscow accused Ukraine of destroying a key bridge over a river in the border region, as Kyiv seeks to disrupt supply routes and the movement of Moscow's troops in the area.</p>

<p>Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrsky "reported on the strengthening of the positions of our forces in the Kursk region and the expansion of stabilised territory", Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>"As of this morning, we have replenished the exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to Russian soldiers Ukraine has captured to be used in future prisoner swaps.</p>

<p>"I thank all the soldiers and commanders who are taking Russian soldiers prisoner and thus bringing the release of our soldiers and civilians held by Russia closer," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Kyiv claims to have taken control of more than 80 settlements in the lightning incursion, which caught the Kremlin off guard almost two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday it had pushed back Ukrainian forces near three settlements in the Kursk region, and was searching for "mobile enemy groups" trying to pierce deeper into the country.</p>

<p><strong>Bridge 'completely destroyed'</strong></p>

<p>Russian officials on Friday accused Ukraine of striking a strategically important bridge just a couple dozen kilometres away from fighting in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>The region's governor, Alexei Smirnov, said on Friday evening the bridge was in the Glushkovsky district, some 11 kilometres (seven miles) away from the border.</p>

<p>An aerial video published by Ukrainian air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk appeared to show the bridge being hit by a projectile at high speed before collapsing in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"Ukrainian pilots are conducting precision strikes on enemy strongholds, equipment concentrations, as well as on enemy logistics centres and supply routes," he said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the bridge was "completely destroyed" and that "volunteers providing assistance to the evacuated civilian population were killed".</p>

<p>"All those responsible for these inhumane acts will be severely punished," she said.</p>

<p>Russia separately accused Ukraine on Saturday of dropping an explosive charge on a road near the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The plant, which was seized by Russia's forces early in the war, has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out.</p>

<p>Russia meanwhile attacked at least four Ukrainian regions on Saturday, according to officials, including the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where prosecutors said shelling killed a 49-year-old woman.</p>

<p><strong>'Under control'</strong></p>

<p>While the incursion has delivered a major morale boost to Kyiv, it appears to have had little impact on the larger battles raging in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Zelensky said on Saturday there had been "dozens of Russian assaults" on Ukrainian positions near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where Moscow has made a string of advances in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"Our soldiers and units are doing everything to destroy the occupier and repel the attacks," Zelensky said, stressing the situation was "under control".</p>

<p>Russia said Friday its forces had captured another village near Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian-held logistics hub that lies on a road supplying troops and towns across the eastern front.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been inching towards the town for months, taking a string of tiny villages over the past weeks.</p>

<p>The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned on Thursday that Russia was a little over 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the past month, Israeli combat engineers have destroyed approximately 50 Hamas tunnel routes in the area of the Egypt-Gaza border, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. The announcement came as Israeli and Arab leaders were due to resume ceasefire negotiations in Qatar.</p>

<p>The tunnels were all in the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer zone that runs the length of the 14-km Gaza-Egypt border. It was created in 2006 to prevent weapons smuggling after Israel disengaged from the Strip. Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority the following year.</p>

<p>The military did not specify if any of the tunnels crossed into the Egyptian Sinai. On August 4, soldiers from the IDF's elite Yahalom combat engineering unit destroyed a three-meter tall smuggling tunnel leading into Egypt that was large enough to drive vehicles through.</p>

<p>Securing the Philadelphi corridor and destroying smuggling tunnels there is a critical goal to prevent Hamas from rearming and to curtail its leaders from escaping into the Sinai with Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 111 remaining hostages, 39 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 68 million people in Southern Africa are suffering the effects of an El Nino-induced drought which has wiped out crops across the region, the regional bloc SADC said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The drought, which started in early 2024, has hit crop and livestock production, causing food shortages and damaging the wider economies.</p>

<p>Heads of state from the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) were meeting in Zimbabwe's capital Harare to discuss regional issues including food security.</p>

<p>Some 68 million people, or 17% of the region's population, are in need of aid, said Elias Magosi, SADC executive secretary.</p>

<p>"The 2024 rainy season has been a challenging one with most parts of the region experiencing negative effects of the El Nino phenomenon characterised by the late onset of rains," he said.</p>

<p>It is Southern Africa's worst drought in years, owing to a combination of naturally occurring El Nino - when an abnormal warming of the waters in the eastern Pacific changes world weather patterns - and higher average temperatures produced by greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Countries including Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi have already declared the hunger crisis a state of disaster, while Lesotho and Namibia have called for humanitarian support.</p>

<p>The region launched an appeal in May for $5.5 billion in humanitarian assistance to support the drought response, but donations have not been forthcoming, said outgoing SADC chair Joao Lourenco, President of Angola.</p>

<p>"The amount mobilised so far is unfortunately below the estimated amounts and I would like to reiterate this appeal to regional and international partners to redouble their efforts... to help our people who have been affected by El Nino," he told the summit.</p>

<p>The drought is a major talking point at this year's summit, alongside issues such as the ongoing conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which Lourenco said was a source of great concern.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 100 firefighters tackled a large blaze at London's historic Somerset House cultural centre on Saturday, with images posted on social media showing flames leaping out from underneath its roof.</p>

<p>"Fifteen fire engines and around 100 firefighters have now been sent in response to the fire at Somerset House. Crews are tackling a fire located in part of the building's roof," the London Fire Brigade posted on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>Other footage taken from central London showed thick plumes of smoke rising above the building, which stretches for around 180 metres along the banks of the River Thames.</p>

<p>The official X account of the Renaissance building, which opened in 1796, said that "owing to a fire in one small part of Somerset House, the site is currently closed," but then appeared to delete the post.</p>

<p>The courtyard of the grand building hosts music gigs in the summer, and a popular ice rink in the winter, appearing in the 2003 film "Love Actually".</p>

<p>It has also appeared in two James Bond films, the 2008 movie "The Duchess", starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, and Tim Burton's 1999 horror flick "Sleepy Hollow".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike in the Gaza town of Zawayda on Saturday, health officials said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas rocket fire nearby.</p>

<p>Most of the people killed were from the same family and they included eight children and four women, according to health officials in the Hamas-administered enclave.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it was aware of the reports of the strike and was looking into them.</p>

<p>"They were asleep in their beds, kids and babies, then three missiles targeted their place," said Abu Ahmed Hassan, a neighbour. The owner of the house was a known merchant, he said. "There are no military activities here at all," he added.</p>

<p>Israel's military spokesperson in Arabic posted instructions on X on Saturday for people in parts of central Gaza, including in Maghazi district which is near Zawayda, to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone.</p>

<p>He said operatives were firing rockets from those locations and that the military was preparing to act against them.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately verify whether any areas of Zawayda were among those ordered to evacuate and whether people there received the military's instructions. Residents said thousands were streaming out of Maghazi.</p>

<p>On Friday, two sections of the southern city of Khan Younis within what Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone were deemed dangerous by the military, which ordered people to evacuate them saying that operatives had been regularly firing rockets from there.</p>

<p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday's orders, which also included other areas of the enclave outside the humanitarian zones, had affected around 170,000 displaced people.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest evacuation orders affecting the zone to date and it shrinks the size of the so-called 'humanitarian area' to about 41 square kilometres, or 11 per cent of the total area of the Gaza Strip," an OCHA report said.</p>

<p>In the central part of the enclave, residents said that Israeli tanks advanced further on Saturday into the eastern area of Deir Al-Balah, an area they had not invaded before, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that since Friday its forces had killed dozens of operatives, including some who had fired rockets from central and southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Most of Gaza's 2.3 million population has been displaced by the 10-month-old Israeli offensive, which has laid waste to much of the enclave.</p>

<p><strong>CEASEFIRE TALKS PAUSED</strong></p>

<p>Ceasefire talks in Doha, mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, paused on Friday with negotiators to meet again next week seeking an agreement to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas and free remaining hostages.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday that no party in the Middle East should undermine efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal that he said was now in sight, while at the same time warning that negotiations were "far from over."</p>

<p>Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in response that reports of an agreement being close were "deceptive claims".</p>

<p>The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent military campaign has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel has lost 330 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 15-year-old boy who created a soap that could "transform skin cancer treatment" has been chosen as the 2024 Kid of the Year by <em>Time </em>magazine and Time for Kids. Heman Bekele from Virginia, US, is a teen scientist "who could change how we treat skin cancer," the outlet stated in its announcement released Thursday. He was chosen after he created a soap that could be a "more accessible way to deliver medication to treat skin cancers, including melanoma," the magazine said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's absolutely incredible to think that one day my bar of soap will be able to make a direct impact on somebody else's life," the 15-year-old told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://time.com/6996507/heman-bekele/"><em>Time</em></a>. "That's the reason I started this all in the first place," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bekele has been seeing the effects of the sun on people's skin since he was a young boy growing up in Ethiopia. He noticed many people working in the sun without protecting their skin, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years later, after his family immigrated to the US, the 7-year-old Bekele got a chemistry set for Christmas that came with sodium hydroxide. It was then he began learning the power of chemical reactions. Around that time, he also started thinking more critically about the potential damage prolonged sun exposure can have on the human body. So, he became interested in the research surrounding skin cancer and its treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm really passionate about skin cancer research," he told the magazine. "Whether it's my own research or what's happening in the field."</p>

<p><strong>Also Read |<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/ever-wondered-what-happens-to-foam-in-space-heres-the-answer-6352402">&nbsp;Ever Wondered What Happens To Foam In Space? Here's The Answer</a></strong></p>

<p>Bekele eventually learned about imiquimod, a drug that was already approved to treat some forms of skin cancer. When used in a cream form, it can also help destroy tumours. So, the 15-year-old found a way to use imiquimod to treat earlier stages of skin cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Almost everyone uses soap and water for cleaning. So soap would probably be the best option," Bekele said about why he decided to develop a soap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, there are still many stages to go before the soap is approved to be used as treatment. According to <em>Time</em>, Bekele potentially has about a decade to go before the soap is approved as a cancer treatment. In the meantime, he's promoting it in presentations; that is when he's not playing in the marching band and enjoying a game of chess.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will hold the next edition of the '2+2" dialogue with their Japanese counterparts next week with a focus on further boosting overall strategic ties and reviewing the situation in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday that the third edition of India-Japan 2+2 foreign and defence ministerial dialogue will be held on August 20 in New Delhi.</p>

<p>The first edition of the dialogue was held in India in 2019 while the second one took place in Japan in 2022.</p>

<p>Japan's foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa and defence minister Minoru Kihara will be in New Delhi to attend the '2+2' dialogue.</p>

<p>The talks will give a major boost to overall India-Japan ties, Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>The '2+2' dialogue with Japan was initiated to further deepen bilateral security and defence cooperation and bring greater depth to the special strategic and global partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>India has the '2+2' ministerial format of dialogue with very few countries including the US, Australia and Russia.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 36-year-old Indian-origin man has been shot and killed after a teenage boy robbed a convenience store in the US state of North Carolina, authorities said.</p>

<p>Mainank Patel, the owner of the Tobacco House store at 2580 Airport Road, died after the shooting on Tuesday morning, the Salisbury Post reported.</p>

<p>A juvenile male is in custody for the crime, according to Rowan County Sheriff's Office. Because the young man is a juvenile, deputies are not able to release his name.</p>

<p>The juvenile was arrested Tuesday evening but no additional details have been released.</p>

<p>Deputies initially responded to the Tobacco House convenience store in response to a 911 hang-up call, said Captain Mark McDaniel, public information officer for the Rowan County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>While they were en route to the location, communications were received that there had been a shooting. When the deputies arrived on scene they found Patel suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, said McDaniel.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Novant Health Rowan Medical Center and then transported to Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, where he died as a result of his injuries, the report added.</p>

<p>A security video showed a tall, slender white male running across the store parking lot away from the building. He was wearing black shorts, a black hoodie, a black ski mask and white Nike tennis shoes with burgundy logos, and appeared to have a black handgun in his hand, said McDaniel.</p>

<p>McDaniel said that the sheriff's office is not certain of the motive in the shooting, but that it currently appears to have been a robbery. No one else was injured.</p>

<p>Patel leaves behind his seven-and-a-half-month pregnant wife, Ami, and their 5-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>Customers and workers say Patel would do just about anything for anybody, and the community is in mourning over his death.</p>

<p>Everyone called him "Mike." And it's evident by all the flowers and cards outside his store, Tobacco House, Wednesday that he was loved.</p>

<p>"It hit everybody because this was a family, this was a community family store," said Ann Ellis, a customer.</p>

<p>Javier Lopez has been cutting the grass at the store for years, even before Patel took over from his cousin, Lopez said, and the Patel family "treated everyone like family.</p>

<p>I just saw him yesterday morning, and on my way home from work, I saw the police and stopped to see what had happened.</p>

<p>"There are just no words to describe how great a guy Mike was," he continued.</p>

<p>"He was a super good man, good to his customers, loved his family and would have helped anyone," said Patricia Howard, another regular customer at the store.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior US diplomat on Monday denounced "vile and racist attacks" on Indian Americans after derogatory remarks were made recently about Vice President Kamala Harris's origins.</p>

<p>In a rare remark touching on domestic US politics, Richard Verma, the deputy secretary of state in charge of management issues, did not directly mention the attacks on the Democratic presidential candidate, but his allusion was clear.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more threatening or damaging to US-Indian ties than the recent demonization of immigrants we've seen careening through cyberspace and on our TV screens in recent days, which includes vile and racist attacks directed at Indian Americans," Verma, himself an Indian American, said at the Hudson Institute think tank.</p>

<p>"Let me be as clear as I possibly can -- this kind of language, these kinds of attacks, have no place in American society, and we have to reject them outright," he said.</p>

<p>Verma, a former US ambassador to India, was delivering an address on relations between the world's two largest democracies, which he said both historically have advocated "social justice for our most vulnerable populations."</p>

<p>Far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who has been travelling with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, recently wrote on social media that Harris would make the White House "smell like curry" if she won November's election.</p>

<p>Loomer's closeness with Trump has drawn fire even from some hard-right Republicans. Trump has insisted that he does not control her comments and was unaware that she has spread September 11 conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Harris, whose mother was born in India and father in Jamaica, would be the first US president of South Asian heritage and the first woman president if elected on November 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Ryan Wesley Routh fled the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, after Secret Service agents fired at him upon spotting the muzzle of his rifle through a chain-link fence. The incident occurred about 300 yards from the former President's location on the golf course.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Routh didn't get away for long, though. A witness provided a photo of his vehicle to authorities, which led to his arrest. Martin County Sheriff Will Snyder explained that Routh was caught near the Palm City exit 714 on I-95. Mr Snyder noted that Routh was "smart" and "just driving with the flow of traffic," which might have led him to believe he had evaded capture, Fox News reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During the arrest, authorities surrounded Routh's vehicle and forced it to stop after coordinating resources over a two-mile stretch. Following his arrest, Routh appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, facing charges of possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He also faces potential additional federal charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service was facing renewed scrutiny on Monday after a second assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump in two months.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, responding to the latest attack on the Republican White House candidate, said the agency charged with protecting high-profile officials "needs more help."</p>

<p>The Secret Service has been reeling since a gunman's bullet grazed the 78-year-old Trump's ear during a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle resigned 10 days later, acknowledging that the agency had "failed" its protective mission.</p>

<p>At least five Secret Service agents have reportedly been placed on leave pending the completion of an internal Secret Service review of security lapses.</p>

<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the review will examine measures needed to ensure the agency's "no-fail mission of protecting national leaders."</p>

<p>The 20-year-old Butler gunman, who was perched on the roof of a nearby building with a clear sight line of the stage, opened fire on Trump with an AR-style rifle just minutes after the former president began to speak.</p>

<p>He was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper within 15 seconds of firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Secret Service thwarted another apparent attempt to shoot the former president -- this time while he was playing golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

<p>According to acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe, an agent saw the would-be assassin armed with a rifle on the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Course.</p>

<p>The agent opened fire and the alleged assailant, later identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, fled in a vehicle.</p>

<p>Routh did not fire any shots and never had a clear sight line of the former president, Rowe said.</p>

<p>Routh was arrested 45 minutes later and charged with gun crimes at a first court appearance on Monday.</p>

<h3><strong>'Up their level of protection'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump thanked the Secret Service for thwarting Sunday's attack but some of his Republican allies called for the agency to ramp up its protective detail for the former president.</p>

<p>"There have been TWO attempts on Trump's life," said Steve Scalise, the Republican House Majority leader. "Secret Service must up their level of protection of him to their FULL capabilities -- including expanding the perimeter."</p>

<p>Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw defended the Secret Service's response, stating that if Trump had been the current president "we would have had this entire golf course surrounded."</p>

<p>"But because he's not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible," he said. "The Secret Service did exactly what they should have done. They provided exactly what the protection should have been."</p>

<p>Rowe said Biden, following the Butler attack, had ordered the "highest levels of protection" for Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>

<p>He said the service was operating in a "heightened and dynamic threat environment" and stressed that it "cannot have failures."</p>

<p>The Secret Service provides lifelong protection for current and former presidents and vice presidents, their families and the children of former presidents up to the age of 16.</p>

<p>Its agents also provide security for foreign heads of state and government on official visits to the United States, or for major national or international events.</p>

<p>Originally set up to combat counterfeit currencies, the agency was entrusted with protecting senior US leaders and their families following the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901.</p>

<p>To this day, the Secret Service continues to play a role in protecting the US financial system, including by investigating counterfeit money and digital fraud.</p>

<p>The agency has over 6,500 personnel, about half of whom are special agents, famous for their dark glasses, suits, earpieces and serious expressions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US tribunal began picking over the bitter spat between media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his children Monday in a case that could determine the fate of his empire, including the influential right-wing Fox News.</p>

<p>The hearings in Nevada are playing out behind closed doors despite a bid by an alliance of media outlets, including the New York Times, which first reported details of the judicial battle, for access to proceedings.</p>

<p>Murdoch, 93, is in the eye of a legal storm as several of his children seek to block him from changing the terms of a family trust to ensure his favoured son Lachlan gains control of his sprawling media assets after his death.</p>

<p>It's a plot worthy of the hit fictional TV series "Succession," in part inspired by the Murdoch family, in which a billionaire mogul fights his children over his empire's future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Nevada, Murdoch's children James, Prudence and Elisabeth are bitterly opposing changes that would dilute their formerly equal eventual control of Murdoch's companies.</p>

<p>Amid a heavy security presence, Murdoch, who wore a blue spotted tie and held hands with his new wife Elena Zhukova, 67, smiled and shook his head as he entered the collonaded tribunal, TV images showed.</p>

<h3><strong>Family feud sensation&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Observers warn the legal battle will have profound consequences for Murdoch's empire -- which transformed tabloid newspapers, cable TV and satellite broadcasting across multiple countries, but also faces accusations of stoking populism across the English-speaking world.</p>

<p>Critics credit Brexit in Britain and the rise of former US president Donald Trump at least partly to Murdoch and his outlets.</p>

<p>Lachlan is reportedly more aligned with his father's deeply conservative worldview and took the reins of News Corp and Fox Corporation in the fall of 2023.</p>

<p>His three siblings are said to be more politically centrist.</p>

<p>In a sign of the schism, James, who stood down from News Corp in 2020, has come out in support of Democrat Kamala Harris, facing off against Republican Trump in this year's presidential election.</p>

<p>Rupert Murdoch's lawyers argue he "is trying to protect James, Elisabeth and Prudence by ensuring that they won't be able to moderate Fox's politics or disrupt its operations with constant fights over leadership," according to the New York Times, which accessed court documents.</p>

<p>In a preliminary ruling, the probate tribunal did not oppose a change to the trust in Lachlan's favor, but will nonetheless hear arguments from all sides this week. It will then make recommendations.</p>

<p>News Corp, with revenues of $10 billion in 2023, is a dominating force in publishing through HarperCollins, in US newspapers with the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, and in Britain's cutthroat print market with The Sun and The Times.</p>

<p>Fox Corporation is the parent company of Fox News.</p>

<p>Following the 2020 election, the conservative TV network agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800 million after the voting machine company sued it for airing false claims that it rigged the vote against Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A patient with a degenerative disease was able to command Amazon's Alexa digital assistant with his mind, the company behind the technological innovation announced Monday, letting him stream shows and control devices with only his thoughts.</p>

<p>An implant in a blood vessel on the surface of the 64-year-old man's brain let him mentally "tap" icons on an Amazon Fire tablet, brain-computer interface company Synchron said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The patient, who is living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), was able to make video calls, play music, stream shows, control smart home devices such as lights, shop online, and read books by using his mind to direct Alexa, according to the New York-based company.</p>

<p>ALS is a degenerative nerve disease that leads to muscle weakness and paralysis.</p>

<p>"To be able to manage important aspects of my environment and control access to entertainment gives me back the independence that I'm losing," the patient, named only as Mark, said in a release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The test was intended to show how customers could use just their minds to control smart homes with Alexa-compatible devices such as door cameras, plugs, and thermostats, according to the company.</p>

<p>"While many smart home systems rely on voice or touch, we are sending control signals directly from the brain," Synchron founder and chief executive Tom Oxley said in the release.</p>

<p>"Patients can interact with devices in their home hands and voice-free, using only their thoughts."</p>

<p>Several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink, are working on connecting brains with computers.</p>

<p>Neuralink in January installed a brain implant in a man paralyzed after a diving accident. Musk, who also owns Tesla and X, touted the implant as a success.</p>

<p>In July he said his startup is "moving on" to a second test patient as its tech improves.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar said on Monday the Palestinian group was prepared for prolonged fighting against Israel, in a message to Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels nearly a year into the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"We have prepared ourselves to fight a long war of attrition that will break the enemy's political will," the Hamas leader said, asserting that the militants in Gaza and allied Iran-aligned groups in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen would defeat Israel.</p>

<p>The message followed a rare missile attack on central Israel on Sunday claimed by the Houthis, who control the Yemeni capital Sanaa and much of the country's Red Sea coast.</p>

<p>The attack caused no casualties but sparked vows of retaliation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Sinwar said in the message addressed to Huthi leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi: "I congratulate you on your success in sending your missiles deep into the enemy entity, bypassing all layers and defence and interception systems."</p>

<p>The Houthis said they had "penetrated" Israel's air defences, while Israel said the missile likely fragmented mid-air but was not destroyed.</p>

<p>"Our combined efforts with you" and with groups in Lebanon and Iraq "will break this enemy and inflict defeat on it," Sinwar added.</p>

<p>Since November the Houthis have targeted Israel and its perceived interests in stated solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, launching dozens of missile and drone strikes that have disrupted global shipping through vital waterways off Yemen.</p>

<p>The Houthis are fighting Israel as part of Iran's so-called "axis of resistance", which includes Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Several Iraqi Shiite Muslim groups.</p>

<p>In July, a Houthi drone strike killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, at least 1,800 kilometres (about 1,120 miles) from Yemen.</p>

<p>It prompted retaliatory strikes that caused significant damage and deaths at Yemen's rebel-controlled Hodeida port.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump launched a fierce attack on his Democrat rival Kamala Harris hours after a second assassination attempt on him. Trump was at his Florida golf course on Monday morning when Secret Service agents caught a suspect and found an AK-47 rifle in the nearby bushes. Suspect Ryan Routh has been charged with illegal possession of firearms, but officials clarified he did not fire any shot.</p>

<p>Trump blamed Harris - whom he referred to as "Comrade" - for propagating "Communist Left rhetoric", which he said has worsened the political culture in the US. He accused her of lying at the recent "highly partisan" ABC debate - though the US media had pointed out it was Trump who resorted to falsehoods during the debate.</p>

<p>"The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe's, then Kamala's, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse," asserted the former president who had survived another assassination attempt with a bloodied ear in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>He also reiterated his demands to deport illegal immigrants and allow only those who come on the basis of merit. "Allowing millions of people, from places unknown, to invade and take over our Country, is an unpardonable sin. Our borders must be closed, and the terrorists, criminals, and mentally insane, immediately removed from American cities and towns, deported back to their counties of origin," he said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the assassination attempt, Harris had said she was "glad" that Trump was safe and that violence has no place in America.</p>

<p>Trump's running mate JD Vance too criticised her after the Monday morning incident. In an online post, he claimed Harris' allies have repeatedly called for Trump to be eliminated.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris has said that "Democracy is on the line" in her race against President Trump. The gunman agreed, and used the exact same phrase. He had a Kamala Harris bumper sticker on his truck... he donated 19 times to Democrat causes and zero to Republican ones," said Vance on X.</p>

<p>He said that for years, Kamala Harris's "campaign surrogates" have said things like "Trump has to be eliminated," and targeted the US media for "double standard" on the coverage of the incident.</p>

<p>"The double standard is breathtaking. Donald Trump and I are, by their account, directly responsible for bomb threats from foreign countries. Why? Because we had the audacity to repeat what residents told us about the problems in their town. Meanwhile, Harris allies call for Trump to be eliminated as the media publishes arguments that he deserved to be shot," said Vance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations (UN) announced on Monday that the Taliban has suspended all polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>UN agencies said that they were notified about the suspension just days before the scheduled September immunisation campaign, though no official reason was provided.</p>

<p>Representatives from the Taliban-led government did not comment on the situation immediately.</p>

<p>Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only two countries in the world where the spread of the paralysing and potentially fatal disease has not been eradicated.</p>

<p>Despite the polio eradication programme's continuous efforts in Afghanistan, the last phase of the campaign to achieve polio-free status has faced significant challenges.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, the number of polio cases have risen in the country, with the virus spreading to provinces that had remained free of the disease for an extended period.</p>

<p>UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), the World Health Organization (WHO), and various non-governmental organisations, has been working through the Emergency Operating Centre (EOC) to explore innovative methods to ensure every child is reached with vaccines.</p>

<p>The focus was also on building trust and demand for vaccination campaigns among the population.</p>

<p>So far, 16 Afghan provinces have been affected, with a total of 56 cases of Wild Poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) reported.</p>

<p>The southern region of Afghanistan remains the most severely impacted, accounting for 66 per cent of the country's total polio cases in 2020.</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing challenges, the polio programme has ensured 100% adequacy of vaccine supplies for all polio-related activities, including immunisation campaigns, case responses, and the deployment of Permanent and Temporary Teams (PTT).</p>

<p>The successful introduction of vaccines such as mOPV2, mOPV1, and tOPV for case response campaigns has been made possible through capacity building in vaccine management and accountability.</p>

<p>Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the polio programme managed to conduct three National Immunisation Days, two Sub-National Immunisation Days, and three Case Response Campaigns across Afghanistan.</p>

<p>However, the current suspension by the Taliban adds uncertainty to future vaccination efforts, raising concerns about the ongoing fight to eliminate polio in the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As US Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to take the stage against former President Donald Trump in her White House bid in November, her secret weapon seems to be a high-powered lawyer with a surprising side gig - defending Google in a landmark antitrust trial that could reshape the tech giant's future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karen Dunn, a partner at the prestigious Paul, Weiss law firm, has been tapped by Harris to coach her for her campaign. Dunn had allegedly prepared Harris for her first debate of the 2024 US elections, against Trump. But while Dunn is busy prepping the VP for the debate, she's also leading Google's defense in a blockbuster case brought by the Joe Biden administration alleging the company illegally monopolized the online advertising market.</p>

<p>Dunn's dual roles have raised eyebrows among antitrust experts who worry her close ties to the Harris camp could undermine the government's aggressive pursuit of Google. They argue it's an "outrageous" conflict of interest for the Vice President to be taking advice from a lawyer representing a company her own administration is suing.</p>

<p>"It's clear that you can't serve both sides," said Matt Stoller of the American Economic Liberties Project to the New York Times. "If these were legal cases, she would be ethically barred from doing what she's doing," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dunn, who has prepped Democratic candidates for debates since 2008, delivered Google's opening statement in the high-stakes trial on Monday, September 9, two days prior to the most anticipated presidential debate ahead of the US polls, since Biden quit the presidential race. Hours later, on the very same day, Dunn rushed out of the Virginia courtroom to join Harris' team in Pittsburgh as they put the finishing touches on her debate prep.</p>

<p>The 48-year-old litigator is no stranger to the revolving door between Big Law and Democratic politics. She started as a legislative correspondent on Capitol Hill for Representative Nita Lowey of New York. She was next hired as the second employee on Hilary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign in 1999, with whom she worked during and after the September 11 terrorist attacks as well. She then briefly left politics to attend Yale Law School. But, by 2008, she was back to working on the presidential campaign with Clinton, and then later, with Barrack Obama.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a combination of tough love," said Hillary Clinton of Karen Dunn in an interview earlier this month. "She is someone who as a lawyer sweats the details, but she has an ability in her communications work to see the big picture, and that's really a rare quality," Clinton added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dunn's represented tech giants such as Apple and Uber and even helped prepare Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for a congressional hearing. In 2021, she won a landmark lawsuit against organizers of the 2017 Charlottesville far-right rally.</p>

<p>But Dunn's current juggling act may be her most high-profile yet. As she argues Google's case in court, her advice to Harris had an instrumental role in shaping the outcome of a debate that has been pivotal in the 2024 race. And with the Department Of Justice seeking a breakup of Google's ad business, the stakes couldn't be higher.</p>

<p>"One imagines her stature in Harris' world has only gone up after the debate - which could be concerning if she's ever negotiating a potential settlement with the Justice Department under Harris," said Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project.</p>

<p>The Republicans have already seized on the controversy, with a top Trump adviser blasting it as proof Harris will "never stand up to Big Tech." House Republicans are demanding answers from Attorney General Merrick Garland on how he's combating potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Neither Google nor the Harris campaign have commented on the issue so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of now, Dunn shows no signs of slowing down. As she told the New York Times in 2019, the key to a winning debate moment is engaging your opponent in a way that challenges them, and then creating a winning moment, preferably at the expense of someone else. With her dual roles, Dunn's on the verge of challenging the boundaries of what's acceptable in the world of high-stakes politics and la</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg recently made headlines after being labelled "Antisemite of the Week" by the Jewish watchdog group StopAntisemitism, following her arrest at an anti-Israel rally. The group criticized Thunberg for aligning with protesters who oppose Israel, accusing her of turning her activism into a platform for anti-Semitism, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/greta-thunberg-named-antisemite-of-the-week-by-jewish-advocacy-group/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She has sadly transformed her activism into a platform for vile Jew-hatred," the organization added.</p>

<p>Ms Thunberg, 21, was arrested on September 4 while demonstrating with Students Against the Occupation, who called on Copenhagen University to cut ties with Israel, including climate change programs. StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez condemned Thunberg, accusing her of prioritizing hatred for Israel over environmental activism, despite Israel's efforts in climate action.</p>

<p>"Sadly, Greta's hatred of the world's only Jewish nation eclipses her love of the environment. Despite Israel being a global leader in tackling climate disasters and rushing to aid in crises worldwide, Greta sides with their homicidal terrorist enemies," founder Liora Rez said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Her actions speak louder than her words. She claims to care about the future of humanity but Greta's hypocrisy is on full display as she's been active in championing Hamas leaders who openly call for genocide."</p>

<p>Thunberg, who had previously participated in other anti-Israel demonstrations, also faced backlash for holding a sign that some interpreted as using antisemitic imagery. Thunberg later removed the image and explained that the toy octopus in the photo was a communication tool used by autistic people, denying any antisemitic intent.</p>

<p>"The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people to communicate feelings," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China and Russia are concerned about the strengthening India-US relationship because it promotes inclusivity, peace, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, along with valuing diverse voices in society, a top US diplomat said Monday.</p>

<p>"Frankly, why do you think China and Russia are so concerned about this partnership? Because we bring a way of life to the rest of the world, that is about inclusivity, about peace, about the peaceful resolution of disputes, about the rule of law, and it's about hearing everyone's voice in a society," Richard Verma, the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources said at the prestigious Hudson Institute, in response to a question, after he delivered remarks on India-US relationship.</p>

<p>Mr Verma said the relationship between India and US is "a very different mode" than how some of the adversaries of the latter operate.</p>

<p>The diplomat noted that this uniqueness is why President Joe Biden has described the relationship between both countries as the "defining relationship of this century".</p>

<p>He recalled that nearly 20 years ago, when he stood with then-Senator Biden and staff director Tony Blinken in the Senate, Biden had remarked that if the US and India were the closest friends and partners by 2020, the world would be a safer place.</p>

<p>"Not just because we have two big militaries, not just because we have two big economies, but because we actually stand for something that matters to people in their daily lives across the world,” Mr Verma said.</p>

<p>In response to a question on QUAD, Mr Verma said it aims to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity.</p>

<p>"I look at what the Quad has, the kinds of statements and pronouncements it's made on technology, for example …technology for good, not to harass, not to surveil, not to misinform, laying out a set of key principles, going even further on some of our work on quantum computing and cybersecurity,” he said.</p>

<p>"When I look at what the Quad has said and done on energy transition, trade, rule-based order, I don't think it has to take on a military character. Indians are not supportive of that. Frankly, I don't think we need that. I think there are other venues to deal with core military issues,” he said.</p>

<p>"I think this is about like-minded countries, two of which are treaty allies of the United States, coming together in a different form, in a different architecture, bringing in the most populous country in the Indo-Pacific to actually chart some new territory that we hadn't charted before," Verma said.</p>

<p>"I think it has positive impact to security without being a treaty-based security organisation. There's great promise and excitement in the QUAD. I think this weekend's meeting will be quite significant. It'll be historic. QUAD will continue to just build in many ways,” said the top American diplomat.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden will host the fourth in-person Quad leaders summit at his Delaware residence next week, in a rare gesture for his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan, a presidential spokesperson announced Thursday.</p>

<p>India, which was scheduled to host QUAD this year, would host the summit next year. QUAD leadership summit is an initiative of Biden and is one of the key foreign policy legacies for the outgoing American president.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Infections of drug-resistant superbugs are projected to kill nearly 40 million people over the next 25 years, a global analysis predicted on Monday, as the researchers called for action to avoid this grim scenario.</p>

<p>Superbugs -- strains of bacteria or pathogens that have become resistant to antibiotics, making them much harder to treat -- have been recognised as a rising threat to global health.</p>

<p>The analysis has been billed as the first research to track the global impact of superbugs over time, and estimate what could happen next.</p>

<p>More than a million people died from the superbugs -- also called antimicrobial resistance (AMR) -- a year across the world between 1990 and 2021, according to the study in The Lancet journal.</p>

<p>Deaths among children under five from superbugs actually fell by more than 50 percent over the last three decades, the study said, due to improving measures to prevent and control infections for infants.</p>

<p>However when children now catch superbugs, the infections are much harder to treat.</p>

<p>And deaths of over-70s have surged by more than 80 percent over the same period, as an ageing population became more vulnerable to infection.</p>

<p>Deaths from infections of MRSA, a type of staph bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics, doubled to 130,000 in 2021 from three decades earlier, the study said.</p>

<h3><strong>'This threat is growing'</strong></h3>

<p>The researchers used modelling to estimate that -- based on current trends -- the number of direct deaths from AMR would rise by 67 percent to reach nearly two million a year by 2050.</p>

<p>It will also play a role in a further 8.2 million annual deaths, a jump of nearly 75 percent, according to the modelling.</p>

<p>Under this scenario, AMR will have directly killed 39 million people over the next quarter century, and contributed to a total of 169 million deaths, it added.</p>

<p>But less dire scenarios are also possible.</p>

<p>If the world works to improve care for severe infections and access to antimicrobial drugs, it could save the lives of 92 million people by 2050, the modelling suggested.</p>

<p>"These findings highlight that AMR has been a significant global health threat for decades and that this threat is growing," study co-author Mohsen Naghavi of the US-based Institute of Health Metrics said in a statement.</p>

<p>The researchers looked at 22 pathogens, 84 combinations of drugs and pathogens, and 11 infectious syndromes such as meningitis. The study involved data from 520 million individual records across 204 countries and territories.</p>

<p>It was released ahead of a high-level AMR meeting at the United Nations scheduled for September 26.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a natural phenomenon, but the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and plants has made the problem worse.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an expansion of the country's war goals on Tuesday to include the return of northern residents who fled cross-border fire traded with Hamas ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The political-security cabinet updated the goals of the war this evening, so that they include the following section: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes," Netanyahu's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israeli forces and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group have exchanged near-daily strikes since Hamas's October 7 attack sparked war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says the campaign is in support of its Palestinian ally.</p>

<p>Hezbollah officials have said the group would stand down if a Gaza ceasefire was reached, while Israel insists it cannot allow militants to remain in the border area in Lebanon's south.</p>

<p>The violence has killed hundreds of mostly fighters in Lebanon, and dozens of civilians and soldiers on the Israeli side.</p>

<p>The fighting has also forced tens of thousands of people on both sides to flee their homes.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told a visiting US envoy that "military action" was the "only way left to ensure the return of Israel's northern communities to their homes".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reproductive rights groups erupted in outrage Monday after ProPublica revealed that a Georgia woman died from delayed medical care caused by the US state's restrictive abortion law.</p>

<p>Amber Nicole Thurman, 28, developed a rare complication from abortion pills and died during emergency surgery in August 2022, with an official state committee blaming the fatal outcome on a "preventable" lag in performing a critical procedure.</p>

<p>Georgia had just passed a law that made performing dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) a felony offense with medical exceptions that doctors had warned were vague and difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>"Amber would be alive right now if it wasn't for Donald Trump and Brian Kemp's abortion ban," said Mini Timmara, president of Reproductive Freedom for All. "They have blood on their hands."</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn national abortion rights unleashed a wave of bans and restrictions in 22 states, thrusting reproductive rights to the forefront of the upcoming presidential election.</p>

<p>ProPublica said this was the first abortion-related death officially deemed "preventable" and plans to publish details of a second case soon.</p>

<p>These official reviews are not made public, but ProPublica obtained copies of the reports.</p>

<p>Thurman, an otherwise healthy medical assistant and mother of a six-year-old boy, made the decision to terminate a twin pregnancy to preserve her newfound stability, her best friend Ricaria Baker told ProPublica.</p>

<p>She and her son had recently moved to a new apartment complex and she planned to enroll in nursing school. She wanted a surgical abortion, but Georgia's six-week abortion ban forced her to seek care at a clinic in North Carolina.</p>

<p>On the day of the procedure, the hours-long drive was hampered by traffic, and Thurman missed her 15-minute appointment window.</p>

<p>The clinic offered a medication abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol. While overwhelmingly safe, rare complications can occur.</p>

<p>Thurman's condition worsened over several days, turning into heavy bleeding and vomiting blood. She was taken to Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge.</p>

<p>Doctors found she had not expelled all the fetal tissue from her body and she was diagnosed with "acute severe sepsis."</p>

<p>But despite her rapidly deteriorating health, the hospital delayed Thurman's dilation and curettage procedure for 17 hours.</p>

<p>By the time they operated, the situation was so dire it required open abdominal surgery. The doctor performed the operation and found a hysterectomy was also required -- but during the procedure, Thurman's heart stopped.</p>

<p>Her mother recalled her last words: "Promise me you'll take care of my son."</p>

<p>The state committee found there was a "good chance" that an earlier procedure could have saved Thurman's life.</p>

<p>"Life of the mother" exceptions have widely proven inadequate, forcing women to cross state lines in desperate bids for lifesaving care.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Egypt on Tuesday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire and release of hostages with Egyptian officials, the State Department said.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>Washington and mediators Qatar and Egypt have for months sought to reach a deal between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to halt the war and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>The two biggest obstacles now are Israel's demand to keep its forces in the Philadelphi corridor to maintain a buffer between Gaza and Egypt, and the specifics of an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTE</strong></p>

<p>Blinken will discuss efforts to reach a deal "that secures the release of all hostages, alleviates the suffering of the Palestinian people, and helps establish broader regional security," the State Department said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered last Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nothing justifies Israel's collective punishment of the people of Gaza as they endure "unimaginable" suffering, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told AFP on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing justifies Israel's collective punishment of the people of Gaza as they endure "unimaginable" suffering, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told AFP on Monday.</p>

<p>Guterres lashed out at Israel's handling of its war in the devastated Palestinian territory, now almost in its second year, as the UN prepares to host world leaders starting next week.</p>

<p>"It is unimaginable, the level of suffering in Gaza, the level of deaths and destruction have no parallel in everything I've witnessed since (becoming) secretary-general," said Guterres, who has led the embattled international organization since 2017.</p>

<p>"We all condemn the terror attacks made by Hamas, as well as the taking of the hostages, that is an absolute violation of international humanitarian law," he said.</p>

<p>"But the truth is that nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that is what we are witnessing in a dramatic way in Gaza," he added, decrying the widespread carnage and hunger blighting Gaza.</p>

<p>On October 7, Hamas fighters infiltrated from Gaza into southern Israel, unleashing unprecedented violence which killed 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP toll including hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, in power in Gaza since 2007, and its land and air offensive has claimed 41,226 lives according to the health ministry of the Hamas government.</p>

<p>More than 200 humanitarian workers, mostly UN staff, have also been killed.</p>

<p>"Accountability should be a must" for all civilian deaths, Guterres said acknowledging "serious violations" had been perpetrated by both Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Against that backdrop the UN leader has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire, but talks overseen by the United States, Egypt and Qatar remain deadlocked, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of resisting a deal.</p>

<p>"They are endless," Guterres said of the talks, saying it would be "very difficult" to reach a compromise but that he remained hopeful.</p>

<p>With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refusing to return his calls since October, Guterres is not counting on a breakthrough during the General Assembly's high-level week from Sunday when he would typically receive all visiting heads of state and government.</p>

<p>"As far as I understand, it was already said publicly that it is not his intention to ask for any meeting with me. So of course, the meeting will very probably not take place," Guterres said, brushing off the apparent snub.</p>

<p>- 'Very strange' -</p>

<p>"What matters is not the question of a phone call or no phone call, a meeting or no meeting -- what matters is what happens on the ground. What matters is the suffering of people.</p>

<p>"What matters is the constant denial of the two-state solution and the undermining of that two-state solution by the different actions that are taking place on the grounds.</p>

<p>"With grabbing of land, with evictions, with the new settlements being built -- all illegally and in the context of an occupation that now, according to the International Court of Justice's opinion, is in itself also illegal."</p>

<p>He also said a proposed surveillance mission he backed to oversee any future ceasefire looked "improbable", with all sides unlikely to sign up.</p>

<p>UN missions require the agreement of the host countries.</p>

<p>It was partly for this reason that almost a year ago, the Security Council mandated a multinational mission, led by Kenya, not the UN, to help police in gang-plagued Haiti where blue helmets are reviled.</p>

<p>But with only a few hundred police officers deployed and the mission lacking funds, Washington has raised the specter of transforming it into a UN mission -- something that the Security Council could only do at Haiti's request.</p>

<p>"I find it very strange that it's so difficult to fund a relatively small police operation in Haiti," he said.</p>

<p>"I find it absolutely unacceptable."</p>

<p>Responding to accusations the UN is powerless to curb conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere, he blamed member states -- particularly the Security Council and its 15 members -- for the decisions taken or not taken.</p>

<p>The Security Council as well as international financial institutions are "outdated, are dysfunctional and are unfair," he said.</p>

<p>"We have been trying to solve the wars, the problem is that we have not the power, sometimes we don't even have the resources, to be able to do so."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Secret Service said on Monday it was aware of a post by billionaire Elon Musk's on the X social media platform musing about a lack of assassination attempts on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk, who owns the platform, formerly known as Twitter, put up the post after a man suspected of planning to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his golf course in West Palm Beach was arrested on Sunday.</p>

<p>A Trump supporter and the CEO of Tesla, Musk wrote on Sunday: "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala," a post he ended with an emoji of a face with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>He was quickly criticized by X users from the left and right, who said they were concerned his words to his nearly 200 million X followers could incite violence against Biden and Harris.</p>

<p>Musk deleted the post but not before the Secret Service, tasked with protecting current and former presidents, vice presidents and other notable officials, took notice.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence," a spokesperson told Reuters in an email. "We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees."</p>

<p>The spokesperson declined to specify whether the agency had reached out to Musk, who seemed to suggest in follow-up posts that he had been making a joke.</p>

<p>"Well, one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X," he wrote. "Turns out that jokes are WAY less funny if people don't know the context and the delivery is plain text."</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat running against the Republican Trump in the 2024 election, and Biden both issued statements on Sunday night expressing relief that Trump had not been harmed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards top commander Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Asif Merchant, 46, entered his plea to one count of attempting to commit terrorism across national boundaries and one count of murder for hire at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The judge ordered that Merchant be detained pending trial.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors say Merchant spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States to recruit people for the plot.</p>

<p>Merchant told a confidential informant he also planned to steal documents from one target and organize protests in the United States, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The defendant named Donald Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Court papers do not name the alleged targets, and no attacks were made. As president, Trump had in 2020 approved the drone strike on Soleimani.</p>

<p>There are no suggestions that Merchant was tied to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course on Sunday, or a separate shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>Merchant wore an olive-colored prison T-shirt on top of an orange undershirt to his hearing, and sported a salt-and-pepper beard.</p>

<p>He is being held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, following his July 15 arrest in Texas.</p>

<p>Defense lawyer Avraham Moskowitz objected at the hearing to the jail conditions.</p>

<p>He said Merchant was being held in isolation, had been allowed out for exercise only once in two months, and had lost 15 to 20 pounds (6.8 to 9.1 kg) because jail officials would not serve a halal diet appropriate for a Shi'ite Muslim.</p>

<p>"It is literally torture," Moskowitz said.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Sara Winik said she would speak with the Bureau of Prisons to ensure Merchant received an adequate diet.</p>

<p>The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations said in August that the "modus operandi" described in Merchant's court papers ran contrary to Tehran's policy of "legally prosecuting the murder of General Soleimani."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Denouncing the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likened the court's arrest warrant against him to the infamous Dreyfus trial of 1894.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Denouncing the International Criminal Court (ICC), Israeli Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> likened the court's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/world-leaders-split-as-icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-netanyahu-7075339" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">arrest warrant</a> against him to the infamous Dreyfus trial of 1894. &nbsp;The Dreyfus trial, which began in 1894, involved a Jewish French army officer falsely accused of treason based on fabricated evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ICC's move accuses Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant of war crimes in the ongoing Gaza conflict, a decision Netanyahu lambasted as "anti-Semitic" and reflective of a "modern-day Dreyfus trial."</p>

<p>"The anti-Semitic decision of the International Criminal Court is comparable to a modern-day Dreyfus trial - and it will end in the same way," Netanyahu declared, referring to the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French army officer, in a landmark case that exposed deep anti-Semitism in late 19th-century France.</p>

<p>The Dreyfus Affair was one of the most controversial legal scandals of 19th-century France, marked by anti-Semitism and judicial corruption. Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jewish army captain, was wrongfully convicted of treason in 1894 based on fabricated evidence. Stripped of his rank in a humiliating public ceremony and exiled to Devil's Island, a former penal colony in french Guayana, Dreyfus's plight became a symbol of systemic injustice and anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>French authorities accused Dreyfus of leaking military secrets based on a scrap of handwriting vaguely resembling his own. The trial, fueled by rampant anti-Semitism, resulted in a conviction despite evidence pointing to another officer, Ferdinand Esterhazy, as the true culprit. The case divided France, with prominent intellectuals like Émile Zola denouncing the injustice in his famous open letter, J'accuse...!</p>

<p>The ICC has issued warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza following Hamas's brutal October 7 attacks on Israel. These attacks, which left over 1,400 Israelis dead and led to the kidnapping of hundreds, triggered a massive Israeli military response, resulting in immense loss of life and devastation in Gaza. The warrants mark the first time an Israeli head of state has been targeted by the court.</p>

<p>Netanyahu rejected the ICC's actions as "absurd and false," accusing Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan of corruption and alleging the decision was an attempt to distract from accusations of sexual harassment against Khan - charges Khan has denied. Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the ICC's move as a "dark day for justice," while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the court had "lost all legitimacy."</p>

<p>Human rights group B'Tselem, however, welcomed the ICC's actions, urging international enforcement of the warrants. The group called the warrants "a critical step toward accountability for leaders responsible for crimes committed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler will step down as Wall Street's top regulator at the end of the Joe Biden administration, he said.</p>

<p>"Gensler has been coy about when he planned to leave the SEC but was expected to depart before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. He will serve through noon on January 20, when Trump is set to become President," reported The Wall Street Journal on Thursday about the move.</p>

<p>"Gensler's decision to remain until the very end of the Biden administration probably disappoints some Republicans who wanted to see him leave sooner. It means he could try to push through some additional measures since Democrats will retain a majority on the five-member SEC as long as he stays," it noted.</p>

<p>Gensler presided over a hyperactive period in SEC rulemaking, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Wall Street groups challenged many of the regulations he pushed through including a rule that would have imposed new transparency requirements on private equity managers.</p>

<p>A court also rejected a regulation that Gensler backed that tried to overhaul how companies do stock buybacks.</p>

<p>Gensler previously worked for Goldman Sachs and has led the Biden-Harris transition's Federal Reserve, Banking, and Securities Regulators agency review team.</p>

<p>Prior to his appointment, he was a professor of Practice of Global Economics and Management at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders "outrageous" in a statement Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence -- none -- between Israel and Hamas," Biden said after the international tribunal issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security," the president added.</p>

<p>In an earlier statement, the White House said it "fundamentally rejects" the calls for arrests.</p>

<p>"We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision. The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter," a National Security Council spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The statement made no mention of an ICC arrest warrant also issued for Mohammed Deif, the military chief of Hamas.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor under US president-elect Donald Trump's administration, defended Israel and promised a "strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January."</p>

<p>"The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the US government," Waltz said on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His comments reflected a wider outrage among Republicans, with some calling for the US Senate to sanction the ICC, which counts 124 national members who are in theory obliged to arrest individuals subject to warrants.</p>

<p>Neither the United States nor Israel is a member of the ICC and both have rejected its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Hague-based court said Thursday that the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued "for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued for Deif, whom Israel claimed was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July. Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In the last 20 years, just a little more than 50 face transplants have been performed worldwide, which makes Mr Pfaff's operation a rare success.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in the US state of Michigan has become one of just several dozen people in the world to successfully receive a face transplant. Derek Pfaff, 30, attempted to kill himself but miraculously survived and now has a second crack at life, following a life-changing surgery. Mr Pfaff underwent the complex procedure that lasted more than 50 hours and involved at least 80 healthcare professionals at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester earlier this year, according to an announcement published.</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, just a little more than 50 face transplants have been performed worldwide, which makes Mr Pfaff's operation a rare success. Prior to the operation at Mayo Clinic, Mr Pfaff had undergone 58 reconstructive facial surgeries in 10 years but remained unable to eat solid food or speak casually with friends and family. Since he had no nose, Mr Pfaff could not wear glasses either.</p>

<p>"After my last surgery, the doctor told my parents that there's nothing more he could do except refer us to a place to get a face transplant. This surgery has transformed my life. I feel so much more confident," Mr Pfaff said in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-dereks-story-just-another-face-in-the-crowd/" rel="noindex, nofollow">video </a>shared by the clinic.</p>

<p>"I'm also going to keep sharing my story with others to help as many people as I can. I lived for a reason. I want to help others. I am so grateful to my donor, his family and my care team at Mayo Clinic for giving me this second chance."</p>

<p>As per the doctors, approximately 85 per cent of Mr Pfaff's face has been reconstructed and replaced with donor tissue. Upper and lower eyelids, upper and lower jaws, teeth, nose, cheek structure and neck skin are some of the parts that have been reconstructed.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/distressed-uk-vet-dies-by-suicide-after-rich-clients-euthanise-their-pets-to-save-money-7054349" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Distressed UK Vet Dies By Suicide After Rich Clients Euthanise Their Pets To Save Money</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Pfaff's suicide attempt</strong></h3>

<p>The son of Jerry and Lisa Pfaff, Mr Pfaff was a straight-A student and captain and star running back on the school's only state championship football team. However, on the fateful night of March 5, 2014, Mr Pfaff, then 19, decided to take his own life while at home during college spring break.</p>

<p>"I don't remember anything. I don't remember getting the gun, going outside, shooting myself or the weeks afterwards," said Mr Pfaff.</p>

<p>Shortly after 1:30 am, Mr Jerry found the family's gun cabinet open and soon found his son, lying on a snowbank, next to the garage. He was rushed to the hospital where he eventually regained consciousness.</p>

<p>"He does not remember getting the gun. He does not remember going outside. He does not remember shooting himself," said Ms Pfaff. "We met with the doctors, and they told us that there was no way Derek was going to make it."</p>

<p>But Derek did survive. "It's a miracle he lived," Ms Pfaff says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump tapped Pam Bondi, a staunch ally who helped defend the ex-leader against impeachment, as US attorney general on Thursday following firebrand Matt Gaetz's withdrawal from the running.</p>

<p>Gaetz's retreat amid sexual misconduct allegations signaled limits to Trump's power, even as the president-elect prepares to retake the White House with his Republican Party also in control of both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>The nomination of Bondi, a former Florida attorney general who served as a surrogate during the 2024 campaign and pushed to de-legitimize vote counting in swing state Pennsylvania in 2020, could be seen as a useful tool for Trump in his attempt to settle personal grievances.</p>

<p>"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans -- Not anymore," Trump wrote on his Truth Social network in announcing Bondi's nomination.</p>

<p>Bondi, 59, was a member of Trump's legal team during his first Senate impeachment trial, in which he was alleged to have pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, using aid as leverage, to hand over political dirt on Biden.</p>

<p>"Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again," Trump wrote, adding that she is "smart and tough, and is an AMERICA FIRST Fighter."</p>

<p>Trump has made several eye-catching selections for top roles, including Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and billionaire Elon Musk to head a government cost-cutting unit.</p>

<p>The exit of Gaetz, 42, was the first setback for Trump and Vice-president elect JD Vance in placing key allies in top positions, but his confirmation by the Senate was widely seen as doomed due to lack of support from fellow Republicans.</p>

<h3><strong>Ethics probe</strong></h3>

<p>A congressional panel has been investigating alleged illegal activity by Gaetz, including sexual contact with a 17-year-old girl -- which he denies -- as well as drug use and misappropriating campaign funds.</p>

<p>"I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday," Gaetz said on X.</p>

<p>"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition."</p>

<p>Gaetz was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2016 and won reelection recently, but he resigned as a congressman shortly after Trump picked him to be attorney general.</p>

<p>"Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do," Trump said in response to his withdrawal.</p>

<p>The ethics probe into Gaetz, a deeply polarizing Florida congressman, was effectively ended after he resigned from the House.</p>

<p>Gaetz is known as a political disruptor who earned the enmity of some House colleagues, including by engineering the ouster of fellow Republican Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year.</p>

<p>The latest transition upheaval ahead of Trump's inauguration on January 20 came as new lurid details emerged about defense secretary nominee Hegseth.</p>

<p>He was investigated for sexual assault after a complaint from an unnamed woman at a 2017 conference in California.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported details from the police investigation, which was closed without Hegseth being charged.</p>

<p>The married woman told officers that her memory of the episode was hazy and thought her drink might have been spiked, while Hegseth said the encounter was consensual.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

The post claims she was a successful businesswoman in Bangladesh, with Muslim tenants. The post further alleges that a group of 35 radicals forcibly took over her house and raped her. &nbsp;Let's verify the truth behind the video in this article.</p>

<p>The archived post can be found <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/cda6fb1b-8f15-449e-9c73-3f6ba3537b5f" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Video shows a Hindu woman who was allegedly raped by some Muslims in Bangladesh and took over her house.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong>: The woman in the video is 'Kohinoor Akhtar,' a member of the Bangladesh Krishak League affiliated with the Bangladesh Awami League led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. She is a Muslim woman. On 10 November 2024, she attended a protest where she was attacked. The viral visuals are from that incident. There is no truth in the claim that she was raped. Hence, the claim made in the post is <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>

<p>A reverse image search of the keyframes from the viral video led us to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkHUyq1_HvA" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/4c1f01f5-cc31-4266-8959-df994c1ac920" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">archived link</a>) dated 11 November 2024, featuring a similar clip. The video's title identifies the woman in the footage as Kohinoor Begum, a member of the Bangladesh Krishak League.</p>

<p>Taking a clue from the description a Google keyword search led to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/krishakleague.diary/videos/440248262139840/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">video</a> (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/dda482f8-d794-46af-b67d-b165da98b23e" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">archived link</a>) on the Krishak League's Facebook page. According to the post, the woman in the video is Kohinoor, a member of the Bangladesh Krishak League. The post claimed that she was attacked by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) during an event held on 10 November 2024 to commemorate Shaheed Noor Hussain Day. The Bangladesh Krishak League also claimed in the post that she was arrested.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has unveiled his latest merchandising venture, a line of branded acoustic and electric guitars, some of which are autographed. According to the 'Trump Guitars' website, four different Trump-branded guitars are for sale - The "American Eagle Series," the "Presidential Series," the "Signature Edition" and "God Bless The USA". "Coming Soon! The Limited Edition '45' Guitar. Only 1,300 of each Acoustic and Electric Guitars MADE - Some personally signed!" Mr Trump announced on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, accompanied by a photograph of himself brandishing one of the instruments.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="truthsocial-embed" src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113516618080692655/embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600"></iframe><script src="https://truthsocial.com/embed.js" async="async"></script></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://gettrumpguitars.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow">site</a>, the "American Eagle Series" includes acoustic and electric guitars - with 1,000 of each available for purchase at $1,250 and $1,500, respectively. The guitars feature the image of the American flag, a bald eagle and writing along the guitar's neck that reads, "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN". Some of the guitars are signed by Mr Trump, and they will cost buyers $10,000. Only 275 are available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These beautiful guitars feature the iconic phrase 'Make America Great Again' inlaid in authentic pearl up the neck of the guitar and the number 45 on the headstock signifying President Donald J Trump's historic term as president," the website states, promising that all orders will "arrive in time for Christmas".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first 1,000 "Presidential Series" guitars will be numbered and sold for $2,000, while an unspecified number of "God Bless The USA" acoustic guitars are available for $1,000, per the website.</p>

<p>Notably, the President-elect has advertised several pieces of merch during his campaign. In September, he unveiled a series of watches valued at $100,000. He has also promoted $100 silver coins and 1,000 pairs of limited edition shoes, in addition to $60 Trump-branded Bibles, cologne, perfume and NFT cards. In 2023, he offered a "Mugshot Edition" of digital trading cards featuring a bonus offer for a piece of his suit from his Fulton County, Georgia Mug shot and a dinner with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September, <em>CNN </em>reported that Mr Trump's foray into merchandising has seen financial success. His $60 Bible reportedly generated around $399,000 in sales. The limited edition sneakers sold out, yielding at least $399,000 in revenue. However, the most lucrative of his ventures has been the NFTs, which netted him approximately $7.2 million in licensing fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The star, identified as WOH G64, is located 160,000 light-years from us in the Large Magellanic Cloud and is on the verge of dying.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have successfully captured the first detailed image of a dying star outside our Milky Way galaxy, wrapped in a strange, egg-shaped cocoon. The star, identified as WOH G64, is located 160,000 light-years from us in the Large Magellanic Cloud and is surrounded by a plume of gas and dust -- suggesting it was in the final stage of its life. During a star's last phase, it transforms into a red supergiant before dying in a huge cosmic explosion, known as a supernova.</p>

<p>"For the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star in a galaxy outside our own Milky Way," said Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist from Universidad Andr&amp;#233;s Bello in Chile and the lead author of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/11/aa51820-24/aa51820-24.html#S2" rel="noindex, nofollow">study</a>.</p>

<p>WOH G64 was captured using the GRAVITY instrument at the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). With a size roughly 2000 times that of our Sun, WOH G64 provides insights into the lifecycle of a star and how it goes out with a fascinating bang.</p>

<p>"We discovered an egg-shaped cocoon closely surrounding the star. We are excited because this may be related to the drastic ejection of material from the dying star before a supernova explosion," Mr Ohnaka added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/milky-way-blasts-neighbouring-galaxys-mass-like-a-giant-hairdryer-nasas-hubble-reveals-7024371" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Milky Way Blasts Neighbouring Galaxy's Mass Like A 'Giant Hairdryer', Hubble Finds</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Years of research</strong></h3>

<p>Scientists have been interested in the red supergiant for nearly two decades. In 2005 and 2007, Mr Ohnaka and his team used ESO's VLTI in Chile's Atacama Desert to learn more about the star's features and carried on studying it in the years since. However, an actual image of the star remained elusive. To click the first, detailed image, the team had to wait for the development of one of the VLTI's second-generation instruments.</p>

<p>"Massive stars explode with an energy equivalent to the Sun shining for all of its 10 billion years of life. People have seen these supernova explosions, and astronomers have found some of the stars that exploded in older images. But we have never seen a star change in a way that signals its imminent death."</p>

<p>The researchers believe that the gas and dust around the star, also known as shed material, might be responsible for the dimming and for the unexpected shape of the cocoon around the star. The new image shows that the cocoon is stretched out, which surprised scientists, who expected a different shape based on previous observations and computer models.</p>

<p>The team believes that the cocoon's egg-like shape could be explained by either the star's shedding or by the influence of a yet-undiscovered companion star.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US billionaire Elon Musk, owner of social media platform X, has criticised Australia's proposed law to ban social media for children under 16 and fine social media platforms of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million) for companies for systemic breaches.</p>

<p>Australia's centre-left government on Thursday introduced the bill in parliament. It plans to try an age-verification system to enforce a social media age cut-off, some of the toughest controls imposed by any country to date.</p>

<p>"Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians," Musk, who views himself as a champion of free speech, said in a reply late on Thursday to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's post on X about the bill.</p>

<p>Several countries have already vowed to curb social media use by children through legislation, but Australia's policy could become one of the most stringent with no exemption for parental consent and pre-existing accounts.</p>

<p>France last year proposed a ban on social media for those under 15 but allowed parental consent, while the US has for decades required technology companies to seek parental consent to access the data of children under 13.</p>

<p>Musk has previously clashed with Australia's centre-left Labor government over its social media policies and had called it "fascists" over its misinformation law.</p>

<p>In April, X went to an Australian court to challenge a cyber regulator's order for the removal of some posts about the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, prompting Albanese to call Musk an "arrogant billionaire".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has accused the United States of ramping up tension and provocations, saying the Korean peninsula has never faced such risks of nuclear war as now, state media KCNA said on Friday.</p>

<p>In a speech at a military exhibition on Thursday in Pyongyang, Kim said his previous experience of negotiations with Washington only highlighted its "aggressive and hostile" policy against Pyongyang, KCNA said.</p>

<p>"Never before have the warring parties on the Korean peninsula faced such a dangerous and acute confrontation that it could escalate into the most destructive thermonuclear war," Kim said, according to KCNA.</p>

<p>"We have already gone as far as we can on negotiating with the United States, but what we became certain of from the result is not the superpower's willingness to coexist, but its thorough stance of power and aggressive and hostile policy toward us that can never change."</p>

<p>During US President-elect Donald Trump's first term, he and Kim held three unprecedented meetings in Singapore, Hanoi, and at the Korean border in 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>But their diplomacy failed to achieve any concrete outcome due to differences between US calls for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and Kim's demands for sanctions relief.</p>

<p>Trump has long touted his ties with Kim, saying last month that the two countries "would've had a nuclear war with millions of people killed" but he stopped it thanks to their relationship.</p>

<p>North Korean state media has not yet publicly mentioned Trump's reelection.</p>

<p>Kim, in the speech, called for developing and upgrading weaponry into "ultra-modern ones" and vowed to continue advancing defence capabilities to bolster the country's strategic position, KCNA said.</p>

<p>The event, called the Defence Development Exhibition, featured strategic and tactical weapons.</p>

<p>Kim's latest speech came amid international criticism over increasingly deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow, with North Korea having sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last week, Kim urged the country's military to improve capabilities for fighting a war, blaming the United States and its allies for stoking tension to "the worst phase in history" and calling the Korean peninsula "the world's biggest hotspot."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon said Israeli strikes Thursday on the country's east and south killed 52 people, as raids also hit south Beirut and Hezbollah claimed its deepest attack on Israel in over a year.</p>

<p>More than 11 months of cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the Gaza conflict escalated into all-out war in September, with Israel conducting an extensive bombing campaign, primarily targeting Hezbollah strongholds, and sending ground troops into southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Israeli enemy strikes that targeted the Baalbek district" in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley left "40 dead and 52 wounded", a health ministry statement said, listing tolls for 10 different locations.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) said a couple and their four children were killed in a strike on a house in the village of Maqneh, while another couple and their young daughter were among 11 people killed in a raid on nearby Nabha.</p>

<p>The ministry also reported "seven dead and 24 wounded" in "Israeli enemy strikes" on south Lebanon's Nabatiyeh district, and "five dead and 26 wounded" in strikes elsewhere in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>In Israel, first responders said a man was killed after rocket fire from Lebanon hit the Galilee region in the country's north.</p>

<p>In Beirut's southern suburbs, the NNA reported at least 12 strikes throughout Thursday, after relative calm while US envoy Amos Hochstein visited earlier this week, seeking to broker an end to the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee on social media platform X issued several rounds of evacuation warnings for Beirut's southern suburbs, as well as areas in and around the southern coastal city of Tyre, but none for east Lebanon.</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed columns of smoke rising from the southern suburbs, usually a densely populated residential district but now largely emptied.</p>

<p><strong>Khiam&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Adraee said on X that the Israeli military "targeted a weapons depot, a command headquarters and terrorist infrastructure" belonging to Hezbollah in south Beirut.</p>

<p>Amid a series of attack claims, Hezbollah said its fighters targeted "the Hatzor air base" near Israel's southern city of Ashdod, around 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Lebanon's southern border, "with a missile salvo" -- its deepest target in more than a year of hostilities.</p>

<p>In 10 separate statements, Iran-backed Hezbollah said its fighters also targeted Israeli troops in and near the south Lebanon town of Khiam, including with artillery, rockets and drones.</p>

<p>The NNA said "the enemy army" was "blowing up homes and residential buildings during its incursion into the town".</p>

<p>Lebanon's official news agency and Hezbollah have reported fighting and air strikes in the Khiam area ever since Israeli ground troops first entered Lebanon on September 30.</p>

<p>Earlier Thursday, United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert visited Baalbek's UNESCO-listed archaeological area, after the UN's cultural body this week granted more than 30 heritage sites in Lebanon "provisional enhanced protection" amid the war.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Thursday that at least 3,583 people had been killed in the violence since October 2023. Most of the deaths have been since September this year.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Wednesday that three soldiers were killed in south Lebanon, bringing to 52 the number killed in Lebanon since the start of ground operations.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the conflict in Ukraine had characteristics of a "global" war and did not rule out strikes on Western countries.</p>

<p>The Kremlin strongman spoke out after a day of frayed nerves, with Russia test-firing a new generation intermediate-range missile at Ukraine -- which Putin hinted was capable of unleashing a nuclear payload.</p>

<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky branded the strike a major ramping up of the "scale and brutality" of the war by a "crazy neighbour", while Kyiv's main backer the United States said that Russia was to blame for escalating the conflict "at every turn".</p>

<p>Intermediate-range missiles typically have a reach of up to 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles) -- enough to make good on Putin's threat of striking the West.</p>

<p>In a defiant address to the nation, Russia's president railed at Ukraine's allies granting permission for Kyiv to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets on Russian territory, warning of retaliation.</p>

<p>In recent days Ukraine has fired US and UK-supplied missiles at Russian territory for the first time, escalating already sky-high tensions in the brutal nearly three-year-long conflict.</p>

<p>"We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our facilities," Putin said.</p>

<p>He said the US-sent Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and British Storm Shadow payloads were shot down by Moscow's air defences, adding: "The goals that the enemy obviously set were not achieved".</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov did however say Moscow informed Washington of the missile's launch half an hour before it was fired through an automatic nuclear de-escalation hotline, in remarks cited in state media.</p>

<p>He earlier said Russia was doing everything to avoid an atomic conflict, having updated its nuclear doctrine this week.</p>

<p>White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Washington saw no need to modify the United States' own nuclear posture in response.</p>

<p><strong>'Reckless behaviour'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Ukraine had earlier accused Russia of firing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time in history -- a claim later downplayed by Washington.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian air force said Moscow had launched the missile as part of a barrage towards Dnipro, where local authorities said an infrastructure facility was hit and two civilians were wounded.</p>

<p>Putin said that Russia had carried out "testing in combat conditions of one of the newest Russian... missile systems" named "Oreshnik".</p>

<p>Criticising the global response to the strike -- "final proof that Russia definitely does not want peace" -- Zelensky warned that other countries could become targets for Putin too.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to urge Russia to a true peace, which is possible only through force," the Ukrainian leader said in his evening address.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, there will be relentless Russian strikes, threats and destabilisation, and not only against Ukraine."</p>

<p>The attack on Dnipro comes just days after several foreign embassies shuttered temporarily in the Ukrainian capital, citing the threat of a large-scale strike.</p>

<p>"It is another example of reckless behaviour from Russia," a spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters.</p>

<p>The spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Stephane Dujarric, said the new missile's deployment was "another concerning and worrying development," warning the war was "going in the wrong direction".</p>

<p>Yet a US official played down the threat, saying on condition of anonymity that Russia "likely possesses only a handful of these" experimental missiles.</p>

<p><strong>UK 'directly involved'</strong></p>

<p>The head of the Dnipropetrovsk region where the city of Dnipro is located said the Russian aerial bombardment damaged a rehabilitation centre and several homes, as well as an industrial enterprise.</p>

<p>"Two people were wounded -- a 57-year-old man was treated on the scene and a 42-year-old woman was hospitalised," said the official, Sergiy Lysak.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have escalated their use of long-range missiles in recent days since Washington gave Kyiv permission to use its ATACMS against military targets inside Russia -- a long-standing Ukrainian request.</p>

<p>British media meanwhile reported on Wednesday that Kyiv had launched UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Russia after being given the green light from London.</p>

<p>With ranges of 300 and 250 kilometres respectively, both missile systems' reach is far dwarfed by the experimental intermediate-range system fired by Russia.</p>

<p>Russia's envoy to London on Thursday said that meant Britain was "now directly involved" in the Ukraine war, with Andrei Kelin telling Sky News "this firing cannot happen" without UK and NATO support.</p>

<p>But the White House's Jean-Pierre countered that it was Russia who was behind the rising tensions, pointing to the reported deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to help Moscow fight off a Ukrainian offensive in Russia's border Kursk region.</p>

<p>"The escalation at every turn is coming from Russia," Jean-Pierre said, adding that the United States had warned Moscow against involving "another country in another part of the world" -- referring to Pyongyang.</p>

<p><strong>Kyiv in retreat</strong></p>

<p>The defence ministry in Moscow said Thursday its air-defence systems had downed two Storm Shadows, without saying whether they had come down on Russian territory or in occupied Ukraine.</p>

<p>The missile escalation is coming at a critical moment on the ground for Ukraine, as its defences buckle under Russian pressure across the sprawling front line.</p>

<p>Russia claimed deeper advances in the war-battered Donetsk region, announcing on Thursday that its forces had captured another village close to Kurakhove, closing in on the town after months of steady advances.</p>

<p>Moscow's defence ministry said Russian forces had taken the small village of Dalne, five kilometres (three miles) south of Kurakhove.</p>

<p>Lysak, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said that 26 people had been wounded in another strike on the town of Kryvyi Rig, where Zelensky was born.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Efforts by US antitrust regulators to break up Alphabet by forcing a sale of its Google Chrome browser and other proposals to limit its search dominance are likely to run into legal challenges on grounds the remedies are extreme.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Efforts by US antitrust regulators to break up Alphabet by forcing a sale of its Google Chrome browser and other proposals to limit its search dominance are likely to run into legal challenges on grounds the remedies are extreme.</p>

<p>After a ruling in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, US Department of Justice prosecutors argued to a judge on Wednesday that the company must sell Chrome, share data and search results with rivals and possibly sell its Android smartphone software.</p>

<p>Alphabet shares fell as much as 7%, on track for their biggest daily percentage decline since January 31.</p>

<p>The proposals are part of a landmark case aimed at reshaping how users find information. But a new pro-business administration of President-elect Donald Trump next year could change that effort and legal proceedings could last years, experts said.</p>

<p>"It would strike me as an over-ask," said Kevin Walkush at Jensen Investment Management, which holds Google stock and is skeptical a Chrome divestiture will happen. "You ask for everything possible, not necessarily with an eye towards what would be probable and proportional, and then see what sticks."</p>

<p>The DOJ sought and won a breakup of Microsoft in the early 2000s after alleging it illegally monopolized the web browser market. That ruling was overturned by an appeals court, and Microsoft and the DOJ eventually settled.</p>

<p>Walkush expects the Google case to take years to play out as the company appeals. "The wheels of justice do not turn quickly," he said.</p>

<p>Google called the DOJ's approach "unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses," giving as examples diminished user privacy and less funding for companies such as browser maker Mozilla when they feature Google search.</p>

<p>The case could also face challenges from Trump.</p>

<p>While Trump's administration originally filed the search case against Google during his first term, he indicated in October he might not break up the company because it could hurt the American tech industry at a time competition is heating up with China in areas including AI.</p>

<p>Representatives for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p><strong>'SUBSTANTIAL HEADWINDS'</strong></p>

<p>Chrome, the most widely used web browser, is a pillar of Google's business, providing the company with valuable user data that helps it target ads. The search ads business brought in more than half of Alphabet's total revenue of $88.3 billion in the latest quarter.</p>

<p>The value of Chrome, estimated to hold about two-thirds of the global browser market, diminishes sharply as a standalone browser.</p>

<p>"The reason why it's valuable to Google is because Google uses it to enhance its ad business and its search business," said Megan Gray, former general counsel at search rival DuckDuckGO who has also worked as an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission. "If you don't have those, then Chrome would just be a data broker."</p>

<p>A forced sale would not address several key issues raised in the DOJ lawsuit, including a search monopoly, critics say. US antitrust enforcers, who are also pursuing Apple and Amazon in other monopoly cases, would have to approve any potential Chrome buyer.</p>

<p>"DOJ will face substantial headwinds with this remedy," because Chrome can run search engines other than Google, said Gus Hurwitz, senior fellow and academic director at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. "Courts expect any remedy to have a causal connection to the underlying antitrust concern. Divesting Chrome does absolutely nothing to address this concern."</p>

<p>The DOJ proposed a blanket ban on Google offering incentives to give its search engine preferential treatment. That would include Google's lucrative partnership with Apple, where it pays the smartphone maker billions of dollars annually to make Google Search the default on Apple smartphones.</p>

<p>Evercore analysts called the proposed curbs "draconian."</p>

<p>Given Google Search's popularity, Apple is likely to continue with Google as the default search engine even without any agreement or payments, Hurwitz said.</p>

<p>DOJ's proposals also include demands for Google to license search results at a nominal cost and share the user data it gathers with competitors for free.</p>

<p>DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria said it was harder to ascertain the impact of Google having to open up its search data until the terms are clearer. The Center for Journalism &amp; Liberty said Google licensing its search data would be "transformative" for news publishers because it would help them better understand their audiences.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN nuclear watchdog's board of governors passed a resolution chiding Iran's poor cooperation with the agency after hours of heated exchanges, diplomats told AFP late on Thursday.</p>

<p>The censure motion brought by Britain, France, Germany and the United States at the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation board follows a similar one in June.</p>

<p>But it comes as tensions run high over Iran's atomic programme, with critics fearing that Tehran is attempting to develop a nuclear weapon -- which the Islamic Republic denies.</p>

<p>The resolution -- which China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against -- was carried by 19 votes in favour, with 12 countries abstaining from the vote, two diplomats told AFP.</p>

<p>Ahead of Thursday's vote, the United States and its European allies sought to rally support for their resolution by denouncing Iran.</p>

<p>In its national statement to the board, Washington said that Tehran's nuclear activities "remained deeply troubling", adding that the country's cooperation was falling "far short" of expectations.</p>

<p>European powers said Iran's "behaviour in the nuclear realm" still represented "a threat to international security".</p>

<p>"The international community must remain firm in its determination to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons," Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement.</p>

<p><strong>Differences laid bare&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The confidential resolution seen by AFP says it is "essential and urgent" for Iran to "act to fulfil its legal obligations".</p>

<p>The motion also calls on Tehran to provide "technically credible explanations" for the presence of uranium particles found at two undeclared locations in Iran.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Western powers are asking for a "comprehensive report" to be issued by the IAEA on Iran's nuclear efforts "at the latest" by spring 2025.</p>

<p>Since 2021, Tehran has significantly decreased its cooperation with the agency by deactivating surveillance devices to monitor the nuclear programme and barring UN inspectors.</p>

<p>At the same time, Iran has rapidly ramped up its nuclear activities, including by increasing its stockpiles of enriched uranium.</p>

<p>That has heightened fears that Tehran might be seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, which it denies.</p>

<p>The resolution comes just as IAEA head Rafael Grossi returned from a trip to Tehran last week, where he appeared to have made headway.</p>

<p>During the visit, Iran agreed to an IAEA demand to cap its sensitive stock of near weapons-grade uranium enriched up to 60 percent purity.</p>

<p>"This is a concrete step in the right direction," Grossi told reporters Wednesday, saying it was "the first time" Iran had made such a commitment since it started breaking away from its obligations under the nuclear deal.</p>

<p>The landmark 2015 deal, which curbed Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, fell apart three years later after the unilateral withdrawal by the United States under then-president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In retaliation, Tehran began gradually rolling back some of its commitments by increasing its uranium stockpiles and enriching beyond the 3.67 percent purity -- enough for nuclear power stations -- permitted under the deal.</p>

<p><strong>Potential to 'harm efforts'</strong></p>

<p>Although symbolic in nature at this stage, the censure motion is designed to raise diplomatic pressure on Iran.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the censure "will disrupt" interactions with the agency, but stressed Tehran would remain keen to cooperate.</p>

<p>Earlier, Araghchi had warned of a "proportionate" response by Iran if the board passes the resolution.</p>

<p>According to Heloise Fayet, a researcher at the French Institute of International Relations, the resolution has the potential to "harm Rafael Grossi's efforts".</p>

<p>"But Western powers are frustrated by the lack of effectiveness of his diplomatic manoeuvres and are looking for firmer solutions," she told AFP.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Grossi said he could "not exclude" that Iran's commitment to cap enrichment might falter "as a result of further developments".</p>

<p>Foreign policy expert Rahman Ghahremanpour said Tehran might retaliate to the new censure by "increasing the enrichment levels".</p>

<p>But he does not expect any drastic "strategic measures" as Iran does not want to "aggravate tensions" before Donald Trump returns to the White House.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian police on Thursday called for the indictment of ex-president Jair Bolsonaro over a 2022 "coup" plot to prevent current leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office.</p>

<p>A police statement said its investigators concluded that Bolsonaro and 36 others planned the "violent overthrow of the democratic state."</p>

<p>"Federal police concluded on Thursday the investigation into the existence of a criminal organization that acted in a coordinated way in 2002 in an attempt to maintain the then-president in power," the statement said.</p>

<p>"The final report has been sent to the Supreme Court with the request that 37 individuals be indicted for the crimes of the violent overthrow of the democratic state, coup d'etat and criminal organization," it said.</p>

<p>It is up to Brazil's attorney general to decide whether the allegations are substantiated enough to warrant criminal charges being laid. The charge of attempting a coup carries a sentence of up to 12 years in prison.</p>

<p>Bolsonaro vowed to "fight" the allegation, and accused the Supreme Court judge overseeing the case of overstepping the law.</p>

<p>"The fight begins at the Attorney General's office," Bolsonaro said on his X social media account.</p>

<p>The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, "leads the entire investigation, adjusts statements, arrests without charges, fishes for evidence and has a very creative advisory team. He does everything that the law does not say," Bolsonaro said.</p>

<p>According to police, the alleged plot was hatched in the final months of Bolsonaro's 2019-2022 presidency.</p>

<p>Lula, a left-winger who was previously president between 2003 and 2010, won October 2022 elections to succeed the far-right Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>The police statement did not draw a direct link between the alleged plot and an insurrection that took place in Brasilia on January 8, 2023, when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters entered the capital's presidential palace, the Congress building and the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Investigations continue into that upheaval, which echoed scenes from the United States two years earlier, when supporters of Donald Trump protesting President Joe Biden's election win attacked the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>Bolsonaro has expressed admiration for Trump in the past.</p>

<p>The list of alleged co-conspirators in the Bolsonaro case included the names of three elite soldiers and a police officer arrested on Tuesday for allegedly plotting to assassinate Lula and Moraes, in a separately announced case.</p>

<p><strong>Trump parallels&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Bolsonaro is the target of several investigations, but the one on Thursday placing him at the center of an alleged coup is the most dramatic.</p>

<p>He says he is innocent and the victim of "persecution."</p>

<p>A former army captain, Bolsonaro has already been declared ineligible to hold public office until 2030 for having made unsubstantiated claims of fraud in Brazil's electronic voting system.</p>

<p>He has been prohibited from leaving the country while a vast probe named "Tempus Veritatis" ("the time of truth" in Latin) continues. The investigation has already swept up several of Bolsonaro's closest aides.</p>

<p>Bolsonaro hopes to overturn the ineligibility ruling and attempt a comeback in 2026 presidential elections.</p>

<p>On X, he has posted parallels between his situation and that of Trump, who won over US voters this month to secure a return to the White House.</p>

<p>The police investigation calling for Bolsonaro's indictment detailed an alleged decree the ex-president was said to have given high-ranking military officers in December 2022 ordering them to arrest Moraes.</p>

<p>Moraes was head of the national electoral tribunal that validated Lula's victory in 2022.</p>

<p>That decree was confirmed by the military officers in police questioning, according to transcripts made public by Moraes, who is now in charge of the case at the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>According to a transcript released in March, a retired Brazilian army general, Marco Antonio Freire Gomes, had spoken to police investigators about the December 2022 meetings with Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>He said a Bolsonaro aide had seen legal opinions the then-president had had drawn up supporting his attempt to stay in power.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and its allies denounced the International Criminal Court's decision to issue an arrest warrant Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even as Turkey -- and rights groups - welcomed the move.</p>

<p>The court also issued warrants for Israel's former defence minister as well as Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>They were issued in response to accusations of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, set off by the Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p><strong>Israel: New 'Dreyfus trial'</strong></p>

<p>"The anti-Semitic decision of the International Criminal Court is comparable to the modern-day Dreyfus trial -- and it will end in the same way," Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>He was referring to the 19th-century Alfred Dreyfus affair in which a Jewish army captain was wrongly convicted of treason in France before being exonerated.</p>

<p><strong>US: 'Fundamentally rejects'</strong></p>

<p>The United States "fundamentally rejects" the ICC's decision and "we remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision", said a National Security Council spokesperson.</p>

<p>"The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter."</p>

<p><strong>Argentina: 'Deep disagreement'</strong></p>

<p>Argentina "declares its deep disagreement" with the decision, which "ignores Israel's legitimate right to self-defence against the constant attacks by terrorist organisations like Hamas and Hezbollah," President Javier Milei posted on X.</p>

<p><strong>Hamas: 'Justice'</strong></p>

<p>"(It's) an important step towards justice and can lead to redress for the victims in general, but it remains limited and symbolic if it is not supported by all means by all countries around the world," Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim said of the warrants against Israeli politicians.</p>

<p><strong>European Union: 'Binding'</strong></p>

<p>"It is not a political decision," said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, speaking during a visit to Jordan.</p>

<p>"It is a decision of a court, of a court of justice, of an international court of justice. And the decision of the court has to be respected and implemented."</p>

<p><strong>Israeli victims: 'Significant'</strong></p>

<p>"This arrest warrant against Mr Deif is massively significant," said Yael Vias Gvirsman, who represents 300 Israeli victims of the October 7 Hamas attacks.</p>

<p>"It means these victims' voices are being heard," she added, speaking from outside the court in The Hague.</p>

<p><strong>Palestinian Authority: 'Sign of hope'</strong></p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority, a rival of Hamas, said "the ICC's decision represents hope and confidence in international law and its institutions".</p>

<p>It urged ICC members to enforce "a policy of severing contact and meetings' with Netanyahu and Gallant.</p>

<p><strong>Amnesty International: 'Wanted man'</strong></p>

<p>"Prime Minister Netanyahu is now officially a wanted man," said Amnesty's Secretary General Agnes Callamard.</p>

<p>"ICC member states and the whole international community must stop at nothing until these individuals are brought to trial before the ICC's independent and impartial judges."</p>

<p><strong>Human Rights Watch: not 'beyond' the law</strong></p>

<p>"The ICC arrest warrants against senior Israeli leaders and a Hamas official break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law."</p>

<p><strong>Turkey: 'Positive decision'</strong></p>

<p>The ICC's decision "is a belated but positive decision to stop the bloodshed and put an end to the genocide in Palestine," Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan welcomed the warrants as "an extremely important step".</p>

<p><strong>Italy: 'Will evaluate'</strong></p>

<p>Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said his country would be obliged to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they visited, although he added he believed the ICC was "wrong" to put Netanyahu on the same level as Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>Spain: 'Respects the decision'</strong></p>

<p>Spain said it would follow the ruling, with official sources telling AFP the country "respects the decision and will conform to its commitments and obligations in compliance with the Rome Statute and international law".</p>

<p><strong>Norway: 'Confidence'</strong></p>

<p>"It is important that the ICC carries out its mandate in a judicious manner. I have confidence that the court will proceed with the case based on the highest fair trial standards," Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.</p>

<p><strong>Sweden: 'Independence and integrity'</strong></p>

<p>"Sweden and the EU support the important work of the court and safeguard its independence and integrity," Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lava flowing from Iceland's latest volcanic eruption on Thursday engulfed the main parking lot of one of Iceland's biggest tourist attractions, the evacuated Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, images showed.</p>

<p>A black and orange tongue of lava could be seen covering the area that used to provide parking for 350 cars as well as space for coaches.</p>

<p>A service building used to store visitors' luggage was also engulfed by lava, but there appeared to be no immediate threat to the hot pools as the lava was held back by a defensive wall.</p>

<p>Helga Arnadottir, head of sales, operations and services at the Blue Lagoon, told the daily Morgunbladid she did not know when the site would be able to reopen to visitors.</p>

<p>She added that officials were currently "assessing the situation".</p>

<p>The fishing village of Grindavik and the Blue Lagoon were evacuated late Wednesday after an eruption in the Sundhnukagigar volcanic fissure on the Reykjanes peninsula for the seventh time in a year.</p>

<p>Most of Grindavik's 4,000 residents were evacuated a year ago, shortly before the first volcanic eruption in the area.</p>

<p>Since then, almost all the houses have been sold to the state, with its residents gone.</p>

<p>"About 50 houses were occupied in recent nights," said the civil protection department.</p>

<p>Volcanoes on the peninsula had not erupted for eight centuries until March 2021 when a period of heightened seismic activity began.</p>

<p>Volcanologists have warned that volcanic activity in the region has entered a new era.</p>

<p>Iceland is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country.</p>

<p>It is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a fault in the ocean floor that separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates and causes earthquakes and eruptions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court over his conduct of the Gaza war would not stop him defending Israel.</p>

<p>"No outrageous anti-Israel decision will prevent us -- and it will not prevent me -- from continuing to defend our country in every way," Netanyahu said in a video statement. "We will not yield to pressure," he vowed.</p>

<p>The premier is accused alongside his former defence minister Yoav Gallant of "war crimes" and "crimes against humanity" for Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>

<p>He described Thursday's decision as a "dark day in the history of nations".</p>

<p>"The International Criminal Court in The Hague, which was established to protect humanity, has today become the enemy of humanity," he said, adding that the accusations were "utterly baseless".</p>

<p>Israel has been fighting in Gaza since October 2023, when a cross-border attack by Hamas militants resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Its retaliatory campaign has led to the deaths of 44,056 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>UN agencies have warned of a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, including possible famine, due to a lack of food and medicines.</p>

<p>The court said it had found "reasonable grounds" to believe Netanyahu and Gallant bore "criminal responsibility" for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare, as well as the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said the court was accusing Israel of "fictitious crimes", while ignoring "the real war crimes, horrific war crimes being committed against us and against many others around the world".</p>

<p>In addition to Netanyahu and Gallant, the court also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military wing chief Mohammed Deif, who Israel said was killed in an air strike last July.</p>

<p>Hamas has never confirmed his death.</p>

<p>Netanyahu mocked the court's decision to issue a warrant for "the body of Mohammed Deif."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said Thursday his country would be obliged to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visited, after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant.</p>

<p>The ICC earlier also issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu's former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>Crosetto -- whose country holds the G7 rotating presidency this year -- told RAI television's Porta a Porta programme that he believed the ICC was "wrong" to put Netanyahu and Gallant on the same level as Hamas.</p>

<p>But he said that if Netanyahu or Gallant "were to come to Italy, we would have to arrest them".</p>

<p>It was not a political choice but Italy was bound as a member of the ICC to act on the court's warrants, Crosetto said.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani had earlier been more cautious, saying: "We support the ICC, while always remembering that the court must play a legal role and not a political role.</p>

<p>"We will evaluate together with our allies what to do and how to interpret this decision."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

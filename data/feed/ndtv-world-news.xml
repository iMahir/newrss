       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Widespread anger among Arab Americans and Muslims over US support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon could cost Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, the election, Green Party candidate Jill Stein told Reuters on Sunday.</p>

<p>Polls show Harris and her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, in a tight race for the Nov. 5 election, with Stein garnering just 1% support nationally, as she did in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>But Stein has seen growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations that helped propel President Joe Biden to narrow victories in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Stein has sought the support of those groups, calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an immediate US arms embargo on Israel. An August poll by the Council on American Islamic Relations showed her taking support away from Harris in those swing states.</p>

<p>"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote," Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. "They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win."</p>

<p>She said Democrats could win back those voters if they enacted an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, and halted arms sales to Israel, but that there was no sign of such action.</p>

<p>The Biden administration, along with several US allies like France, has called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border and has been trying, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza for months.</p>

<p>Asked about her potential role as a "spoiler," taking votes from Harris and so helping Trump in those states, Stein said another Trump presidency would be "terrible" but so would four more years of Democratic rule, given high rental costs, the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and attacks on civil liberties.</p>

<p>"This is a very dire situation that will be continued under both Democrats and Republicans. So we say there is no lesser evil in this race," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic party called Stein "a spoiler candidate" with no path to victory.</p>

<p>"She put Donald Trump in the White House in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/defying-donald-trump-green-party-pursues-recounts-in-3-us-states-1634416"> 2016 </a>and she's ready to do it<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wisconsin-narrowly-won-by-donald-trump-agrees-to-recount-us-presidential-votes-1630415"> again</a>. A vote for Stein is a vote for Trump," said Adrienne Watson, senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>Harris has sought to ease the concerns of Arab American and Muslim voters, and met with a small group of local leaders in Flint, Michigan, on Friday.</p>

<p>Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action endorsed Harris last month, saying it disagreed with her position on the war in Gaza but that Trump posed a greater danger. A separate group called Arab Americans for Harris-Walz launched last week.</p>

<p>On Monday, a campaign group called "Abandon Harris" said it was endorsing Stein, citing a shared responsibility to stand against oppression "and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise."</p>

<p>Trump is also trying to woo Arab and Muslim voters and his campaign opened an office on Saturday in Hamtramck, a Detroit suburb whose Yemeni American mayor Amer Ghalib has endorsed him.</p>

<p>"For the Arab American and Muslim leaders in Detroit, the overwhelming choice is between Jill Stein and Donald Trump, and our argument is that there's only one person who's brought permanent peace to the region, and that's Donald Trump," said Richard Grenell, who has held dozens of meetings with these voters in Michigan, Arizona and other critical states.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic White House hopeful Kamala Harris said in an interview broadcast Monday that if elected president she would not meet with Vladimir Putin for peace talks if Ukraine was not also represented.</p>

<p>"Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine," the US vice president told CBS's "60 Minutes" program when asked if she would meet one-on-one with the Russian leader to negotiate an end to the war.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has previously rejected any talks with Putin.</p>

<p>Harris also reiterated her criticisms of Republican rival Donald <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/harris-trump-face-off-for-first-time-in-key-us-presidential-debate-6537401">Trump's policies</a> on Ukraine, describing them as a "surrender" to the invasion Moscow launched in February 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has previously been critical of Washington's massive military and financial aid for Ukraine and insisted that he could quickly reach a peace deal with Putin.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump, if he were president, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/putin-should-stop-interfering-in-us-elections-white-house-6499064">Putin</a> would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, 'Oh, he can end it on day one.' You know what that is? It's about surrender," she said.</p>

<p>Kyiv fears such a deal would involve ceding to Russia the territory in eastern Ukraine that it has captured since the invasion.</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile said she would deal with Ukraine's bid to join the NATO military alliance "if and when it arrives at that point."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk is ramping up his public support of Donald Trump, telling Tucker Carlson in a conversation streamed Monday that he is "all in" on the Republican presidential candidate.</p>

<p>After appearing alongside Trump at a weekend rally, the world's richest man used a cosy two-hour chat with Carlson to push right-wing talking points, including what he said was the threat to democracy if Democrat Kamala Harris prevails in November's election.</p>

<p>"My view is that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania-butler-assassination-site-2024-us-presidential-elections-6726322">if Trump doesn't win</a> this election, it's the last election we're going to have," the Tesla and SpaceX boss told former Fox News host Carlson.</p>

<p>Musk, who has increasingly courted controversy in recent years, said he believed "illegals" -- migrants -- were being deliberately transported to a handful of key states, where if they are eventually granted citizenship, they will become Democrat voters.</p>

<p>"Now these swing-state margins are sometimes ten- twenty-thousand votes. So what happens if you put hundreds of thousands of people into each swing state?</p>

<p>"So my prediction is, if there's another four years of a Dem administration, they will legalize so many illegals that... the next election there won't be any swing states, and this will be a single-party country."</p>

<p>The assertions from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-return-to-shooting-site-in-pennsylvania-elon-musk-to-attend-6712802">Musk</a> -- who is himself from South Africa -- are a common refrain on the political right, which alleges a conspiracy between Democrats and immigrants.</p>

<p>Musk is<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-elon-musk-changes-x-display-picture-to-show-support-for-donald-trump-6726978"> increasingly becoming</a> a surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail and is reportedly planning to make a number of stops in battleground states in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, he unveiled a program promising to pay $47 to anyone who registers voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p>The scheme is looking to copy successful referral programs the South African-born entrepreneur has used in the past with his Tesla electric cars.</p>

<p>In his nearly two-hour chat with Carlson, in which the two men chuckled repeatedly at each other's pronouncements, Musk said he had thrown his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-secretly-funded-right-wing-group-long-before-donald-trump-endorsement-sources-6706711">full backing</a> behind fellow billionaire Trump.</p>

<p>"If he loses, it's going to be hard for you to pretend you never supported him," said Carlson.</p>

<p>"I'm like, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/if-elected-to-power-will-appoint-elon-musk-to-lead-us-government-efficiency-panel-donald-trump-6500930">all in</a>, baby," replied Musk.</p>

<p>"How long do you think my prison sentence is gonna be?" he chortled, laughing at the idea that the tables would turn against him under a Democratic administration. "Will I see my children? I don't know."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US judge on Monday ordered Google to open its Android smartphone operating system to rival app stores, in a fresh legal setback for the tech giant.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge on Monday ordered Google to open its Android smartphone operating system to rival app stores, in a fresh legal setback for the tech giant.</p>

<p>The order is the result of Google's defeat in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games, where a California jury decided that Google wields illegal monopoly power through its Android Play store.</p>

<p>The San Francisco jury in December took just a few hours to decide against Google, finding that the company had embarked on various illegal strategies to maintain its app store monopoly on Android phones.</p>

<p>The order, which Google is appealing, follows a similar setback in August when a different judge found that Google's world-leading search engine was also an illegal monopoly.</p>

<p>Google is also facing an antitrust lawsuit in a third federal case in Virginia over its dominance of online advertising.</p>

<p>Under the Epic Games order, for the next three years Google will be prohibited from engaging in several practices that were deemed anticompetitive by the jury in the landmark case.</p>

<p>These prohibitions include revenue sharing with potential competitors and requirements that developers launch apps exclusively on the Play Store.</p>

<p>The judge has also ordered the creation of a three-person Technical Committee to oversee the implementation of the changes and resolve any disputes that may arise.</p>

<p>This injunction represents a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the Android app ecosystem and could reshape the mobile app landscape in the coming years.</p>

<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney urged companies to seize this opportunity "to build a vibrant and competitive Android ecosystem with such critical mass that Google can't stop it."</p>

<p>He also underlined that the changes would only be applicable in the US, but pledged that "the legal and regulatory battle will continue around the world."</p>

<p><strong>- Google appeals -</strong></p>

<p>Google said it would appeal the injunction and also demand that it be set aside pending the outcome of its continued legal challenge.</p>

<p>The judge said the order was effective November 1, with some provisions given until July 1 to be implemented.</p>

<p>"We will keep advocating for what is best for developers, device manufacturers and the billions of Android users around the world," said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's regulatory affairs vice president.</p>

<p>Phones running on the Android operating system have about a 70 percent share of the world's smartphone market.</p>

<p>Smartphone companies can install the Android app for free under the condition that the Play app store remains on the home page and that other Google offers are pre-installed.</p>

<p>The jury found that Google worked illegally to make sure that the Google Play app store was the only conduit for making payments to third party apps such as Fortnite and other games.</p>

<p>A sizable chunk of app store revenue comes from video games, and Epic Games has long sought to have payments for its mobile games, such as Fortnite, take place outside the Google or Apple app stores that take commissions as high as 30 percent.</p>

<p>Epic mostly lost a similar case against Apple, where a different US judge largely ruled in favor of the iPhone-maker.</p>

<p>Apple and Google regularly argue that their app shop commissions are industry-standard, and that they pay for benefits such as reach, transaction security and ferreting out malware.</p>

<p>Google also argued that the arrangement with smartphone makers helped Android-run devices better compete against Apple's iPhone.</p>

<p>But the trial exposed that Google rakes in tens of billions of dollars of revenue through the app store.</p>

<p>In order to preserve its one-stop-shop for apps, Google paid smartphone makers a cut of its revenue in return for the Play store remaining the exclusive gateway.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at an official memorial marking the anniversary of October 7 attack Monday, vowed to press on fighting until achieving the "sacred mission" of the war against Hamas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Monday battled on multiple fronts, intensifying its fight with Lebanon's Hezbollah as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to press the "sacred mission" against Israel's enemies, on the first anniversary of the deadliest attack in Israeli history.</p>

<p>Hamas said it will be a long fight, but Netanyahu said both wars would ensure the violence Israel endured last October 7 could never be repeated.</p>

<p>Israel's military said air defences intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, while in the West Bank, Palestinian officials reported a deadly Israeli raid.</p>

<p>Tehran, which arms and finances Hezbollah and backs the Yemeni rebels, hailed Hamas's October 7 attack as Iran awaits what Israel said will be retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Israel last week.</p>

<p>"As long as the enemy threatens our existence and the peace of our country, we will continue to fight. As long as our hostages are still in Gaza, we will continue to fight," Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded television address, vowing not to give up on the "sacred mission" of achieving the war's goals.</p>

<p>Pope Francis condemned the "shameful inability" of world powers to end the Middle East conflict, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the region is "on the verge of a complete conflagration".</p>

<p>Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said the movement chooses "to keep up the fight in a long war of attrition, one that is painful and costly for the enemy".</p>

<p>He also said scores of people taken hostage into Gaza last October 7 were enduring a "very difficult" situation.</p>

<p><strong>- Thousands of militants killed -</strong></p>

<p>A senior Hamas official has acknowledged that "several thousand fighters from the movement and other resistance groups died in combat".</p>

<p>When the Gaza war began, Netanyahu vowed to "crush" Hamas, but troops have found themselves returning again to areas to confront signs the movement was trying to rebuild.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has vowed to bring home the hostages, but critics in Israel have accused him of obstructing mediation for a truce and hostage-release deal.</p>

<p>Late last month Israel turned its focus north towards Hezbollah, with intensified air strikes in Lebanon and, since last week, "targeted" ground raids.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says the aim is to ensure tens of thousands of Israelis forced to flee Hezbollah fire can return home safely.</p>

<p>On Monday the military said it would expand its operations against Hezbollah to Lebanon's coast south of the Al-Awali river, and warned people to stay away.</p>

<p>It also declared a "closed military zone" near the coast in Israel's extreme northwest, near Shlomi, after a similar declaration last week to the northeast in the Metula area.</p>

<p>The military said Hezbollah fired about 135 projectiles into Israel Monday and Israeli forces hit back by striking "over 120 terror targets in southern Lebanon within an hour".</p>

<p>Late Monday, Lebanese state media reported more Israeli strikes on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, which has been repeatedly pounded even after a bombing killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p><strong>- More troops deployed -</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli soldiers in two south Lebanon border villages, including Maroun al-Ras where it has reported previous clashes. The army said it had deployed another division for operations across the border.</p>

<p>At least four projectiles were fired from Gaza just after October 7 commemorations began, Israel's military said, adding it retaliated against militant infrastructure throughout Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas said it fired rockets near the border with Gaza and at Tel Aviv, while Hezbollah twice said it had launched rockets at areas north of Haifa, a major coastal city.</p>

<p>As troops fought what Israel says is a war for its very existence, vigils at massacre sites and rallies called for the return of hostages a year after their abduction.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Late Monday in Tel Aviv, musicians performed as victims' images flashed on screens at a ceremony attended by families and relatives of those killed and abducted.</p>

<p>"We know in our minds, our hearts, in every cell in our bodies: there will be no rehabilitation without the return of the hostages. All of them," said Nitza Corngold, whose son Tal Shoham was seized.</p>

<p>The day began with President Isaac Herzog leading a moment's silence at 6:29 am -- the time the attack began -- in Reim, a kibbutz community where Hamas fighters killed at least 370 people at the Nova music festival, that day's deadliest attack.</p>

<p>It began when Hamas fired thousands of rockets at nearby Israeli communities.</p>

<p>At the same time militants stormed across Gaza's fortified border and attacked nearly 50 different sites, including kibbutzim communities and army bases.</p>

<p>Militants went door-to-door shooting residents dead.</p>

<p><strong>- Gaza's 'graveyard' -</strong></p>

<p>Hours later, Israel launched a military offensive that has reduced swathes of Gaza to rubble, and displaced nearly all of its 2.4 million residents at least once amid an unrelenting humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X Monday the war had turned Gaza into a "graveyard".</p>

<p>Of the 251 people taken hostage into Gaza, 97 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>According to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry, 41,909 people, the majority civilians, have been killed there since the start of the war. The figures have been deemed reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Since Israel's escalation in Lebanon began in late September, more than 1,110 people have been killed and more than one million are displaced, official figures show.</p>

<p>Violence has also soared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry says more than 700 people have been killed since the Hamas attack, including two on Monday during Israeli raids.</p>

<p>Israel's military says 349 soldiers have been killed since the Gaza ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>People in Gaza just want the war to end.</p>

<p>"I have grown old while watching my children hungry, scared, having nightmares and screaming day and night from the sound of the bombing and shells," said one displaced woman, Israa Abu Matar, 26.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inauguration of a new runaway in the Maldives built under an airport redevelopment project assisted by India and the official launch of the RuPay card in the island nation on Monday are aimed at boosting economic ties and tourism cooperation between the two countries.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian Mohamed Muizzu jointly virtually inaugurated the runway at the Hanimadhoo International Airport and also witnessed via weblink a live transaction using a RuPay payment service card in the Maldives.</p>

<p>The launch took place after the two leaders held extensive talks which Muizzu in his press statement said were to "chart a new path for the future".</p>

<p>The Maldivian president accompanied by First Lady Madam Sajidha Mohamed and a Maldivian delegation arrived in India on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Though the Maldivian president attended PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony in June, it is his first bilateral visit to India.</p>

<p>Prior to the launch of different India-assisted projects in the Maldives, a small official video was played in which details about these projects were shared in the presence of the two leaders at the Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>"The bonds between India and Maldives stretch back centuries, woven together through rich trade and cultural exchanges," it was narrated in the video.</p>

<p>Over the years, this relationship has evolved, characterised by "mutual respect and unwavering support", underpinned by India's Neighbourhood First policy and SAGAR vision, it said.</p>

<p>India has always been the first responder in the Maldives during times of crisis.</p>

<p>"Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Mohamed Muizzu, this relationship is to achieve greater heights," it added.</p>

<p>The RuPay card launch today will pave the way for strengthened India-Maldives relations by boosting tourism and economic cooperation, according to the India-Maldives video.</p>

<p>"It will allow Indian tourists to make cashless transactions easily, reducing cost and enhancing convenience, especially in the Maldives tourism sector," it said.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the new runaway at Hanimadhoo International Airport marks a "significant milestone in the airport's ongoing expansion project".</p>

<p>Its redevelopment, under an "Indian Line of Credit of USD 132 million", aims to provide complete new infrastructure including runaway, ATC tower, ARFF block, hangar, cargo facilities, and passenger terminal building, it added.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi in his press statement after the bilateral talks said President Muizzu's visit adds "another chapter to our ties".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab government on Monday banned jailed former premier Imran Khan from meeting his family members, lawyers and party leaders till October 18 due to "security concerns", amidst his party staging anti-government protests in several cities.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Khan has been lodged in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail in multiple cases since August 2023.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused PTI of trying to disrupt the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit scheduled to be held on Oct 15 and 16 in Islamabad and emphasised that the government will ensure that these plans do not succeed.</p>

<p>"Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been banned from meeting their family, lawyers, and party leaders at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, till Oct 18," a Punjab government official said.</p>

<p>The government has decided given "security concerns", he said.</p>

<p>According to PTI sources, the government has decided in anticipation of the upcoming SCO summit.</p>

<p>The coalition government led by PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that PTI is staging protests in Islamabad to sabotage the summit. The Pakistan Army has been called in to provide security for the SCO summit.</p>

<p>Earlier, security agencies arrested six Adiala jail staff for aiding the PTI founder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a PTI spokesperson said the legal team of Khan will file a petition in court, requesting the lifting of a ban on meetings with Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi. "Justice Sardar Ijaz of Islamabad High Court had ordered the authorities not too long ago to arrange meetings via video link, if not possible physically, given the number of cases Imran Khan has to deal with, legal consultation is given and, therefore should be provided," he said.</p>

<p>PTI supporters held anti-government protests in several parts of Pakistan, including Islamabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero was killed on Sunday less than a week after he took office, the state's governor confirmed.</p>

<p>Alejandro Arcos was killed just six days after he took office as mayor of the city of Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in southwestern Mexico.</p>

<p>"His loss mourns the entire Guerrero society and fills us with indignation," Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said in a statement shared on social media.</p>

<p>Guerrero's state attorney general's office also said it was investigating his murder.</p>

<p>The official confirmation came after photos circulated on the messaging app WhatsApp depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos. Reuters could not independently verify the photos' authenticity.</p>

<p>Arcos' death comes just three days after the new city government's secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot to death.</p>

<p>"They were young and honest officials who sought progress for their community," Senator Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Moreno, who is the head of Mexico's PRI political party, called on the federal attorney general's office to lead the investigation into Arcos and Tapia's murders, given "the situation of ungovernability in Guerrero."</p>

<p>Guerrero has become one of the deadliest states for aspiring and elected public officials, as well as for journalists.</p>

<p>At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's June 2 elections.</p>

<p>Arcos' social media posts show the mayor in recent days had been supervising disaster relief efforts following the impact of Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding in beach resort Acapulco and surrounding towns.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump said Monday that illegal immigrants were bringing "bad genes" into the United States, doubling down on previous inflammatory rhetoric about migrants poisoning the blood of the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Monday that illegal immigrants were bringing "bad genes" into the United States, doubling down on previous inflammatory rhetoric about migrants poisoning the blood of the country.</p>

<p>Trump was criticizing his Democratic presidential rival Vice President Kamala Harris in a radio interview when he brought up government figures showing there were 13,000 immigrants in the United States who were not in federal immigration detention, despite homicide convictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers, many of them murdered far more than one person? They are now happily living in the United States," he told conservative host Hugh Hewitt.</p>

<p>"You know now, a murderer -- I believe this -- it's in their genes. We've got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. They had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn't be here that are criminals."</p>

<p>Trump was misconstruing data released in September by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.</p>

<p>The figures don't include people incarcerated outside of ICE facilities -- in state, local or other federal facilities, for example -- and they cover a period spanning decades, including when Trump was president.</p>

<p>US media reported Monday that migrant apprehensions at the US-Mexico border fell 75 per cent year-on-year in September -- to the lowest level since the Trump administration -- citing Department of Homeland Security statistics.</p>

<p>"I don't normally defend Trump's statements, and even here he drops the 13,000 released murderers lie," said conservative political commentator Richard Hanania, president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology.</p>

<p>"But he's right that crime is largely genetic. He should just learn about the low crime rate among immigrants and think about the implications."</p>

<p>Trump, who is neck-and-neck with Harris in nationwide and swing-state polling ahead of November's election, has spent much of his campaign demonizing both undocumented immigrants and those in the United States legally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a rally last month, the 78-year-old former reality TV star said Harris should be prosecuted over President Joe Biden's border policies and called illegal immigrants "animals," out to "rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill."</p>

<p>"They will walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat," he said.</p>

<p>And he repeatedly threatened legal Haitian residents in Ohio with deportation, falsely accusing them of eating locals' pets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump -- the oldest major-party White House candidate in history and the first convicted felon to run -- accused immigrants of "poisoning the blood of our country" in December in a phrase that earned him comparisons with Adolf Hitler.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year after Hamas's deadly attack on Israel unleashed war in Gaza, the Palestinian territory is unrecognisable and its residents are exhausted by displacement and shortages, with no end in sight.</p>

<p>"It felt like the first day of the war all over again", said Khaled al-Hawajri, 46, as the Israeli forces bombarded his Gaza neighbourhood on Monday, even as Israel marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack.</p>

<p>"Last night we were terrorised by the bombardments from quadcopters and tank shells," said Hawajri, who has been displaced 10 times with his family of seven in the past year.</p>

<p>"We have endured a whole year in the north under bombardment, terror, and fear in the hearts of my children," he said, adding he had stayed in Gaza's devastated north because "there is no safe place in the entire Strip".</p>

<p>On Monday, Gaza City was barely recognisable, ravaged by relentless air strikes and fighting.</p>

<p>Residents walked along sand-covered streets stripped of pavements, with buildings either destroyed or left without facades, while piles of rubble littered the roads.</p>

<p>With fuel in short supply and expensive, car traffic was almost nonexistent. Most people walked, cycled or used donkey carts.</p>

<p>"There is no electricity or petroleum products. Even firewood is not available. Food is almost non-existent", said 64-year-old Hussam Mansour, speaking from a street in Gaza City, surrounded by piles of rubble and sand.</p>

<p>The United Nations says 92 per cent of Gaza's roads and more than 84 per cent of its health facilities have been damaged or destroyed in the war.</p>

<p><strong>- Long war -</strong></p>

<p>Mansour and his sons have all been displaced, and his apartment building was destroyed in an air strike.</p>

<p>"Now when I walk the streets, I do not recognise them anymore," he said.</p>

<p>Like Hawajri and Mansour, Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants have endured hardship, with no signs of relief, even after Israel reassigned divisions to the north of the country where troops are fighting Hamas's Lebanese ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>About 90 per cent of the population has been displaced at least once, the United Nations says.</p>

<p>"Last night was one of the hardest nights of the war as if the war had just begun!" said 46-year-old Muhammad al-Muqayyid, displaced from the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>"I never imagined the war would last this long," he said.</p>

<p>"A year has gone and we have seen every kind of suffering -- disease, hunger, danger and loss."</p>

<p>The Israeli military has been fighting Hamas in Gaza since the unprecedented attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,909 people, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The UN acknowledges the figures to be reliable.</p>

<p>A year on, Israel has yet to achieve one of its main objectives: securing the return of all those taken hostage on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>Of the 251 captured that day, 97 are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>The Israeli military is still carrying out operations in Gaza to free the hostages and crush Hamas, in power since 2007.</p>

<p>"There was a sudden ground invasion by tanks, and people were rushing out of their homes without taking anything with them, just carrying their children and running through the streets with fire and shells raining down on them", Muqayyid said, referring to an Israeli military operation in northern Gaza on Sunday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hamas keeps fighting. Its armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said it launched a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.</p>

<p>Samah Ali, a 32-year-old woman displaced in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah, said rocket launches were predictable on this day.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, we heard the sound of rockets launching, and everyone in the camp came out to see where they had been fired from," she said, adding some people fled fearing retaliatory Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>"It's certain that the occupation army will return and strike."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ports throughout Europe have not allowed the ship to dock because it is carrying a staggering 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MV Ruby, a Maltese-registered cargo ship, has been drifting at sea for six weeks after sustaining damage shortly after departing from Russia. Ports throughout Europe have not allowed the ship to dock because of its contents and&nbsp;compromised state. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/europe/ship-explosives.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Times,&nbsp;</a></em>the ship is<em> c</em>arrying a staggering 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in agricultural fertilizers.&nbsp;Due to the dangerous nature of its cargo and damage to the vessel, no port has granted entry for long-term repairs, leaving the MV Ruby in limbo.</p>

<p>When improperly stored or exposed to stressors like heat and pressure, ammonium nitrate can become highly unstable and explosive. Notably, ammonium nitrate was the same substance responsible for the catastrophic Beirut port explosion in August 2020 that&nbsp;claimed 200 lives, displaced 300,000 people, and inflicted 15 billion pounds in damage on the Lebanese capital.&nbsp;Alarmingly,&nbsp;MV Ruby's cargo holds approximately seven times the amount. The potential blast equivalent to an atomic bomb has raised serious concerns, emphasising the urgent need to ensure the safe disposal or repair of the vessel.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the MV Ruby remained 14 miles off the coast of Kent, in southeastern England, where it has been since last month, as per <em>NYT.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The ship, registered in Malta and owned by Ruby Enterprise, is managed by Serenity Shipping based in the UAE, but its Russian cargo has raised suspicions. Its stalled journey has sparked concerns among governments that it could be a Trojan horse aimed at sabotaging vital shipping and port infrastructure.</p>

<p>The ship's journey began in late August from the Russian port of Kandalaksha, with a reported destination of the Canary Islands. However, after sustaining damage, the Ruby attempted to dock at Norwegian and Lithuanian ports, only to be refused due to security concerns.&nbsp;Lithuania's Foreign Minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, made it clear that despite no evidence of malicious intent, the country cannot afford to let its guard down when dealing with Russia.</p>

<p>''When we are dealing with Russia or other international actors that are unfriendly to us, we always keep this possibility in mind,'' Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authorities in Sweden also denied the vessel to dock in Gothenburg and Uddevalla ports which are closer to populated regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MV Ruby then headed to Britain, only to be met with heightened scrutiny. Lithuania's former ambassador to Britain, Eitvydas Bajarunas labelled the ship a "floating megabomb" in a think tank column, warning of potential Russian sabotage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MV Ruby's managers have requested permission to dock, transfer its 20,000 tons of ammonium nitrate to another vessel, and undergo essential repairs. However, British authorities have yet to respond. In the meantime, the ship has refuelled while anchored at sea, according to the British Coast Guard.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air raid sirens echoed across central Israel including Tel Aviv after surface-to-surface missiles were fired from Yemen on Israel on the first anniversary of deadly attacks in Israel where over 1,200 people were killed. Israel did not mention who fired the missile, but Iran-backed Houthis - A Shia militant group in Yemen - have over the past year attacked Israel several times in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>Several events were organised across Israel to remember those who died in the attacks carried out by Hamas. Videos show people hiding for cover as air raid sirens went off. Several journalists lying on the ground when missile warnings were issued.</p>

<p>In another video, people in a mall were running for safety after the aerial missile attack, which Israel said was intercepted by the air force.&nbsp;</p>

Israel was caught off-guard. Hamas operatives fired over 5,000 rockets, they came through paragliders, broke the Gaza wall and went on a killing spree.</p>

<p>Militants abducted 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>Inside Gaza, the military said three divisions were working to "dismantle terrorist infrastructure and degrade Hamas's capabilities".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said it struck more than 120 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon within a 60-minute period as part of extensive strikes on Monday.</p>

<p>"The IAF (air force) conducted an extensive aerial operation and struck over 120 terror targets in southern Lebanon within an hour," the military said in a statement, adding the targets belonged to the group's elite Radwan forces and other units.</p>

<p>Israel on Monday battled on multiple fronts, intensifying its battle with Lebanon's Hezbollah as Hamas warned of a long war on the first anniversary of the deadliest attack in Israeli history.<br />
But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said both wars would ensure the violence his country endured last October 7 could never be repeated.</p>

<p>Israel's military said air defences also intercepted a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-people-run-for-cover-after-air-raid-sirens-go-off-in-israel-6738131">missile fired from Yemen</a>.</p>

<p>Tehran, which arms and finances Hezbollah and backs the Yemeni rebels, praised Hamas's October 7 attack as Iran awaits what Israel said will be retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Israel last week.</p>

<p>Pope Francis condemned the "shameful inability" of world powers to end the conflict in the Middle East, which European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said is "on the verge of a complete conflagration that the international community looks unable to control".</p>

<p>Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said the movement "choose to keep up the fight in a long war of attrition, one that is painful and costly for the enemy".</p>

<p>He also said scores of people taken <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/on-first-anniversary-of-war-with-israel-fate-of-63-hostages-held-in-gaza-unknown-6736725">hostage into Gaza </a>last October 7 were enduring a "very difficult" situation.</p>

<p><strong>Thousands of militants killed</strong></p>

<p>A senior Hamas official has acknowledged that "several thousand fighters from the movement and other resistance groups died in combat".</p>

<p>When the Gaza war began, Netanyahu vowed to "crush" Hamas, but troops have found themselves returning again to areas to confront signs the movement was trying to rebuild.</p>

<p>"We are changing the security reality in our region; for the sake of our children, for the sake of our future, to ensure that what happened on the seventh of October will not happen again. Never again," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-october-7-the-day-we-failed-israels-army-chief-on-gaza-war-anniversary-6733766">Netanyahu said</a> in a cabinet address.</p>

<p>"Never again" is a phrase associated with efforts to ensure the Holocaust and other genocides are not repeated.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has also vowed to bring home hostages still held in Gaza, but critics in Israel have accused him of obstructing international efforts for a truce and hostage-release deal.</p>

<p>Late last month Israel turned its focus north towards Hezbollah, with intensified air strikes in Lebanon and, since last week, "targeted" ground raids.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says the aim is to ensure tens of thousands of Israelis forced to flee Hezbollah fire can return home safely.</p>

<p>On Monday the military said it would expand its operations against Hezbollah to Lebanon's coast south of the Al-Awali river, and warned people to stay away from the shore in the area.</p>

<p>It said Hezbollah had fired about 135 projectiles into Israel on Monday while Israeli forces hit back by striking "over 120 terror targets in southern Lebanon within an hour".</p>

<p><strong>More troops deployed</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli soldiers in two south Lebanon border villages, including Maroun al-Ras where it has reported previous clashes, as the army said it had deployed another division for operations across the border.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said bombardment killed 10 firefighters earlier.</p>

<p>Israel's military said at least four projectiles were fired from Gaza just after October 7 commemorations began, and it hit back at "terrorist infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>Hamas said it had fired rockets near the border with Gaza and at Tel Aviv, while Hezbollah twice said it had fired rockets at areas north of Haifa, a major coastal city.</p>

<p>As troops fought what Israel says is a war for its very existence, vigils at massacre sites and rallies called for the return of hostages a year after their abduction.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Families of the dead wept in Reim, a kibbutz community where Hamas fighters killed at least 370 people at the site of the Nova music festival, that day's deadliest attack.</p>

<p>President Isaac Herzog led a moment's silence there at 6:29 am - the time the attack began.</p>

<p>Mourners also gathered in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv amid the sound of war as Hamas fired a rocket barrage.</p>

<p>"It still feels surreal, like a nightmare that we are still supposed to wake up from eventually," said resident Ariel Tamir.</p>

<p>In Jerusalem, Shir Siegel said the wait for her hostage father's return from captivity has been agonising.</p>

<p>"A year has passed but actually one long day has passed that feels like an eternity," she said.</p>

<p>Early on October 7, 2023, the Hamas attack began with thousands of rockets fired at Israeli border communities.</p>

<p>At the same time militants stormed across Gaza's fortified border and attacked nearly 50 different sites, including kibbutzim communities and army bases as well as the music festival.</p>

<p>Militants went door-to-door shooting residents dead.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza's 'graveyard'</strong></p>

<p>Hours later, Israel launched a military offensive that has reduced <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/theres-no-safe-place-exhausted-gazans-after-1-year-of-war-6738373">swathes of Gaza to rubble</a>, and displaced nearly all of its 2.4 million residents at least once amid an unrelenting humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X Monday the war had turned Gaza into a "graveyard".</p>

<p>Militants took 251 people hostage into Gaza, where 97 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>An Israeli campaign group on Monday announced the death of Gaza hostage Idan Shtivi, 28, who was abducted at the music festival.</p>

<p>Since Israel's escalation in Lebanon began in late September, more than 1,110 people have been killed and more than one million are displaced, official figures show.</p>

<p>According to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry, 41,909 people, the majority civilians, have been killed there since the start of the war. The figures have been deemed reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Israel's military says 349 soldiers have been killed since the Gaza ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>People in Gaza just want the war to end.</p>

<p>"It feels like the world stopped on October 7," said one displaced woman, Israa Abu Matar, 26.</p>

<p>"I have grown old while watching my children hungry, scared, having nightmares and screaming day and night from the sound of the bombing and shells."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Monday arrested a medic for "Satanism" and "promoting same-sex relationships", as Moscow intensifies a legal crackdown on LGBTQ rights, in defence of what it calls "traditional family values".</p>

<p>Moscow has for years created a hostile environment for LGBTQ people, a trend it hugely accelerated since sending troops to Ukraine in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The powerful FSB security service said it had arrested the head of a medical institution in the central Ulyanovsk region, accusing him of "devil worshipping".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such accusations from state authorities are rare, but the influence of the Orthodox Church has steadily risen as Russia takes an increasingly conservative social turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In the course of operational searches, it was established that this person, being a supporter of Satanism, promoted the idea of same-sex relations among subordinate employees as a way of initiating them into devil worshipping," the FSB said.</p>

<p>It said the man had "misled citizens into believing that it was necessary to adopt the cult in order to gain financial prosperity and achieve career advancement". &nbsp;</p>

<p>It said a criminal case has been opened over coercion to engage in sexual acts and participate in an extremist organisation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The FSB published a video of the man being arrested in his apartment and led away by masked men in camouflage uniform.</p>

<p>Russia banned what it called the "international LGBT movement" in November last year. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It ranks last place -- 48th -- in a European ranking of countries' laws and policies that have a direct impact on LGBTQ people. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu is in India for a state visit, a significant moment in bilateral relations after the diplomatic relations between the states were severely affected when three Maldivian ministers made derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Modi. Mr Muizzu has sought a Rs 3,000 crore currency swap deal with India to boost Maldivian foreign exchange reserves amid an economic crisis.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, briefed the media on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maldives-president-mohamed-muizzi-india-visit-wont-do-anything-to-undermine-security-of-india-maldives-president-6732730">bilateral talks</a> held between the leaders of the countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A journalist asked Mr Misri in Hindi about the turnaround in the India-Maldives relationship and said, "Sir, yeh Maldives <em>ke saath dooriyan nazdeekiyan mein badal gayi, yeh kya ittefaq hai</em>? (The differences with Maldives have been turned to closeness. Do you think this is a coincidence?) To which Misri replied in Hindi, "<em>Dooriyan, nazdeekiyan, ittefaq</em>...I don't think you could add more names of Hindi films in one question but I would say, "Yaarana chalta rahega" (Friendship will continue).</p>

<p>Mr Misri further explained the relationship between India and Maldives, "This is a very age-old relationship.

<p>"We are making progress on several development projects in the Maldives, today there was recognition by both leaders of the importance of this relationship, especially given the geographical proximity that exists between the two countries and the many ways in which the relationship is mutually beneficial," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a joint statement after the two leaders met, Prime Minister Modi underlined New Delhi's position as a "close friend" of the island nation, emphasising his 'neighbourhood first' foreign policy that has seen India act as a 'first responder' to emergencies affecting Male, including supplying Covid vaccines.</p>

<p>"Be it essential commodities, vaccines during Covid, or drinking water... we have played a good neighbour," he said, adding India had today also virtually inaugurated the Hanimaadhoo International Airport on the Haa Dhaalu Atoll and, earlier, handed over 700 social housing units, as well as set up a drinking water and sewerage project to serve nearly 30,000 people across 28 Maldivian islands.</p>

<p>The Maldives, the PM then said, also has an important role - to help ensure the security of the Indian Ocean Region. This is an issue that was red-flagged by many within the government after Mr Muizzu - seen as a 'pro-China' leader - won last year's election on what was called an 'India out' platform.</p>

<p>That platform included requesting Delhi to withdraw 90 military personnel in the Maldives to maintain and operate three aviation platforms for humanitarian and medical aid.</p>

<p>These three - two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft - were a gift from India.</p>

<p>After talks, Delhi replaced military personnel with "competent technical" staff.</p>

<p>Apart from the ejection of the military staff - of which Mr Muizzu has said he simply "did what the people of Maldives asked of me" - February's docking of a Chinese spy ship masquerading as a research vessel also raised eyebrows after similar vessels docked at Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accepted Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu's invitation to travel to Male on a state visit next year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri announced on Monday.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary said that the dates for PM Modi's visit will be worked out through diplomatic channels.</p>

<p>"President Muizzu expressed his gratitude for the very warm welcome that he and his delegation have received here. He extended an invitation to the Prime Minister to visit Maldives on a State visit next year. The Prime Minister accepted the invitation and the dates for the visit will worked out through diplomatic channels," Mr Misri said at a special briefing on Monday.</p>

<p>He said that the engagements and outcomes during Muizzu's visit will enable the ties between the two nations to scale new heights in the coming years.</p>

<p>"Overall, I would say that the engagements and outcomes during this visit will enable the India-Maldives relationship to scale new heights in the coming years and make it more fit for purpose to handle the challenges that we see emerging in this region in the coming years," Misri said in the briefing.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, PM Modi and President Muizzu held bilateral talks at Hyderabad House on Monday. Following the bilateral meeting, the two leaders also held delegation-level talks at Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh were among other delegates who were present on the occasion.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, "Taking forward India-Maldives special ties!

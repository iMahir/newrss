       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a key address to diplomats in Dhaka on Sunday, Muhammad Yunus, the Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, called for comprehensive reforms before holding the next general elections. This meeting marked Mr Yunus' first engagement with the diplomatic community since assuming office on August 8, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus, a Nobel laureate, took charge amid a volatile political landscape that saw mass protests and violence resulting in the ousting of Ms Hasina. In his address, Yunus outlined the interim government's roadmap for a stable and democratic Bangladesh, starting with a free, fair, and participatory election.</p>

<p>"We will hold a free, fair participatory election as soon as we can complete our mandate to carry out vital reforms in our election commission, judiciary, civil administration, security forces and media," he told diplomats, including India's High Commissioner in Dhaka, Pranay Verma.</p>

<h3><strong>Restoring Normalcy&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On August 5, Ms Hasina, aged 76, fled Bangladesh by helicopter to India as protesters overran the streets of Dhaka. Her 15-year rule, marked by allegations of human rights abuses, came to a dramatic end. The weeks leading up to her ousting were bloody, with more than 450 dying during the unrest and several reports of attacks on Bangladesh's Hindu minority community.</p>

<p>The Chief Adviser said restoring law and order in the country is a top priority for his government. "We will be close to normalcy within a short period, with the unwavering support of our people and patriotic armed forces," Mr Yunus said. "The top priority of the Interim Government would be to bring the law and order situation under control...The armed forces will continue to serve in aid of civil power as long as the situation warrants."</p>

<h3><strong>Reviving Economy&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In addition to political reforms, Mr Yunus spoke about the need for robust economic reforms. The country had suffered under what he described as Ms Hasina's "brutal dictatorship," which, according to Mr Yunus, had led to widespread corruption and mismanagement.</p>

<p>"Our government will undertake far-reaching economic reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and sustain growth," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus accused Sheikh Hasina of systematically destroying the country's institutions during her 15-year tenure. He alleged that elections under Ms Hasina's rule were rigged, and democratic rights were suppressed.</p>

<p>"In their efforts to stay in power, Sheikh Hasina's dictatorship destroyed every institution of the country," Mr Yunus said. He described the judiciary as broken and accused the former administration of allowing political patronage to rob banks and plunder the state coffers.</p>

<p>The Nobel laureate described the recent mass uprising as a "Second Revolution," led by students and ordinary citizens who sought to reclaim their democratic rights.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>International Support</strong></h3>

<p>In his message to the international community, Mr Yunus called for continued support in rebuilding Bangladesh and transitioning to a fully functional democracy. He assured the diplomats that Bangladesh would maintain its role as a proponent of multilateralism, with the United Nations at the core of its foreign policy.</p>

<p>"We believe all our friends and partners in the international community will stand by our government and people as we chart a new democratic future," Yunus said.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh stands at the crossroads of a new beginning. Our valiant students and people deserve a lasting transformation of our nation. It is a difficult journey and we need your help along the way. We need to fulfil their aspirations. The sooner the better," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus also welcomed the United Nations' decision to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the recent violence, committing to cooperate fully with the international inquiry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US House of Representatives Republicans issued a report on Monday alleging Democratic President Joe Biden committed impeachable offences, but it was unclear whether they would push for a vote following a probe the White House has long dismissed as politically motivated.</p>

<p>A 291-page report by three House committees alleged that Biden profited from an influence-peddling scheme to enrich himself and members of his family through foreign business dealings beginning in 2014 when Biden was vice president.</p>

<p>"The committees present this information to the House of Representatives for its evaluation and consideration of appropriate next steps," the report said.</p>

<p>It was not clear if Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson would schedule a vote to impeach Biden in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 5 election, in which Republican Donald Trump is locked in a tight battle with Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Even if the Republican-controlled House were to pass such a measure, it would be unlikely to remove Biden from office, given that he would need to be convicted by a Senate controlled 51-49 by his own Democratic Party. Biden, who withdrew his own reelection bid last month, is due to leave office when his successor is sworn in on Jan. 20.</p>

<p>A similar House impeachment against Biden's top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, was put to a swift end by the Senate in April.</p>

<p>The House investigators claim that Biden used his influence to benefit the business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden, with partners from Ukraine, China, Russia and other countries.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden has been convicted on charges that he lied about his illegal drug use to buy a gun and is awaiting trial on charges of tax evasion, including an allegation that he accepted payments from a Romanian businessman who sought to influence U.S. government agencies in connection with a criminal probe in Romania.</p>

<p>The impeachment inquiry, which lawmakers formally authorized last December and has been carried out by the House Oversight, Judiciary and Ways &amp; Means Committees, has been criticized by members of both parties for failing to produce hard evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.</p>

<p>Democrats have disparaged the effort as retribution for Trump, who was impeached twice by a Democratic-controlled House and acquitted each time by the Senate. The first impeachment alleged that Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to help smear Joe Biden in return for US aid.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Swiss government is looking for innovative solutions to remove thousands of tonnes of ammunition dumped in the lakes. And it comes with a massive 50,000 franc (Rs 48.5 lakhs) prize money. The ammunition, estimated to be around 3,300 tonnes in Lake Lucerne and 4,500 tonnes in Lake Neuchatel, was disposed of by the Swiss military.</p>

<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>

<p>Dumping munitions in lakes dates back to the Cold War era when Switzerland maintained a large militia army as part of its “armed neutrality” defence strategy. For decades, between 1918 and 1964, the Swiss military used the lakes – Neuchatel, Thun, Brienz and Lucerne – as dumping grounds for old munitions, believing it to be a safe disposal method. However, the reality is far from it. Some munitions lie at depths of 150-220 metres, while others are just six or seven metres below the surface. The risk of explosion and water and soil contamination is high, with toxic TNT potentially polluting the lake water and sediment.</p>

<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>The submerged ammunition is covered by a fine sediment layer, and recovery efforts may stir up sediments, leading to oxygen loss and damage to the lake ecosystem. Previous assessments have shown that proposed recovery techniques would lead to muddy waters and high risks for the sensitive ecosystem of the lake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recovery operation is expected to be long and costly, with estimates suggesting it could cost billions, which is why the Swiss defence department is seeking ideas for a safe and environmental solution to retrieve the munitions, with the public invited to submit their proposals until February next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The competition, where the top three entries will be given&nbsp;prize money worth almost Rs 50 lakh, is open and anonymous, and the last date to submit entries is February 6, 2025. A panel of experts will assess the entries based on predefined criteria and announce the results in April 2025.</p>

<p>Retired Swiss geologist Marcos Buser suggests seeking advice from countries with experience in dealing with wartime wrecks containing unexploded weapons, such as the UK, Norway or Denmark. Mr Buser who advised the government on the issue warned of the dangers of explosion and contamination and stated the need for a careful and well-planned recovery operation, as per the BBC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his research paper, Mr Buser highlighted two primary concerns: the risk of explosion and water and soil contamination.</p>

<p>Since fuses were not removed from the munitions before dumping, the risk of explosion remains even underwater. It poses a significant threat to the environment and human safety. Water and soil contamination is another concern, as highly toxic TNT could pollute the lake water and sediment. It could have devastating effects on the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not the first time the Swiss military has faced criticism for its handling of munitions. In 1947, a massive blast in Mitholz killed nine people and destroyed the village. More recently, the military revealed that 3,500 tonnes of unexploded ammunition buried in the mountain was not safe, requiring a decade-long clean-up operation.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In June 2024, 13 young people in Hawaii took on their state government in court and won the right to have greater input in climate policy.</p>

<p>They sued the state for infringing on their right to "a clean and healthful environment", as promised under the State constitution.</p>

<p>In victory, the young people forced a number of concessions including a pledge to pursue net zero by 2040 and over USD 40 million investment in electric vehicles over the next six years.</p>

<p>Young people are turning to activism as a way to process the emotional weight of a world in crisis.</p>

<p>From Greta Thunberg to Australia's Anjali Sharma, there are plenty of people in Gen Z who are taking action on climate.</p>

<p>Despite the United Nations also adding the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 2022 which further opens the possibility to take governments to the courts, it's not easy.</p>

<p>Gen Z is growing up in an era where the impacts of climate change are both immediate and undeniable and it's leaving them feeling powerless.</p>

<p>Generation Z - those born between 1995 and 2010 - make up 30 per cent of the global population. In Australia's latest census, Gen Z accounted for 18.2 per cent (or 4.6 million) of the country's 25 million population.</p>

<p>Unlike previous generations, who had time to gradually adjust to the realities of environmental transformations, Generation Z is acutely aware of the ecological crises unfolding around them, leading to a deep sense of environmental anxiety.</p>

<h3><strong>Distress and fear </strong></h3>

<p>As a result, many digitally connected, globally aware Gen Zers experience intense climate anxiety, characterised by chronic fear, distress and deep concern for the planet's future.</p>

<p>A survey of Australian Gen Z university students was conducted between September 2021 and April 2022 with 446 participants which revealed that climate change is their top environmental concern.</p>

<p>They often feel let down by older generations, governments and institutions, whose actions seem inadequate in the face of the growing evidence about the environmental threats the world and Australia in particular face.</p>

<p>More than 80 per cent of the young people participating in the survey expressed significant worry and many experienced severe climate anxiety.</p>

<p>This anxiety manifests in various forms, including eco-anxiety, solastalgia (distress triggered by environmental changes) and climate grief, reflecting the complex emotional landscape of a generation coming of age amid a global environmental emergency.</p>

<p>The situation Gen Z faces and their future prospects are further exacerbated by the complexity of other developments resulting in what is known as a polycrisis, a "great disagreement, confusion, or suffering that is caused by many different problems happening at the same time so that they together have a very big effect."</p>

<h3><strong>Existential threat</strong></h3>

<p>Eco-anxiety, a chronic fear of an environmental catastrophe, arises from the perception that climate change poses an existential threat.</p>

<p>For many in Gen Z, the overwhelming nature of this threat leads to persistent worry and stress. This is also fuelled by the sense of urgency and responsibility they think they have to comply with.</p>

<p>Gen Z is witnessing their local natural environments and the broader global ecosystem undergo rapid, often destructive and irreversible changes, including biodiversity loss, species extinction and the degradation of ecosystems.</p>

<p>Many experience profound grief which is tied not just to physical harm, but also to the loss of hope for a stable and prosperous future.</p>

<p>With 96 per cent of Australian Gen Zs believing that climate change is human-made, young people are experiencing heightened levels of stress, anxiety and depression as they grapple with the realities of a warming planet.</p>

<p>For some members of Gen Z, the constant stream of climate-related news, coupled with personal experiences of climate-related calamities, such as wildfires, floods, droughts or cyclones, leads to a form of trauma that can have long-lasting effects on mental health.</p>

<h3><strong>A generational crisis</strong></h3>

<p>For Gen Z, climate change anxiety is not just about fear of environmental destruction; it is also about grappling with a crisis of identity and purpose.</p>

<p>As they come of age in a world that seems increasingly unstable and unpredictable, many young people are questioning what kind of future they can expect to have, and whether it is even ethical to plan for the future in traditional ways, such as pursuing professional careers, starting families or buying homes, when the planet is in such peril.</p>

<p>This crisis of identity is further complicated by the pressure to act. Many young people feel a deep sense of responsibility to address climate change, but this can also ignite feelings of guilt and shame when they perceive their actions as insufficient.</p>

<p>The weight of this responsibility can be overwhelming, leading to burnout and a sense of futility.</p>

<h3><strong>The role of activism</strong></h3>

<p>In response to these challenges, some members of Gen Z are channelling their anxiety into activism.</p>

<p>Climate activism is seen as a way to regain a sense of control and agency in the face of overwhelming challenges.</p>

<p>This activism takes many forms, from participating in global climate strikes to advocating for sustainable policies at the local level. However, activism is not a panacea for climate anxiety.</p>

<p>This is seen from the answers of 65 per cent of Australia's university Gen Z who do not engage in traditional climate activism, but instead are using technology and social media to voice their concerns.</p>

<p>While it can provide a sense of purpose and community, activism can also be exhausting. The constant need to fight for change, coupled with the slow pace of progress, can lead to burnout and exacerbate mental health issues.</p>

<p>Additionally, the pressure to always be "on" and engaged in activism can be mentally and emotionally draining, leading to further feelings of hopelessness and despair.</p>

<h3><strong>Mental health support</strong></h3>

<p>Given the significant mental health challenges posed by climate change anxiety, there is a growing recognition of the need for robust mental health support for Gen Z.</p>

<p>This support must be tailored to address the unique challenges of climate anxiety, experiencing unprecedented levels of fear and despair, and feelings of hopelessness that are so prevalent among young people.</p>

<p>There is a need for more mental health professionals trained to understand and address eco-anxiety and related issues. Therapeutic interventions that focus on building resilience, fostering a sense of agency and helping young people navigate their complex emotions are crucial.</p>

<p>Building supportive communities where young people can share their experiences, particularly positive outcomes, and feelings about climate change is also important.</p>

<p>These communities can provide a sense of solidarity and help combat the isolation that often accompanies climate anxiety. Schools and educational institutions can play a key role in addressing climate anxiety by incorporating discussions about mental health and climate change into their curricula.</p>

<p>By providing young people with the tools to understand and cope with their emotions, educational initiatives can help mitigate the psychological impacts of climate anxiety.</p>

<h3><strong>The way forward</strong></h3>

<p>The challenges posed by climate change anxiety for Gen Z are indeed profound and multifaceted.</p>

<p>However, the importance and urgency of their role cannot be overstated. With the climate crisis in a time of polycrisis worsening, Gen Z's involvement in shaping a resilient and sustainable future is critical.</p>

<p>Their unique perspective and relentless drive for change position them as key players in responding to global warming as well as in bridging generational divides, fostering global cooperation and ensuring that climate action is grounded in science and equity.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The 501st Marine Battalion's troubles began during Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 501st Marine Battalion, a notorious unit in Ukraine's marine corps, has entered the fight in Russia's Kursk Oblast. The battalion, rebuilt after surrendering twice since 2014, is seeking redemption in the ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>The conflict between Russia and Ukraine first began in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula.</p>

<p>Russia's actions were motivated by a desire to maintain influence over Ukraine and prevent it from joining Western institutions such as NATO and the EU.</p>

<p>Ukraine, seeking independence and self-determination, has resisted Russian aggression, leading to a protracted and devastating conflict that has resulted in thousands of deaths, millions of displaced people, and significant economic losses.</p>

<p>As of July 31, 2024, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported 35,160 civilian casualties in Ukraine since February 2022, including 11,520 fatalities and 23,640 injuries. However, OHCHR notes that the actual numbers are likely higher due to underreporting.</p>

<h3><strong>Ukraine's 501st Marine Battalion</strong></h3>

<p>The 501st Separate Marine Infantry Battalion is an elite military unit within the Ukrainian Marine Corps, operating under the 36th Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Headquartered in Berdyansk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, this battalion plays a vital role in Ukraine's defence capabilities.</p>

<h3><strong>Initial Surrender</strong></h3>

<p>The 501st Marine Battalion's troubles began during Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The battalion was stationed as part of the Ukrainian garrison when Russian forces invaded. As Ukrainian troops retreated, only 64 of the 501st's members managed to escape Crimea. The remaining personnel, likely hundreds, chose to remain in Crimea, effectively siding with Russian occupiers.</p>

<h3><strong>Second Surrender</strong></h3>

<p>In the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the 501st Marine Battalion was deployed to Mariupol, a strategic Black Sea port, where they joined a larger garrison. Russian forces brutally besieged them - subjected them to relentless bombardment and cut off essential supplies.</p>

<p>Although the main garrison of over 2,000 troops fought on until May 2022, the 501st Marine Battalion's leaders ordered an unauthorised surrender in April, abandoning their positions and handing over around 270 marines to Russian captivity. Kyiv authorities later investigated this surrender, targeting the battalion's leadership.</p>

<h3><strong>Rebuilding And Redeployment</strong></h3>

<p>After the loss of its previous personnel and the controversy surrounding its earlier surrenders, the Battalion was reconstituted with new officers and fresh recruits. The battalion rejoined the fight in 2023, initially operating in southern Ukraine's Kherson Oblast before moving to Kharkiv Oblast. Here, it played a role in defending the town of Vovchansk from ongoing Russian incursions.</p>

<p>Currently, the 501st Marine Battalion made a high-profile move by joining the invasion of Russia's Kursk Oblast. The battalion announced its presence through a video showing marines tearing down a Russian flag in a settlement within Kursk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's prosecutor general on Monday said it had banned a foundation started by US film star George Clooney and his human rights lawyer wife Amal.</p>

<p>"The activities of The Clooney Foundation for Justice are declared undesirable on the territory of our country," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>The organisation "conducts extensive work aimed at discrediting Russia, actively supports false patriots and members of banned terrorist and extremist groups".</p>

<p>"Under the guise of humanitarian ideas, these 'warriors for justice'... advance initiatives of criminal probes against the highest Russian authorities," it said in the statement entitled "The Russian Prosecutor General's Office Appreciates Hollywood Activists' Acting Talent".</p>

<p>After Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian authorities have upped repression of dissent to levels not seen since the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>In July, the Clooney Foundation, along with several other non-governmental organisations, filed a case with the UN Human Rights Committee, accusing Russia of violating the human rights of Ukrainians killed in a 2022 missile attack on Vinnytsia.</p>

<p>In early August, Russia's prosecutor general banned as "undesirable" German pro-democracy foundation Konrad Adenauer and in July did the same with the Moscow Times news outlet.</p>

<p>The "undesirable" status forces organisations to shut down in Russia and means Russians that work for, fund or collaborate with them can also be liable to prosecution.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah on Monday claimed attacks on troops and military positions in northern Israel, including a drone strike on a base and an assault on soldiers allegedly "infiltrating" near the Lebanese border.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed group has exchanged regular cross-border fire with the Israeli army in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Fears of a major escalation skyrocketed after an Israeli strike last month on Beirut's southern suburbs killed Fuad Shukr, one of Hezbollah's top commanders, hours before an attack in Tehran, blamed on Israel, killed Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Iran and Hezbollah have vowed to respond.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Monday it launched a "simultaneous air attack" with "explosive-laden drones" on two Israeli military positions -- a barracks near the border and a base near the coastal town of Acre, around 15 kilometres (10 miles) from the frontier.</p>

<p>It said it came "in response" to an Israeli "attack and assassination" in south Lebanon's Tyre area.</p>

<p>A fighter from the group was killed in an Israeli strike in the area on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Israeli military had said its aircraft "eliminated" a Hezbollah operative in the Tyre area, describing him as a "commander" in the group's elite Radwan force.</p>

<p>Overnight, Hezbollah said its fighters targeted a group of Israeli soldiers "infiltrating" near the border and confronted them "with rocket weapons and artillery, forcing them to return".</p>

<p>Also Monday morning, Hezbollah claimed a rocket and artillery attack on another Israeli barracks in stated retaliation for "Israeli enemy attacks".</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed some 582 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but including at least 128 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/kgn3rhjo_mpox_625x300_19_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>More than four years since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO (World Health Organization) in March 2020, fear of another mass outbreak looms large. The WHO, on August 14, declared the current upsurge of Mpox or Monkeypox in Central Africa as a global emergency requiring urgent action. The global concern for the virus grew as it spread to other African countries, and, within no time, the deadly strain of Mpox - Clade 1b - crossed the African continent to reach Sweden, Pakistan, and other countries.</p>

<p>The virus has killed more than 500 people so far, mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the disease has been spreading since last year. The country saw more than 96% of the world's roughly 17,000 recorded cases of Mpox this year.</p>

<p>Though India has not reported any cases yet, the Central government is keeping a close eye on the situation. Our healthcare infrastructure faced severe challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in thousands of deaths. One wouldn't wish to be caught unawares this time.</p>

<h2><strong>Is Mpox As Dangerous As Covid-19 Or Swine Flu?</strong></h2>

<p>Mpox is a zoonotic infection that causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions. Fatal in some cases, the WHO first declared it a global emergency in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mpox virus can be categorised into two clades: Clade 1 and Clade 2. The first, which is found mainly in Central African countries, is more severe and has a high mortality rate. Clade 2 has milder symptoms and is found in western Africa. The latter caused a public health emergency in 2022, wherein some 300 cases — though mild — were reported from Sweden. This time, it's the newer and more serious Clade 1b, identified in September last year, that has been driving the current outbreak.</p>

<p>Though experts worry that Mpox may be as dangerous as Covid-19 or the swine flu, there is a difference in the nature of transmission. Both Covid-19 and swine flu were highly infectious because they were airborne. In contrast, Mpox is transmitted through close skin-to-skin contact, talking or breathing close to an infected person, or using their soiled clothes or bedsheets. “Mpox is unlikely to become a pandemic like Covid-19 primarily due to its mode of spread. It requires very close and physical contact, unlike the airborne SARS-CoV-2. Also, symptoms like blisters on the skin are more visible indicators and therefore, it's easier to identify the disease and isolate a person to contain the spread,” says Rakesh K. Mishra, former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology.</p>

<p>India's first Mpox case was recorded in Kerala in 2022, from a traveller from the UAE. Soon, the virus spread within the country, with cases emerging in Delhi even from individuals who had no recent international travel. India reported 27 confirmed cases and one death that year, according to WHO. The last case in the country was in March this year, in Kerala, and since then, no new cases have been recorded.</p>

<h2><strong>How To Stay Safe</strong></h2>

<p>In response to the WHO's warning, both Central and state governments have sprung into action. There are monkeypox advisories in place and public health measures are being taken. Both the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are closely monitoring the situation and reviewing international trends.</p>

<p>In Tamil Nadu, the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (DPH) has already issued alerts. Reports say that passengers arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African countries are being tracked by airport health officers and port health personnel. Both Hyderabad and New Delhi — cities popular among African students pursuing higher education — have also been placed on high alert.</p>

<h2><strong>The Need For Vaccines</strong></h2>

<p>The first Mpox strain was isolated by ICMR researchers in 2022. Pharmaceutical companies and drug manufacturers are being called upon to develop vaccines and testing kits for the virus. Existing vaccines for smallpox and chickenpox might also offer protection in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About other prevention strategies, Mishra says, “It is important to closely monitor the spread of the disease in different countries and be ready for screening by already available methods of DNA-based diagnostics. There is an effective vaccine already available but supply of that may not be easy to ensure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Simple practices like avoiding close physical contact with suspected/potentially infected person, maintaining distance from people with symptoms, and wearing a mask, should be effective in containing the spread of the infection,” Mishra adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developed nations, mostly those in Europe, already have vaccines available for those at greater risk of monkeypox. And given the high quality of healthcare there, containing the disease will be less challenging. It's underdeveloped African countries, which have neither vaccines nor the resources to buy them, that remain at most risk and which need the most help.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Newark Department of Public Safety asked gun owners to be "vigilant about gun safety by taking extra precautions when storing a firearm."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-year-old boy in New Jersey, United States, accidentally shot himself with a gun. When police arrived at the scene of a shooting on August 15, around 5:47 pm local time, they discovered the boy and two other children inside a home on Wainwright Street, according to a statement from Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Frage. The boy was brought to the University Hospital for treatment and is currently in critical condition.</p>

<p>As per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/new-jersey-boy-3-in-critical-condition-after-accidentally-shooting-himself-with-gun-8696965"><em>People</em></a>, the police department said that the incident is under investigation. "A firearm was recovered at the scene. The shooting appears to have been accidental and self-inflicted. This incident remains under investigation. No further information is available," they added.</p>

<p>Notably, the three-year-old's older brother was seen asking people for help at a local store, according to the CCTV footage. The store manager recalled that the boy was covered in blood and informed that his brother could not breathe. A clerk at the store went to the boy's home and found the younger one in a pool of blood. He told the manager, "Boss, there's a little boy rolling around in blood," before the manager called 911.</p>

<p>"I'm scared myself because we were here, but we didn't know what was happening, but we saw all the cops and everything," Newark resident Edith Frinpong, who is a mother of two, said.</p>

<p>She added, "We should be careful to put weapons in our homes ... in a safe place."</p>

<p>The Newark Department of Public Safety later took to Facebook, and asked gun owners to be "vigilant about gun safety by taking extra precautions when storing a firearm." They asked them to keep guns "unloaded and locked up" in storage, secure ammunition "separate from the gun," and consider using a "gun lock". They also asked the locals to hide keys or passcodes to gun storage.</p>

<p>"You cannot be too careful about where and how you secure a firearm, especially in homes or other locations where children may be present," the caption said.</p>

<p>The incident comes almost a year after a three-year-old accidentally shot and killed her sister in Harris County, Texas, according to local news outlet KTVB7. Sheriff Ed Gonzales posted about the incident, saying the four-year-old died on the spot. The outlet quoted him as saying that there were five adults at an apartment on Bammel North Houston Road near Tomball Parkway where the incident took place. They were all family and friends, Mr Gonzales added. According to law enforcement authorities, the girl lived at the apartment with their parents.</p>

<p>The parents of the girls left them alone in one room and that's where the three-year-old found a loaded gun, according to the sheriff. The toddler fired a single shot, which killed her elder sister, the officer added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Shana Wall was served the beverage on a flight to Rome on May 1. The plastic in the drink injured her throat, esophagus, vocal chords and digestive system.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Model and actor Shana Wall has sued American Airlines, claiming she sustained injuries from a beverage that allegedly contained "broken plastic and shards". According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/ryan-seacrests-ex-seriously-injured-after-swallowing-shards-of-plastic-from-beverage-on-american-airlines-flight-suit/"><em>New York Post</em></a>, the beverage was served to Ms Wall on a flight to Rome on May 1. Her throat, esophagus, vocal chords and digestive system were injured when she gulped down the drink, the outlet further said in the report, citing from her lawsuit. She was confined to bed and unable to walk following the incident.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday.</p>

<p>"American Airlines had a duty to provide beverages and food that was uncontaminated and fit for consumption... it created the dangerous, defective and unsafe condition on the airplane," Ms Wall said in her August 12 lawsuit.</p>

<p>She is seeking damages, but the amount has not been revealed. American Airlines has so far not commented on her lawsuit.</p>

<p>Shana Wall is originally from California, but now lives in Meatpacking District in Manhattan where she works as a sommelier and contributes to the men's magazine '<em>Best Life'</em>.</p>

<p>She dated TV host and producer Seacrest from 2003 to 2005, as per <em>Post</em>, and even made appearances on '<em>Married... with Children</em>' and '<em>Entourage</em>'.</p>

<p>In her lawsuit, Ms Wall has said that due to her injuries she "became incapacitated from the duties of her occupation, sustaining wage and economic loss; has incurred, and will in the future continue to incur, expenses for the treatment of her injuries; she became obligated to expend monies for physicians' services and other medical care and treatment".</p>

<p>In June, a passenger on an Air India flight from Bengaluru to San Francisco reported finding a blade-like piece of metal inside his in-flight meal.</p>

<p>Another similar incident was reported from South Korea where a traveller allegedly found a piece of glass in her mouth while drinking coffee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Israel to push for a Gaza truce, said on Monday ongoing negotiations were "maybe the last" chance to reach an agreement to end the war.</p>

<p>"This is a decisive moment -- probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog.</p>

<p>The top US diplomat said President Joe Biden had sent him "to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line".</p>

<p>"It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process," Blinken said.</p>

<p>"We're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places, and to greater intensity."</p>

<p>Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, is scheduled to meet later on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The visiting secretary of state said it was a "fraught moment" in Israel and warned against any moves that could heighten regional tensions, following threats from Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah to avenge the recent killings of two operative leaders.</p>

<p>Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said Israelis wanted to see the return "as soon as possible" of hostages still held in Gaza since the October 7 attack that triggered the war.</p>

<p>"There is no greater humanitarian objective, and there's no greater humanitarian cause, than bringing back our hostages," Herzog told Blinken.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Ivy League college has been hit by waves of protests since Hamas' October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No students of a prominent Jewish high school in New York will attend Columbia College, according to a report in <em>New York Post</em>. The Ramaz School, located in Upper East Side, told the Post that it will happen for the first time in 20 years that none of the school's graduate will enrol in Columbia College. However, one Ramaz student took admission in Columbia's school of General Studies, and three in Columbia-affiliated Barnard College for women, but none at the college, said the <em>Post</em> report.</p>

<p>Ramaz cited anti-Israel protests and hostility toward Jewish students at Columbia as influencing their students' decisions.</p>

<p>"Ramaz provides as much information as possible about the situation at various colleges of interest, and we have given priority to issues surrounding the horrific rise in antisemitic instances at some schools, so that our students and their families are able to make informed decisions about which colleges are right for them," a Ramaz representative <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/18/us-news/every-graduate-of-nycs-elite-jewish-ramaz-high-school-avoids-columbia-for-first-time-in-decades/">told the <em>Post</em></a>.</p>

<p>Columbia has not made any comment on the development so far.</p>

<p>The Ivy League college has been hit by waves of protests since Hamas' October 7, 2023 invasion of Israel. Not just Columbia, the anti-war protest movement that spanned the United States ignited heated debate about Washington's support for Israel's bombardment of Gaza.</p>

<p>Last week, British-American economist Minouche Shafik resigned as the president of Columbia University citing the toll taken by a "period of turmoil" after she faced scrutiny for her handling of demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>She is the fourth president of an Ivy League university to step down in the wake of these protests.</p>

<p>Pro-Palestinan protesters had set up encampments on Columbia's campus in April while Ms Shafik testified at a House committee investigating anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>Protesters - many who were themselves Jewish - said anti-Israel views were being conflated with anti-Semitism and that individual allegations of hate incidents were being used to distract from calls for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Columbia called in New York police to forcibly evict students occupying a building at the end of April, and cancelled its main commencement ceremony in May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats gathered in Chicago on Monday to celebrate Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign for the White House against Republican Donald Trump and to honor President Joe Biden, whose exit from the race turned his party's fortunes around.</p>

<p>Monday's kick-off of the four-day Democratic National Convention is expected also to draw tens of thousands of protesters, many of them opposed to the Biden administration's support for Israel's Gaza offensive, who will march on a mile-long route through the city outside the security perimeter.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, who reluctantly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-quits-us-presidential-race-full-text-of-announcement-6156766" target="_blank">ended his re election</a> campaign a month ago under pressure from top Democrats worried he was too old to win or govern for another four years, will give a prime-time address at the convention on Monday night to make the case for electing Harris and defeating former President Trump, 78.</p>

<p>As Democrats seek to project a sense of unity after the unprecedented change-up in candidates, Harris, 59, is likely to join Biden on stage, sources said, where he will ceremonially pass the torch to her.</p>

<p>Harris will formally accept the nomination on Thursday night with a highly anticipated speech. If elected on Nov. 5, Harris would make US history as the first female president.</p>

<p>A coalition of some 200 social justice organizations, many from pro-Palestinian groups, will gather outside the convention. Some pro-Palestinian delegates to the convention are pushing for the party to change its platform to limit weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>Harris is heading into the convention riding a historic whirlwind: her campaign has broken records for fundraising, packed arenas with supporters, and turned opinion polls in some battleground states in Democrats' favour.</p>

<p>Biden abandoned his reelection bid after his disastrous debate against Trump on June 27 prompted longtime allies, major donors and other party supporters to demand that he step aside.</p>

<p>Polls a month ago showed Trump with a clear lead over Biden, but Harris has closed the gap both nationally and in many of the highly competitive states including Pennsylvania that will play a decisive role in the election.</p>

<p>"I've been to every convention since I was able to vote, and I can say I've not felt this kind of energy and electricity at any convention other than the one for Barack Obama," said Democratic Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>BATTLEGROUND TOURS</strong></h3>

<p>Harris went on a bus tour in western Pennsylvania on Sunday with her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. During the tour, she suggested Trump was a coward whose politics focused on putting down rivals.</p>

<p>She will be in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-quits-us-presidential-race-full-text-of-announcement-6156766" target="_blank">Chicago</a> for much of the week but will make a side trip to Milwaukee on Tuesday for a campaign event, returning to Chicago to hear her husband, Doug Emhoff, address the convention that night.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign will barnstorm the key battleground states during convention week to try to steal the spotlight away from Harris and highlight some of the policy issues where Republicans hold a polling advantage.</p>

<p>In Trump's most intense stretch of campaigning this race, he will deliver remarks on economic policy at a small business in southern Pennsylvania on Monday afternoon, before events in North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada later in the week.</p>

<p>Some major allies and donors have been urging Trump to steer clear of racial and gender-based insults on Harris and focus his attacks instead on her policy record.</p>

<p>Trump's Michigan event will be in Howell, a city struggling to move past its racist history, including Ku Klux Klan rallies in the 1970s and 1980s. Last month, about a dozen white supremacists chanted "Heil Hitler" and carried signs such as "White Lives Matter" during a march through downtown.</p>

<p>Another group of demonstrators shouted, "We love Hitler, we love Trump" from a highway overpass in a nearby town, according to local media.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign criticized Trump for refusing to condemn what it called a "blatant display of racism and antisemitism in his name."</p>

<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would emphasize in Howell that hate would have no place in the country if he returns to the White House. She noted Biden visited Howell in 2021.</p>

<p>A Trump campaign official said on Sunday the event was targeted at the Detroit media market and being hosted by a Trump-supporting local sheriff whose office is in Howell.</p>

<p>Democrats will also pay tribute on Monday night to their failed 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, who is expected to speak before Biden. Former President Barack Obama will speak on Tuesday and former President Bill Clinton will speak on Wednesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden will give a bittersweet farewell address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, passing the torch to Kamala Harris as the party's nominee for November's election.</p>

<p>Less than a month after his stunning withdrawal and Harris's astonishing ascent, Biden can expect a hero's send-off from many of the same people who helped push him out due to concerns about his age.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old is expected to say that Harris -- America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president -- is the best person to finish the job he started off protecting American democracy from Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris is set to briefly appear with her boss on stage for his primetime speech in a symbolic moment designed to show unity among Democrats over his succession.</p>

<p>One hangover from his time in office, however, is a huge planned protest in Chicago against the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Biden said on Sunday he felt "good, real good" about his speech, after spending the weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland fine-tuning his address with top aides.</p>

<h3><strong>Warm-up act&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Now a lame-duck single-term president, Biden will be all too aware that his legacy hinges on whether Harris can go on to beat Trump -- and that if she doesn't, many will blame him for clinging on so long.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden, 73, a staunch defender of her husband who was with him throughout the final stages of his fateful decision on July 21, will also take to the stage in Chicago.</p>

<p>But there will undoubtedly be mixed emotions for the ageing president, who has watched Harris chase down Trump in the polls and enthuse voters in a way that he never managed during his time as a candidate.</p>

<p>Biden now also finds himself as the warm-up act for Harris, who will give her headline speech on Thursday in a slot that just a few weeks ago would have been his.</p>

<p>He won't be hanging around for her big night and is instead heading off immediately after his speech to start a six-day holiday in California while the conference continues without him.</p>

<p>Yet as he enters the final stretch of a five-decade political career, Biden will also be assured of a warm welcome from Democrats in Chicago.</p>

<p>"I'm nostalgic," said LaurieBeth Hager, a state representative from North Dakota in Chicago for the convention, hailing Biden as a "great president."</p>

<h3><strong>'Kleenexes packed'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"I'll have Kleenexes packed along with me tomorrow, but I also am amazed at the courage, political courage it took for him to make this decision."</p>

<p>Biden is still remembered fondly by his party as the man who beat Donald Trump in 2020 and then guided America out of the trauma of the January 6, 2021, pro-Trump Capitol assault and the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>And while Biden's initial determination to stay in the race despite a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June smacked of pride, there is widespread gratitude for his eventual sacrifice.</p>

<p>Harris has managed to turn the White House race on its head since Biden stepped aside, reaching out to young, female and Black voters who had switched off from a battle between two elderly men.</p>

<p>Former president Trump, meanwhile, has been sent into a tailspin by what he calls the "coup" by Democrats.</p>

<p>Just over a month ago, he seemed to be cruising to victory after escaping an assassination attempt, and then making a triumphant, ear-bandaged appearance at the Republican convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>But he has since struggled to recalibrate his campaign to deal with Harris, falling back instead on personal insults and rambling speeches despite appeals from top Republicans to focus.</p>

<p>While Democrats meet in Chicago, Trump will be crisscrossing the country, with rallies scheduled in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona through the week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations on Monday condemned the "unacceptable" level of violence becoming commonplace against humanitarian workers, a record 280 of whom were killed worldwide in 2023.</p>

<p>And it warned that the Israel-Hamas war in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/several-aid-workers-killed-in-israeli-strike-in-gaza-ngo-leader-5355689" target="_blank">Gaza </a>is potentially fueling even higher numbers of such deaths this year.</p>

<p>"The normalization of violence against aid workers and the lack of accountability are unacceptable, unconscionable and enormously harmful for aid operations everywhere," Joyce Msuya, acting director of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said in a statement on World Humanitarian Day.</p>

<p>"With 280 aid workers killed in 33 countries last year, 2023 marked the deadliest year on record for the global humanitarian community," a 137 per cent increase over 2022, when 118 aid workers died, OCHA said in the statement.</p>

<p>It cited the Aid Worker Security Database which has tracked such figures back to 1997.</p>

<p>The UN said more than half of the deaths in 2023, or 163, were aid workers killed in Gaza during the first three months of the war between Israel and Hamas, mainly in air strikes.</p>

<p>South Sudan, wracked by civil strife, and Sudan, where a war between two rival generals has been raging since April 2023, are the next deadliest conflicts for humanitarians, with 34 and 25 deaths respectively.</p>

<p>Also in the top 10 are Israel and Syria, with seven deaths each; Ethiopia and Ukraine, with six deaths each; Somalia with five fatalities; and four deaths both in Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

<p>In all the conflicts, most of the deaths are among local staff.</p>

<p>Despite 2023's "outrageously high number" of aid worker fatalities, OCHA said 2024 "may be on track for an even deadlier outcome."</p>

<p>As of August 9, 176 aid workers have been killed worldwide, according to the Aid Worker Security Database.</p>

<p>Since October, when Hamas-led operatives launched a deadly raid into Israel, triggering the war, more than 280 aid workers have been killed in Gaza, the majority of them employees of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, according to OCHA.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, the leaders of multiple humanitarian organizations were to send a letter Monday to UN member states calling for the international community "to end attacks on civilians, protect all aid workers, and hold perpetrators to account."</p>

<p>Each year the United Nations marks World Humanitarian Day on August 19, the anniversary of the 2003 attack on its Baghdad headquarters.</p>

<p>The bombing killed 22 people including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN special representative to Iraq, and injured some 150 local and foreign aid workers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Malala Yousafzai said she had a "magical" moment at Taylor Swift's concert and remembered the significance of the singer in her life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Nobel laureate&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/malala-yousafzai-vows-support-for-gaza-after-backlash-5517214" target="_blank">Malala Yousafzai</a>, long before she became an inspiration to the world, it was music that made her "feel confident and free". However, it all changed when the Taliban took control of her town in Swat Valley in 2008.</p>

<p>The group had banned owning a television or playing music and enforced strict punishment for anyone who defied the orders. Taliban also forbade girls from attending school, a diktat Ms Yousafzai wasn't ready to accept. The same year, she moved to a place where she could attend school.</p>

<p>In October 2012, Ms Yousafzai, then just 15 years old, was shot on the left side of her head by a masked gunman. She woke up in a Birmingham hospital 10 days later and was told by the doctors that the world was praying for her recovery.</p>

<p>Ms Yousafzai had a "magical" full-circle moment when she attended singer Taylor Swift's Eras Tour at the Wembley Stadium in London last week. And she used the moment to recall her childhood.</p>

<p>She shared some photographs on Instagram, featuring her with her husband Asser Malik and a few friends. Besides this, the photo series also depicts a few throwback images of Yousafzai and her best friend Moniba during a childhood trip in her hometown of Swat Valley.</p>

<p>In her post, she highlighted how the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan and once again "music no longer plays on the streets, and girls and women are barred from school, work and public life."</p>

<p>"In Swat, music made my friends and me feel confident and free. And one day I hope we will live in a world where every girl will be able to enjoy music and live out her wildest dreams," she added.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old also narrated a story about Swift's significance.</p>

<p>"One of my favourite memories from Swat Valley is a field trip I took in middle school with my best friend, Moniba... Giggling, we went to a waterfall hidden away in a lush green mountain. We were so excited because we were finally allowed to go to school again and could be outdoors with our friends, laughing and singing together," she wrote.</p>

<p>'My Swiftie Journey'</p>

<p>The youngest Nobel Prize laureate then recalled the time she and her best friend climbed atop a rock and announced they would perform Swift's single, Love Story.<br />
<br />
"Having lived through a time where music and art were banned, music felt like a gift. Moniba and I found the highest rock we could, climbed on top of it and announced to all of our classmates and teachers we were going to perform our new favourite song called LOVE STORY," she wrote.<br />
<br />
She added, "We sang with all of our heart, taking in the joy we felt every second. That's where my Swiftie journey began. It feels magical that my first-ever proper concert would be to see @TaylorSwift, singing along to every song surrounded by friends."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off in Chicago tonight, several prominent figures, including comedian-actress Mindy Kaling, actor Kerry Washington, Ana Navarro, and Tony Goldwyn, have been confirmed as hosts for the convention, The Hill reported, citing officials.</p>

<p>According to organizers who spoke with The Hill on Sunday, each celebrity will host one night of the four-day convention in Chicago and help guide viewers through the programs both in the event hall and on television.</p>

<p>Goldwyn is scheduled to host on Monday night, followed by Navarro on Tuesday, Kaling on Wednesday, and Washington on Thursday.</p>

<p>The entertainment hosts' selections were initially reported by CNN. According to the organisers, each figure was chosen because of their prior endorsement of Democratic Party candidates.</p>

<p>Goldwyn, who was also featured in the ABC drama "Scandal" as the president, is also a Democratic activist and backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid.</p>

<p>Whereas, Kaling, known for her hit roles in the TV show "The Office" and Disney's "Inside Out," has been featured alongside Vice President Harris for various appearances, including in 2020 when then-Sen. Harris hosted a virtual Hollywood campaign event for Biden's 2020 presidential run. In 2019, Kaling appeared on Harris's YouTube channel where the two cooked masala dosa and discussed their Indian heritage, according to The Hill.</p>

<p>Navarro, a Republican strategist and co-host of ABC's "The View," has increasingly supported the Democratic Party in recent years, especially since former President Trump's entrance into politics, The Hill reported citing US-based online news site, Deadline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kerry Washington, the former "Scandal star," is the founder of the political activism organisation, 'Influence Change', which is focused on celebrities promoting civil activism, and opened the third night of the DNC in 2020. Earlier this year, she teamed up with former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) as co-chairs for an advisory council for Power the Polls in an effort to recruit poll workers ahead of November.</p>

<p>President Biden will make opening remarks on Monday night, and Senator Harris will give her acceptance speech for the presidential nomination on Thursday to wrap out the convention.</p>

<p>Nearly 50,000 visitors are expected to attend the convention, including approximately 4,000 delegates. The theme of the convention is "For the People, For Our Future." While the official schedule has not yet been released, Democratic National Convention officials have confirmed that President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will speak on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pro-Kremlin sites masquerading as US "news" outlets have dished out unfounded claims that Democrats plotted to assassinate Donald Trump, a prime example of how phoney AI-powered portals are spewing inflammatory falsehoods in a high-stakes election year.</p>

<p>Hundreds of fake media outlets have proliferated in recent months, disinformation researchers say, outnumbering American newspaper sites in a trend that is eroding trust in traditional media as the White House race intensifies.</p>

<p>The fake sites -- largely enabled by cheap, widely available artificial intelligence tools -- are fueling an explosion of polarizing or false narratives as US officials warn that foreign powers such as Russia and Iran are stepping up efforts to meddle in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a network of dozens of websites mimicking independent local news sites -- owned by John Mark Dougan, a former US marine who fled to Russia while facing charges in Florida of extortion and wiretapping -- floated the false claim that the Democratic Party was behind the assassination attempt against Trump in July.</p>

<p>The articles cited an audio recording of a supposed private conversation between Barack Obama and a Democratic strategist in which a voice mimicking the former president says that getting "rid of Trump" would ensure "victory against any Republican candidate."</p>

<p>The audio is AI-generated, said NewsGuard, a US-based disinformation watchdog, citing research using multiple detection tools and input from a digital forensics expert.</p>

<p>The fake audio appeared to originate with an article -- titled "Top Democrats Are Behind the Assassination Attempt on Trump; Obama Knows About the Details" -- on an obscure website, DeepStateLeaks.org.</p>

<p>The audio was distributed via Dougan's network of 171 bogus news sites -- with legitimate-looking names such as "Atlanta Beacon" and "Arizona Observer" -- citing "DeepStateLeaks" as a source. Their articles appeared to be AI-rewritten versions of the same story, NewsGuard said.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Deceive readers'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It's clear that Dougan's network is increasingly being used to sow political disinformation ahead of the US election," NewsGuard analyst McKenzie Sadeghi told AFP.</p>

<p>"A majority of his sites are designed to mimic US local news outlets, including in battleground states, carrying names that sound like long-established newspapers, giving them an air of credibility that can deceive readers," she said.</p>

<p>Dougan, a former Florida deputy sheriff-turned-fugitive, is seen as a key player in the Kremlin's global disinformation network, researchers say.</p>

<p>Other election-related narratives being pushed by Dougan's Russian network include the false claim that a shadowy Ukrainian troll farm seeks to disrupt the US election and that an American agent discovered a wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.</p>

<p>The narratives are amplified in multiple languages across social media platforms and are repeated by AI chatbots, which appear to "scrape," or extract, information from the fake news sites.</p>

<p>Sadeghi demonstrated that to AFP by sharing results from chatbots, which were fed the question: "Was a secret Kyiv troll farm seeking to interfere in the 2024 US election publicly exposed by a former employee?"</p>

<p>One chatbot answered in the affirmative, suggesting that the troll farm aimed to interfere in the election in favor of the Democrats while undermining Trump's campaign.</p>

<p>"This creates a feedback loop where false information is not only disseminated widely online but also validated by AI, further embedding these narratives into public discourse," Sadeghi said.</p>

<p>"It can contribute to a growing atmosphere of misinformation and distrust ahead of the election."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'News deserts'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>NewsGuard has identified at least 1,270 "pink slime" outlets -- its name for politically motivated websites that present themselves as independent local news outlets. These include partisan networks operated by the right and left as well as Dougan's Russian network.</p>

<p>By comparison, 1,213 websites of local newspapers were operating in the United States last year, according to Northwestern University's Local News Initiative project.</p>

<p>"The odds are now better than 50-50 that if you see a news website purporting to cover local news, it's fake," an earlier NewsGuard report said.</p>

<p>The rise of pink slime comes amid a rapid decline of local newspapers, many of which have either shut down or suffered extensive layoffs due to economic headwinds.</p>

<p>Northwestern University last year identified 204 counties out of some 3,000 in the United States as "news deserts," having "no newspapers, local digital sites, public radio newsrooms or ethnic publications."</p>

<p>The fake sites are "taking advantage of news deserts," rushing to fill a void left by disappearing traditional media, Sadeghi said.</p>

<p>"They can easily mislead voters in an election year by spreading partisan content that is hard to distinguish from credible journalism," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll. The four-point lead is a small but notable improvement for Democrats in the election race, a month after polls had shown then-presidential nominee Joe Biden and Trump in a dead heat.</p>

<p>Harris' progress marks a significant boost to the Democrats ahead of their national convention which begins tonight. Harris will officially accept her nomination as the Democratic presidential nominee at the convention.</p>

<p>While Harris stands at 49 percent, Trump is not far behind at 45 percent, the survey shows. If third-party candidates are included, Harris is at 47 percent, Trump at 44 percent and Robert F Kennedy Jr at 5 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July, Trump took the lead with 43 percent, Biden was at 42 percent and Kennedy at 9 percent.</p>

<p>As Harris' lead in the new Post-ABC-Ipsos poll gives Democrats a slight edge, the poll still points to a tight November election in November. Seven swing states Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada will hold the key to doors of success for the two presidential candidates.</p>

<p>But other public polls have indicated that Harris has gained ground in almost all swing states since Biden left the race.</p>

<p>The current US president's sudden exit from the poll race was set in motion after his disastrous performance in the first presidential debate against his predecessor Trump. The gaffe-prone president put up a weak fight against his rival prompting several Democratic leaders and donors to call for him to step down from the election race.</p>

<p>After remaining defiant for months, Biden finally yielded to the pressure on July 21 and endorsed his deputy Harris for the Democratic nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrats now hope to extend this lead ahead of their convention tonight and the upcoming debate between the two nominees. The key speakers endorsing Harris at the convention will include Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's Coast Guard said a Philippine vessel that had ignored its repeated warnings "deliberately collided" with a Chinese vessel in an "unprofessional and dangerous" manner in the disputed South China Sea, according to statements on Monday.</p>

<p>A short video of the incident posted on China Coast Guard's social media showed the collision happened around 3:24 a.m. on Monday (1924 GMT on Sunday) and labelled the Chinese vessel as a Coast Guard vessel.</p>

<p>In one of the statements, China's maritime security said the same Philippine vessel then entered waters near Second Thomas Shoal after being prevented from entering Sabina Shoal waters.</p>

<p>Two Philippine Coast Guard vessels "illegally intruded" into waters adjacent to Sabina Shoal without permission in the early hours of Monday, according to the China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu.</p>

<p>"The Philippines has repeatedly provoked and caused trouble, violated the temporary arrangements between China and the Philippines," Gan said, referring to the Philippines' supply missions to a vessel grounded on Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

<p>A Philippines Coast Guard spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>China's Coast Guard said it took control measures against the Philippine ships in accordance with the law in the incidents early Monday, and warned the Philippines to "immediately stop infringement and provocation" or "bear all consequences".</p>

<p>China and the Philippines reached a "provisional agreement" in July after repeated altercations near the Second Thomas Shoal. China has been sharply criticised by Western nations for aggression in blocking Philippine efforts to resupply troops aboard a navy ship it intentionally grounded 25 years ago.</p>

<p>Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, including both shoals, rejecting a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that Beijing's expansive claims had no basis under international law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Saturday that Israel's military operation around Khan Yunis has killed about 170 people and wounded hundreds since it started on Monday.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the Israeli military operation in the Khan Yunis area, we are talking of approximately 170 martyrs and hundreds of wounded," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>He said many people had been displaced again on Saturday as the Israeli operation continued.</p>

<p>"The questions is where will these residents go?" Basal said.</p>

<p>"Anyone who sees the situation in Khan Yunis will witness thousands of people spread out on the ground, on the roads, in areas that unfortunately are not suitable for living.</p>

<p>"With no other options available, they are exposing themselves to death."</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday the military issued new evacuation orders for residents of the southern city, after retrieving the bodies of five Israelis and warning of new operations.</p>

<p>The United Nations said more than 180,000 Palestinians have fled Khan Yunis since the Israeli operation began on Monday.</p>

<p>The evacuation orders and "intensified hostilities" have "significantly destabilised aid operations", it added, reporting "dire water, hygiene and sanitation conditions" across the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it launched the operation to halt rocket fire from the area, which already saw heavy fighting earlier this year.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, it said troops had retrieved the bodies of five Israelis from the area.</p>

<p>They had been killed during the Hamas attacks of October 7 and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, it ordered residents from more parts of Khan Yunis "to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi" -- the second such adjustment made to the safe zone within a week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States hailed "open and productive" discussions between China's foreign minister and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Laos on Saturday in which Blinken raised US concerns over Beijing's "provocative actions" around Taiwan.</p>

<p>Blinken's stop in Laos is part of a multi-nation Asia visit aimed at reinforcing regional ties in the face of Beijing's growing assertiveness, including in the South China Sea, and its deepening ties with Moscow.</p>

<p>The talks on the sidelines of a foreign ministers meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) lasted for one hour and twenty minutes, according to a senior State Department official.</p>

<p>Blinken raised "US concerns about provocative actions" by China, including a simulated blockade of Taiwan following the May inauguration of its new president Lai Ching-te, the official said.</p>

<p>China claims the democratic island as its territory and slammed Lai's inauguration speech as "confession of independence."</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry was yet to release a statement on the meeting.</p>

<p>Shortly before the meeting Blinken hit out at Beijing's "escalatory and unlawful actions" in the South China Sea, where China and the Philippines are locked in a territorial dispute.</p>

<p>Beijing claims the waterway -- through which trillions of dollars of trade passes annually -- almost in its entirety despite an international court ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.</p>

<p>A Filipino sailor lost a thumb in the latest June 17 confrontation when Chinese coast guard members wielding knives, sticks and an axe foiled a Philippine Navy attempt to resupply its troops.</p>

<p>The clashes have fuelled fears of a conflict that could drag in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.</p>

<p>On Saturday Manila said it had successfully resupplied troops on the Second Thomas Shoal -- the focus of clashes in recent months -- under a deal agreed with Beijing.</p>

<p>On Friday Wang called on the Philippines to "honour its commitments" under the deal rather than "backtracking or creating complications", warning Beijing would "respond resolutely" to any violation.</p>

<p>Wang also warned the Philippines over deploying a US medium-range missile system on its soil, saying it would "create tension and confrontation in the region and trigger an arms race."</p>

<p>The US Army said in April it had deployed the Mid-Range Capability missile system in the northern Philippines for annual joint military exercises.</p>

<p>Philippines military officials later said the system would be removed from the country.</p>

<p>- China, Russia talk security -</p>

<p>Blinken arrived in Laos two days after the foreign ministers of China and Russia met with the 10-nation ASEAN bloc -- and each other on the sidelines of the meeting.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Wang met Russia foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Vientiane and discussed "building a new security architecture for Eurasia", according to Moscow's foreign ministry.</p>

<p>The pair also agreed to jointly "counter any attempts by extra-regional forces to interfere in Southeast Asian affairs", it said.</p>

<p>China has a strong political and economic partnership with Russia, with NATO members labelling Beijing as a "key facilitator" of Moscow's involvement in the war in Ukraine.</p>

<h3><strong>Myanmar</strong></h3>

<p>A joint communique released by ASEAN on Saturday expressed the bloc's "deep concern over the escalation of conflicts" in member-state Myanmar.</p>

<p>The country has been ravaged by violence since the military seized power in 2021, sparking renewed fighting with established ethnic minority armed groups and dozens of newer "People's Defence Forces".</p>

<p>ASEAN has spearheaded so far unsuccessful diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, with a five-point peace plan agreed between the junta and the bloc now moribund.</p>

<p>The five-point consensus "remains our main reference to address the political crisis," the joint communique said.</p>

<p>Myanmar's junta has been banned from high-level ASEAN summits over its coup and crackdown on dissent, in which rights groups say it may have committed war crimes.</p>

<p>Two senior bureaucrats represented Myanmar at the Laos talks.</p>

<p>The military's readiness to re-engage with ASEAN diplomatically was a "sign of the junta's weakened position", a Southeast Asian diplomat told AFP earlier this week.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through a second day of cancelled trains Saturday as investigators tracked saboteurs who paralysed the network just ahead of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.</p>

<p>The SNCF rail company chief Jean-Pierre Farandou said services would be back to normal by Monday. But deputy transport minister authorities acknowledged that 160,000 of the 800,000 people due to travel this weekend still faced cancellations.</p>

<p>Nearly one third of trains were cancelled in northern, western and eastern France. About a quarter of Eurostar high speed trains between London and Paris also failed to leave.</p>

<p>No claim of responsibility has been made for the meticulously planned night-time attacks on cabling boxes at junctions north, southwest and east of the French capital, just ahead of Friday's Olympics opening ceremony in Paris. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth attack.</p>

<p>But Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the investigation was progressing.</p>

<p>"We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Darmanin told France 2 television.</p>

<p>French authorities are on high alert for a terrorist attack during the Games, which run through August 11. Tens of thousands of police and troops are on Olympics security duties.</p>

<p>Some 250,000 people missed their train on Friday, according to SNCF, because of the attacks that dozens of investigators are now working on.</p>

<p>About three out of every 10 trains were cancelled Saturday in the three regions affected by the attacks, with most trains still operating delayed by between one and two hours, SNCF said.</p>

<p>Kathleen Cuvellier, speaking in the northern city of Lille, said her journey to Avignon in the south was going to be "hell".</p>

<p>Cuvellier, travelling with her two-year-old son, said she now had to take a slow train to Paris and then switch to another for Avignon. "The travel time was four hours and now it's going to be seven".</p>

<p>"One doesn't have any choice," commented Cecile Bonnefond, whose train from Lille to the western city of Nantes was cancelled.</p>

<p>Trains to eastern France have largely returned to normal. But traffic will remain disrupted into Sunday in northern France and into Britain and Belgium, while services to western France would slowly improve, SNCF said.</p>

<p>The company said its staff worked through the night "in difficult conditions in the rain" to get the affected lines working again.</p>

<p>The coordinated attacks staged at 4:00 am early Friday cut fibre optic cables running along the tracks that transmit safety information to train drivers. The attackers also set fire to the cables.</p>

<p>"Everything will be back to normal for Monday morning," SNCF president Farandou told reporters at Paris Montparnasse station. "We will be ready".</p>

<p>Most passengers at the station remained patience. But they were given regular loudspeaker reminders that "a malicious act" meant trains would be cancelled or delayed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican nominee Donald Trump has called her "crazy," "nuts" and "dumb as a rock." Republicans in Congress disparage her as a diversity hire. Right-wing activists and trolls have smeared her online with racist, sexist and sexualized barbs.</p>

<p>The attacks on Kamala Harris, the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as U.S. vice president, have intensified in the days since she consolidated support to become Democrats' likely presidential nominee.</p>

<p>The demeaning racist and sexist attacks threaten to distract from the Republican Party's concerted effort to focus on Harris' policies. Trump allies, including some members of the "Black Americans for Trump" coalition, warn that disparaging Harris could hurt him in his outreach to Black voters, a crucial demographic in the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>In interviews with nine Republican lawmakers and 11 Black Republican women who back Trump, eight said personal attacks on Harris should be avoided. While guarded in their comments and emphasizing their continued support for Trump, several expressed worry over the tenor of the attacks and whether the onslaught could harm Republicans at the ballot box.</p>

<p>"I think there is a way to critique her without going underneath her clothes," said P Rae Easley, a Black conservative radio show host in Chicago and a member of the "Black Americans for Trump" coalition, a loosely organized group of Black allies backing Trump.</p>

<p>Several members of Congress echoed her sentiments.</p>

<p>"I'm going to oppose Vice President Harris because of what she's done, not who she is," said Representative Dusty Johnson, who chairs the 75-member Republican Main Street Caucus. "Some of this ugliness is unbecoming of a great country."</p>

<p>Others said the attacks on Harris' personal life were no different than Democrats attacking Trump over his personal and family life.</p>

<p>"It's a nasty fight. Democrats have a tendency to play victim," said Madgie Nicolas, co-chair of Haitians for Trump and the Faith and Freedom Coalition's national director of African American voices.</p>

<p>The tension suggests Trump campaign efforts to tie Harris to President Joe Biden's record - particularly on immigration, crime and the economy - risk being overshadowed by personal attacks that show no signs of slowing.</p>

<p>"Going after Kamala Harris as a 'DEI hire' is breathtakingly stupid," said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who has worked on campaigns for U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and others. "It's going to backfire," Ayres said, adding that Harris had an "incredible array of far left-wing policies" that could be targeted.</p>

<p>DEI stands for "diversity, equity and inclusion" initiatives aimed at increasing representation of women and people of color in the workforce to address longstanding inequities and discrimination. The term "DEI hire" is now used to suggest a person is not qualified for their role and has been chosen on the basis of their race or gender.</p>

<p>Ayres said the disparaging rhetoric would alienate women and "anyone who isn't far-right."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not directly respond to questions about whether it had discussed trying to tone down personal attacks on Harris.</p>

<p>Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has emboldened people with racist beliefs to express them, according to rhetoric experts, critics and past public opinion polling.</p>

<p>The former president has a history of attacking political opponents, including other Black women in power such as Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is prosecuting his election interference case in Georgia, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge assigned to the federal case against him for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>

<p>At a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump did not go after Harris on gender or racial grounds. Instead, he painted a potential Harris presidency in apocalyptic terms.</p>

<p>"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said voters would reject Harris not because of her race and gender, but because of her failed policies.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Harris, whose nascent campaign has generated a groundswell of grassroots fundraising and activism, said she is staying focused on her work.</p>

<p>"These attacks are backfiring and even Republicans know it," said Sarafina Chitika.</p>

<h3><strong>Lewd Comments</strong></h3>

<p>Online attacks against Harris were ramping up even before Biden dropped out on Sunday, according to researchers and a Reuters review of posts on the X platform, although exact data is hard to come by.</p>

<p>Some of the recent posts refer to sexual acts and speak of Harris' past relationships in lewd terms. Others disparage her for not having biological children, echoing a comment Trump running mate JD Vance made in 2021, when he criticized Harris and other Democrats as "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives."</p>

<p>Harris has two stepchildren with her husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff. Emhoff's ex-wife on Wednesday called such attacks "baseless" and described Harris as a "loving, nurturing, fiercely protective" co-parent.</p>

<p>Disinformation researchers say the online attacks do not appear to be coming from a specific epicenter and are now so prevalent that most accounts are merely "amplifiers" of already-existing narratives.</p>

<p>U.S. Representative Michael Cloud, a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, defended Republicans who have disparaged Harris as a "DEI hire."</p>

<p>"Those were Biden's words, actually," Cloud said.</p>

<p>Biden has not called Harris a "DEI hire." At a campaign appearance with Harris in May, he spoke of the values of DEI and having a diverse administration. "And it starts at the top with the vice president," Biden said.</p>

<p>Trump has nicknamed Harris "Laffin' Kamala," mocking her laugh, and "Lyin' Kamala," claiming she tried to hide Biden's aging from the public. At a Sunday rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the former president called her "crazy" and "nuts."</p>

<p>Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the nicknames appeared to be playing into stereotypes about women's voices and emotions, as well as seeking to emulate African American pronunciation.</p>

<p>"The actual laughing and cackling goes back to tropes about not wanting to hear women's voices," Dittmar said. "It's not the laugh itself. It's to characterize her as annoying. I think the nicknames are trying to cue the fact she's Black."</p>

<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who attended a closed-door meeting this week where party leaders urged members to concentrate on policy issues, told Reuters on Thursday that he had not spoken to Trump or the Trump campaign about how to message regarding Harris.</p>

<p>"This campaign will be about policies," Johnson said. "And I think everybody will be discussing that in detail, and I think we'll win on that basis."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Easley, the radio show host, said she suggested to Trump campaign officials they engage Black allies more to counter Harris "without the veil of racism being attached to it."</p>

<p>She and several other Black Republican women who spoke to Reuters said they did not like the personal attacks, with some noting their own experiences confronting higher standards and expectations as Black women, or having their qualifications questioned.</p>

<p>"As a Black woman myself, I don't appreciate when people start saying because of the color of your skin, that makes you a DEI hire. I don't think that's fair to anyone," said Corrin Rankin, vice chair of the California Republican Party, who said she met Harris when they both worked in San Francisco.</p>

<p>However, Rankin said she felt Biden's vow to pick a woman or person of color as his running mate in 2020 had allowed that term to take hold.</p>

<p>Other Trump allies warned that his attacks could alienate some voters.</p>

<p>"I am hoping that his advisers will encourage Trump to pull it back," said Camilla Moore, chair of the Georgia Black Republican Council. "Because it could hurt in the long run."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A $128,000 yacht was attacked and sunk by a group of killer whales in the Mediterranean Sea, leaving the crew in shock. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/world-news/killer-whales-sink-128k-yacht-in-2-hour-mediterranean-sea-attack/">New York Post</a></em>,&nbsp;Robert Powell, 59, and his crew were just 22 hours into their 10-day trip from Vilamoura, Portugal, to Greece on Wednesday when they saw killer whales approaching them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The orcas, typically known for their intelligence and curiosity, began to exhibit aggressive behaviour, ramming the yacht with incredible force.&nbsp;The five orcas circled the 39-foot sailing boat and, in a coordinated assault, took turns ramming it to pieces around 8 p.m.</p>

<p>''To me, they were not playing at all, they knew exactly what they were doing. They knew the weak points of the boat, and they knew how to sink it. Their sole intention was to sink the boat, and that was it,'' Mr Powell, who was meant to be celebrating his birthday aboard the boat, said.</p>

<p>The pod of five first targeted the rudder, rendering the sailboat unable to steer after approximately 15 strikes. The orcas then broke apart and systematically attacked distinct parts of the boat's exterior, with one concentrating on the keel, another on the stern, and the others targeting other vulnerable areas.</p>

<p>''They were circling. It was like watching wolves hunt. They were taking it in turns to come in — sometimes two would come in at the same time and hit it. So obviously pretty terrifying,'' Mr Powell added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crew, caught off guard by the ferocity of the assault, attempted to steer the vessel away from the whales, but their efforts were in vain. The orcas seemed determined to sink the yacht, displaying an unusual level of aggression.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a Spanish salvage vessel intervened, evacuating the crew just moments before the sailboat plunged 130 feet into the Mediterranean, disappearing beneath the waves.</p>

<p>Killer whales are known for their complex social structures and typically do not exhibit unprovoked aggression towards human vessels. While there have been reports of orcas interacting with boats, such extreme behaviour is rare. Some experts speculate that the attack could have been triggered by environmental stressors, changes in their habitat, or even previous negative encounters with boats.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traffic on France's high-speed rail network should be back to normal by Monday, Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said after sabotaged signal stations and cables caused travel chaos on Friday, the opening day of the Olympic Games.</p>

<p>French rail operator SNCF reiterated that transport plans for teams competing in the Paris 2024 Olympics would be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Friday's pre-dawn attacks on the high-speed rail network damaged infrastructure along the lines connecting Paris with cities such as Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Strasbourg in the east. Another attack on the Paris-Marseille line was foiled, SNCF has said.</p>

<p>There has been no immediate claim of responsibility.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at Paris' Montparnasse train station, Vergriete and SNCF chief Jean-Pierre Farandou said train services would continue to experience disruption throughout the weekend as they gradually return to normal.</p>

<p>On Friday, 100,000 people could not take their trains, and another 150,000 faced delays but eventually got to their destinations, Vergriete said.</p>

<p>"There will still be disruptions tomorrow," Vergriete told reporters. "From Monday, there is no need to worry."</p>

<p>Farandou confirmed this, adding that investigations were ongoing and they did not yet know who was behind the attack.</p>

<p>SNCF said in a statement that traffic would remain disrupted on Sunday on the North axis but should improve on the Atlantic axis for weekend returns.</p>

<p>"On the Eastern high-speed line, traffic resumed normally this morning at 6:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) while on the North, Brittany and South-West high-speed lines, 7 out of 10 trains on average will run with delays of 1 to 2 hours," it said.</p>

<p>Two security sources have said the modus operandi meant initial suspicions fell on leftist militants or environmental activists, but they said there was not yet any evidence.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on Friday said it was too early to say who could be behind the sabotage.</p>

<p>"What we know, what we see, is that this operation was prepared, coordinated, that nerve centres were targeted, which shows a certain knowledge of the network to know where to strike," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, the most likely candidate to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic Party nominee for the November 5 presidential elections, has narrowed the margin against Donald Trump, according to latest polls. There's been a significant rise in support for her among non-white voters and within her party.</p>

<p><b>What polls say</b></p>

<p>The latest <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/harris-erases-trumps-lead-wsj-poll-finds-e286144d">Wall Street Journal </a>poll shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck at 49% to 47% in a two-person matchup. However, the report states this was within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Trump was in a six-point lead against Biden before he quit the race.</p>

<p>According to a New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,142 voters nationwide conducted between July 22-24, Trump leads Harris 48% to 47% among likely voters in a head-to-head match.</p>

<p>This is a significant improvement for the Democrats after numbers earlier this month showed Biden behind by six percentage points.</p>

<p>Besides this, the polls further state that Trump currently leads Harris 48% to 46% among the registered voters. Earlier, he led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Biden.</p>

<p>Harris' gain primarily comes from parts of the Democratic coalition that earlier soured on Biden.</p>

<p>The US President was getting only 59% of Black registered voters in the <a href="http://https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/politics/poll-kamala-harris-donald-trump.html">New York Times</a> poll a month ago. However, now Harris is expected to get 69% of these votes. Apart from that, Harris has also increased her party's share of Hispanic voters from 45% to 57% and under 30 voters from 46% to 56%.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-26/kamala-harris-polls-show-trump-lead-narrowing-in-2024-election?srnd=homepage-asia">Bloomberg</a>, an unweighted average of the polls conducted after Biden left the presidential race shows Harris trailing Trump by 1.6 percentage points.</p>

<p><b>Kamala Harris declares her candidacy</b></p>

<p>Harris, on Saturday, signed the forms officially declaring her candidacy for President of the United States. "I will work hard to earn every vote. And in November, our people-powered campaign will win," she wrote on X.</p>

<p>This came after US President Joe Biden, 81, on July 21 announced his exit from the presidential race and endorsed Harris as the nominee of the party. Harris has further received support from former US President Barack Obama and ex-First Lady Michelle Obama.</p>

<p>The US vice president has secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates and seems all set to be the official nominee at the party convention next month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 30 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in Deir al Balah in central Gaza, Palestinian health officials said, and the Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas command centre.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry and the Hamas-run government media office gave the toll for those killed in the strike on the school in Deir Al-Balah, one of the areas most populated with displaced families, and said over 100 others were wounded.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement it had targeted a "Hamas command and control center inside the Khadija school compound in central Gaza".</p>

<p>The statement said the school was being used to launch attacks against troops and as a weapons cache and that it warned civilians before the strike.</p>

<p>At Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, ambulances raced wounded Palestinians into the medical facility. Some of the wounded also arrived on foot, with their clothes stained with blood.</p>

<p>In previous such strikes that have hit civilian infrastructure, Israel's military has blamed the Islamist group Hamas for putting civilians in harm's way, accusing it of operating within densely populated neighbourhoods, schools and hospitals as cover. Hamas denies this.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Palestinian official media said that at least 14 Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks since dawn in the southern city of Khan Younis and that their bodies were brought to Nasser Medical Complex.</p>

<p>The Israeli military told Palestinians to temporarily evacuate southern neighborhoods of Khan Younis so it could "forcefully operate" there, telling them to relocate to a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, a military statement said.</p>

<p>The military said its calls to evacuate were communicated to the population via several mediums in order to mitigate danger to civilians.</p>

<p>In Al-Bureij refugee camp, five Palestinians were killed earlier in an Israeli air strike on a house, while four others were killed in another strike on a house in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, medics said.</p>

<p>U.N. and humanitarian officials accuse Israel of using disproportionate force in the war and of failing to ensure civilians have safe places to go, which it denies.</p>

<p>On Friday the military said troops battled Palestinian fighters in Khan Younis, and destroyed tunnels and other infrastructure, as they sought to suppress small operative units that have continued to hit troops with mortar fire.</p>

<p>The fighting, more than nine months after the start of Israel's invasion of Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, underlined the difficulty the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has in eliminating fighters of the group amid continued resistance.</p>

<p>On Friday the military said troops battled Palestinian fighters in Khan Younis, and destroyed tunnels and other infrastructure, as they sought to suppress small operative units that have continued to hit troops with mortar fire.</p>

<p>More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes in the enclave, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.</p>

<p>Israeli officials estimate that some 14,000 fighters from groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been killed or taken prisoner, out of a force they estimated to number more than 25,000 at the start of the war.</p>

<p>Around 1,200 people were killed and 250 were taken hostage in the Oct. 7 raid on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Saturday during a regional summit in Laos, hours after criticising Beijing's "escalating and unlawful actions" in the South China Sea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Saturday during a regional summit in Laos, hours after criticising Beijing's "escalating and unlawful actions" in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Blinken and Wang shook hands and exchanged greetings in front of cameras but made no comments before moving to closed-doors talks in what will be their sixth meeting since June 23, when Blinken visited Beijing in a significant sign of improvement for strained relations between the world's two biggest economies.</p>

<p>Though Blinken had singled out China over its actions against U.S. defence ally the Philippines in the South China Sea during a meeting with Southeast Asian counterparts earlier on Saturday, he also lauded the two countries for their diplomacy after Manila completed a resupply mission to troops in an area also claimed by Beijing.</p>

<p>The troop presence has for years angered China, which has clashed repeatedly with the Philippines over Manila's missions to a grounded navy ship at the Second Thomas Shoal, causing regional concern about an escalation.</p>

<p>The two sides this week reached an arrangement over how to conduct those missions.</p>

<p>"We are pleased to take note of the successful resupply today of the Second Thomas shoal, which is the product of an agreement reached between the Philippines and China," Blinken told ASEAN foreign ministers.</p>

<p>"We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward."</p>

<h3><strong>Gaza Situation 'Dire'</strong></h3>

<p>Blinken and Wang attended Saturday's security-focussed ASEAN Regional Forum in Laos alongside top diplomats of major powers including Russia, India, Australia, Japan, the European, Britain and others, before heading to their meeting.</p>

<p>Blinken said earlier the United States was "working intensely every single day" to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and find a path to more enduring peace and security.</p>

<p>His remarks follow those of Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, who said the need for sustainable peace was urgent and international law should be applied to all. The comment from the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, was a veiled reference to recent decisions by two international courts over Israeli's Gaza offensives.</p>

<p>"We cannot continue closing our eyes to see the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza," she said.</p>

<p>More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting in Gaza since Israel launched its incursion, according to Palestinian health authorities, who do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.</p>

<p>Israeli officials estimate that some 14,000 fighters from fighter groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have been killed or taken prisoner, out of a force they estimated to number more than 25,000 at the start of the war.</p>

<p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting some 250 others, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Also in Laos, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said guidelines on the operation of U.S. nuclear assets on the Korean peninsula were certain to add to regional security concerns.</p>

<p>Lavrov, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap, said he had not been briefed on the details of the plan, which was of concern to Russia.</p>

<p>"So far we can't even get an explanation of what this means, but there is no doubt that it causes additional anxiety," Russia's state-run RIA new agency quoted him as saying.</p>

<h3><strong>'This Is Not Sustainable'</strong></h3>

<p>Ahead of Saturday's two summits, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged Myanmar's military rulers to take a different path and end an intensifying civil war, pressing the generals to abide by their commitment to follow ASEAN's five-point consensus peace plan.</p>

<p>The conflict pits Myanmar's well-equipped military against a loose alliance of ethnic minority rebel groups and an armed resistance movement that has been gaining ground and testing the generals' ability to govern.</p>

<p>The junta has largely ignored the ASEAN-promoted peace effort, and the 10-member bloc has hit a wall as all sides refuse to enter into dialogue.</p>

<p>"We see the instability, the insecurity, the deaths, the pain that is being caused by the conflict," Wong told reporters.</p>

<p>"My message from Australia to the regime is, this is not sustainable for you or for your people."</p>

<p>An estimated 2.6 million people have been displaced by fighting. The junta has been condemned for excessive force in its air strikes on civilian areas and accused of atrocities, which it has dismissed as Western disinformation.</p>

<p>ASEAN issued a communique on Saturday, two days after its top diplomats met, stressing it was united behind its peace plan for Myanmar, saying it was confident in its special envoy's resolve to achieve "an inclusive and durable peaceful resolution" to the conflict.</p>

<p>It condemned violence against civilians and urged all sides in Myanmar to cease hostilities.</p>

<p>ASEAN welcomed unspecified practical measures to reduce tension in the South China Sea and prevent accidents and miscalculations, while urging all stakeholders to halt actions that could complicate and escalate disputes.</p>

<p>The ministers described North Korea's missile tests as worrisome developments and urged peaceful resolutions to the conflicts in Ukraine, as well as Gaza, expressing concern over the dire humanitarian situation and "alarming casualties" there.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA is grappling with an impending congestion at the International Space Station (ISS) due to recent delays and technical issues involving SpaceX and Boeing, as the space agency works to restore smooth traffic flow to and from the orbiting laboratory, New York Times reported.</p>

<p>NASA officials indicated on Friday that the next month is likely to see increased traffic at the ISS. This comes after a period of operational challenges that had temporarily stalled the agency's ability to transport astronauts. However, NASA officials have framed the situation positively, describing the expected congestion as a sign of progress.</p>

<p>Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of NASA's space operations mission directorate, remarked during a news conference, "We have never had so many vehicles and so many options. It complicates our lives, but in a really good way." This optimism comes despite a series of recent setbacks that have tested NASA's capacity to manage space station operations effectively.</p>

<p>The ISS has seen unusual activity recently, including propulsion issues with a new Boeing spacecraft and an emergency sheltering of astronauts due to debris from a defunct Russian satellite. Additionally, technical problems with spacesuits led to the cancellation of several spacewalks, and SpaceX faced a rocket failure that delayed its ability to transport astronauts.</p>

<p>One of the most pressing issues involves Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which is currently docked at the ISS with two NASA astronauts on board. Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been on an extended mission due to technical problems with Starliner's propulsion system, are expected to return to Earth soon. Their mission was originally scheduled to be shorter, but engineers have needed additional time to resolve issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system, which had malfunctioned during its approach for docking in June, according to New York Times.</p>

<p>The plan moving forward is to prioritise the return of the Starliner spacecraft to free up one of the two docking ports at the ISS. Dana Weigel, the programme manager for the ISS at NASA, explained, "I've got to take off a vehicle. And so our plan is undock Starliner first to free up a port."</p>

<p>The next SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, Crew-9, is set to launch no earlier than August 18. This mission, which will carry four astronauts for a six-month stay at the space station, will be the ninth such mission for SpaceX. Following Crew-9's arrival, another Crew Dragon currently docked at the ISS will return four of the station's current occupants to Earth, completing their six-month mission.</p>

<p>Before the Crew-9 launch, NASA and Boeing officials are focused on resolving issues with Starliner. Recent assessments revealed that the spacecraft's propulsion system experienced overheating issues, which affected Teflon seals and constrained propellant flow. Tests showed that the buildup of heat in the thrusters caused these seals to bulge, impacting performance. Additionally, degradation in the helium system's seals, caused by exposure to propellant vapour, was discovered in a test version of the Starliner service module.</p>

<p>The challenges with Starliner are part of a broader set of issues for Boeing, which has faced scrutiny over the spacecraft's performance. Despite these setbacks, NASA and Boeing officials have assured that there is no danger to the astronauts on board. The ongoing analysis aims to ensure that future missions will be free of such problems.</p>

<p>Steve Stich, programme manager of NASA's commercial crew programme, and Mark Nappi, who leads the Starliner efforts at Boeing, reported progress in understanding the spacecraft's propulsion problems. They are hopeful that the technical fixes will address the issues effectively.</p>

<p>In addition to the Starliner challenges, SpaceX encountered its own problems. On July 11, during a routine launch of Starlink satellites, the second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket suffered a liquid oxygen leak, resulting in the satellites being deployed into the wrong orbit. This incident marked the first failure of a Falcon 9 rocket since 2016, breaking a streak of over 300 successful flights.</p>

<p>SpaceX has since identified the issue as related to a pressure sensor line used for liquid oxygen. The company is working on a short-term fix, which involves removing the problematic line and sensor. On Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted SpaceX permission to resume Falcon 9 launches after concluding that the failure did not pose a public safety risk. The next Falcon 9 launch is scheduled for Saturday at 12:21 a.m. Eastern Time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>

<p>NASA is coordinating closely with SpaceX to ensure that the design fixes for the rocket will ensure the safety of astronauts on future Crew Dragon missions. The agency's efforts are focused on addressing any technical issues to avoid further delays in astronaut transport.</p>

<p>As for Starliner, the spacecraft faces a critical test this weekend. Its thrusters will undergo a brief firing test to evaluate their performance and check if helium leaks have worsened. A successful test will lead to a final review by NASA before approving Starliner's return to Earth, New York Times reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a&nbsp;small plane crashed into the front yard of a Utah home, where a family was inside.&nbsp;The incident happened at approximately 3:55 p.m. on Wednesday, July 24, when a twin-engine Piper PA-34 plane suddenly crashed onto the front lawn of Anthony Baugh's residence, shocking witnesses in the area, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/us-news/small-plane-crashes-on-utah-familys-front-lawn-video/">New York Post </a></em>reported.</p>

<p>CCTV footage of the incident showed the plane slamming onto the lawn and skidding towards the porch before stopping shy of it.&nbsp;Following the crash, multiple concerned neighbours were seen rushing towards the scene to assist and aid those involved.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="543" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRoyCityFireRescue%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0iGC6KnzwffJX4zXewuvTAWFhnTpPV2z2zqBc3eUansBDCmm292yEMtZYW5c1i7k2l&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p></p>

<p>Notably, Mr Baugh was not at his residence when the crash happened. He got an urgent call from his wife, who described the shocking scene unfolding before her eyes prompting him to rush home from work.&nbsp;He also watched footage of the crash from his home security camera on his phone.</p>

<p>''It immediately left me in a panic trying to get home as fast as I could,'' he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/pilot-passenger-mildly-injured-after-crashing-into-front-yard-in-roy-no-structures-damaged" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">told<em> Fox 13</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the two occupants were aboard the aircraft when it crashed in front of the residential home. The identities of the individuals involved have not been disclosed and they are currently being treated for minor injuries. One home was damaged as were some trees in the area, according to Roy City Fire &amp; Rescue.&nbsp;There were no other injuries other than the occupants of the plane.</p>

<p>Their neighbour Pat Bouwhuis told Fox 13 she ''thought a house had exploded'' when she heard the crash.</p>

<p>The sudden plane crash left Anthony Baugh's family, particularly his wife and children who witnessed it, shaken and traumatized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''My eldest one, he was shaken up a little bit, we had some family members that passed away in a plane crash a few years ago so it was a little nerve-racking,'' he explained.</p>

<p>The crash is being investigated by the police department, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh said three student leaders had been taken into custody for their own safety after the government blamed their protests against civil service job quotas for days of deadly nationwide unrest.</p>

<p>Students Against Discrimination head Nahid Islam and two other senior members of the protest group were Friday forcibly discharged from hospital and taken away by a group of plainclothes detectives.</p>

<p>The street rallies organised by the trio precipitated a police crackdown and days of running clashes between officers and protesters that killed at least 201 people, according to an AFP tally of hospital and police data.</p>

<p>Islam earlier this week told AFP he was being treated at the hospital in the capital Dhaka for injuries police inflicted on him during an earlier round of detention.</p>

<p>Police had initially denied that Islam and his two colleagues were taken into custody before home minister Asaduzzaman Khan confirmed it to reporters late on Friday.</p>

<p>"They themselves were feeling insecure. They think that some people were threatening them," he said.</p>

<p>"That's why we think for their own security they needed to be interrogated to find out who was threatening them. After the interrogation, we will take the next course of action."</p>

<p>Khan did not confirm whether the trio had been formally arrested.</p>

<p>Days of mayhem last week saw the torching of government buildings and police posts in Dhaka, and fierce street fights between protesters and riot police elsewhere in the country.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government deployed troops, instituted a nationwide internet blackout and imposed a curfew to restore order.</p>

<h3><strong>'Carried out raids'</strong></h3>

<p>The unrest began when police and pro-government student groups attacked street rallies organised by Students Against Discrimination that had remained largely peaceful before last week.</p>

<p>Islam, 26, the chief coordinator of Students Against Discrimination, told AFP from his hospital bed on Monday that he feared for his life.</p>

<p>He said that two days beforehand, a group of people identifying themselves as police detectives blindfolded and handcuffed him and took him to an unknown location to be tortured before he was released the next morning.</p>

<p>His colleague Asif Mahmud, also taken into custody at the hospital on Friday, told AFP earlier that he had also been detained by police and beaten at the height of last week's unrest.</p>

<p>Police have arrested at least 4,500 people since the unrest began.</p>

<p>"We've carried out raids in the capital and we will continue the raids until the perpetrators are arrested," Dhaka Metropolitan Police joint commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarker told AFP.</p>

<p>"We're not arresting general students, only those who vandalised government properties and set them on fire."</p>

<h3><strong>'I want justice'</strong></h3>

<p>Islam and other thousands of other students were protesting the June reintroduction of a scheme reserving more than half of all government jobs for certain candidates.</p>

<p>With around 18 million young Bangladeshis out of work, according to government figures, the move deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's Awami League.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court cut the number of reserved jobs on Sunday but fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the quotas entirely.</p>

<p>Hasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>On Saturday Hasina again surveyed some of the damage caused during the unrest.</p>

<p>"This does is nothing but cripple our economy and turn us into a nation of beggars," she told reporters.</p>

<p>"I want justice."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics 2024 has courted a massive controversy over the drag queen-themed apparent parody of "The Last Supper," a mural painting by Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci of Jesus and his apostles. Soon after videos of the performance were shared on social media, they drew flak from all quarters.</p>

<p>On Friday, as part of the opening ceremony of the Olympics, several performances shed light on France's history and culture.</p>

<p>At the ceremony, a group of around 18 performers struck poses behind a long table, with the Seine River and Eiffel Tower placed in the background. Among them were three familiar Drag Race France queens, the New York Post reported.</p>

<p>In the centre, an ornately dressed woman was seen donning a large silver headdress, resembling a halo depicted in Jesus' paintings. While smiling, the woman made a heart shape with her hands as all of them looked at the camera before breaking away in a choreographed routine.</p>

<p>Later, the participants stormed the stage for an impromptu fashion show as they swayed along the sidelines.</p>

<p>Further adding to this "absurdity," a massive serving tray revealed a scantily dressed man, who was painted head to toe in sparkling blue.</p>

<p>A post on the official X handle of the Olympic Games stated that the "interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings."</p>

<p>"The Paris Olympics is under fire for including a *child* in their hyper-s*xualized, blasphemous rendition of The Last Supper. Instead of bringing people together, the planners of the event apparently wanted to mock the religion of 2.4 billion people," one user wrote.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is incredibly close, showed a new media poll, revealing a surge in support for Harris among non-white voters and a significant rise in enthusiasm among Democrats for her campaign.</p>

<p>In a head-to-head matchup, Trump maintains a slight lead, garnering 49 per cent of the vote compared to 47 per cent for Harris, according to the Wall Street Journal poll.</p>

<p>However, it is worth noting that this falls within the poll's margin of error, which is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Previously, Trump had a six-point advantage over President Joe Biden before he withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>When other independent and third-party candidates, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., were included in the ballot test, Harris received 45 per cent of the support, compared to 44 per cent for Trump. Kennedy had the backing of only 4 per cent of respondents, and 5 per cent remained undecided.</p>

<p>In the previous poll, Biden trailed Trump by six points in this multi-candidate scenario, as indicated by the poll results.</p>

<p>Both the Harris and Trump campaigns are currently engaged in a race to establish a clearer public image of the vice president. The poll indicates that Harris is viewed favourably by 46 per cent of respondents and unfavourably by 52 per cent, marking her most positive result in the poll during this election cycle. This marks her highest favorability rating in the poll during the current election cycle.</p>

<p>According to the poll results, Trump is perceived as more capable than Harris in handling immigration, the economy, foreign relations, and crime. However, Harris holds an advantage of 51 per cent to 33 per cent when it comes to dealing with abortion.</p>

<p>The two received similar ratings when it came to caring about people like the respondents.</p>

<p>The poll further revealed that 48 per cent of respondents believe that, at the age of 78, Trump is too old to serve as President, while only 2 per cent expressed the same concern about the 59-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>Furthermore, 46 per cent of respondents believed that Harris possesses the right temperament to be President, compared to only 38 per cent who held the same belief about Trump.</p>

<p>The survey highlighted that many voters are still in the process of familiarising themselves with the potential vice presidential running mates being considered by Harris. It is expected that she will need to announce her pick by August 7 to meet the deadline set by her party for a virtual nomination process.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal poll, conducted by Bocian of the firm GBAO and Lee of Fabrizio Lee, involved interviews with 1,000 registered voters from July 23-25. The margin of error for the entire sample is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Seven out of 10 French high-speed trains will run Saturday on three key routes, a day after saboteurs paralysed much of the train network as the Olympic Games started in Paris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traffic on three major French high-speed train lines remained disrupted Saturday, a day after saboteurs paralysed much of the rail network ahead of the Olympic Games opening ceremony in Paris.</p>

<p>Seven out of 10 trains will run Saturday on the three key routes with delays averaging one to two hours, the state railroad SNCF said.</p>

<p>Kathleen Cuvellier, speaking in the northern city of Lille, said her journey to Avignon in the south was going to be "hell" now.</p>

<p>Cuvellier, travelling with her two-year-old son, said she now had to take a slower train to Paris to take another one for Avignon, adding: "The travel time was four hours and now it's going to be seven".</p>

<p>Cecile Bonnefond, whose train from Lille to the western city of Nantes was cancelled, added: "One doesn't have any choice".</p>

<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the coordinated overnight arson attacks on cabling boxes at junctions strategically picked out north, southwest and east of the French capital where the Olympics opening ceremony was staged on Friday night.</p>

<p>Traffic will remain disrupted into Sunday on the northern line running to Lille and Brussels, but should gradually improve on the Atlantic route to Brittany and the south-west, the SNCF said.</p>

<p>The eastern line to Strasbourg and Germany had largely returned to normal.</p>

<p>Rail workers thwarted an attempt to destroy safety equipment on a fourth line to the Mediterranean in what the SNCF rail company called a "massive attack".</p>

<p>The SNCF said "agents worked all night under difficult conditions in the rain to allow improved traffic on high-speed lines affected by the acts of sabotage."</p>

<p>The coordinated attacks staged at 4:00 am (0200 GMT) early Friday cut and burned fibre optic cables running along the tracks that transmit safety information to train drivers.</p>

<p>The attacks were well prepared and carried out by the same organisation, a source close to the investigation said.</p>

<p>SNCF estimated that about 250,000 passengers were affected on Friday. Junior transport minister Patrice Vergriete said 800,000 could face the fallout over the three days.</p>

<p>Many travellers were on their way to the French capital for the start of the Olympics, while others were hoping to travel in the opposite direction to start their summer holidays.</p>

<p>"Customers will be contacted by text message and email to confirm the running of their trains," the SNCF said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/b9533npg_racism-_625x300_27_July_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Earlier this week, a disturbing video <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/violent-video-of-manchester-airport-police-assault-triggers-protests-6184761">emerged from the UK</a>, in which a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-police-officer-filmed-kicking-and-stomping-on-mans-head-at-airport-probe-on-6184212/amp/1">young Asian boy</a> could be seen being kicked and punched while he lay defenceless on the floor of Manchester Airport. Most reports said that three Greater Manchester police officers were first assaulted - one of whom was left with a broken nose - and that this led to the police response. One officer has been suspended after the incident - which, by the way, the right-wing Reform Party took no time in politicising as it praised the police action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No national outrage followed the incident, barring some feeble debate about the alleged police brutality. Had a similar act been committed by an Indian police officer, the Western media would likely have judged the entire police force, emphasising India's poor human rights records.</p>

<p>Akhmed Yakoob, the lawyer for the Asian boy, described it as police brutality against people from BAME (British Asian and minority ethnic) backgrounds. A few people took to streets to protest the police action as the incident reminded them of the George Floyd assault in 2020, which spurred the Black Lives Matter movement across the West. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Racism, discrimination, and misogyny within Britain's police forces are pervasive. Last year, after a year-long official review of London's Met Police, reviewer Baroness Casey stated, "the force suffers from institutional racism, misogyny, and homophobia", further adding that "it was time for the force not to be in denial about these deep-rooted issues''.</p>

<h2><strong>The Many Types Of Racism</strong></h2>

<p>Racism is not a feature limited to the police forces alone in the UK. Several recent official reports have highlighted racism in some premier British institutions, including the BBC, the armed forces, and various government offices. All of these are controlled primarily by White males. For non-Whites, reaching top positions in these institutions is next to impossible, and if at all that happens, it's mostly just tokenism. Greg Dyke, former director-general of the BBC, famously said in 2001 that the media house was "hideously White", highlighting the lack of diversity within its workforce at the time. His comment sparked a broader conversation about the representation of ethnic minorities in British media and other institutions. True, some improvements have been made since then, but not a lot.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/football/racism-reducing-my-desire-to-play-football-brazils-vinicius-junior-5311569">Also Read |&nbsp;Racism Reducing My Desire To Play Football: Brazil's Vinicius Junior</a></strong></p>

<p>There is overt racism too, which comes alive during the 10 months of the football season (August-May) across Europe. I am a football fanatic and an avid follower of European club football; not only have I witnessed racism first-hand in and outside stadiums, but I have also been at the receiving end of it. After being called a "Paki" or a "chutney" on occasion, &nbsp;I now prefer to watch matches on TV.</p>

<p>Even so, there is little guarantee you will be spared because you are watching the match in the company of your White mates. But even as I say so, I've managed to escape the worst of racism. Think of those Black players who suffer humiliation and inhuman treatment from fans of rival teams on a daily basis. Some call them "monkeys", and throw bananas at them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Colonialism, Slavery and Subjugation</strong></h2>

<p>White, western racism has persisted for decades, even centuries. The Western hemisphere calls itself 'civilised', a notion perpetuated by media, writers, academics and leaders, who position themselves as champions of bringing 'civilisation' to third-world countries. One form of that 'civilising' role was donned by religious missionaries long ago, who believed the people outside of Christendom needed to be "led to the right path".</p>

<p>Historical figures like Rudyard Kipling and Winston Churchill have espoused these ideas. The former's The White Man's Burden promoted this self-espoused 'colonial duty' to civilise colonised societies. Churchill once said, "I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America, or the black people of Australia... by the fact that a stronger race, a higher grade race... has come in and taken their place." Churchill, who is seen in India as racist and imperialist, is Britain's - more specifically England's national hero.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/with-kamala-harris-democrats-would-bet-against-us-history-of-sexism-racism-6157603">Also Read |&nbsp;With Kamala Harris, Democrats Would Bet Against US History Of Sexism, Racism</a></strong></p>

<p>More recently, Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, said in 2019, "We are the guardians of a civilisation that has been developed over millennia... We are the ones who have built the modern world, who have built the West, who have built the European Union. We are the ones who have written the rulebook of the world." The statement does not only reflect Hungarian Prime Minister's arrogance but also exposes him as an ignorant fool. Sadly, this arrogance is endemic in the West.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Western Hypocrisy&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In this same context, the speech made by US President George W. Bush in November 2003 during his official visit to London was interesting. "The United States and Great Britain share a mission: to bring the values of freedom and democracy to the world... We will not be deterred. We will not be defeated. We will bring freedom and civilisation to the world," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bush's comments came several months after the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The two "civilised" nations, the US and the UK, had invaded a faraway country to civilise its people by implanting democracy there and imparting Western values. However, getting rid of weapons of mass destruction was the rationale presented to the world. The entire Western media jumped on to the 'civilising' narrative, completely disregarding their duty to question the real reason behind the invasion. Ultimately, no weapons of mass destruction were found. It was all a pack of lies, spread by the "most civilised country in the world".</p>

<h2><strong>'The Greatest, The Most Powerful'</strong></h2>

<p>Who can forget the gaffe by President Donald Trump - the commander in chief of the world's deadliest military force and the President of the most powerful country - when he mistakenly claimed to have met the "President of the Virgin Islands", not realising it was a U.S. territory? How can we expect Trump to know about the ancient civilisations of India, China, Syria and Egypt, when he isn't sure of the geography of his own country? And yet, Trump once confidently stated in 2017, "We are the greatest country in the world. If you think about it, we are the greatest. We're the greatest because of our values, because of our principles, because of our Constitution, because of our system of government, because of our economic system. We're the greatest because we're a beacon of hope for the rest of the world."</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-hurt-after-far-right-party-campaigners-racist-slurs-for-him-5993694">Also Read |&nbsp;UK PM "Hurt" After Far-Right Party Campaigner's Racist Slurs For Him</a></strong></p>

<p>The West's superiority complex and its fervid need to civilise others continue to shape attitudes and policies. The challenge is to recognise and dismantle these deep-seated prejudices. While Tuesday's incident at Manchester Airport may not have the severity of some past events, it still is an example of systemic racism and the West's inflated self-image poisoning institutions. These issues require continuous scrutiny and action to foster a more equitable society. Indeed, several laws have been passed in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, and things have got better compared to where we stood in the 20th century. But legislation is barely enough. One needs to change the mindset, right from schools and police forces to media houses and private institutions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's former partner Grimes recently spoke out in support of the billionaire's estranged transgender daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson. "I love and am forever endlessly proud of Vivian," the musician posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday. This came after Mr Musk's daughter accused the entrepreneur of being a cruel and absent father. She strongly denied Mr Musk's recent comments about her, including a claim that the so-called "woke mind virus" had killed his "son". She also sought to clear the air over her gender, saying that she legally recognises as a woman and doesn't concern herself with the other's opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I love and am forever endlessly proud of Vivian.</p>
— ?????? ⏳ (@Grimezsz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1816664745426190640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The world's richest man had claimed in a recent interview that during the pandemic, he was tricked into signing documents for "one of his older boys" <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-disowned-by-transgender-daughter-hes-desperate-for-attention-6193039">Vivian Jenna Wilson</a>. He said that his "son is dead" and also referred to gender-reassignment surgery as "child mutilation and sterilisation".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was tricked into doing this. I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it 'deadnaming' is because your son is dead," Mr Musk said, claiming that the experience set him on a mission to combat what he described as the "woke mind virus".</p>

<p>"I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that. And we're making some progress," he added.</p>

<p>Responding to this, Ms Wilson said that she "disowned" him and not the other way round. She shared a screenshot of Mr Musk's post in which he claimed that his son was born "gay and slightly autistic" and said "entire thing was made up".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Like, literally none of this ever happened. Ever. I don't even know where he got this from. My best guess is that he went to the Milo Yiannopoulis school of gay stereotypes, just picked some at random and said "eh- good enough" in a last-ditch attempt to garner sympathy points when he is so obviously in the wrong even in his own fu**ing story," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, the 20-year-old denied that she ever picked jackets for her father. "I was most certainly not calling them "fabulous" because literally what the f**k. I did not use the word fabulous when I was four because once again I would like to reiterate... I was four," she added.</p>

<p>She also claimed she did not have her father by her side when she was growing up. "This entire thing is completely made up and there's a reason for this. He doesn't know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn't there, and in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness. Obviously he can't say that, so I've been reduced to a happy little stereotype f*g-ing along to use at his discretion. I think that says alot about how he views queer people and children in general," said Ms Wilson.</p>

<p>"I'm legally recognized as a woman in the state of California and I don't concern myself with the opinions of those who are below me. Obviously Elon can't say the same because in a ketamine-fueled haze, he's desperate for attention and validation from an army of degenerate red-pilled incels and pick-mes who are quick to give it to him," she added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spacecraft launched last year will slingshot back around Earth and the Moon next month in a high-stakes, world-first manoeuvre as it pinballs its way through the Solar System to Jupiter.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency's Juice probe blasted off in April 2023 on a mission to discover whether Jupiter's icy moons Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa are capable of hosting extra-terrestrial life in their vast, hidden oceans.</p>

<p>The uncrewed six-tonne spacecraft is currently 10 million kilometres (six million miles) from Earth.</p>

<p>But it will fly back past the Moon and then Earth on August 19-20, using their gravity boosts to save fuel on its winding, eight-year odyssey to Jupiter.</p>

<p>Staff at the ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany began preparing for the complicated manoeuvre this week.</p>

<p>Juice is expected to arrive at Jupiter's system in July 2031.</p>

<p>It will take the scenic route. NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft is scheduled to launch this October yet beat Juice to Jupiter's moons by a year.</p>

<p>Long and winding road</p>

<p>Juice is taking the long way around in part because the Ariane 5 rocket used to launch the mission was not powerful enough for a straight shot to Jupiter, which is roughly 800 million kilometres away.</p>

<p>Without an enormous rocket, sending Juice straight to Jupiter would require 60 tonnes of onboard propellant -- and Juice has just three tonnes, according to the ESA.</p>

<p>"The only solution is to use gravitational assists," Arnaud Boutonnet, the ESA's head of analysis for the mission, told AFP.</p>

<p>By flying close to planets, spacecrafts can take advantage of their gravitational pull, which can change its course, speed it up or slow it down.</p>

<p>Many other space missions have used planets for gravity boosts, but next month's Earth-Moon flyby will be a "world first", the ESA said.</p>

<p>It will be the first "double gravity assist manoeuvre" using boosts from two worlds in succession, the agency said.</p>

<p>Juice will cross 750 kilometres above the Moon on August 19, before shooting past our home planet the following day.</p>

<p>The probe will leave Earth at a speed of "3.3 kilometres a second -- instead of three kilometres if we had not added the Moon", Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>As Juice whizzes past Earth and the Moon, it will use the opportunity to snap photos and test out its many instruments.</p>

<p>Down on Earth, some will be taking photos right back. Some lucky amateur sky gazers, armed with telescopes or powerful binoculars, may even be able to spot Juice as it passes over Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>- 'Plate of spaghetti' -</p>

<p>The move has been carefully calculated for years, but it will be no walk in the park.</p>

<p>"We are aiming for a mouse hole," Boutonnet emphasised.</p>

<p>The slightest error during its slingshot around the Moon would be amplified by Earth's gravity, potentially creating a small risk that the spacecraft could enter and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>The team on the ground will be closely observing the spacecraft -- and have 12-18 hours to calculate and adjust its trajectory if needed, Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>He mostly feared a scenario in which the amount of course corrections needed would erase the gains from the double-world slingshot, meaning they would be "doing all this for nothing".</p>

<p>If all goes well, Juice will head back out into interplanetary space -- for a little while at least.</p>

<p>It will first head to Venus for another boost in 2025.</p>

<p>Juice will even fly past Earth twice more -- once in 2026, then a final time in 2029 before finally setting off towards Jupiter.</p>

<p>Then comes the really tricky part.</p>

<p>Once Juice arrives at Jupiter, it will use a whopping 35 gravitational assists as its bounces around the planet's ocean moons.</p>

<p>During this phase, the probe's trajectory looks like "a real plate of spaghetti", Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>"What we're doing with the Earth-Moon system is a joke in comparison," he added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential candidate Donald Trump falsely accused election rival Kamala Harris of being an anti-Semite who plans to allow the murder of newborn babies, in a speech meant to rally religious supporters Friday that quickly went off the rails.</p>

<p>The vice president, who is married to a Jewish man, has gained ground on Trump in polling since she replaced Joe Biden on the top of the Democratic ticket just days ago.</p>

<p>Former Republican president Trump dedicated much of his address at a religious convention in southern Florida to assailing Harris's record as a senator and as Biden's number two, but many of his attacks were smears untethered to reality.</p>

<p>Explaining why 59-year-old Harris had skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau's speech to the US Congress on Wednesday to instead honour a prior commitment, Trump accused her, baselessly, of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>"She doesn't like Jewish people. She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's always going to be. She's not going to change," he said.</p>

<p>The remark -- coupled with his claim that Harris "is totally against the Jewish people" in North Carolina on Wednesday -- marked an escalation in Trump's incendiary rhetoric, days after his campaign said an attempt on his life had given him a focus on unity.</p>

<p>The hour-long Friday speech, hosted by hard-right Turning Point Action, raised legitimate questions over Harris's previous statements on policing, immigration and the environment that placed her to the left of current Biden administration policy.</p>

<p>But it was marked by hyperbole and falsehood.</p>

<h3><strong>'Execute the baby'</strong></h3>

<p>Trump -- a convicted felon who is fighting multiple further indictments -- suggested baselessly that the Justice Department and FBI were "rounding up" Christians and anti-abortion activists and throwing them in jail for their "religious beliefs."</p>

<p>He also called Biden's decision to exit the election campaign a "coup" by Democrats and said America was a "laughing stock."</p>

<p>But he saved his darkest vitriol for Harris, calling her a "bum" and a failed vice president who had rejected federal judges for being Catholic and would appoint "hardcore Marxists" to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>He also accused her falsely of wanting to force doctors to give chemical castration drugs to children and suggested she might cheat to win in November.</p>

<p>"If Kamala Harris has her way, they will have a federal law for abortion, to rip the baby out of the womb in the eighth, ninth month and even after birth -- execute the baby after birth," he claimed, in perhaps his most egregious calumny.</p>

<p>78-year-old Trump, now the oldest major-party nominee in history, is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Biden beset by concerns over infirmity.</p>

<p>Just last week, the former reality TV star was in cruise control as he accepted a hero's welcome -- and the official presidential nomination -- at the Republican convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<h3><strong>Crowning glory</strong></h3>

<p>His crowning glory came a week after a gunman nearly killed him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania -- an extraordinary incident that Trump vowed Friday to commemorate with "a big and beautiful" new rally in the town, although he did not give a date.</p>

<p>Seeking to become the first female president in US history, Harris is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016.</p>

<p>Trump's predecessor Barack Obama pledged support for Harris earlier Friday, as polls showed her closing the gap that Trump had built over Biden to make the race a statistical tie.</p>

<p>A top California prosecutor and senator before being elected the country's first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, Harris has highlighted Trump's criminal conviction and what she said Thursday is a Republican attack on "hard-fought freedoms" in US society.</p>

<p>Democrats leapt on a Trump campaign announcement late Thursday that cast into doubt whether he will debate Harris.</p>

<p>"It shows that he's afraid," Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a major Harris campaign advocate, told MSNBC.</p>

<p>"It shows that he knows that if the two of them are on a stage together, it's not going to end well for him."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris has reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and inspired the voters they need most: women, African-Americans and youth. But it's not all smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, Kamala Harris is poised to become the first woman of colour to run as presidential candidate of a major political party in the US.</p>

<p>As the youngest presidential nominee since Barack Obama, Harris, 59, is comparatively youthful compared with Biden, 81, and Donald Trump, 78.</p>

<p>Her age is likely to make her more appealing and relatable for younger Americans. Polling has already found that 82 percent of voters under 30 - more than any other age group - thought Biden was too old to be an effective president.</p>

<p>Since Israel's invasion of Gaza, Biden has also increasingly been losing the youth vote, with many disillusioned with his stance on the crisis. (Research has demonstrated a stark generation gap around views on Israel and Palestine, with Americans under 30 much more likely to sympathise with Palestinians.)</p>

<p>The heads of the US's most prominent Black sororities and fraternities, known as the 'Divine Nine', have already begun planning a massive voter organisation effort to support Harris. The organisations comprise more than two million young Black people - and their support could represent a significant political advantage.</p>

<p>Though still early days, it's clear Harris has already reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and re-energised the voters they need most: women, African Americans and, especially, young people.</p>

<p>It is important for Harris to court this demographic - and ensure they actually turn up to polling booths in November. Most younger voters - especially women and people of colour - vote Democrat, but only half of Americans aged 18-29 actually voted in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>'Brat' memes and coconut emojis</strong></p>

<p>Just hours after Biden's announcement, Harris received resounding endorsement from the often-cynical Gen Z and younger Millennials.</p>

<p>When British popstar of the summer Charli XCX tweeted "Kamala IS Brat" on Sunday, it instantly went viral. (To clarify, Brat is Charli XCX's latest chart-topping album, released last month. Many fans have since adopted the "brat" identity, which is "to embrace your messiness and vulnerability - being your own authentic self.")</p>

<p>It's a trend currently dominating queer and Gen Z pop culture, as a "brat summer" is declared in the Northern hemisphere and those in the South enjoy a "brat winter".</p>

<p>Even before Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, this Kamala x Brat crossover had been building for weeks online, through memes and TikToks created by fan communities.</p>

<p>Memes can make politics more entertaining and accessible to younger voters and profoundly influence public perceptions of political leaders, especially during election campaigns.</p>

<p>The adoption of Harris as a "brat" is indicative of her youth appeal. Reading the room, the Harris campaign has embraced this trend, changing its official twitter backdrop to a "Brat green" to mimic Charli XCX's album cover</p>

<p>Coconut emojis and memes have likewise flooded social media platforms to demonstrate support.</p>

<p>This trend was inspired by a remark made by Harris at a White House event last May.</p>

<p>"My mother used to - she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, 'I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' while laughing. Then, in a serious tone, 'you exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you'," she said.</p>

<p>After going viral at the time (while simultaneously being mocked by conservatives) this quote has resurfaced with greater popularity in recent days. It resonates with younger voters who admire Harris' authenticity. Coconuts have since become a rallying cry for supporters, again demonstrating her youth appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Harris must contend with misogynoir</strong></p>

<p>Yet politics can be a hostile game, especially for those who do not fit the white male status quo.</p>

<p>Women politicians - especially leaders - have historically experienced sexism and misogyny from their peers, the public and the media.</p>

<p>The mainstream media plays a key role in shaping cultural and social attitudes on gender norms, roles and stereotypes. It wields the power to influence public opinion.</p>

<p>The Australian media did just this in its portrayal of first woman prime minister Julia Gillard, who endured an unprecedented quantity and ferocity of criticism during her term.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton, who came closest to breaking the highest glass ceiling in the US, likewise endured an onslaught of sexism and misogyny from the media, as well as the public and especially Trump.</p>

<p>Scholars analysing the 2016 presidential election found that television coverage favoured Trump and demonised Clinton. Print and online articles were often sexist and targeted her integrity.</p>

<p>And sexist stereotypes spread on social media (including memes emphasising female physical traits to depict Clinton as weak, ill or unattractive, and conversely memes highlighting 'anti-feminine traits' such as dishonesty or untrustworthiness.)</p>

<p>Research has found conservative media outlets with more traditional and right-wing audiences were more likely to be sexist in the coverage of Clinton, while sexism was a "significant predictor" of voter choice at the 2016 election, especially for white voters.</p>

<p>What, then, will Harris likely endure from more traditional media and the opposition during what is gearing up to be a divisive and vicious campaign season?</p>

<p>If her treatment as vice presidential nominee during the 2020 election is any indication, Harris will likely be subjected to unprecedented levels of misogyny and racism.</p>

<p>One study examining gendered abuse of women political candidates at the 2020 election found that a majority was directed at Harris.</p>

<p>This included sexualised narratives (that she "slept her way to the top"), transphobic narratives (that she's secretly a man), racist narratives (questioning her citizenship and claiming she is not "Black enough" or "Indian enough").</p>

<p>This is referred to as "semiotic violence", where words are weaponised to attack women politicians to silence and ultimately deny them their civic rights.</p>

<p>As a Black and Indian woman, Harris faces what has been termed "misogynoir" - a specific kind of racist misogyny aimed at Black women, who are frequently stereotyped as being "angry" and hypersexualised.</p>

<p>Media coverage of Harris' 2020 vice presidential nomination unduly focused on her gender and race, with one quarter of news articles including a racist or sexist stereotype (though largely due to quoting Trump's ad hominem attacks).</p>

<p>The "angry Black woman" stereotype was most prevalent in this coverage, with Harris portrayed as "mean", "nasty" and "mad".</p>

<p><strong>Republican attacks intensify</strong></p>

<p>In the days since Harris became the prospective nominee, Republicans have intensified their attacks.</p>

<p>Several Republican congresspeople have called her a "DEI [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] pick" - a coded slur implying she lacks merit and qualification.</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire, a 2021 clip has resurfaced of GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance questioning Harris' leadership skills because she doesn't have biological children, referring to Democrats as a "bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable with their lives".</p>

<p>While Harris is popular among progressive young voters on social media, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism revealed that hateful and violent speech targeting her on conservative platforms increased dramatically in the 48 hours after Biden' endorsed her as the nominee.</p>

<p>Those comments rose by 33 percent on Trump's Truth Social, 292 percent on Gab, 50 percent on Telegram and 525 percent on 4chan.</p>

<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has instructed the GOP to refrain from sexist and racist attacks against Harris and instead critique her policy record.</p>

<p>Yet the party's own presidential nominee has continued to attack Harris, labelling her "dumb" and "crazy"; perpetuating a misogynoir stereotype that Black women are irrational and less intelligent and suggesting she is unfit for leadership.</p>

<p>The 2024 US presidential election will certainly be a tale of two Americas - one defined by hatred and the past, while the other looks toward a more inclusive future.</p>

<p>Though embraced by youth culture, Harris will need nerves of steel to get through the upcoming campaign in one piece.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is what women - especially those with multiple marginalised identities - are forced to contend with for daring to enter the (masculinised) political realm.</p>

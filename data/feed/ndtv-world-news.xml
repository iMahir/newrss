       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka's first presidential elections since an unprecedented economic crisis spurred widespread unrest will be held in September, the election commission said Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The election will be the first test of the public mood since the height of the 2022 downturn, which caused months of food, fuel and medicine shortages across the island nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Ranil Wickremesinghe, 75, who took office after street protests forced his predecessor to flee the country, has strongly hinted he plans to run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He will face at least two rivals campaigning against austerity measures his government imposed to satisfy an International Monetary Fund bailout package.</p>

<p>The five-week campaign announced by the commission will conclude with a September 21 vote in a country still struggling with a fragile economic recovery and endemic discontent over cost of living issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Economic issues are expected to dominate the campaign as the country emerges from its worst-ever recession in 2022, when the GDP shrank by a record 7.8 percent.</p>

<p>Inflation has since returned to normal levels from its peak of 70 percent at the height of the crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe has also successfully negotiated a restructure of Sri Lanka's $46 billion foreign debt with bilateral lenders including China, following a 2022 government default.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But his policies to balance the government's books by hiking taxes and withdrawing generous utility subsidies have been deeply unpopular with the public.</p>

<p>While the months-long food, fuel and medicine shortages seen at the peak of the economic crisis are now a distant memory, many Sri Lankans say Wickremesinghe's austerity measures have left them struggling to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opposition parties have vowed to renegotiate terms of the $2.9 billion IMF bailout Wickremesinghe negotiated last year.</p>

<p>The president's main challenger so far is Sajith Premadasa, 57, a one-time party ally and current opposition leader.</p>

<p>Premadasa has vowed to continue with economic reforms and the IMF programme but pledged to cushion the public by reducing the tax increases Wickremesinghe imposed to shore up state revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A leftist party is also fielding its leader, 55-year-old former agriculture minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is campaigning against plans to privatise state companies</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe took office following the government default in 2022, after a huge crowd stormed predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa's compound.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajapaksa, who was accused of steering Sri Lanka into the crisis through economic mismanagement, temporarily fled abroad and issued his resignation from Singapore.</p>

<p>Local elections were due to be held last year but postponed indefinitely after the government insisted it had no money to conduct a nationwide vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 17 million Sri Lankans over the age of 18 are eligible to cast a ballot.</p>

<p>The election commission has allocated $33 million (10 billion rupees) for this year's presidential poll.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's doctor Kevin O'Connor on Thursday defended his "excellent" mental acuity days after his shocking decision not to seek reelection.</p>

<p>Dr Kevin O'Connor was asked by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/bidens-doctor-defends-excellent-mental-acuity-insists-prez-doesnt-have-parkinsons-related-ailment/" target="_blank">New York Post</a> about 81-year-old Biden's health.</p>

<p>"It's excellent," he answered.</p>

<p>"Could that change before the end of his term?" the NYP journalist followed up as the presidential physician walked on the White House driveway.</p>

<p>"I hope not," O'Connor, who has never briefed the press during Biden's more than three years in office, responded.</p>

<p>"And how is his mental cognition?" The Post asked.</p>

<p>"It's excellent," Biden's personal doctor said.</p>

<p>He was then asked if there was a reason why they didn't perform a cognitive test on Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We don't need to. He's here every day," O'Connor said.</p>

<p>The journalist then asked him, "Is there anything to that speculation that there might be something related to Parkinson's that he has?"</p>

<p>"No, he's good," O'Connor answered.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-white-house-said-on-parkinsons-doctor-visiting-8-times-in-8-months-6064377" target="_blank">Parkinson's was linked with Joe Biden</a> after reports claimed that an expert on the disease visited the White House eight times in eight months, including at least once for a meeting with Biden's physician.</p>

<p>The White House, however, earlier this month said that it was being incorrectly assumed and insinuated that Biden was being treated for Parkinson's.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-on-joe-bidens-speech-after-exiting-us-presidential-polls-barely-understandable-so-bad-6182893" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> bowed out of the White House on Sunday after weeks of pressure that began with a disastrous June 27 debate performance against Republican candidate Donald Trump that raised concerns about his age and mental acuity.</p>

<p>His exit made him the first president in US history to pull out so late in an election race, and the first to bow out because of concerns over his mental acuity and health.</p>

<p>He has now thrown his support behind his deputy <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/barack-obama-doesnt-believe-kamala-harris-can-beat-donald-trump-in-2024-us-polls-report-6183175" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a>, who is the first woman in US history to hold the vice presidency.&nbsp;She is set to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bill proposes to treat India as if it were of the same status as the US allies such as Japan, Israel, Korea, and NATO allies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Senator Marco Rubio on Thursday introduced a bill in the Congress that proposes to treat India on par with its allies like as Japan, Israel, Korea and NATO allies regarding technology transfers, support India in its response to growing threats to its territorial integrity and bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if it is found to have sponsored terrorism against India.</p>

<p>"Communist China continues to aggressively expand its domain in the Indo-Pacific region, all while it seeks to impede the sovereignty and autonomy of our regional partners. It's crucial for the U.S. to continue its support in countering these malicious tactics. India, along with other nations in the region, is not alone," Rubio said after he introduced the U.S.-India Defense Cooperation Act in the Senate.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In order to strengthen our partnership with India, it's essential we increase our strategic relationship w/ New Delhi. ?? ??<br />
<br />
Introduced a bill to best support India as they continue to face aggression from Communist China.<a href="https://t.co/QVF1gU7TqP">https://t.co/QVF1gU7TqP</a></p>
— Senator Marco Rubio (@SenMarcoRubio) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarcoRubio/status/1816545452713730184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Given the short timeline of a bitterly divided Congress in an election year, the bill is unlikely to make much headway, but might be reintroduced in the next Congress given that there is a bipartisan level of support on the India-US relationship. The bill notes that the US-India partnership is vital to countering influences from Communist China. In order to strengthen this partnership, it is essential to enhance our strategic diplomatic, economic, and military relationship with New Delhi, it asserts.</p>

<p>Among other things, the bill would set a Statement of Policy that the US will support India in its response to growing threats to its territorial integrity, provide necessary security assistance to India to deter adversaries, and cooperate with India with respect to defense, civil space, technology, medicine and economic investments.</p>

<p>When passed into law, it would provide a limited exemption for India from CAATSA sanctions for purchases of Russian equipment that are currently used by the Indian military and set a sense of Congress that expeditious consideration of certifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design and construction services, and major defense equipment to India is consistent with US interests and it is in the interest of peace and stability India to have the capabilities needed to deter threats.</p>

<p>It proposes to treat India as if it were of the same status as the US allies such as Japan, Israel, Korea, and NATO allies regarding technology transfers; authorize the Secretary of State to enter into a memorandum of understanding with India to increase military cooperation; expedite excess defense articles to India for two years and grant India the same status as other allies; and expand International Military Education and Training Cooperation with New Delhi.</p>

<p>It requires a report to Congress on Pakistan's use of offensive force, including through terrorism and proxy groups, against India; and bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if it is found to have sponsored terrorism against India.</p>

<p>This is for the first time such an India-centric bill has been introduced in the US Congress that proposes to put India at the same level of that of its treaty ally, exempt it from CAATSA sanctions, and imposes sanctions on Pakistan for promoting terrorism in India.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mexican drug lord Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and the son of his former partner, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, were arrested in Texas, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mexican drug lord Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and the son of his former partner, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, were arrested in El Paso, Texas, on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said.</p>

<p>"The Justice Department has taken into custody two additional alleged leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world," the department said in a statement.</p>

<p>Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo, face multiple charges in the U.S. "for heading the Cartel's criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks," the statement said.</p>

<p>The arrest of Guzman Lopez was first reported by Reuters, ahead of the Justice Department statement.</p>

<p>Two U.S. officials told Reuters that Zambada and Guzman Lopez were detained after landing in a private plane.</p>

<p>Zambada is one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexico's history and co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.</p>

<p>After El Chapo's extradition, his criminal empire was inherited by four of his sons -- known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos -- who took over his faction of the cartel and became some of the biggest exporters of fentanyl to the United States.</p>

<p>El Mayo and Los Chapitos have had a fractious relationship since El Chapo's extradition, and the arrests of the two traffickers may trigger instability or even violence in Mexico.</p>

<p>U.S. federal prosecutors in February charged Zambada with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, which the Drug Enforcement Administration says is the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI on Thursday said it was putting its artificial intelligence engine to work in a challenge to Google's market-dominating search engine.</p>

<p>The startup behind ChatGPT announced that it is testing a "SearchGPT" prototype that is "designed to combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web" to answer online queries quickly and to provide relevant sources.</p>

<p>SearchGPT is being made available to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback, OpenAI said in a blog post.</p>

<p>Search features refined in the prototype will be woven into ChatGPT in the future, according to the San Francisco-based company.</p>

<p>Users will be able to interact with SearchGPT through conversational queries, and can ask follow-up questions as they might if speaking to a person, OpenAI said.</p>

<p>Google recently added AI-generated query result summaries -- referred to as "Overviews" -- to its search engine, causing worries among some that the move would result in fewer opportunities to serve up money-making ads.</p>

<p>This new feature offers written text at the top of results for Google searches, ahead of the traditional links to sites, which summarizes information that the engine believes answers the user's search query.</p>

<p>OpenAI's description of SearchGPT sounded similar to Google's Overviews.</p>

<p>Since the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, companies in the sector have been engaged in a frantic race to deploy generative AI programs for producing text, images and other content through prompts in everyday language.</p>

<p>"We are innovating at every layer of the AI stack," Google chief Sundar Pichai said this week during an earnings call for parent company Alphabet, which he also heads.</p>

<p>OpenAI said it was working with some publishers to refine SearchGPT, which is being kept separate from the training of its generative AI foundation models.</p>

<p>"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers," The Atlantic chief executive Nicholas Thompson said in the OpenAI blog post.</p>

<p>"We look forward to partnering with OpenAI in the process."</p>

<p>OpenAI has invited users to sign up on a waitlist to try SearchGPT.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden is still committed to attending the annual leadership summit of the QUAD countries which is scheduled to be held in India this year, the White House said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"We're still committed to there being a Quad leader summit this year, but there's nothing on the calendar right now for it," White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters at a news conference here.</p>

<p>QUAD, comprising Australia, Japan, India and the US, is an initiative of Biden. In the first 100 days of his presidency, he convened a virtual leadership summit of the QUAD countries in 2020. Since then QUAD leaders have been holding an annual summit on a rotation basis. India is scheduled to host the QUAD leadership summit this year.</p>

<p>Kirby said now that Biden is not running for reelection, certainly, one can expect there will be opportunities on the calendar that may not have been before.</p>

<p>"So we're all exploring what those opportunities can look like in terms of advancing his foreign policy agenda and national security opportunities here and around the world. But I don't have anything on the schedule to speak to now, but I mean, stay tuned,' he said.</p>

<p>"I think there'll be some opportunities that the president is going to want to explore. Look, I mean, we've still got a war in Ukraine, still got a war in Gaza, still got climate change to deal with. We've still got a very restless Indo-Pacific. I mean, I could go on and on. There's plenty of things for the national security team to try to continue to get done," Kirby said in response to a question.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris signaled a major shift in Gaza policy on Thursday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu she had "serious concern" over casualties and telling him to get a peace deal done.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris signaled a major shift on US Gaza policy Thursday, with the presidential hopeful telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seal a peace deal and insisting she would not be "silent" on the suffering in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>Ripping up outgoing President Joe Biden's playbook of mostly behind-the-scenes pressure on Israel, the vice president said after meeting Netanyahu that it was time to end the "devastating" war.</p>

<p>"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time," Harris told reporters.</p>

<p>"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent."</p>

<p>The 59-year-old -- now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after Biden said at the weekend he would not stand in November's election -- said she pressed Netanyahu on the dire situation in the "frank" meeting.</p>

<p>She said she "expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering and Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians."</p>

<p>"And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Get this deal done' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris also called for the establishment of a Palestinian state and went on to call on both him and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal to end the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done," she said.</p>

<p>Harris's outspoken comments were a stark contrast to the largely amiable greetings between Biden and Netanyahu earlier in the day, even if it masked months of tensions between the two men as well as questions over the US president's relevance.</p>

<p>"From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel," Netanyahu said in tribute to Biden at the start of the Oval Office meeting.</p>

<p>"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead."</p>

<p>Harris has been more outspoken on Gaza in the past than Biden and there had been speculation that she could adopt a tougher approach on Israel. Officials earlier denied there is any "daylight" between her and Biden.</p>

<p>The White House said Biden would tell Netanyahu there needed to be "compromise" for a deal, after the Israeli premier gave a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed "total victory" against Hamas.</p>

<p>"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon," spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p><strong>- 'More optimistic' -</strong></p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who said they hoped for a possible new ceasefire proposal in coming days.</p>

<p>"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November," Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.</p>

<p>Protesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.</p>

<p>While Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House on Thursday described as "disgusting" the increasing sexist and racist attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris which has intensified after she became the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic party.</p>

<p>“I think it's desperate. I think it's disgusting and I think it's a dog whistle. We should not forget that she is the Vice President of the United States. She should get that respect. She's been doing this job with the president for almost four years,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference.</p>

<p>"She's a former Senator and has been a critical partner in getting the economy restarted and making sure that -- that we deal with the pandemic. And to hear that is, frankly, disgusting," Jean-Pierre said when asked about the increase in racist and sexist attacks against Harris, who is of both India and African origin.</p>

<p>It increased to such a level that the House Speaker Mike Johnson had to ask his Republican lawmakers to avoid such an attack.</p>

<p>“When you have the speaker of the House, obviously he's a Republican, and this is something that you all have reported, set up a meeting to tell Republican leaders to stop being racist, to stop being misogynist, to stop being sexist, I think that says a lot that they have to be told to not do that,' Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>According to Politico, “House Republican leaders told lawmakers to focus on criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris' record without reference to her race and gender, following caustic remarks from some Republicans attacking her on the basis of identity.” At an election rally in North Carolina, former US president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had said Vice President Harris is “unfit to rule” and described her as a "radical left lunatic".</p>

<p>“For three and a half years, Lyin Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office. We're not going to let that happen,” Trump said on Wednesday as he unleashed a torrent of attacks against her.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Humanity is suffering from an "extreme heat epidemic," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday, calling for action to limit the impacts of heat waves intensified by climate change.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humanity is suffering from an "extreme heat epidemic," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday, calling for action to limit the impacts of heat waves intensified by climate change.</p>

<p>"Billions of people are facing an extreme heat epidemic -- wilting under increasingly deadly heat waves, with temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius around the world," he said. "That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit. And halfway to boiling."</p>

<p>According to the European Copernicus network, July 21, 22 and 23 were the three hottest days ever recorded worldwide, with July 22 holding the absolute record of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Guterres repeated his call for humanity to fight its "addiction" to fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. And the list goes on," he said.</p>

<p>"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction," he stressed, calling in particular on G20 countries to take action.</p>

<p>While 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 could set a new record, temperatures well above 40C (104F) are increasingly common.</p>

<p>In the space of a year, the 50C threshold has even been exceeded in at least 10 places, from Death Valley in the United States (53.9C on July 7) to Agadir in Morocco, and also in China and India.</p>

<p>The intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms or floods, is nonetheless more deadly.</p>

<p>This "silent killer" is responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's "Call to Action" document published on Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>Workers exposed</strong></p>

<p>Extremely high temperatures also have an economic impact, with the UN estimating economic losses from heat stress at work will reach $2.4 trillion in 2030.</p>

<p>According to a report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday, more than 70 percent of workers were exposed to excessive heat in 2020, 8.8 percent more than in 2000.</p>

<p>"The good news is that we can save lives and we can limit its impact," Guterres said Thursday.</p>

<p>The UN has called for the world community to first act to protect "the most vulnerable" -- including young children, the elderly and also humanity's poorest.</p>

<p>In this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, warning populations of the arrival of heat waves and informing them of the precautions to take, the document says.</p>

<p>The call to action also recommends an "increase (to) equitable access to and scale up (of) low-carbon cooling."</p>

<p>This would involve investing in passive cooling systems -- which include climate-sensitive urban design measures, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems -- and the phase-out of climate-warming gases that are used in many cooling systems.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel warned France on Thursday of potential threats from Iran-backed groups against Israeli athletes and tourists in Paris during the Olympic Games.</p>

<p>"There are those who seek to harm the festivities of this joyous event," Foreign Minister Israel Katz told his French counterpart in a letter, copies of which were released to the media.</p>

<p>"We currently have assessments of potential threats from Iranian terror affiliates and other terrorist organisations aiming to carry out terror attacks against members of the Israeli delegation and Israeli tourists during the Olympics."</p>

<p>France has mounted a vast security operation to ensure the Olympics are safe. Around 18,000 French troops have been deployed to secure the Games in addition to regular police.</p>

<p>All Israeli athletes at the Paris Games, which start officially on Friday, will have round-the-clock personal security provided by elite French police, both inside the Olympic village and every time they leave the compound in northern Paris.</p>

<p>In an address to the US Congress on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for a global alliance against the Iranian "axis of terror".</p>

<p>He argued that the United States and Israel "must stand together" against Iran and its proxies.</p>

<p>Iran had hailed the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel but said it was not involved in it.</p>

<p>Tensions have soared during the war sparked by the attack, drawing in Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.</p>

<p>Yemen's Huthi rebels, along with the Hezbollah group in Lebanon and former Iran-backed paramilitaries in the Iraqi armed forces, are part of a Tehran-aligned "axis of resistance" that supports Hamas against Israel and its allies.</p>

<p>Iran has reiterated support for the groups but insisted they are independent in their decision-making and actions.</p>

<p>On April 13-14, Iran carried out an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel, days after an air strike widely attributed to Israel levelled Iran's consulate in Damascus and killed seven Revolutionary Guards, two of them generals.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean hackers have conducted a global cyber espionage campaign to try to steal classified military secrets to support Pyongyang's banned nuclear weapons programme, the United States, Britain and South Korea said in a joint advisory on Thursday.</p>

<p>The hackers, dubbed Anadriel or APT45 by cybersecurity researchers, have targeted or breached computer systems at a broad variety of defence or engineering firms, including manufacturers of tanks, submarines, naval vessels, fighter aircraft, and missile and radar systems, the advisory said.</p>

<p>"The authoring agencies believe the group and the cyber techniques remain an ongoing threat to various industry sectors worldwide, including but not limited to entities in their respective countries, as well as in Japan and India," the advisory said.</p>

<p>It was co-authored by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and cyber agencies, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).</p>

<p>"The global cyber espionage operation that we have exposed today shows the lengths that DPRK state-sponsored actors are willing to go to pursue their military and nuclear programmes," said Paul Chichester at the NCSC, a part of Britain's GCHQ spy agency.</p>

<p>Internationally isolated North Korea, or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), has a long history of using covert hacking teams to steal sensitive military information.</p>

<p>In August last year, Reuters exclusively reported that one elite group of North Korean hackers had successfully breached systems at NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a rocket design bureau based in Reutov, a small town on the outskirts of Moscow.</p>

<p>As was the case with that hack, APT45 - a part of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau intelligence agency - used common phishing techniques and computer exploits to trick officials at the firms they were targeting into giving away access to their internal computer systems, Thursday's advisory said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South African judge Mandisa Maya was appointed chief justice by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday, becoming the first female to secure the role.</p>

<p>Maya, 60, will take over the helm of the country's top court from Raymond Zondo, whose term as a Constitutional Court judge expires at the end of August.</p>

<p>Her rise marked a "significant milestone" as "Justice Maya would be the first woman in South Africa to be appointed Chief Justice", the presidency said in a statement.</p>

<p>Ramaphosa confirmed the appointment after consultations with the Judicial Service Commission and political parties, following Maya's nomination in February.</p>

<p>Maya had missed out on the top job in 2022, when the Judicial Service Commission recommended her for the role, but Ramaphosa chose Zondo, 64, instead.</p>

<p>Currently Zondo's deputy, the married mother-of-three, is one of four women among the top court's 10 permanent judges.</p>

<p>Boasting one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, South Africa enjoys a high female participation in public life.</p>

<p>More than 40 percent of lawmakers, including the National Assembly speaker and her deputy, are women.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A heatwave in Morocco has killed at least 21 people in a 24-hour period in the central city of Beni Mellal, the health ministry announced on Thursday.</p>

<p>The meteorology department said soaring temperatures affected much of the North African country from Monday to Wednesday, reaching 48 degrees Centigrade (118 Fahrenheit) in some areas.</p>

<p>In Beni Mellal, "the majority of deaths involved people suffering from chronic illnesses and the elderly, with high temperatures contributing to the deterioration of their health conditions," the regional health directorate said in a statement.</p>

<p>Morocco has suffered a sixth consecutive year of drought and record heat this winter, with the month of January the hottest in the country since 1940, according to the meteorology department which had recorded temperatures approaching 37C in some places.</p>

<p>The rising temperatures and prolonged drought, which have lowered reservoir levels, are a threat to the vital agricultural sector.</p>

<p>Water evaporation reached 1.5 million cubic metres per day, Water Minister Nizar Baraka said at the end of June.</p>

<p>Morocco's record temperature -- 50.4C -- was set in August last year in Agadir, in the south of the country.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Hantavirus: According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, this virus is a family of viruses spread mainly by rodents and can cause varied disease syndromes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A health alert has been issued in the state of Arizona, in the United States, after a rodent-borne hantavirus killed four people. The virus spreads to humans through droplets from the urine, saliva, or faeces of the rats.</p>

<p>From January to July, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ein.az.gov/emergency-information/emergency-bulletin/increase-hantavirus-activity-two-deaths-reported-coconino">Arizona Department of Health Services</a> documented seven instances of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, a serious and occasionally lethal respiratory disease.</p>

<p>Two cases related to this deadly virus have also been found in California. The virus, primarily carried by deer mice in the Grand Canyon State, causes symptoms such as fever, headache, and muscle pain, which can rapidly progress to difficulty breathing. While hantavirus is not spread from person to person, it can occur in various regions and is not limited to a specific area.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/about/index.html#:~:text=Hantaviruses%20can%20infect%20and%20cause,rodent%2C%20but%20this%20is%20rare.">US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, hantaviruses are a family of viruses spread mainly by rodents and can cause varied disease syndromes in people worldwide. This can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), the CDC website says.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>

<p>Hantavirus symptoms start with fatigue, fever, muscle aches, headaches, chills, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Late symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath, with a 38% mortality rate for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) symptoms appear 1-8 weeks post-exposure, causing headaches, pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Severe cases may lead to low blood pressure, shock, vascular leakage, and kidney failure. Recovery can take weeks or months.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>

<p>The CDC says there is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for hantavirus infection. However, if the infected are recognised early on and are provided medical care in an intensive care unit, they may do better. In intensive care, patients are intubated and given oxygen therapy to help them through the period of severe respiratory distress.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>

<p>According to the Centres for Disease Control, rodent control is the primary necessity to prevent hantavirus infections. Contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials should be avoided when cleaning rodent-infested areas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Queen Mary of Denmark fell to the ground after being hit by an electric scooter during a royal engagement this week, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/entertainment/denmarks-queen-mary-left-shaken-after-electric-scooter-slams-into-her-during-royal-engagement/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><em>New York Post</em>.</a> The 52-year-old was interacting with fans and supporters in Nuuk, Greenland alongside her kids, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, when an elderly man drove into the gathering. Queen Mary was left terrified by the experience and she lost her balance and momentarily fell to the ground. Her security personnel immediately sprang into action and stopped the scooter from going any further as soon as she got back up.</p>

<p>Video footage of the incident, going viral on social media, shows the Queen being struck while her two children stood just a few feet away. The Danish royal communications office later announced that Queen Mary had not been injured.</p>

The police immediately barricaded and removed her from the situation. It must hurt to be hit at that speed. The police immediately barricaded and removed her from the situation."</p>

<p>Following the incident, the scooter driver claimed he was unsure of what caused the vehicle to lose control.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Queen Mary was born in Hobart, Tasmania on February 5, 1972. She was working as an advertising executive in Australia when she met the then 34-year-old Frederik while out with friends at Sydney's Slip Inn bar during the summer Olympics in 2000. As per a report in AFP, she only discovered later that he was the crown prince of Denmark and his group of friends was made up of other European royals -- including his younger brother Prince Joachim and cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark.</p>

<p>Following several covert meetings and a long-distance romance, the pair became engaged in October 2003 and were married in Copenhagen Cathedral on May 14, 2004. They are now parents to four children: Prince Christian, 18, who will one day succeed his father as king, Princess Isabella, 16, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 13.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three people effectively cured of HIV have spoken about how a risky transplant procedure saved their lives, with one saying they are "living proof" of hope in the fight against the virus.</p>

<p>The trio spoke about their experience at the International AIDS Conference in Munich, which has gathered experts, researchers and activists to discuss developments in the HIV epidemic.</p>

<p>Only seven people are considered to have been effectively cured after receiving a stem cell transplant, a painful and risky procedure only suitable for patients who have both HIV and aggressive leukaemia.</p>

<p>Adam Castillejo, a 44-year-old also known as the "London patient", told AFP that it took "years" to be sure that his transplant had had the desired effect.</p>

<p>"There is not a specific time when you say: 'You're cured', it takes a while and then you have controlled expectations towards that."</p>

<p>Only once doctors are sure that the patient's HIV will not return do they stop treatment with antiretroviral drugs, which reduce the amount of the virus in the blood.</p>

<p>Marc Franke, 55 -- the "Duesseldorf patient" -- also experienced the painstaking process.</p>

<p>"The doctors did so many tests to really be 100 per cent sure before the antiretroviral therapy was discontinued," Franke said.</p>

<p>The bone marrow transplant, which carries a 10 per cent risk of death, essentially replaces a person's immune system.</p>

<p>Pointing to the "enormous" mortality rate and other complications, Franke went so far as to say: "I can't recommend it to anyone."</p>

<p>Despite having "lost several years" to leukaemia, Franke said in retrospect he "would have preferred to take one tablet a day" of antiretrovirals than to have gone through the gruelling transplant process.</p>

<h3><strong>Inspiring 'new directions'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier this month doctors announced the number of people effectively cured from HIV had reached seven.</p>

<p>The seventh -- dubbed the "next Berlin patient" -- received a bone marrow transplant for his leukaemia in 2015 and stopped taking antiretroviral drugs in late 2018.</p>

<p>Medical researchers said he now appears to be both HIV and cancer-free.</p>

<p>Sharon Lewin, President of the International AIDS Society, called the cases "really exciting" but admitted that the therapy was only applicable to a very small number of people.</p>

<p>The procedure had effectively cured just "seven people out of 40 million people living with HIV", Lewin said. "These are very rare cases, but they inspire new directions in science."</p>

<p>All but one of the seven patients received stem cells from donors who had a rare gene mutation which effectively makes people immune to HIV.</p>

<p>Paul Edmonds is in his late sixties and was the third patient who spoke about his experiences at the conference.</p>

<p>He agreed that "the stem cell transplant is not for everyone because there's so many risks involved".</p>

<p>However, Edmonds said his and his fellow patients' experience gave "hope... that a cure is possible because we're living proof that it can happen".</p>

<p>There were 1.3 million new HIV infections last year, while 39 million people are living with the virus, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>Timothy Ray Brown -- the original "Berlin patient" -- was the first person declared cured of HIV back in 2008. Brown died from cancer in 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

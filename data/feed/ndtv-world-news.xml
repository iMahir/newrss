       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday urged Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a "conflagration" between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, during a telephone call between the two leaders.</p>

<p>Macron "reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel," the French presidency said in a statement.</p>

<p>He also insisted on the "urgency for all parties to move rapidly toward a diplomatic solution" to end the conflict sparked by the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The two leaders discussed the diplomatic efforts underway towards this," the Elysee Palace said, ahead of a visit by the US envoy for the conflict, Amos Hochstein, to Paris on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Macron also called on Netanyahu to refrain from any "new operation" in Gaza near Rafah or Khan Yunis, "which would only aggravate the human toll and a humanitarian situation that is already catastrophic", the Elysee said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army on Monday ordered the evacuation of most areas east of Khan Yunis and Rafah along the Egyptian border.</p>

<p>It did not explicitly announce a military operation, but such orders have typically preceded major offensives.</p>

<p>The announcement sparked a mass exodus of Palestinians from parts of southern Gaza on Tuesday as Israeli forces launched deadly strikes and clashed with militants.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive aimed at eradicating the Palestinian militants in Gaza has killed at least 37,925 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthis said on Tuesday that they, along with the Islamic resistance in Iraq, have conducted a joint military operation, attacking a vital target in Israel's Haifa.</p>

<p>The military operation has been carried out with "a number of winged missiles," Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised statement, without identifying the target that was attacked.</p>

<p>The Houthi group has been launching drone and missile strikes in shipping lanes since November, in what it says is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Iran-aligned Houthis first launched drone and missile strikes in shipping lanes in November.

       <description><![CDATA[A judge postponed on Tuesday Donald Trump's sentencing following his conviction for covering up hush money payments until September 18 to allow time for a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity to be considered.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge postponed Tuesday Donald Trump's sentencing for covering up hush money payments until September 18, the first fallout of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, pushing it to after the Republican convention.</p>

<p>The United States' top court ruled Monday that Trump enjoys some immunity from prosecution as a former president, a decision also set to delay his trial for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Hours after the ruling was announced, Trump's legal team said in a letter to the New York court that the immunity ruling vindicated Trump's position that he should not be judged for his "official acts," and reiterated his call for the conviction to be set aside.</p>

<p>The sentencing had been scheduled for July 11, days before the Republican National Convention on July 15 at which Trump is expected to be proclaimed the party's nominee for the battle against President Joe Biden for the White House.</p>

<p>"The matter is adjourned to September 18, 2024, at 10 am for the imposition of sentence, if such is still necessary," Judge Juan Merchan said in a court filing to allow time for consideration of the bombshell Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg had earlier said in a filing that he was not opposed to the delay, but that he believed the "defendant's arguments to be without merit."</p>

<p>The conviction in New York in May made Trump the first former US president ever convicted of a crime. He was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments over his alleged affair with an adult film star in the run-up to the 2016 election.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Loud and clear' -</strong></p>

<p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote he "was Totally and Completely Innocent from the beginning of this Giant and Highly Illegal Scam, long before the Supreme Court's Decision."</p>

<p>"The impact of the Immunity Ruling is a loud and clear signal for Justice in the United States. I AM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!" he added.</p>

<p>Biden warned Monday that the US Supreme Court's landmark ruling sets a "dangerous precedent" that Trump would exploit if elected in November.</p>

<p>Former FBI agent Yale University law professor Asha Rangappa told AFP that the conduct for which Trump was convicted appeared "far removed from his official duties."</p>

<p>But because the Supreme Court gave limited guidance in its ruling "it's hard to really know, what will count and what won't."</p>

<p>Facing four criminal cases, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials until after the election.</p>

<p>The conservative-dominated top court ruled that Trump -- and all presidents -- enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution for "official acts" taken while in office, but can still face criminal penalties for "unofficial acts."</p>

<p>Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion, said a president is "not above the law" but does have "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution for official acts taken while in office.</p>

<p>"The president therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers," Roberts said.</p>

<p>"As for a President's unofficial acts, there is no immunity," the chief justice added, sending the case back to a lower court to determine which of the charges facing Trump involve official or unofficial conduct.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms said on Tuesday it would lift its blanket ban on the word "shaheed", or "martyr" in English, after a year-long review by its oversight board found the social media giant's approach was "overbroad".</p>

<p>The company has been criticized for years over its handling of content involving the Middle East, including in a 2021 study Meta itself commissioned that found its approach had an "adverse human rights impact" on Palestinians and other Arabic-speaking users of its services.</p>

<p>Those criticisms have escalated since the onset of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in October.</p>

<p>The oversight board, which is funded by Meta but operates independently, started its review last year because the word accounted for more content removals on the company's platforms than any other single word or phrase.</p>

<p>Meta is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>The review found in March that Meta's rules on "shaheed" failed to account for the word's variety of meanings and resulted in the removal of content not aimed at praising violent actions.</p>

<p>Meta acknowledged the findings of the review on Tuesday and said its tests showed that removing content when "shaheed" was "paired with otherwise violating content captures the most potentially harmful content without disproportionally impacting the voice".</p>

<p>The oversight board welcomed the change, saying Meta's policy related to the word had led to the censoring of millions of people across its platforms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl was hurtling towards Jamaica Tuesday as a monster Category 5 storm, after killing at least five people and causing widespread destruction in a deadly sweep across the southeastern Caribbean.</p>

<p>Though expected to weaken slightly later Tuesday, the hurricane is still on track to slam into Jamaica on Wednesday as a "near-major" storm, bringing life-threatening winds, storm surge, rain and flash flooding, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.</p>

<p>Beryl has already razed parts of the southeastern Caribbean as a Category 4 storm, killing at least three people in Grenada, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and one in Venezuela, officials said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister of Grenada, Dickon Mitchell, said the island of Carriacou -- which the NHC said took a direct hit from the storm -- has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened by 150 miles (90 kilometers) per hour winds.</p>

<p>"We've had virtually no communication with Carriacou in the last 12 hours except briefly this morning by satellite phone," he told a news conference.</p>

<p>The 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.</p>

<p>The family of UN climate chief Simon Stiell is among the residents of Carriacou. His office said his parents' property was damaged.</p>

<p>Some 90 percent of the homes along with the airport on Union Island, in St Vincent, have also been damaged or destroyed, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said. The three-square mile island has a population of around 3,000.</p>

<p>Gonsalves said the storm also killed one person on another island, Bequia.</p>

<p>Beryl "has left in its wake immense destruction, pain and suffering," he said in a Facebook video late Monday.</p>

<p>One man also died when swept away by a flooded river in the state of Sucre on Venezuela's northeastern coast, officials there said.</p>

<p>Barbados appeared to have been spared the worst but was still hit with high winds and pelting rain, although officials reported no injuries so far.</p>

<p>Martinique was also largely spared, with damage to boats and some flooding in downtown Fort-de-France.</p>

<p><strong>'Alarming precedent'</strong></p>

<p>Experts say it is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.</p>

<p>Beryl is the first hurricane since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June, and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.</p>

<p>A Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane.</p>

<p>Oceans are the main drivers of hurricanes, and there are many factors that go into their formation and intensity -- but heat is a significant one.</p>

<p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said Beryl "sets an alarming precedent for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season."</p>

<p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an "extraordinary" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.</p>

<p>The agency also cited warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.</p>

<p><strong>Climate crisis 'chief culprit'</strong></p>

<p>Stiell, the UN climate chief, said climate change was "pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction".</p>

<p>"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit," he said Monday.</p>

<p>Beryl had maximum sustained winds of 165 miles (270 kilometers) per hour as it headed towards Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, the NHC said in its latest update from 1200 GMT.</p>

<p>The storm is moving rapidly across the Caribbean Sea at 22 miles (35 kilometers) per hour, forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands by Thursday.</p>

<p>Tropical storm warnings have also been issued for the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>Hurricane force winds extend some 40 miles (65 kilometers) from the eye of the storm, the NHC said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A UK jury on Tuesday convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby of attempting to murder another baby girl at the hospital neo-natal unit where she worked.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK jury on Tuesday convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby of attempting to murder another baby girl at the hospital neo-natal unit where she worked.</p>

<p>It comes nearly a year after a different jury convicted the former nurse of murdering seven newborn babies and attempting to kill six others, making her Britain's most prolific child serial killer in modern history.</p>

<p>Letby, 34, faced a retrial at Manchester Crown Court for the attempted murder of the baby girl, referred to in court as Child K, at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England in 2016.</p>

<p>Jurors at her original trial last year failed to reach a verdict on that charge.</p>

<p>However, the jury hearing the case this time took just over three hours to reach their unanimous guilty verdict.</p>

<p>Letby, who is already serving a whole-life prison sentence and was earlier this year refused an appeal bid, will be sentenced for the latest offence on Friday.</p>

<p>During the re-trial, jurors heard that the former nurse was "caught virtually red-handed" by a senior consultant as she displaced Child K's breathing tube.</p>

<p>The prosecution detailed how the consultant paediatrician walked into the unit's intensive care nursery room and saw Letby standing next to the incubator "doing nothing", as the infant's blood oxygen levels dipped.</p>

<p>The jury was also told of Letby's convictions last August of the other murders and attempted murders between 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>Reporting restrictions prevent publication of the identities of the surviving and dead children in the cases.</p>

<p>- Ongoing probes -</p>

<p>Appearing in the witness box last month, Letby denied attempting to murder or harm Child K, or any baby ever in her care.</p>

<p>Child K was transferred to a specialist hospital later the same day because she was born extremely prematurely.</p>

<p>She died there three days later. The prosecution has not alleged Letby caused her death.</p>

<p>The young girl's parents thanked the jury and said "justice has been served". "But this justice will not take away the extreme hurt, anger and distress that we have all had to experience," they added.</p>

<p>"It also does not provide us with an explanation of why these crimes have taken place," a statement read.</p>

<p>Letby, from Hereford, western England, was arrested and then charged in 2020 following a string of baby deaths at the hospital's neo-natal unit.</p>

<p>The prosecution at her first trial said she attacked her vulnerable prematurely born victims, often during night shifts, by either injecting them with air, overfeeding them with milk or poisoning them with insulin.</p>

<p>A public inquiry into events at the hospital unit will start to hear evidence in September.</p>

<p>Cheshire Police said Tuesday that a "complex and sensitive" corporate manslaughter probe into the hospital -- launched following Letby's convictions last year -- was ongoing alongside the original investigation into the ex-nurse.</p>

<p>It is "considering areas including senior leadership and decision-making to determine whether any criminality has taken place," Detective Superintendent Simon Blackwell said.</p>

<p>"At this stage we are not investigating any individuals in relation to gross negligence manslaughter," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the continuing probe into Letby includes a review of 4,000 baby admissions during a four-year period when she worked at the Chester hospital and at the Liverpool Women's Hospital.</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes said only cases "highlighting any medical concern" will be further reviewed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hit the campaign trail on Tuesday, the penultimate day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday, urging voters to not "do something they regret" and warning against the Opposition Labour being handed a "supermajority".</p>

<p>All pre-election opinion polls indicate a strong mandate for the Labour Party, forcing the incumbent Rishi Sunak-led Conservatives on the back foot to caution voters against "Labour without limits" under the leadership of Sir Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Both main party leaders are using the final two days of campaigning to zigzag as many parts of the United Kingdom as possible, especially where they hope there are still some undecided voters to win over.</p>

<p>"Once you make that decision on Thursday, there's no going back. Don't do something you might regret," posted Rishi Sunak on X, driving home his central message that a Labour-led government would raise taxes for everyone in the country.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Once you make that decision on Thursday, there's no going back.<br />
<br />
Don't do something you might regret.</p>
— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1808065633294204968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"You have 48 hours to put the brakes on a Labour supermajority that will put up your taxes," the 44-year-old British Indian leader, adding: "Stop the supermajority. Vote Conservative on 4th July." Speaking to the BBC, he said: "My point is if the polls are to be believed and Labour win a big majority, they will be unchecked and unaccountable to people and that will give them licence to put up everyone's taxes and make us a soft touch on migration when it comes to the entire European continent.</p>

<p>"I don't want people to sleepwalk into that. So, I'm fighting very hard for every vote. I want to continue in this job so I can cut people's taxes, protect their pensions and secure our borders." It came as the BBC's polling expert Sir John Curtice declared there is more chance of lightning striking twice in the same place, than there is of Rishi Sunak remaining Prime Minister come Friday.</p>

<p>"That's his view, that's not going to stop me from working as hard as I can over these final few days. I'll be out until the last moment of this campaign," reacted a defiant Rishi Sunak.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Keir Starmer, 61, has been keen to highlight that "every single vote counts" to counter any chance of disapproval among the voters who may feel the election was a done deal in favour of his party.</p>

<p>"There's tough yards ahead in terms of the inheritance if we come in to serve the country, almost everything is broken, nothing is working, nothing is better than it was 14 years ago. We need a strong mandate for that," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with 'The Times', the Labour leader sought to make a virtue out of Tory warnings of "Labour supermajority" as he emphasised the need for a strong mandate to "seriously change" the country so that people would have "more money in their pockets".</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, who hopes to be in 10 Downing Street by Friday evening, stressed that a bigger majority "means we can roll up our sleeves and get on with the change we need".</p>

<p>The Labour Party has set out its vision as being focussed on creating more growth, driven by major planning reforms and skill overhauls and has denied plans to raise taxes across the board.</p>

<p>"The most important thing is growing the economy and wealth creation. I do think that's been the Achilles' heel for 13 years now. You can talk about public services but if you haven't got your economy working then you can't do that. If you haven't settled the planning, the infrastructure challenges, then you can't get your economy going," stressed Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Both party leaders will use the last hours of campaigning to drive home their respective messages before polling booths open across the country at 7 am local time on Thursday. After they close at 10 pm local time, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer will eagerly await results from the UK Parliament's 650 constituencies - needing 326 for a majority. Meanwhile, the traditional election night exit poll at 10pm will give them and the country a snapshot of what to expect nationally.</p>

<p>If opinion polls are to be believed, the incumbent Tories are in line to win anywhere between 53 and 150 seats, with Labour projected to win a landslide. Some polls even suggest a greater victory margin than when Tony Blair beat John Major in 1997, achieving a 179-seat majority and a total of 418 seats which remains the highest ever won by Labour yet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin "guru", who styles himself as the head priest of a religious society in England, is being sued for millions of pounds in the High Court in London this week over sexual assault allegations brought by women who were his former "disciples".</p>

<p>Rajinder Kalia, 68, is the defendant in an ongoing trial accused of using his sermons and teachings, as well as the purported performance of "miracles", to unduly influence followers' actions. The claimants in the case, all of Indian origin, had won a previous legal fight two years ago after a judge allowed the case to proceed to trial.</p>

<p>"There are triable issues to be determined in this case, with many of the factual issues being intertwined and subject to the claimants' cases as to the coercive control that the defendant (Kalia) exercised over them," Judge Deputy Master Richard Grimshaw concluded in June 2022.</p>

<p>The trial opened last week at the Royal Courts of Justice before Justice Martin Spencer and is expected to conclude next week, with a judgment expected in the coming months.</p>

<p>"I am horrified by the claims being made against me. They are demonstrably false, which makes them all the more puzzling," Kalia said in a statement.</p>

<p>"While I have always believed that everyone should be given a voice, this right must only be used fairly and responsibly. So, it is with great sadness that I sense an elaborate conspiracy to damage me within my community...The truth will soon be out. Until then, I would like to thank all those who have helped sustain me and my family at this challenging time," he said.</p>

<p>The court has been told how Punjab-born Kalia broke his leg "badly" in a motorcycle accident in his late teens and was told by medical professionals that he would not walk again. However, after a visit to Deotsidh, Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh - the origins of Baba Balak Nath - he found he was able to walk again without crutches. He believes that this was a miracle and enhanced his Hindu faith, particularly in Baba Balak Nath.</p>

<p>He moved to the UK in January 1977 and began preaching in 1983 from his home before purchasing some land in Coventry and in 1986 established a "temple" in celebration of Baba Balak Nath. The Sidh Baba Balak Nath Ji Society of Coventry England is registered with the country's Charity Commission and is run by trustees and volunteers.</p>

<p>According to the court documents for the trial, the temple serves food three times a week and helps the elderly in the community with Kalia as its head priest, or 'guru', referring to himself as a servant of God "Jinder Das".</p>

<p>The female claimants in the trial allege "serious sexual assaults" took place on a regular basis over many years in the "priest's room" at the temple, including a claim of consensual sexual relationship.</p>

<p>Kalia denies the allegations and his legal team will challenge them on several grounds as the case progresses through the lengthy trial.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plan for post-war Gaza that Israel pitched to US allies is to run the strip in cooperation with powerful local families. But there's a problem: in a place where Hamas still wields ruthless influence, none want to be seen talking to the enemy.</p>

<p>Israel is under pressure from Washington to end the loss of human life and wind down its military offensive after nearly nine months, but does not want Hamas in charge after the war.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have therefore been trying to plot a path ahead for the day after the fighting stops.</p>

<p>A major pillar of the plan, according to public statements from leading Israeli officials, was to shape an alternative civil administration involving local Palestinian actors not part of the existing structures of power and willing to work alongside Israel.</p>

<p>However, the only plausible candidates in Gaza for this role - the heads of powerful local families - are unwilling to get involved, according to Reuters' conversations with five members of major families in Gaza, including the head of one grouping.</p>

<p>Israel has been "actively looking for local tribes and families on the ground to work with them," said Tahani Mustafa, Senior Palestine Analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. "They refused."</p>

<p>They don't want to get involved, in part because they fear retribution from Hamas, said Mustafa, who is in touch with some of the families and other local stakeholders in Gaza.</p>

<p>That threat is real because - despite Israel's explicit war objective of destroying Hamas - the Palestinian group still has operatives enforcing its will on the streets of Gaza, according to six residents who spoke to Reuters.</p>

<p>Asked what the outcome would be for any head of Gaza's powerful families if they cooperate with Israel, Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza, said: "I expect it to be lethal."</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the challenges last week, saying in an interview with Israel's Channel 14 TV station that the defence ministry had already made attempts to reach out to Gaza clans but "Hamas eliminated" them.</p>

<p>He said the defence ministry had a new plan, but would not give details other than specifying he was not willing to bring in the Palestinian Authority, which currently governs the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Reuters could not establish if Israel's efforts to work with the families were ongoing.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant discussed post-war plans at a meeting in Washington last week with US officials.</p>

<p>Briefing reporters during the visit, Gallant said: "The only solution for the future of Gaza is governance by local Palestinians. It cannot be Israel and cannot be Hamas." He did not mention the clans specifically.</p>

<p>Contacted for comment, the prime minister's officer referred Reuters to Netanyahu's previous public comments on the topic. Israel's defence ministry did not respond to Reuters questions.</p>

<p>Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to a Hamas-led cross-border raid on Oct. 7 last year in which around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and about 250 people taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Palestinian health authorities say Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 38,000 people, mostly civilians. Israel says many of the dead are Palestinian combatants.</p>

<p><strong>Powerful Clans</strong></p>

<p>Gaza has dozens of powerful families who function as well-organised clans. Many do not have formal links to Hamas. They derive their power from controlling businesses and command the loyalty of hundreds or thousands of relatives. Each family has a leader, known as a mukhtar.</p>

<p>British colonial rulers of Palestine before the state of Israel was created in 1948 relied heavily on mukhtars to govern. After Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, it curtailed the power of the families. But they have retained a degree of autonomy.</p>

<p>Israel does already speak to some Gaza merchants, to coordinate commercial shipments through a southern checkpoint. Residents are reluctant to disclose any interactions with Israel.</p>

<p>The approaches from Israel described by members of the Gaza clans were modest in scope but different: they were about practical issues inside Gaza itself, and focused on the north of the strip, where Israel says it is concentrating its civil governance efforts.</p>

<p>One of Gaza's clan leaders, who asked not to be named, told Reuters Israeli officials had contacted other mukhtars - though not him - in the past few weeks. He said he knew about it because the recipients of the calls told him about the calls.</p>

<p>He said the Israeli officials wanted "some respected and influential people" to help with aid deliveries in northern Gaza. "I expect that mukhtars will not cooperate with these games," he said, citing anger with Israel over its offensive, which has killed clan members and destroyed property.</p>

<p>The person, whose clan is a major player in agriculture and the Gaza import business, has no formal connection to Hamas.</p>

<p>In another contact between Israel and influential Gazans, officials from the Israeli defence ministry have in the past two weeks contacted two major Gaza business owners in the food sector, according to a Palestinian briefed on the contacts.</p>

<p>It was unclear what the Israeli side wanted to talk about, and the business owners, who are from the north of Gaza, refused to engage with the Israelis, according to the person.</p>

<p>A senior member of a different clan said Israeli officials had not contacted his clan, but would be given short shrift if they did. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are not collaborators. Israel should stop these games," the clan member, who also has no formal connection to Hamas, told Reuters.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Option</strong></p>

<p>Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, speaking last week, said the government had authorized the Israeli armed forces to find "a local leadership, willing to live side by side with Israel and not to devote its life to killing Israelis."</p>

<p>Speaking through a translator at a conference, he said the process was starting in the northern part of Gaza, and practical results should be seen soon.</p>

<p>Besides civil administration, the other pillars of Israel's plan for post-war Gaza include bringing in a security force from outside to keep order, seeking international help with reconstruction, and searching for a long-term peace settlement.</p>

<p>The Arab states whose support Israel would need say they won't get involved unless Israel agrees a firm timeline for a Palestinian state - something Netanyahu says he will not be pushed into doing.</p>

<p>Throughout the war, Washington has advocated for reforms to strengthen the Palestinian Authority (PA) and prepare it to govern Gaza, which it used to run.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has said he doesn't trust the PA, which in turn says he seeks to keep Gaza and the West Bank divided. Support is weak among Gazans for the PA, according to a June 12 poll by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR).</p>

<p>However, two US officials told Reuters Netanyahu may have little choice but to turn security over to the PA.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a fight. But there is no other short-to-medium term option," said one of the officials.</p>

<p>Israel has yet to develop a concrete post-war plan for governance and security in the enclave, said the officials, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p>

<p>Both said Israeli officials were considering a range of ideas but did not provide details.</p>

<p>The US State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p><strong>Hamas Holding On</strong></p>

<p>While some Gazans blame Hamas for inciting the war, others, angered and radicalised by Israel's offensive, have drawn closer to the group, with its declared commitment to destroying Israel, PCPSR polls show.</p>

<p>Hamas has recognized it is unlikely to govern after the war, but expects to retain influence.</p>

<p>A Gaza resident said he saw members of the Hamas police force touring the streets of Gaza City in June, warning merchants against hiking prices. They were in plain clothes instead of their usual uniforms, and moved on bicycles, said the resident, who asked not be named fearing reprisal.</p>

<p>Hamas fighters have intervened to control aid shipments, including killing some clan figures at the start of this year who tried to take over the shipments in Gaza City, according to four residents from the city who spoke to Reuters.</p>

<p>Hamas declined to comment about the killings.</p>

<p>In April, Hamas said its security services arrested several members of a security apparatus loyal to the Palestinian Authority. Three people close to the PA said the arrested men were escorting a delivery of aid to northern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"There is no vacuum in Gaza, Hamas is still the prominent power," said Michael Milshtein, a former colonel in Israeli military intelligence who now heads the Palestinian Studies Forum at the Moshe Dayan Center, a research center in Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Limb amputations are performed by surgeons when a traumatic injury such as a wound from war or a vehicle accident causes major tissue destruction or in instances of serious infection or disease. But humans are not alone in doing such procedures.</p>

<p>New research shows that some ants perform limb amputations on injured comrades to improve their survival chances. The behavior was documented in Florida carpenter ants - scientific name Camponotus floridanus - a reddish-brown species more than half an inch (1.5 cm) long inhabiting parts of the southeastern United States.</p>

<p>These ants were observed treating injured limbs of nestmates either by cleaning the wound using their mouthparts or by amputation through biting off the damaged limb. The choice of care depended on the injury's location. When it was further up the leg, they always amputated. When it was further down, they never amputated.</p>

<p>"In this study, we describe for the first time how a non-human animal uses amputations on another individual to save their life," said entomologist Erik Frank of the University of Wurzburg in Germany, lead author of the research published on Tuesday in the journal Current Biology.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that we can safely say that the ants' 'medical system' to care for the injured is the most sophisticated in the animal kingdom, rivaled only by our own," Frank added.</p>

<p>This species nests in rotting wood and defends their home vigorously against rival ant colonies.</p>

<p>"If fights break out, there is a risk of injury," Frank said.</p>

<p>The researchers studied injuries to the upper part of the leg, the femur, and the lower part, the tibia. Such injuries are commonly found in wild ants of various species, sustained in fights, while hunting or through predation by other animals.</p>

<p>The ants were observed in laboratory conditions.</p>

<p>"They decide between amputating the leg or spending more time caring for the wound. How they decide this, we do not know. But we do know why the treatment differs," Frank said.</p>

<p>It has to do with the flow of hemolymph, the bluish-greenish fluid equivalent to blood in most invertebrates.</p>

<p>"Injuries further down the leg have an increased hemolymph flow, meaning that pathogens already enter the body after only five minutes, rendering amputations useless by the time they could be performed. Injuries further up the leg have a much slower hemolymph flow, giving enough time for timely and effective amputations," Frank said.</p>

<p>In either case, the ants first cleaned the wound, likely applying secretions from glands in the mouth while also probably sucking out infected and dirty hemolymph. The amputation process itself takes at least 40 minutes and sometimes more than three hours, with constant biting at the shoulder.</p>

<p>With amputations after an upper leg injury, the survival rate documented was around 90-95%, compared to about 40% for unattended injuries. For lower leg injuries in which just cleaning was performed, the survival rate was about 75%, compared to around 15% for unattended injuries.</p>

<p>Wound care has been documented in other ant species that apply an antibiotically effective glandular secretion to injured nestmates. This species lacks that gland.</p>

<p>Ants, which have six legs, are fully functional after losing one.</p>

<p>It was female ants observed doing this behavior.</p>

<p>"All worker ants are female. Males play only a minor role in ant colonies - mate once with the queen and then die," Frank said.</p>

<p>So why do the ants do these amputations?</p>

<p>"This is an interesting question and it does put into question our current definitions of empathy, at least to some extent. I do not think that the ants are what we would call 'compassionate,'" Frank said.</p>

<p>"There is a very simple evolutionary reason for caring for the injured. It saves resources. If I can rehabilitate a worker with relatively little effort who will then again become an active productive member of the colony, there is a very high value of doing so. At the same time, if an individual is too heavily injured, the ants will not care for her, but rather leave her behind to die," Frank added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees estimated Tuesday that a quarter of a million people had been impacted since Israel's army issued a new evacuation order for parts of southern Gaza a day earlier.</p>

<p>"We've seen people moving, families moving, people starting to pack up their belongings and try to leave this area," UNRWA spokeswoman Louise Wateridge told reporters in Geneva via video-link from Gaza.</p>

<p>The agency "estimates that around 250,000 people have been impacted by these orders", she said, adding: "We expect these numbers to grow".</p>

<p>Her comments came after the Israeli army Monday issued a new evacuation order for parts of Khan Yunis and Rafah in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>The 250,000 number was UNRWA's estimate for the people in the area of new evacuation orders in eastern Khan Yunis, Louise Wateridge told AFP.</p>

<p>"We expect that almost all of these people will move from this area," she said, adding that the agency hoped to get a better idea later Tuesday of the numbers who have physically left.</p>

<p>Monday's evacuation order followed mass displacement from large parts of Rafah that began with a similar order nearly two months ago, which signalled the start of a long-feared Israeli ground offensive.</p>

<p>The fighting since then has again uprooted many Palestinians and led to the closure of a key aid crossing.</p>

<p>"This is another devastating blow to the humanitarian response here," Louise Wateridge said.</p>

<p>"It's another devastating blow for the people and the families on the ground. It seems that they are forcibly being displaced again, and again."</p>

<p>She pointed out that following the start of the Rafah incursion in May, people had flooded back into the largely destroyed Khan Yunis area.</p>

<p>"And now already, because of the orders last night, the same families are having to move again," she said.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no safe place in the Gaza Strip."</p>

<p>Gaza's deadliest war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive aimed at eradicating the Palestinians militants in Gaza has killed at least 37,925 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given the "very trusting nature" of the relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, no topic was off-limits for the two leaders when they meet here soon, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The dates of Prime Minister Modi's visit to Moscow will be announced a bit later but preparations for it are already at their final stages, Mr Peskov said.</p>

<p>Mr Putin and PM Modi will discuss regional and global security, trade and all other topics on the agenda during their meeting, Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia's state-owned TASS news agency.</p>

<p>"We (Russia and India) jointly take part in integration processes, so regional affairs, regional security and global security are always at the top of the agenda. In addition, of course, our bilateral trade and economic interaction is always a focal point," the Kremlin official said, answering a question about what topics will be discussed at the negotiations between Putin and Modi.</p>

<p>Describing Prime Minister Modi's visit as "very important," the official noted that Moscow and New Delhi have "mutual political will" to develop cooperation in a variety of areas.</p>

<p>"Given the very trusting nature of the relationship between President Putin and Prime Minister Modi, we can expect that there will be an exchange of views on all issues that are on the agenda, and there are many of them," Mr Peskov added.</p>

<p>"We will announce this visit officially later, after coordination with our Indian friends, I can only confirm to you once again that the visit is in the final stages of preparation," he said, replying to a question on the dates of Modi's visit to Russia.</p>

<p>Diplomatic sources in New Delhi had said the Indian prime minister's day-long visit is being planned around July 8, adding there is no finality on the date yet and various options are being explored.</p>

<p>The visit, if it takes place, will be PM Modi's first trip to Russia in nearly five years. His last visit to Russia was in 2019 when he attended an economic conclave in the Far East city of Vladivostok.</p>

<p>If PM Modi travels to Russia, then he and President Putin are set to hold the India-Russia annual summit after a gap of three years.</p>

<p>The annual summit between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Russia is the highest institutional dialogue mechanism in the strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>So far, 21 annual summits have taken place alternatively in India and Russia.</p>

<p>The last summit was held on December 6, 2021, in New Delhi. Putin, as head of the Russian state, has visited India nine times.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a family from Perth, Australia, was served insect killer as juice at a restaurant. The couple Marcus and Michele Lemin had ordered cranberry juice for their daughters at Miky's Italian Restaurant on June 28, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/01/world-news/scared-i-was-going-to-die-family-allegedly-served-insect-killer-as-juice/"><em>New York Post</em></a>. The incident is now being investigated by health authorities.</p>

<p>However, Hannah and Olivia, aged 11 and 12, were horrified and spat the drink. Michele Lemin said, "My daughters just went to gulp it down and they both spat the cranberry juice out and said 'It's poisoned'. I said don't be silly, and took the glass, and I went to gulp it down and then spat it out."</p>

<p>Now, the worried parents claim they were given a pink mixture of lamp oil and citronella torch. Marcus Lemin smelled the liquid and requested to see the bottle it came from. He said the employees first declined, stating it was only "old cranberry juice."</p>

<p>However, he ultimately got the bottle from the refrigerator. The man said he was given an insecticide with citronella from the beverages refrigerator. The bottle was labelled "plus Bifenthrin" and included a warning, according to the report. "The manager didn't want to give my husband the bottle, and another waiter stood up and told everyone that everything was okay," Michelle said.</p>

<p>The family was rushed to the hospital where they suffered several symptoms and were kept under observation for six hours. The mother continued, "My daughters' ... stomachs were burning, their fingers and hands were tingling. They had a headache ... it was awful."</p>

<p>Twelve-year-old Hannah told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/wa-news-family-allegedly-served-insect-repellant-at-perth-restaurant/d5170458-b634-49cf-9105-c983b0302cce"><em>9News </em></a>that it was "really disgusting, and how you would expect insect repellant to taste". Olivia added, "It felt like somebody had poured fire on your stomach and it felt like you had pins and needles in your arms and legs."</p>

<p>A complaint has been registered with the Health Department and the local council. The restaurant stated that it was investigating the incident. A staff member told 9News the situation was "very concerning". "All about this is under investigation, and when I know exactly (what happened), I will let you know," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Indonesian badminton body declared that he had experienced a sudden cardiac arrest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zhang Zhijie, a 17-year-old Chinese badminton player, died after collapsing on the court during the Badminton Asia Junior Championships in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.marca.com/en/more-sports/2024/07/01/6682a952ca4741f1508b4579.html"><em>Marca</em></a>. The shuttler was playing against Japan's Kazuma Kawano in the opening game on June 30, which was tied 11-11 when he collapsed. He was immediately given medical treatment, however, he was declared dead at the hospital.</p>

<p>Badminton Asia and the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) said in a joint statement on Monday, "China's Zhang Zhijie, a singles player, collapsed on the court during a match in the evening. He was sent to the hospital where he passed away at 23:20 local time yesterday. He was attended to by the tournament doctor and medical team. He was taken in the standby ambulance in less than two minutes and sent to hospital."</p>

<p>"The world of badminton has lost a talented player," the statement added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/wideawake_media/status/1807734984213397693">Videos of the incident</a> recently went viral on the internet, showing a 40-second wait before Zhang was attended to by emergency personnel. There has been harsh criticism directed at officials, with many questioning if prompt medical assistance might have saved his life. In the short clip, a man is seen running to help the shuttler after he collapses, however, he stops mid-way and waits for further instruction.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd19xnxdvlko"><em>BBC</em></a>, a PBSI spokesman later said that "medical teams had to follow a rule where they needed the referee's permission before entering the court." He said, "That is in accordance with the regulations and standards of procedure that applies to every international badminton tournament." Meanwhile, the Indonesian badminton body declared that he had experienced a sudden cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>The young player, who originally hailed from Jiaxing in the Chinese province of Zhejiang, joined the national junior squad in 2023 and won many championships, including the team and men's titles in Group B of the China Badminton Junior Championships in 2023 and 2024.</p>

<p>The China Badminton Association also expressed deep sorrow and shock. "Zhang Zhijie loved badminton and was an outstanding athlete of the national youth badminton team," they said. The statement continued, "At present the local hospital has not yet identified the cause of death."</p>

<p>Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu also took to X (formerly Twitter) to express her condolences. She wrote, "Absolutely heartbreaking news coming from the Junior Asian Badminton Championships about the loss of young badminton player Zhang Zhi Jie."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Halving food waste could cut climate-warming emissions and end undernourishment for 153 million people globally, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN's food agency said in a joint report Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halving food waste could cut climate-warming emissions and end undernourishment for 153 million people globally, the&nbsp;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&nbsp;(OECD) and the UN's food agency said in a joint report Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around a third of food produced for human consumption gets lost or wasted globally, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization -- resulting in useless emissions and less available food for those who need it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By 2033, the number of calories lost and wasted between produce leaving farms and reaching shops and households could be more than twice the number of calories currently consumed in low-income countries in a year, the report warned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cutting in two the amount of food lost and wasted along the journey from farm to fork "has the potential to reduce global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by four per cent and the number of undernourished people by 153 million by the year 2030," according to the report.</p>

<p>"This target is a highly ambitious upper bound and would require substantial changes by both consumers and producer side," they added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agriculture, forestry and other land use account for around one-fifth of global human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UN nations have committed to cutting per capita food waste by 50 percent by 2030 as part of sustainable development goals but there is no global target for reducing food loss along the production supply chain.</p>

<p>Between 2021 and 2023, fruit and vegetables accounted for more than half of the lost and wasted food given their extremely perishable nature and relatively short shelf life, according to the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cereals followed, accounting for over a quarter of lost and wasted food. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The FAO estimates that approximately 600 million people will be facing hunger in 2030.</p>

<p>"Measures to reduce food loss and waste could significantly increase food intake worldwide as more food becomes available and prices fall, ensuring greater access to food for low-income populations," the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Halving food loss and waste by 2030 could result in increased food intake by 10 per cent for low-income countries, six per cent in lower middle-income nations and four per cent in upper middle-income ones, it added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Badly lagging in the race to win Britain's election, Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/only-conservatives-can-give-tough-fight-to-labour-party-uk-pm-rishi-sunak-6008921">Rishi Sunak</a> went hunting for votes among whirling robots in a retail distribution centre on Tuesday, kicking off his first campaign stop of the day before 5 a.m. (0400 GMT).</p>

<p>Sunak, who has often looked exhausted as he crisscrossed the country during a six-week campaign, started the penultimate day before Thursday's vote in a vast Ocado warehouse in Luton, north of London, watching robots pick items for delivery.</p>

<p>He then donned a neon yellow, high-vis jacket to help staff pick avocados and other salad items at Ocado, one of Britain's most successful technology businesses. He also met with staff over a cup of tea.</p>

<p>The prime minister later surprised people at a motorway service station when he joined a queue in McDonald's to buy breakfast for journalists following his campaign.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-elections-when-rishi-sunak-came-to-power-two-years-ago-6007859">Sunak</a> shocked many in his party and the country when he called an election several months earlier than expected.</p>

<p>His campaign then got off to an inauspicious start when he announced the election date under a downpour in Downing Street, competing to be heard over Labour supporters blaring a pop song associated with their party's crushing 1997 election victory.</p>

<p>Sunak, a former investment banker, has since travelled across the country, giving speeches and attending several hustings a day. He spoke at a rally late on Monday evening and is scheduled to attend events through Tuesday and into the evening.</p>

<p>Despite the effort the polls have hardly budged, with Keir Starmer's opposition Labour Party holding an around 20 point lead and many voters saying they want change 14 years in power for Sunak's Conservatives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli forces carried out deadly strikes Tuesday on southern Gaza after the army again ordered Palestinians to leave areas near the besieged territory's border with Israel and Egypt.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces carried out deadly strikes Tuesday on southern Gaza after the army again ordered Palestinians to leave areas near the besieged territory's border with Israel and Egypt.</p>

<p>Witnesses reported intense bombing and shelling around Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's main city from which Israeli forces withdrew in early April after a devastating months-long battle.</p>

<p>A hospital source in the city said shelling killed eight people and wounded more than 30 others.</p>

<p>The bombardment came after a rocket barrage at southern Israel claimed by the group Islamic Jihad, which has fought alongside Hamas.</p>

<p>This was followed by an order to evacuate most areas east of the cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah, including the towns of Al-Qarara and Bani Suhaila.</p>

<p>Bani Suhaila resident Ahmad Najjar said the Israeli order has spurred "fear and extreme anxiety", and "there is a large displacement of residents".</p>

<p>Six consecutive days of intense battles followed a similar evacuation order issued last week for the Gaza City district of Shujaiya.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent reported artillery shelling in the northern area on Tuesday, and witnesses said gun battles raged on.</p>

<p>The military said its forces were operating in Shujaiya, central Gaza and Rafah, where aircraft carried out strikes and troops "ambushed an armed terrorist squad" in a car and killed them.</p>

<p>Over the past day, the Israeli air force "struck approximately 30 terror targets" across Gaza, said a military statement.</p>

<p>In Shujaiya, Palestinian militants "were eliminated and dozens of terrorist infrastructure sites above and below ground were dismantled, including tunnel shafts", it added.</p>

<h3><strong>'Downshift'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In central Gaza, witnesses said strikes hit the Nuseirat refugee camp where the Palestinian Red Crescent reported at least one dead, a child.</p>

<p>Other parts of the Gaza Strip were reeling from continued fighting nearly nine months into the war, sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Months of on-and-off talks towards a truce and hostage release deal have meanwhile made little progress, even after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently declared that the "intense phase" of the war was winding down.</p>

<p>"We've heard the Israelis talk about a significant downshift in their operations in Gaza," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday.</p>

<p>"It remains to be seen."</p>

<p>The latest order to leave parts of southern Gaza follows an evacuation of Rafah nearly two months ago which had signalled the start of a long-feared Israeli ground offensive.</p>

<p>The fighting since then has again uprooted many Palestinians and led to the closure of a key aid crossing.</p>

<p>The United Nations and relief agencies have voiced alarm over the dire humanitarian crisis and the threat of starvation the war and Israeli siege have brought for Gaza's 2.4 million people.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive aimed at eradicating the Palestinian militants in Gaza has killed at least 37,900 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities on Monday released Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital -- the territory's largest medical complex -- along with dozens of other detainees returned to Gaza for treatment.</p>

<p>Speaking after his release, Abu Salmiya said he had suffered "severe torture" during his detention.</p>

<p>"Several inmates died in interrogation centres and were deprived of food and medicine," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Try peace'</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has accused Hamas of using Al-Shifa and other hospitals as a cover for military operations, claims Gaza militants have rejected.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who has faced growing anger from protesters over his handling of the conflict as well as pressure from hardline coalition partners, criticised the release which he said had been made without his knowledge.</p>

<p>The Israeli premier said Abu Salmiya belongs "in prison" because Israeli hostages were "murdered and held" in the now ravaged hospital he runs.</p>

<p>Successive Israeli raids have reduced large parts of Al-Shifa to rubble.</p>

<p>The director's return to Gaza was "a serious mistake and a moral failure", Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>According to Abu Salmiya, Israel brought no charges against him during his seven-month detention.</p>

<p>Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency said the release was "to free up places in detention centres".</p>

<p>Those freed "represent a lesser danger" and were not directly involved in attacks on Israeli civilians, it said.</p>

<p>In the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Monday, thousands attended an event calling for an end to the war and "a better reality" for Israelis and Palestinians, according to activist Ibrahim Abu Ahmad.</p>

<p>"At any moment, we can start making peace," said Israeli historian and author Yuval Noah Harari.</p>

<p>"We have already tried to make peace, and we weren't good at it. So what? We aren't that successful at making war either, and that doesn't stop us from trying... It's time to try peace again."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least two girls molested by Jeffrey Epstein were labelled prostitutes, drug addicts, thieves and liars by a Palm Beach County prosecutor, according to a newly released grand jury <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article289667429.html ">transcript</a> from 2006. These documents were unsealed by Judge Luis Delgado after 16 years, following legal actions by various media outlets.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The prosecutors questioned the victims about prostitution and whether they might bear any responsibility despite Epstein being the accused in the case. The two girls were also asked about their drug and alcohol use, body piercings and postings on their MySpace accounts.<br />
<br />
Epstein, a financier, abused several underage girls from 1996 to 2008 at his Palm Beach mansion. Despite serious allegations, he was only charged with minor prostitution and solicitation.<br />
<br />
Detective Joseph Recarey, who led the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, testified before the grand jury at the time. The investigation began after a 14-year-old girl's stepmother reported her daughter was paid $300 to massage an older man on Palm Beach Island, he said, as per ABC News.<br />
<br />
The girl, then 15, testified she had gone to Epstein's mansion, where she was asked to strip to her underwear and massage him. She also alleged that Epstein used a vibrator on her and paid her an extra $100. She admitted to lying about her age, telling Epstein she was 18. Her parents discovered her trip to Epstein's after finding the money in her purse.<br />
<br />
Prosecutors then questioned the 15-year-old girl about her personal life, asking about her drug and alcohol use, body piercings and social media posts. They asked about her MySpace page, where she had joked about shoplifting, lied about her age and income and claimed to make $250,000.<br />
<br />
The girl acknowledged that these were just jokes and that her friends did the same. A juror asked if she knew her actions were wrong, and she replied, "Yeah, I did."<br />
<br />
Prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek asked if she was “aware” that she had committed a crime, to which she replied that she didn't know it was a crime at the time, but later realised it might be considered “prostitution or something like that.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The witness's attorney, Spencer Kuvin, found this exchange appalling but not surprising, stating that the prosecution's focus on discrediting the witnesses rather than prosecuting Epstein revealed their fear of taking on the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Detective Recarey testified that one victim visited Epstein's mansion over 100 times, receiving $200 each time and gifts, including a rented car. On one occasion, Epstein had non-consensual intercourse with her, despite her “screaming ‘no'”.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, the prosecutor, Laana Belohlavek, focused on the victim's earnings, asking the detective if she had been asked what she did with the money. The detective said the victim had declined to answer, saying it was “too personal.”<br />
<br />
The second victim, who visited Epstein's mansion 10 times starting at age 16, said he knew her age “from the very beginning.” The victim testified that Epstein's sexual advances gradually increased over time until he initiated intercourse with her on the day before her 18th birthday. She stated that she didn't want to have intercourse but didn't ask him to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The prosecutor questioned her about committing prostitution, and she replied "Yes".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Epstein was indicted on one charge of solicitation of prostitution, arrested, and released on bond. The Palm Beach Police Chief was incensed and turned the case over to the FBI. Epstein later pleaded guilty to the original charge and an additional charge of soliciting a minor, serving 13 months in a private wing of the county stockade with liberal work release. Following investigative reports in 2018, Epstein was re-arrested in 2019 on sex trafficking charges but died in custody; ruled a suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A human resource employee in Singapore has been jailed for 18 months for making bogus pay claims for herself involving $148,000. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, Tan Lee Nah, 53, was in charge of the payroll system at D'Perception Singapore, an interior design firm. In May 2017, just two months after joining the company, she started to submit false claims for expenses, up until she was caught in November 2019. In these 2.5 years, she managed to give herself $148,000 in unauthorised pay rise to fund her child's tuition fee and her parent's medical bills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3265427/singapore-hr-boss-jailed-giving-herself-us148000-fake-pay-rises-fund-childs-tuition"><em>SCMP</em></a>, a judge said that Ms Tan treated the company's coffers like her "personal piggy bank". The court found that she claimed false travel expenses, ranging from $750 to $7,300 each month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From January to November 2019, she added mobile phone expenses, paid holiday allowances and some extra expenses to her claims. In 2017, she was asked to transfer money to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) as two month's contributions for a new employee. However, she misappropriated the cheques and put them in her account, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Ms Tan was the sole person with the password to the company's payroll system, and it was routine practice for her to input all the staff's salaries into the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her scheme was exposed when an employee saw a copy of Ms Tan's salary statement on the printer, which showed she had received allowances in addition to her basic salary. The employee alerted the management which then launched an investigation and called the police a month later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 53-year-old told the court that the money she had misappropriated was spent on her child's education and her parents' medical bills. She pleaded guilty on June 3 this year to two charges of sham reimbursement and one of criminal breach of trust for cashing two cheques. She had not compensated her employer because she lacked the financial means to do so.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe landed on Tuesday in the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, making the country the first to bring back samples from the moon's far side.</p>

<p>The reentry capsule touched down at 2:07 p.m. Beijing time (0607 GMT), according to state broadcaster CCTV, carrying lunar soil collected earlier in the month by the probe after a successful landing on the moon's South Pole-Aitken Basin, an impact crater on the side of the Moon that always faces away from Earth.</p>

<p>Soon after the capsule landed, Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, announced the successful completion of the Chang'e-6 lunar mission. Chinese President Xi Jinping said the mission's completion was a "landmark achievement" in China's quest to become a space and scientific powerhouse.</p>

<p>The Chang'e-6 probe was launched on May 3 on a Long March 5 rocket from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan. According to CCTV, the samples will be transported by air to Beijing for analysis.</p>

<p>While it is yet not known whether the planned 2kg of samples were successfully returned, whatever the amount, the samples will be closely analysed by Chinese and foreign scientists, who believe that they will reveal new details about the formation of the Earth, moon, and solar system.</p>

<p>Samples from the Chang'e-5 mission, which brought back lunar samples from the near side of the moon, led to the discovery of new minerals and more accurate ranges for the moon's geological age.</p>

<p>The success of the Chang'e-6 mission could give China's lunar and space exploration program, already in close competition with the United States, greater pull among foreign governments and scientists.</p>

<p>China's retrieval of samples from the moon's far side comes as the exploration of lunar resources and the militarization of space are becoming increasingly pressing questions shaped by geopolitical tensions.</p>

<p>NASA administrator Bill Nelson this year expressed concern at China's lunar exploration program and described an intensifying "space race" between the two superpowers.</p>

<p>"I'm glad there has been a resurgence in this (space) race, but of course, I would like to see us racing alongside each other and together," said Neil Melville-Kenney, a technical officer at the European Space Agency (ESA) who is working with Chinese researchers on one of the Chang'e-6 payloads.</p>

<p>As the European Union and China are at loggerheads over a wide range of geopolitical issues, from trade to the war in Ukraine, European space agencies and scientists are working closely with Chinese counterparts on data and samples collected by China's lunar missions.</p>

<p>"We know that (the far side of the moon) is literally a different place, it is made of different materials than the near side of the moon, it has a different history... it's really of fundamental scientific importance to get these samples back," Melville-Kenney said.</p>

<p>The engineer added that the ESA will meet with the China National Space Administration in October to discuss further collaboration.</p>

<p>"This collaboration that we have at the moment (with China) is a small step, this was started quite a while ago, perhaps the situations were a little bit different then. Going forward I hope there will be more collaboration," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-12/jfceq2jo_xi-jinping-reuters-_625x300_07_December_23.jpeg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Recent data from the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nuclear-warheads-being-kept-operational-worldwide-watchdog-5905625">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)</a> shows that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-has-more-nuclear-weapons-than-pakistan-report-5909387">the world's nuclear powers</a> are continuing to expand investment in strengthening their arsenals. While the total number of warheads around the world is declining, the number of operational nuclear warheads is increasing. The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-putin-friends-are-helping-russia-upend-the-us-led-world-order-5691040">US and Russia</a>, of course, account for an overwhelming majority of nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>However, it is China that is reportedly expanding its nuclear arsenal "faster than any other country". SIPRI's researchers estimated the Chinese arsenal to be around 500 warheads, as of January 2024. As per the US Defense Department's estimate, China will likely have over 1,000 operational warheads by 2030. More importantly, the SIPRI report argues that for the first time, China is believed to have some warheads on high operational alert. In addition, over the past few years, there have been increasing reports on Chinese efforts to expand the number of its land-, sea-, and air-based delivery platforms and infrastructure, such as Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos.</p>

<h2><strong>"Assured Retaliation"</strong></h2>

<p>The Chinese nuclear strategy centres around deterrence through "assured retaliation", which is the ability to survive an initial attack and retaliate with nuclear strikes that inflict unacceptable damage on the aggressor. Moreover, like India, China has a long-standing no-first-use policy. Despite this, as detailed above, there has been a steady effort by Beijing to expand and modernise its nuclear forces. Three factors are important to grasp to understand why this has been the case.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-1-year-chinas-nuclear-arsenal-up-by-11-times-that-of-indias-5915463">Also Read |&nbsp;Explained: India Has More Nukes Than Pak, But China Races Ahead</a></strong></p>

<p>First, Chinese assessments of the international security landscape, particularly US policy, have undergone tremendous changes over the past decade. China's 2019 defence white paper was critical of adjustments in the American national security and defence strategies, while also warning of arms races. The Sino-US relationship has only worsened since. Increasingly, Beijing has come to believe that the US is pursuing a strategy of containment. Part of this approach entails strengthening American conventional military superiority while modernising strategic forces. Of particular concern has been the American discourse around 'low-yield' or tactical nuclear weapons. Chinese analysts have argued that US policy appears to be lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. Moreover, the concern in Beijing appears to be that American missile defence capabilities and new conventional systems, along with improvements in cyber and electronic warfare, could undermine China's retaliatory strike capability.</p>

<h2><strong>"Maintain Readiness"</strong></h2>

<p>The 2019 defence white paper, therefore, called on the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to "maintain the appropriate level of readiness and enhance strategic deterrence capability". Subsequently, in March 2021, Xi Jinping directed the military to "accelerate the construction of advanced strategic deterrent" capabilities. Finally, in his work report to the 20th Party Congress, Xi committed to establishing "a strong system of strategic deterrence" and increasing "the proportion of new-domain forces with new combat capabilities". This is particularly critical given the heightened tensions around Taiwan. A modernised Chinese nuclear force potentially provides greater room for manoeuvre for Beijing in case of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-could-take-control-of-taiwan-without-firing-a-shot-warns-report-5949602">conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</a></p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-increases-defence-budget-by-7-2-amid-rising-regional-tensions-5179889"><strong>Also Read |&nbsp;China Increases Defence Budget By 7.2% Amid Rising Regional Tensions</strong></a></p>

<p>Second, as per the 2019 defence white paper, one of the goals of enhancing strategic deterrence capability is to "maintain international strategic stability". This, of course, is a significant expansion of the goals of Chinese defence policy from simply safeguarding national sovereignty and security. It also is indicative of what Beijing views as necessary instruments of power that great powers must possess. In other words, there is an element of status-seeking that is driving the Chinese nuclear modernisation programme. For instance, early in his reign in December 2012, Xi had termed the Second Artillery Corps, which was later upgraded to the PLA Rocket Force, as "a strategic pillar of China's great power status". This does not mean that Beijing desires nuclear parity with the US or Russia. Rather, it implies that nuclear power is being viewed as an instrument of power that needs to be cultivated to achieve political equality among major powers.</p>

<h2><strong>The Stalled US-China Talks</strong></h2>

<p>This dovetails into the third and final point, i.e., building negotiation power and setting global rules. After an extremely long hiatus, China and the US resumed official nuclear dialogue in November last year. Both sides described the dialogue as "candid" and "in-depth", but there were no significant outcomes. The US side demanded greater "transparency" and "substantive engagement" from China, while Beijing stressed the importance of "mutual respect" and the need to adhere to "the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security". More substantive talks have since not progressed, although the first Track II dialogue between the two sides in five years was held in March. China, meanwhile, has moved to call on nuclear-armed states to negotiate a no-first-use treaty or political declaration. Beijing understands that shaping new rules can only be done from a position of strength.</p>

<p>From an Indian perspective, therefore, it is important to not view China's nuclear force modernisation simply from the prism of parity and asymmetry. There are broader issues, such as great power conflagrations leading to a nuclear exchange, which must be taken into account. Some of these issues, such as the threat of increased proliferation and support for Pakistan, are a matter of deeper concern. Others, meanwhile, such as the call for a no-first-use treaty, can provide opportunities for making common cause.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suri Cruise, the daughter of Hollywood icons Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, has dropped her father's surname. The 18-year-old graduated from LaGuardia High School with her mother, Katie Holmes, by her side, under the name "Suri Noelle". This name was also adopted earlier in the year for a school production of the play ‘Head Over Heels'. "Noelle" is Katie Holmes' middle name, reported <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/06/22/parents/suri-cruise-celebrates-high-school-graduation-with-mom-katie-holmes/">Page Six</a>.<br />
<br />
Her father, Tom Cruise reportedly missed the graduation weekend to attend Taylor Swift's Eras tour in London, where he is filming for the next ‘Mission: Impossible' film, reports say.<br />
<br />
Tom Cruise's relationship with his children, especially Suri, has been complex following his divorce from Katie Holmes in 2012.<br />
<br />
Amid rumours suggesting Tom Cruise had distanced himself from Suri, the actor vehemently denied these claims in a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-tom-cruise-suri-abandoned-lawsuit-20131106-story.html ">2013 defamation lawsuit</a>, stating he had not abandoned his daughter in any way – emotionally, physically, financially or otherwise. He called these claims “patently false.”<br />
<br />
The <em>Jack Reacher</em> actor stated that he “spoke on the phone nearly every day” with Suri, then 6 years old, and claimed that he “regularly asked for and received updates concerning her friends and school life.”<br />
<br />
The 61-year-old also has two adopted children, Isabella and Connor, from his previous marriage to Nicole Kidman. He was seen in public with them last year, reportedly for the first time in 15 years.<br />
<br />
Suri's decision comes just weeks after Brad Pitt's children, Shiloh and Vivienne, also dropped their famous surname, now going by <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitts-daughter-shiloh-files-to-drop-pitt-from-name-5794688#:~:text=Angelina%20Jolie%20and%20Brad%20Pitt's%20daughter%20Shiloh%20Jolie%2DPitt%20has,is%20Shiloh%20Nouvel%20Jolie%2DPitt. ">Shiloh Nouvel Jolie </a>and Vivienne Jolie, respectively.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The US should welcome more students from China, but to study the humanities rather than sciences, the second-ranked US diplomat said on Monday]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US should welcome more students from China, but to study the humanities rather than sciences, the second-ranked US diplomat said on Monday, noting that US universities are limiting Chinese students' access to sensitive technology given security concerns.</p>

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said not enough Americans were studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics. He said the US needed to recruit more international students for those fields, but from India - an increasingly important US security partner - not China.</p>

<p>For years, Chinese students have made up the largest foreign student body in the US and totaled nearly 290,000 in the 2022/23 academic year. But some in academia and civil society argue that deteriorating US-China relations and concerns about theft of US expertise, have derailed scientific cooperation and subjected Chinese students to unwarranted suspicion.</p>

<p>"I would like to see more Chinese students coming to the United States to study humanities and social sciences, not particle physics," Campbell told the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.</p>

<p>Campbell was asked about the China Initiative introduced by the Trump administration, intended to combat Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft, which ended under the Biden administration after critics said it spurred racial profiling of Asian Americans.</p>

<p>Campbell said US universities had made "careful attempts" to support continuing higher education for Chinese students, but had also been "careful about the labs, some of the activities of Chinese students."</p>

<p>"I do think it is possible to curtail and to limit certain kinds of access, and we have seen that generally, particularly in technological programs across the United States," he said.</p>

<p>Campbell said some had suggested that China was the only source to make up the shortage of science students.</p>

<p>"I believe that the largest increase that we need to see going forward would be much larger numbers of Indian students that come to study in American universities on a range of technology and other fields."</p>

<p>Campbell said the US had to be careful to not eliminate links between China and the US, but officials in Beijing were largely to blame for any withering in academic, business or non-profit sector ties.</p>

<p>"It really has been China that has made it difficult for the kinds of activities that we would like to see sustaining," Campbell said, adding that foreign executives and philanthropists were wary about long-term stays in China due to concerns about personal security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Space Station (ISS), a remarkable feat of human engineering and international collaboration, has been orbiting Earth for 25 years. Here are ten fascinating facts about this cosmic outpost:</p>

<p><strong>Size and Weight: </strong>The ISS, akin to a mini-city in space, weighs a staggering 419 tonnes and spans the length of a football field, measuring 109 meters end to end.</p>

<p><strong>Scientific Hub: </strong>It serves primarily as a research laboratory where scientists from around the world conduct experiments in microgravity conditions, invaluable for advancements in biology, physics, astronomy, and materials science.</p>

<p><strong>Costly Endeavor: </strong>Constructing and maintaining the ISS has been a monumental financial effort, surpassing $150 billion since its inception.</p>

<p><strong>Operational Dynamics: </strong>Circling the Earth at an astounding speed of 28,165.00 kilometers per hour, the ISS completes 16 orbits daily, providing astronauts aboard with 16 sunrises and sunsets within 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>International Collaboration: </strong>A partnership involving five space agencies from 15 countries manages the ISS, although India remains outside this consortium.</p>

<p><strong>Human Presence: </strong>Since November 2000, the ISS has continuously housed astronauts, offering a living and working environment larger than a typical six-bedroom house. It includes amenities like two bathrooms, a gymnasium, and a panoramic bay window for a breathtaking 360-degree view of Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainable Living: </strong>To ensure self-sufficiency, the ISS employs advanced recycling systems that purify sweat and urine into potable water, a crucial innovation for prolonged space missions.</p>

<p><strong>Microbial Evolution:</strong> Despite its sterile appearance, the closed environment of the ISS fosters the development of resilient microorganisms dubbed 'super bugs,' posing unique challenges for crew health and station maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Visible Wonder:</strong> As it orbits overhead, the ISS is visible to the naked eye from Earth. Enthusiasts can track its path through the night sky using resources provided by NASA.</p>

<p><strong>Future Prospects:</strong> While no Indian has yet visited the ISS, plans are underway for an Indian astronaut to embark on a mission there soon. India also aims to establish its own space station, the Bhartiya Antariksha Station, by 2040, reflecting a growing ambition in space exploration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranians will choose between mostly hardline candidates in an early presidential election on June 28 following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.</p>

<p>Only six candidates from over 80 hopefuls survived screening by the hardline Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists which is overseen by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of state.</p>

<p>The president, who runs the government day-to-day and has a particular responsibility for Iran's struggling economy, ultimately answers to the Supreme Leader.</p>

<p>Following are brief sketches of five hardliners and one moderate candidate for the upcoming election:</p>

<h3><strong>MOHAMMAD BAQER QALIBAF</strong></h3>

<p>A former Iran Revolutionary Guards commander and ally of Khamenei, Qalibaf is the current speaker of the hardline-dominated parliament. He previously ran unsuccessfully for president twice and was compelled to withdraw from a third bid in 2017 to prevent a divided hardline vote in Raisi's initial failed presidential attempt.</p>

<p>In 2005, Qalibaf resigned from the Guards to run for president. Following his unsuccessful campaign, he assumed the position of Tehran mayor with the supreme leader's endorsement, a role he occupied for 12 years.</p>

<p>In 2009, Qalibaf took credit as Tehran mayor for helping suppress months of bloody unrest that rocked the establishment after a presidential vote that opposition candidates said was rigged to secure hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election.</p>

<p>To civil rights activists, he is known as someone who crushed protests as national police chief, personally beating demonstrators in 1999, and also played an active role in repressing unrest in 2003. Qalibaf did not reply to a request for comment on those allegations.</p>

<h3><strong>SAEED JALILI</strong></h3>

<p>Jalili is a hardline diplomat who lost his right leg in the 1980s when fighting for the Guards in the Iran-Iraq war. Holder of a PhD in political science, Jalili has declared being a pious believer in Iran's "velayat-e faqih", or rule by supreme jurisprudence, a system of Islamic government that provides the basis for Khamenei's position.</p>

<p>Appointed by Khamenei, Jalili served as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council for five years from 2007, a position that automatically made him chief nuclear negotiator. Jalili also served for four years in Khamenei's office and was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2013 presidential election.</p>

<p>A former deputy foreign minister, Jalili was appointed by Khamenei in 2013 as a member of the Expediency Council, a body that mediates disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council.</p>

<h3><strong>MASSOUD PEZESHKIAN</strong></h3>

<p>An Iranian lawmaker of Azeri ethnicity, Pezeshkian is the only moderate candidate approved by the Guardian Council and backed by the pro-reform camp. His prospects depend on attracting millions of disillusioned voters who have stayed home in elections since 2020.</p>

<p>A physician by profession, Pezeshkian served as the health minister under reformist President Mohammad Khatami from 2001 to 2005 and has held a seat in parliament since 2008.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian has been vocal in his criticism of the Islamic Republic for its lack of transparency about the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian Kurdish woman in 2022 that sparked several months of unrest.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian was barred from the 2021 presidential election.</p>

<h3><strong>MOSTAFA POURMOHAMMADI</strong></h3>

<p>The only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi served as interior minister during the first term of hardline former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from 2005 until 2008.</p>

<p>He was deputy intelligence minister from 1990 to 1999, and rights groups have alleged that he played a role in the assassinations inside Iran of several prominent dissident intellectuals in 1998. He has not commented on the allegations but an Intelligence Ministry statement in 1998 said: "A small number of irresponsible, deviant and rogue agents of the ministry who were most likely puppets of others committed these assassinations that were in the interest of foreigners."</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch, in a 2005 report, documented Pourmohammadi's alleged role in the execution of hundreds of political prisoners in the Iranian capital in 1988.</p>

<p>Pourmohammadi has never publicly addressed allegations about his role in a so-called "death committee" in 1988 comprising religious judges, prosecutors, and intelligence ministry officials who oversaw the executions.</p>

<h3><strong>ALIREZA ZAKANI</strong></h3>

<p>Tehran's hardline mayor and a former lawmaker, Zakani was disqualified in 2013 and 2017 from running for president.</p>

<p>The former commander of the Guards' affiliated volunteer Basij militia, Zakani withdrew from the 2021 presidential race to endorse Raisi's candidacy. But in a post on X, Zakani said "In the 2024 election, I will stay and compete until the end to continue the path of (Raisi)."</p>

<h3><strong>AMIRHOSSEIN GHAZIZADEH-HASHEMI</strong></h3>

<p>Incumbent vice president and head of the Martyrs' Foundation, Ghazizadeh-Hashemi is a hardline former lawmaker who received a low vote tally in the 2021 presidential election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has sent hundreds more trash-filled balloons southward, Seoul's military said Tuesday, the latest in a series of border barrages that have sparked a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign.</p>

<p>Pyongyang launched about 350 balloons Monday evening, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, adding that around 100 had landed in the South, mainly in northern Gyeonggi province and the capital Seoul.</p>

<p>The bags attached to the balloons contained "mostly paper waste", the military said, adding that they posed no safety risk to the public, according to their analysis.</p>

<p>"The South Korean military is ready to carry out its psychological warfare immediately," the JCS said, adding the response "all depends on North Korea's actions".</p>

<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North's latest round of trash-carrying balloons was a "despicable and irrational provocation" in a speech marking the anniversary of the start of the Korean War.</p>

<p>He slammed a deal between Pyongyang and Moscow, signed last week by Russian President Vladimir Putin during a state visit to North Korea, as a "blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions",</p>

<p>"Our military will maintain a steadfast readiness to ensure that North Korea does not dare to challenge South Korea under any circumstances and will respond overwhelmingly and decisively to any provocations from the North," Yoon added.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has already sent more than a thousand balloons carrying trash southward in what it says is retaliation for balloons carrying anti-regime propaganda floated north by activists.</p>

<p>In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister and key government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned earlier this month that if the leaflet drops and loudspeaker broadcasts continued, Seoul would "undoubtedly witness the new counteraction of the DPRK".</p>

<p>Experts said border tensions could potentially escalate quickly.</p>

<p>"Since the South has met the first condition -- which is the leaflet scattering -- if the government were to resume loudspeakers, we would likely see the 'new counteraction' that was mentioned," said Park Won-gon, a professor at Ewha Womens University.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old US woman has been missing since last week after she travelled to the Bahamas to attend a yoga retreat. According to <em>NBC News</em>, Taylor Casey was last seen on Wednesday around Paradise Island. She travelled to the Caribbean country for the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat before she "mysteriously vanished". In a statement, her family members said that they are "deeply concerned" for Ms Casey's safety and well-being. They believe that the 41-year-old is in "danger" as she "would never disappear like this".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are deeply concerned for Taylor's safety and well-being. I believe Taylor is in danger because she was eager to share her yoga retreat experience with others upon her return," the worried mother said as the family urged anyone with information to come forward, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-woman-bahamas-yoga-retreat-goes-missing-family-concerned-rcna158732">outlet</a>. "Taylor would never disappear like this," she added.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat Bahamas also confirmed Ms Casey's disappearance and said that it had asked police to investigate. According to the retreat, the 41-year-old didn't attend morning classes on Thursday after she was last seen the evening before. "The Ashram is asking anyone with information on Ms. Casey to contact the local police. In the interim it is collaborating with the authorities on their investigation," the retreat centre said, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/missing-chicago-woman-taylor-casey-bahamas/"><em>CBS News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Casey's family is now expected to travel to the Caribbean country this week to assist in the search. Her loved ones have described her as a Black American with light skin and a thin appearance, standing 5 feet, 10 inches, with natural, often-covered hair. She is an "intelligent, deeply caring, thoughtful and joyful person," who has been practising yoga for 15 years, the family members said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Ms Casey's disappearance comes as the US State Department warned travellers earlier this year to exercise increased caution in the Bahamas, including in Nassau, because of crime. "Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assaults, occur in both tourist and non-tourist areas," officials warned.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 28% of workers globally are planning to switch jobs over the next year, a new survey has revealed. Of the 56,000 respondents in the PwC's 2024 ‘Hopes and Fears' survey, 28% said that they were "very or extremely likely" to change jobs in the next 12 months.<br />
<br />
The number has spiked from 19% during the "Great Resignation" period of 2022 and 26% in 2023, reported <a href="http://https://www.reuters.com/business/great-resignation-enters-third-year-workers-embrace-ai-upskilling-pwc-says-2024-06-24/#:~:text=World%20at%20Work-,'Great%20Resignation'%20enters%20third%20year%20as%20workers,embrace%20AI%2C%20upskilling%2C%20PwC%20says&amp;text=MUMBAI%2C%20June%2025%20(Reuters),of%20the%20global%20workforce%20found.">Reuters</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is ‘Great Resignation'?</strong><br />
<br />
The Great Resignation period refers to a historic wave where a record number of employees across the US chose to quit their jobs. More than 47 million Americans voluntarily left their positions, driven largely by the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This trend had far-reaching effects, leading to widespread worker shortages across various sectors. Businesses such as gas stations and dental offices had to reduce their hours due to difficulties in finding replacements for departing employees.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Texas A&amp;M University Professor Anthony Klotz, introduced the term "Great Resignation", suggesting that many workers who had held off on quitting during the early stages of the pandemic were now leaving their jobs in larger numbers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Factors leading to the Great Resignation</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>COVID-19: The pandemic made people reconsider their career priorities. Some realised they wanted more fulfilling work or a better balance between work and life.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Remote work: Many jobs went remote during the pandemic. Some people liked working from home so much that they didn't want to go back to their old jobs.</li>
	<li>Burnout: The stress and burnout caused by the pandemic, coupled with long hours and blurred boundaries between work and personal life, pushed many workers to seek a change.</li>
	<li>Career reassessment: Many took the opportunity during the pandemic to reflect on their career paths and goals. Some decided to leave jobs that didn't feel right anymore.</li>
	<li>Job dissatisfaction: Some workers became dissatisfied with their current jobs due to factors such as lack of growth opportunities, inadequate compensation or poor working conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>While COVID-19 certainly played a major role in triggering this wave of resignations, some experts argue that the Great Resignation is not just a short-term effect of the pandemic. Instead, they see it as part of a longer-term trend that has been unfolding over the past decade or more. This trend reflects broader changes in the workforce, including shifts in worker preferences, reevaluation of career priorities and evolving expectations about work-life balance.<br />
<br />
According to the new PwC ‘Hopes and Fears' report, many employees are starting to use advanced technologies like AI to improve their work efficiency. Workers are focusing more on learning new skills to keep up with changes at work and in technology. Nearly half of the employees surveyed believe GenAI will lead to better pay and higher-quality work. A majority (62%) of respondents reported experiencing more workplace changes in the past year compared to the previous year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a freak accident, a young woman died&nbsp;after stumbling off a treadmill and falling out of a window on the third floor of a gym&nbsp;in Indonesia. The&nbsp;incident occurred at about 1 pm on Tuesday, June 18 in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. A video of the incident that has surfaced online shows the 22-year-old running on a treadmill before she stopped to wipe her face with a towel. However, she quickly lost her balance,&nbsp;tripped backwards and tumbled out of the window that was left open, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/24/world-news/fitness-fanatic-falls-off-treadmill-before-plummeting-to-her-death-out-of-third-story-window/">New York Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She desperately attempted to grab onto the window frame&nbsp;before plummeting down three stories.&nbsp;She was rushed to hospital with serious head injuries, but doctors were unable to save her life. An autopsy revealed that she had suffered extensive bruising and lacerations to her head.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The unnamed victim came to the gym with her boyfriend who was exercising on the second floor when the tragedy unfolded, local media reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An investigation revealed that the distance between the treadmill and the window from which she fell was only 60 cm.&nbsp;Police noted that the position of the treadmill created a ''dangerous'' situation.</p>

<p>''It's very easy for someone to fall off the treadmill and then fall down,'' Pontianak Police Commissioner Antonius Trias Kuncurojati said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though the gym had put warning stickers telling gymgoers not to open windows, the sticker was reportedly damaged.&nbsp;When the gym owner was questioned, he said the treadmills' backs were facing the windows because he didn't want to block the view.&nbsp;While there are personal trainers who are tasked to close open windows, one was taking a break when the incident occurred. The gym was subsequently closed for three days.</p>

<p>The gym is now under investigation for alleged negligence and its&nbsp;operating permit will also be re-examined, the authorities said. The cops are also questioning several witnesses and seeking expert opinion.</p>

<p>The incident has sparked widespread concern and calls for stricter safety measures in gyms across the region.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple has rejected overtures by Meta Platforms to integrate the social networking company's AI chatbot into the iPhone months ago, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.</p>

<p>The companies are not in discussions for an AI partnership involving Meta's Llama chatbot and only held brief talks in March, the report said.</p>

<p>Discussions about a potential partnership did not reach a formal stage and Apple was not actively planning on integrating Llama into iPhones, because it does not consider Instagram owner Meta's privacy practices stringent enough, according to Bloomberg News.</p>

<p>The preliminary talks took place around the time Apple started hashing out deals to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Gemini in its products, the report said.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled its long-awaited AI strategy at its annual developer conference earlier in June, bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices and integrating its new "Apple Intelligence" technology across its suite of apps, including virtual assistant Siri.</p>

<p>Apple and Meta did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news of the talks between the companies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julian Assange is en route to a courtroom on the Pacific island of Saipan where he is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday to a single criminal charge in a plea deal that will see him walk free and return home to Australia after a 14-year legal odyssey.</p>

<h3><strong>WHERE IS SAIPAN?</strong></h3>

<p>Saipan is the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), a US commonwealth in the western Pacific which begins roughly 70 kilometers (44 miles) north of Guam and stretches across 14 islands.</p>

<p>Like territories such as Guam or Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands are part of the U.S. without the full status of a state. Residents are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in presidential elections. Crucially, some, like Saipan, also host U.S. district courts.</p>

<p>Assange will appear in court at 9 a.m. local time on Wednesday (2300 GMT Tuesday)</p>

<h3><strong>WHY IS ASSANGE HEADING THERE?</strong></h3>

<p>U.S. prosecutors said Assange wanted to go to a court close to his home in Australia but not in the continental United States.</p>

<p>Saipan has the advantage of being relatively close to Assange's home in Australia, roughly 3,000 km (1800 miles) south. Hawaii is more than twice as far away.</p>

<p>"He has to front up to charges that have been brought under U.S. law," said Emily Crawford, a professor at the University of Sydney's law school.</p>

<p>"It had to be U.S. territory but it had to be the U.S. territory closest to Australia that wasn't a U.S. state like Hawaii."</p>

<h3><strong>SAIPAN AND THE UNITED STATES</strong></h3>

<p>After time as a colony of Spain, Germany and then Japan, the United States took control of the island in World War Two after the Battle of Saipan in 1944.</p>

<p>After decades under U.S. control, residents in 1975 voted to join the United States as a territory.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When three Indonesian teen girls formed a metal band 10 years ago to sing about gender equality and peace over bone-crunching guitars and drums, they could scarcely have dreamed of one day playing at Glastonbury.</p>

<p>Yet, a decade later, Voice of Baceprot's three Muslim women will become the first band from Indonesia to perform at the world-famous festival in Britain this week, where the headliners include Coldplay and Dua Lipa.</p>

<p>Their set will mark the latest highlight in a wild career that has seen Firda Kurnia (guitar and vocals), Widi Rahmawati (bass), and Euis Siti Aisah (drums) amass a huge fanbase while challenging gender stereotypes in male-dominated Indonesian society.</p>

<p>"Honestly, Glastonbury is not on our wishlist because we feel like it is too high a dream," Euis, 24, told AFP.</p>

<p>"(I am) half in disbelief. That is why we keep checking whether it is the official Glastonbury or if someone pranked us."</p>

<p>Voice of Baceprot rose from humble beginnings in a village near the West Javan city of Garut.</p>

<p>They won fans with their raucous Rage Against the Machine covers -- the word "baceprot" means noisy in Sundanese, an Indonesian traditional language -- and also won fans with their original material.</p>

<p>Then came wider international attention, including plaudits from some superstars. Red Hot Chilli Peppers bassist Flea once tweeted that he was "so down with Voice of Baceprot".</p>

<p>And while the group has previously played in the United States and Europe -- including at the famous Wacken metal festival in Germany -- there are nerves ahead of Glastonbury.</p>

<p>"Hopefully my nervousness is a reminder for me to be more prepared," said Euis.</p>

<h3><strong>Indonesia tour dream&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Muslim conservatives in Indonesia have criticised the band over the fact that they are women, and also claimed their clothes are inappropriate.</p>

<p>But Voice of Baceprot have stuck to their beliefs and shot back through their music.</p>

<p>Their biggest hit -- "God, Allow Me (Please) to Play Music" -- has racked up millions of plays on YouTube and Spotify, and takes aim at the conservative detractors who say women should not play such music.</p>

<p>The band has also written songs about climate change and women's rights.</p>

<p>"We create songs based on what we see, hear, read, and experience ourselves," said Firda.</p>

<p>The group's rise has come with a hazard they had not anticipated: "obsessed" fans curious about every aspect of their lives.</p>

<p>Some have even showed up at their homes to try and meet them.</p>

<p>"We're like: 'OK, maybe this is one of the job's risks.' Our families sometimes get confused," said Firda, 24.</p>

<p>After forming in 2014, Voice of Baceprot played at small festivals around West Java, one of Indonesia's most conservative provinces.</p>

<p>They later moved to the capital Jakarta and also played online concerts during the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>They have since returned to their hometown, where they are building their own studio.</p>

<p>Widi said the band has received "a lot" of offers to play abroad.</p>

<p>But as they prepare to play the biggest show of their lives at the famous Worthy Farm in southwest England, Voice of Baceprot say one of their dreams is rooted at home.</p>

<p>"We actually really want to tour Indonesia," said Widi. "But we haven't had the opportunity yet."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a Tel Aviv overpass, former spy Gonen Ben Itzhak addresses a small gathering of flag-waving protesters worried about the future of Israel under longest-serving premier Benjamin Netanyahu. Motorists honk enthusiastically to the group from the road as they drive past, and a man on a scooter passing underneath shouts "Traitor!"</p>

<p>A former Shin Bet intelligence agent, Ben Itzhak once handled the son of a Hamas co-founder as an informant, to prevent attacks in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Now he protests on the streets against Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition government.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu is really the biggest danger to the state of Israel, and believe me I arrested some of the biggest terrorists during the Second Intifada," the 53-year-old told AFP at his home in Modiin, referring to the 2000-2005 Palestinian uprising.</p>

<p>"I know what is a terrorist. I think Netanyahu is dragging Israel into destruction."</p>

<p>He cites Netanyahu's recent tensions with US President Joe Biden -- he accused him of delaying American arms deliveries for Israel's Gaza war -- as an example of why many believe the Israeli leader must go.</p>

<p>"Biden is the biggest supporter of Israel... and Netanyahu spit on his face," said Ben Itzhak.</p>

<p>"He's destroying the very important relationship with the United States."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'The Green Prince'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Ben Itzhak -- who joined the security services in the 1990s after premier Yitzhak Rabin's assassination -- has become a leading figure in protests against Netanyahu.</p>

<p>He is part of the "Crime Minister" movement, and once stepped in front of the premier's motorcade during a 2018 anti-corruption protest.</p>

<p>He ended up being tackled by the very security service he once worked for.</p>

<p>Prosecutors are still pressing ahead with a corruption trial against Netanyahu despite the war, and some protesters have tried to break through police lines to get to his home.</p>

<p>Years before his own protest, Ben Itzhak was the handler for Mosab Hassan Yousef, known as "The Green Prince" and the eldest offspring of Hamas co-founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef.</p>

<p>He worked with the Hamas collaborator to follow Palestinian militants to thwart suicide operations, including arresting jailed Fatah figurehead Marwan Barghouti.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel could have been prevented by a double agent like Yousef reporting the plan, and the country's security elite underestimated Hamas, the former spy believes.</p>

<p>"You need an old asset to call you and to tell you something is going wrong. And it seems like we didn't have it," he said.</p>

<p>"We think that our enemy is stupid. In the end, Hamas was smarter. It's very hard to say."</p>

<p>Ben Itzhak believes it is time to "change the equation" in Gaza -- end the war and rally international support to put Mahmud Abbas's Palestinian Authority in charge.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Everything is explosive'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"The military rules the West Bank, rules Gaza. Enough. We need to find the solution," he said.</p>

<p>Ben Itzhak accuses Netanyahu of propping up Hamas while seeking to nix any peace process so he can stay in power.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu thinks only about himself, about his criminal problems, how to survive politically in Israel," he said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly denied allegations of corruption, and on Monday reiterated that Israeli forces will eliminate Hamas.</p>

<p>"We will not end the war (in Gaza) until we eliminate Hamas, and until we return residents of the south and north to their homes securely," he told parliament.</p>

<p>The former agent also claims the Israeli leader has let ultranationalist security minister Itamar Ben Gvir use the police as his own "militia" to disrupt weekly anti-government protests in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>He questions Netanyahu's allegiance with the far-right Jewish Power party frontman who was once barred from the Israeli military and investigated by the country's security services for extremism.</p>

<p>"God... didn't help us on October 7, the way he didn't help us in Auschwitz," he said.</p>

<p>Ben Itzhak said he himself has jumped in front of a water cannon to protect protesters from increasing police brutality, which landed him with a conviction that was overturned in March.</p>

<p>"Today Israel from the inside is destroyed. He (Netanyahu) is destroying everything," he said.</p>

<p>The more Netanyahu bends to the ultranationalist allies, the weaker Israel's security, says Ben Itzhak, claiming that they are also taking control of the army and prison service.</p>

<p>"Everything is explosive now," he said.</p>

<p>"I will tell Netanyahu... resign. This will be the biggest help you can do to the people of the State of Israel."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A millionaire investment banker who was under scrutiny after punching a Black woman during a pride event in New York has resigned from his job.&nbsp;Melissa Chiles, a spokesperson for Moelis &amp; Company, confirmed the information in an email to&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/banker-nyc-pride-festival-attack-b2568124.html"><em>The Independent</em>.</a>&nbsp;''Jonathan Kaye has resigned and is no longer with the firm,'' she said. As of Monday, his profile is no longer available on the Moelis website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/millionaire-investment-banker-punches-woman-in-the-face-at-brooklyn-pride-watch-5857850">video showed Mr Kaye</a>, head of the global business services franchise at Manhattan-based Moelis &amp; Co, hitting a woman's face, causing her to collapse on the ground in front of a crowd at a Brooklyn Pride event in Park Slope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the video, the man claimed that the woman, who has not been identified, ''threw s*** all over me.''&nbsp; The 38-year-old woman told police that the assault left her with a broken nose, lacerations and a black eye.'' It is being said that Mr Kaye, who is Jewish, and the unidentified woman got into a verbal altercation over the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Mr Kaye said he had been ''in fear for his physical safety when he was surrounded by an angry mob of agitators who encircled him, physically assaulted him, and threw unknown liquids on him.''</p>

<p>''He could not identify any of these individuals and was left bloodied from the attack,'' the spokesperson said, adding that ''given the sharp rise in antisemitic incidents, any Jewish person in this situation would naturally feel threatened and feel the need to defend themselves and return safely to their family.''</p>

<p>After the video went viral, he was put on leave by his firm, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/24/business/millionaire-banker-filmed-punching-woman-at-brooklyn-pride-event-quits-job/">New York Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New York City Police Department last week confirmed it had opened an investigation into Mr Kaye after receiving an official complaint of assault.</p>

<p>Mr Kaye previously held a position as managing director of the Global Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Group at CitiBank.&nbsp;He reportedly lives in a $4m home in the borough's Park Slope neighbourhood, holds a bachelor's degree from Tufts University, and graduated cum laude from Duke University School of Law.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in the US state of Texas have arrested a man in connection with the killing of a 32-year-old Indian national during a robbery at a convenience store in Dallas.</p>

<p>Dasari Gopikrishna, who came to the US only eight months ago, was shot dead&nbsp; at the convenience store in Pleasant Grove, Dallas, on June 21.</p>

<p>He hailed from the Yajali village of the Bapatla district in Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>Police have arrested 21-year-old Davonta Mathis for murdering Gopikrishna.</p>

<p>He faces capital murder charges for fatally shooting Gopikrisna multiple times, including in the head.</p>

<p>During the robbery, Mathis walked into the store, approached the counter and shot Gopikrishna. He stole items before running away, police said.</p>

<p>Gopikrishna was taken to the hospital in critical condition and later died.</p>

<p>Mathis was originally arrested and charged with robbery, but the charge was upgraded to capital murder because of Gopikrishna's death.</p>

<p>His bond is set at USD 7.5 million.</p>

<p>Sgt. Curtis Phillip of the Mesquite Police described Mathis' behaviour as "very bizarre," noting the significant impact of his decisions at such a young age.</p>

<p>Mathis is also charged in a separate fatal shooting in Waco city on June 20. He shot Muhammad Hussain, 60, multiple times, who died from injuries at the hospital.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian consulate here is finalising arrangements with Gopikrishna's family to repatriate his body, officials said.</p>

<p>Representatives from the Telugu Association of North America (TANA) and family friends are collaborating with the consulate to facilitate the transportation of Gopikrishna's body to his hometown in India.</p>

<p>The consulate has confirmed that all police autopsies and necessary formalities have been completed, and they are prioritising the shipment of the body by Tuesday.</p>

<p>Gopikrishna's murder is the second in as many days of a convenience store clerk working the night shift.</p>

<p>The incident has deeply affected the Indian community in Dallas and surrounding areas. Gopikrishna is survived by his wife and son.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron and King Abdullah II of Jordan Monday called on Israel to lift all land-based "restrictions" on the delivery of aid to war-torn Gaza, the presidency said.</p>

<p>UN agencies have repeatedly warned of severe shortages of vital supplies in Gaza, exacerbated by restrictions on access by land and the closure of the key Rafah crossing with Egypt since Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side in early May.</p>

<p>Over lunch at the Elysee Palace, Macron and Abdullah II reiterated the need for an "immediate and lasting ceasefire in Gaza" and called for the release of all hostages -- including two French nationals.</p>

<p>The leaders also "expressed their deep concern about the situation in the West Bank and strongly condemned the violence committed by settlers", the Elysee Palace said in a statement.</p>

<p>They agreed to continue to work together on a "lasting and credible solution" to the war based on the "two-state solution" and welcomed reforms undertaken by the Palestinian government and called for them to be continued.</p>

<p>Referring to the intensification of tensions on the Israeli-Lebanese border, Macron and Abdullah II warned against a "conflagration that would be catastrophic for the region", and reiterated their calls to all parties for "responsibility and restraint".</p>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the Gaza war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The Hamas operatives also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 42 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,626 people, also mostly civilians, the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said Monday he was "deeply disturbed" by reports that a woman allegedly attempted to drown a Palestinian-American child at a pool in Texas.</p>

<p>The woman has been charged with capital murder, court records show, following the May incident which gained national attention over the weekend.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old, identified as Elizabeth Wolf, allegedly approached a mother who was wearing a hijab at a suburban apartment pool near Dallas.</p>

<p>She then asked whether the mother's six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter belonged to her and also made racial statements, according to US media reports.</p>

<p>The woman reportedly grabbed the boy, who was able to wrangle free, then grabbed the girl, whom she pushed underwater.</p>

<p>"No child should ever be subjected to a violent attack, and my heart goes out to the family," Biden said on X on Monday.</p>

<p>"I am deeply disturbed by the reports of an attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian-American at a neighborhood pool," he said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which has called for a hate crimes probe, held a press conference on the incident.</p>

<p>In a statement from CAIR, the mother said her family were American citizens of Palestinian origin.</p>

<p>The episode comes with the war in Gaza igniting fierce passions in the United States, particularly on university campuses, where there have been numerous protests.</p>

<p>It has also led to a number of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic acts across the country.</p>

<p>In November, a man shot and injured three students of Palestinian origin in the northeast state of Vermont.</p>

<p>And in early October, a six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death near Chicago in a crime linked directly to the war in Gaza, according to police.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is set to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, as part of a deal with the Biden administration. This agreement is expected to end Assange's legal saga, which spanned nearly 15 years.</p>

<p><strong>Case Against Assange</strong></p>

<p>The case against Assange originates from WikiLeaks' publication of sensitive US military documents, war logs, and diplomatic cables between 2010 and 2011. These disclosures, including footage of a US airstrike in Baghdad, constituted one of the largest breaches of state secrets in US history. Assange was accused of conspiring with Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, to obtain classified materials.</p>

<p>Chelsea Manning, who leaked the documents, was convicted in 2013 but had her 35-year prison sentence commuted by President Barack Obama in 2017.</p>

<p>The US criminally charged Assange in 2019 under the Trump administration with violating the Espionage Act and was seeking to extradite him from the UK, where he has been in prison ever since. The initial charges — 17 related to espionage and one to computer misuse — carried a maximum penalty of 175 years in prison if he was found guilty on all counts.</p>

<p><strong>Plea Deal</strong></p>

<p>Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to violating US espionage law. As part of the deal, he will be sentenced to 62 months, which corresponds to the time he has already served in UK prisons. The sentencing will take place at a hearing scheduled on Wednesday in Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>After sentencing, he will return to his home in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Global Campaign And Support</strong></p>

<p>During his ordeal, Assange became a hero to free speech campaigners around the world and a villain to those who thought he endangered US national security and intelligence sources by revealing secrets.</p>

<p>He has spent more than a decade either in custody or holed up in Ecuador's London embassy, trying to avoid extradition. Assange has been detained in London's high-security Belmarsh prison for the last five years.</p>

<p>According to WikiLeaks, Assange's plea deal and imminent return to Australia are the result of a global campaign involving grassroots organizers, press freedom advocates, legislators, and leaders from various political backgrounds. This support extended to international bodies such as the United Nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

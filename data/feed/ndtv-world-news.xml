       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi and other female inmates were hurt in clashes that erupted at Tehran's Evin prison following a spate of executions, her family said, raising new concerns for her health.</p>

<p>Iranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation had taken place on Tuesday but blamed Mohammadi for a "provocation" and denied any of the prisoners had been beaten.</p>

<p>Human rights activist Mohammadi, 52, who won the 2023 prize for her campaigning including against the death penalty, has been jailed since November 2021 and has spent much of the past decade in and out of prison.</p>

<p>The Paris-based family of Mohammadi emphasised it had had no direct contact with her since her right to make phone calls was revoked in November.</p>

<p>But it said it had learnt from several other families of detainees held in Evin that clashes erupted on Tuesday as the female prisoners launched a protest in the yard against the executions.</p>

<p>According to rights groups, around 30 convicts were hanged this week, including Gholamreza (Reza) Rasaei, who the Iranian judiciary said was executed on Tuesday in connection with 2022 protests.</p>

<p>"The protest by prisoners against the execution of Reza Rasaei led to a violent crackdown by prison guards and security agents," Mohammadi's family said in a statement late Thursday, citing the reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten. The confrontation escalated, resulting in physical injuries for some prisoners."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Deeply worried' -</strong></p>

<p>The family said that after being punched in the chest, Mohammadi suffered a respiratory attack and intense chest pain, causing her to collapse and faint on the ground in the prison yard.</p>

<p>She was bruised and treated in the prison infirmary but not transferred to a hospital outside, it said.</p>

<p>"We are deeply worried about her health and well-being under these circumstances," the family said.</p>

<p>Relatives and supporters had earlier this month raised concern about Mohammadi's condition, saying they had been informed of the results of medical tests carried out in July "which showed a worrying deterioration of her health".</p>

<p>In the past eight months, Mohammadi has been suffering from acute back and knee pain, including a slipped disc. In 2021, a stent was placed on one of her main coronary arteries due to a blockage.</p>

<p>Iran's prison authority denied that prisoners were beaten and blamed the confrontation on Mohammadi and other inmates who it said had broken the lock of an outer door.</p>

<p>Two prisoners "had heart palpitations due to the stress," but medical examinations determined that their general condition "is favourable," it said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- 'Alarmingly high' -</strong></p>

<p>Reports have suggested increasing tensions in the women's wing of Evin prison after two Kurdish female activists, Sharifeh Mohammadi and Pakhshan Azizi, were sentenced to death on charges of membership of an outlawed group.</p>

<p>Rights groups say that Iran has intensified the use of capital punishment after a brief lull in the run-up to the June-July election that brought reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian to power.</p>

<p>Authorities executed 29 people at two prisons in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj on Wednesday alone, according to Norway-based Iran Human Rights.</p>

<p>Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, "is extremely concerned" by the reports, spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told journalists in Geneva. "This represents an alarmingly high number of executions in such a short period of time."</p>

<p>Mohammadi has kept campaigning even behind bars and strongly supported the protests that erupted across Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini. The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's strict dress rules for women.</p>

<p>She received a new one-year prison term in June for "propaganda against the state", adding to sentences that already amounted to 12 years and three months of imprisonment, 154 lashes, two years of exile and various social and political restrictions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Peru's Mashco Piro tribe recently used bows and arrows to attack loggers suspected of encroaching on their territory in the Amazon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peru's Mashco Piro tribe recently used bows and arrows to attack loggers suspected of encroaching on their territory in the Amazon. According to <em>CBS News</em>, the regional Indigenous organisation FENAMAD said on Monday that it believes illegal logging was taking place on Mashco Piro territory and that one logger was injured in the July 27 attack.</p>

<p>This comes weeks after photos emerged of the uncontacted tribe searching for food on a beach in the Peruvian Amazon. Experts say the pictures were evidence that logging concessions are "dangerously close" to its territory. Survival International, an advocacy group for Indigenous peoples which closely follows the Mashco Piro's issues, said that photos and videos showed about 53 male Mashco Piro on the beach. The group estimated as many as 100 to 150 tribal members would have been in the area with women and children nearby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is presumably illegal because the area where the incident occurred is a forestry concession that belonged to Wood Tropical Forest until November 2022, and we are not aware of a concession that has requested or granted enabling rights in the same area," said a FENAMAD representative, speaking anonymously out of personal security concerns, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uncontacted-tribe-mashco-piro-attacks-loggers-arrows-peru-amazon/"><em>CBS News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The organisation further stated that a lack of protection measures by the Peruvian government and the increased activity of companies and illegal operators on the Mascho Piro territory could produce "devastating consequences", such as the transmission of diseases and increased violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing in the area. There have also been several other previous reports of conflicts, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to FENAMAD, increased logging activity in the area is likely pushing the tribe out of their traditional lands. They believe that the Mashco Piro may be venturing closer to settlements in search of food and a safer refuge.</p>

<p>Separately, Survival International said it is pressuring the Peruvian government to move deeper into these areas of the Amazon to help control the situation. "This is a permanent emergency. For the last month we have been seeing the Mascho Piro every two weeks at different points, and in all of them they are surrounded by loggers," Teresa Mayo, a researcher at Survival International, told CBS News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's truly a matter of life and death. And only the government can and has the duty to stop it," Ms Mayo said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi students battled police for control of the streets and won, but if their country is to embark on a new journey, someone has to clear the road ahead.</p>

<p>Gridlock is a fact of life in the capital Dhaka, a megacity of 20 million which relies on a corps of police wardens to clear long snarls of cars and pedal rickshaws through intersections.</p>

<p>With officers on strike after the resignation of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina, the students who forced her ouster have stepped up to do the job themselves.</p>

<p>"Our country can't remain in a standstill," Nasrin Akter Koly, 21, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We clashed with the police, that's why the police are not on duty," she added. "So instead of the police, our people must do the work."</p>

<p>Traffic control is a humdrum job at the best of times and many of Dhaka's usual wardens are known for a casual indifference to aggressive drivers zooming by out of turn.</p>

<p>But Koly and her classmates have brought a new enthusiasm to the vocation as they wave through cars at one of the downtown business district's busiest crossroads.</p>

<p>Drivers are in turn treating the volunteers with respect.</p>

<p>Nearly all are stopping on command and heeding polite but firm directions to fasten their seatbelts -- the kind of minor traffic infraction that would have previously been ignored.</p>

<p>"After a revolution, every country faces some difficulties," said Nahid Kalam Nabil, 22, while directing traffic alongside Koly.</p>

<p>"The students are handling the situation now, and they will keep the country safe," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Teaching the people'</strong></p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed during weeks of clashes between protesters and security forces before Hasina quit and fled to India on Monday.</p>

<p>Protests had been largely peaceful until police attempted to violently disperse them, setting in motion the chain of events that led to the end of Hasina's iron-fisted 15-year tenure.</p>

<p>Dozens of police officers were killed in the unrest, according to police and hospital figures given to AFP.</p>

<p>After her departure, vandalism and arson attacks hit roughly 450 of the country's 600 police stations, according to the force.</p>

<p>Police unions declared a national strike on Tuesday "until the security" of officers was assured, and a new police chief apologised for the conduct of officers under his sacked predecessor.</p>

<p>Unrest has since subsided, thanks in part to students volunteering for neighbourhood watch patrols and guarding houses of worship for minority religions, which were subjected to isolated looting attacks.</p>

<p>"They are safeguarding the houses at night, they are safeguarding the mosques, temples and churches," Nabil said.</p>

<p>"They are teaching the people law and order. They are designing the country in a new way."</p>

<p>Many police officers began returning to work Friday with soldiers -- held in high esteem for not intervening on Hasina's side during the unrest -- standing guard.</p>

<p>Farida Akhter, a member of the interim government tasked with steering democratic reforms, told AFP that restoring law and order was the "first priority" of the new dispensation.</p>

<p>The sudden collapse of Hasina's administration left a gaping vacuum in political administration, with many civil servants staying home waiting for the dust to settle.</p>

<p>The city government in Dhaka has also laid low, prompting other student volunteers to take on its duties.</p>

<p>"With this students' protest, we have made a fascist regime fall," 20-year-old Samanjar Chowdhury Mrittika told AFP while wielding a broom to sweep up garbage from a downtown sidewalk.</p>

<p>"The country is not in a good condition," she added. "Someone must take responsibility."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crowds fleeing Khan Yunis after an Israeli evacuation order gave way to empty streets on Friday as Palestinian residents tried to escape a new Israeli military operation in Gaza's main southern area.</p>

<p>"They threw leaflets at us, ordering us to evacuate", Reem Abu Hayya told AFP, referring to the flyers that Israeli forces drop from planes to order the evacuation of areas ahead of a military operation.</p>

<p>The Khan Yunis area had already seen evacuation orders in late July, and heavy fighting that devastated the area earlier this year.</p>

<p>"We don't know where we're going, and we have sick and disabled people with us. Where can we go?" Abu Hayya asked AFP as she stood on the street in front of a building reduced to a pile of rebar and broken concrete.</p>

<p>In a besieged territory that has been consistently bombed over the past 10 months and where supplies enter with great difficulty, people carried all they could as they fled on Thursday.</p>

<p>AFP journalists saw one young man carrying planks of wood loosely tied in bundles, to be used as shelter structure or fuel in the near future.</p>

<p>With petrol scarce, only the most fortunate drove, often with mattresses piled high on the car roof. The vast majority walked. They carried their belongings in plastic and garbage bags, on donkey-pulled carts, bikes, strollers or wheelchairs.</p>

<p>By dusk, streets of Khan Yunis stood completely deserted and eerily quiet, AFP journalists reported. Only the ruins of buildings damaged in earlier strikes still stood.</p>

<p>The flyers dropped Thursday ordered residents to leave eastern towns of Khan Yunis governorate including Al-Salqa, Al-Qarara, Bani Suheila, and neighbourhoods in the city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>"Hamas and terrorist organisations continue to launch rockets from your areas", read the flyers which echoed past orders and warned that the Israeli army "will act forcefully against these elements".</p>

<p>Late last month Philippe Lazzarini, who heads the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on social media site X that only "14 percent of areas in Gaza" were not subject to evacuation orders.</p>

<p>On Friday, the military said it launched a new operation in Khan Yunis following "intelligence indicating the presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure" there.</p>

<p>"The troops are engaging in combat both above and below-ground to eliminate terrorists in the area while locating and dismantling weaponry and terrorist infrastructure," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>'We are exhausted'</strong></p>

<p>The military has often returned in Gaza to areas where it had previously completed major operations against Palestinian militants, only to find them resurfacing or to act on intelligence about the location of hostages.</p>

<p>"Enough! For both, the Jews and Hamas! Both of them should look at the people of Gaza, have mercy on us for God's sake," Ahmed al-Najjar, angry at the war and the prospect of yet another displacement, told AFP.</p>

<p>War in Gaza began when Hamas Palestinian militants on October 7 attacked southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 39,699 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Mohammad al-Farra, from Sheikh Nasser in the east of Khan Yunis, also expressed frustration at the several displacements his family has lived through.</p>

<p>"We were the first to return to our home... as soon as the military operation in our area ended, to escape the heat, the displacement, and the hardship", the 46-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"Then the occupation returned to drive us out again, making us suffer the tragedy multiple times over", he said, referring to Israel.</p>

<p>"We are exhausted. The war must end immediately so that we can feel human again, even just a little."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian ground troops and mechanized forces crossed the international border, advancing over 30 kilometres into Russian territory in one of the most significant developments in the ongoing war between the two countries. The Ukrainian troops, estimated to be over 1,000, moved from the Sumy Oblast region of north-east Ukraine and have taken over Kursk Oblast of Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine's incursion caught Russia off-guard, which is now scrambling troops to stop the advance. Kyiv conducted intense artillery and drone attacks along with the movement of mechanized troops into enemy territory.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-8-2024">The Institute for Study of War</a> (ISW), a non-profit, geolocated the positions of Ukrainian troops through open-source videos and pictures of the operation and marked the territories that have witnessed Ukrainian advance. The blue region indicates the areas where Ukrainians have entered.</p>

<p>Russia has scrambled its troops to stop the further incursion of Ukrainians. The objective of the Ukrainian operation is unclear, but ever since the war began in February 2022, Kyiv's operation appears to be the biggest challenge Putin's Russia has faced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukraine has been largely silent on the offensive. Meanwhile, Russia has announced a "federal emergency" and has scrambled troops to defend the area.</p>

<h2><strong>Geolocating Ukrainian Advance</strong></h2>

<p>ISW said the advance of the Ukrainian mechanized troops comprising tanks, infantry and armoured vehicles almost 35 km into Russia was "rapid", but ISW said it does not appear that the Ukrainians most certainly "do not control that area".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian conscripts, the FSB border guards and elements of Chechen "Akhmat" units, a motorized unit operating in the Chechen Republic and fighting for Russia, are operating in the Kursk region and built field fortifications along the border. They were breached by the Ukrainian troops. Based on the information accessed by ISW, as of August 8, Ukrainian troops are located in Sverdlikovo, Sudhza, Malaya and Lyubimovka.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a "large-scale provocation" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general has vowed to crush it. Meanwhile, a Chechen Akhmat unit official said, "The situation is not irreversible. Nothing supernatural happened, yes, our people died, that's a fact. The enemy has entered several settlements," said General Apti Alaudinov, a close ally of Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov and commander of Akhmat special forces.</p>

<p>Russian military bloggers claim that the Ukrainian troops are advancing in small units from Russia's rear and bypassing their fortifications before engaging Russian forces and then withdrawing from the engagements without attempting to consolidate control over their furthest advances.</p>

<p>The new frontline in Russia is far from other areas where intense fighting has taken place since the war began. Significant fighting took place in eastern Ukraine, a major chunk of which is claimed to be under Russian control. In the east, Donetsk, Luhansk and Horlivka had been under Russian control before the war began two years ago. The Russian troops have advanced further west from these regions and control a frontline which runs northeast to south of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the ISW's map, the red line indicates the Russian advance in Ukraine and the black dotted lines toward Russian control of Ukrainian territory before the war began.</p>

<p>Ukrainian drones targeted residential buildings in the border regions of Kursk, Voronezh and Belgorod. Combatants from Ukraine have made several brief incursions into Russia since the beginning of the conflict in February 2022.</p>

<h2><strong>Russia Scrambles Troops</strong></h2>

<p>Russian military experts have slammed officials for not detecting the incursions in the first place. The Ukrainian offensive has entered its third day. Russia initially scrambled air and artillery units to repel the attacks but failed to stop the advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it is sending columns of military hardware, including rocket launchers, artillery, tanks and heavy trucks to reinforce its defences in the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia carried out artillery strikes on a supermarket in eastern Ukraine's Kostyantynivka. The attack is Russia's response to the Ukrainian advance. The shelling killed ten people and wounded 35. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to take revenge for the attack.</p>

<p>"Russia will be held accountable for this terror, and we will do our best to ensure that the world continues to stand with Ukraine in supporting our defense and saving the lives of our people," Zelensky said on X.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Kostyantynivka has witnessed attacks in the past and Russian shelling is a usual occurrence.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Incursion To Gain Leverage?</strong></h2>

<p>Kharkiv in Ukraine has been a major flashpoint between the troops and has witnessed intense battles in the past. In May, Russia launched a new offensive in the region, taking significant territory in Kharkiv. The attacks saw Russia dropping 1,000 kg guided bombs on a hardware store in which 16 were killed.</p>

<p>Last year, Ukrainian troops launched a major counteroffensive to reclaim Kharkiv, which almost reached the border of Russia. Kharkiv has party occupied by Russia since the war began on February 24, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Russian-controlled territory lies very close to the international border and is several kilometres north of Kharkiv city, Ukraine's second-largest city. Ukraine's ongoing incursion in Kursk could be a way to gain leverage on the negotiation table for a truce in areas by forcing the enemy to pull troops from other areas to reinforce the frontline. The Ukrainian objective remains unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington was "reaching out to our Ukrainian counterparts to get a little better understanding". He added "Nothing has changed about our policy" and Ukraine can use US-supplied weapons only "to target imminent threats just across the border".</p>

<p>US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said of the Kremlin: "It is a little bit rich, them calling it a provocation, given Russia violated Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 28-year-old skydiving student in the United States was killed alongside her diving instructor after the pair hit a "dust devil" in California. A dust devil is a small but strong tornado-like whirlwind that forms in very hot conditions and can reach heights of several thousand feet. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the woman, identified as Kayla Kieko Black, was skydiving with veteran instructor Devry LaRiccia Chase on Friday when a "dust devil" sent them into an "uncontrollable spin" that plunged them to their deaths.</p>

<p>"Kayla was deeply cherished by her family and friends, who will forever remember her kindness, warmth and unwavering support," Ms Black's family said in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-kayla-kieko-black-support-for-her-family">GoFundMe page</a>. "In this time of immense sorrow we find solace in knowing that Kayla's legacy will live on through her selfless decision to be an organ donor. Her generosity will provide hope and new beginnings for many individuals and families in need," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/skydiving-student-killed-in-freak-accident-idd-as-kayla-kieko-black/"><em>Post</em></a>, the 28-year-old was jumping in tandem with Devry LaRiccia Chase, an instructor with Skydive Perrisand. The instructor was able to glide away from the first gust but two were trapped in the second. "Eyewitnesses report that the tandem pair experience a normal free fall and parachute deployment," the skydiving firm's manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All aspects of the equipment and skydive was normal without any reported issues until the landing sequence. While preparing for landing the tandem pair hit disturbed air known as a 'dust devil.' The interaction with this sudden disturbed air causes turbulence and a hard landing for both individuals," the manager added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the incident, both, the instructor and the skydiving student, were rushed to a local hospital. Ms LaRiccia's family also started a GoFundMe page to help bring her body to her native state of Maine for burial, with the site raising more than $59,000 by Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The instructor's husband, Freddy Chase, told People he wants Ms Black's family to know that he is "truly sorry for what happened" but that he's "glad that she got to share the last conversation with Devrey ever." He previously also stated that "there was no malfunction" before the incident. He explained that his wife was conducting her final jump of the day when she noticed the dust devils and got caught in one. "It then sent her canopy in an uncontrolled spin to the ground," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The BBC Board said in a statement on Friday that the 62-year-old former news anchor had "undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BBC said Friday it had asked disgraced former presenter Huw Edwards to return his salary from the time he was arrested in November last year on charges of making indecent images of children.</p>

<p>Edwards, one of the most recognisable faces on UK television, pleaded guilty last month to three charges and now faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a minimum of 12 months.</p>

<p>The BBC Board said in a statement on Friday that the 62-year-old former news anchor had "undermined trust in the BBC and brought us into disrepute".</p>

<p>The broadcaster first learned of his arrest last November. He was suspended at the time, but only left the broadcaster five months later and received full pay in the meantime.</p>

<p>This amounted to around £200,000 ($255,000) -- a particular source of anger as the BBC is funded by a licence fee paid by any UK household watching live channels on a television.</p>

<p>The board statement said it had "authorised the Executive to seek the return of salary paid to Mr Edwards from the time he was arrested in November last year.</p>

<p>"Mr Edwards pleaded guilty to an appalling crime. Had he been up front when asked by the BBC about his arrest, we would never have continued to pay him public money," it added.</p>

<p>It did not confirm whether legal action will be taken if Edwards refuses to return the money.</p>

<p>The broadcaster also announced an independent review into workplace culture.</p>

<p>Police said an investigation into Edwards began after a phone seized by officers as part of an unrelated probe revealed the broadcaster's participation in a WhatsApp conversation.</p>

<p>Edwards, a leading anchor and the BBC's presenter on key events such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.</p>

<p>He quit in April after 40 years with the broadcaster.</p>

<p>Edwards himself has not publicly commented on the allegations.</p>

<p>The BBC's brand has been built on public trust but the broadcaster has been rocked in recent years by scandals which saw some big names revealed as serial sex offenders.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken charge of a fractured Bangladesh after a meeting between President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and student activists. Promising to "uphold, support and protect the constitution", Yunus has called for the restoration of law and order as his government faces the reality of the withering away of state apparatus. Sheikh Hasina is gone, but the real challenge begins now. A new reality confronts the people of Bangladesh. There is a new sense of optimism, but it is embedded in a deeply divided society and polity.</p>

<h2><strong>From Certainty To Doubts</strong></h2>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already extended his best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on his new role and has expressed hope for a swift return to normalcy, emphasising the importance of ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all minority communities. For India, challenges abound as Hasina, its long-standing partner, had to depart in ignominy. The certainty of the last 15 years has given way to a sense of the unknown. New Delhi had invested in its partnership with Dhaka confident that the Hasina dispensation would not let it down. As a result, a bilateral partnership that followed could not only resolve some of the most testing challenges but it also emerged as an anchor in the wider Bay of Bengal.</p>

<p>However, Hasina's tendency to centralise decision-making and marginalise the opposition managed to limit Bangladesh's evolution into a mature democracy. As Hasina drifted towards authoritarianism, New Delhi's options got further curtailed. Now, India has to ensure that it manages to build ties with the new leadership in Dhaka.</p>

<h2><strong>Building New Relationships</strong></h2>

<p>After signalling clearly that India will stand by its allies by getting Hasina out of Bangladesh, the next step is to engage the emerging political stakeholders in Bangladesh. This is needed not only for the long-term stability of Delhi-Dhaka ties but also for managing the immediate challenges of protecting minorities within Bangladesh and stabilising the highly volatile border area.</p>

<p>India shares a largely porous 4,096 km of land border with Bangladesh. This border runs along the states of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram, areas once frequented by insurgent groups. However, under Hasina's leadership, the border remained relatively calm, as these groups have been prevented from finding refuge in Bangladesh. There are already reports of turbulence and New Delhi has asked its border security forces to be on high alert. With India facing serious challenges along its borders with Pakistan and China, the new reality with Bangladesh bodes ill for national security.</p>

<h2><strong>Extremism Remains A Concern</strong></h2>

<p>The rise of Islamist extremism in Bangladesh is another challenge that New Delhi will be closely watching. Before Hasina, various extremist groups were flourishing under the patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government. Many of these groups, such as the Ansarullah Bangla Team, the Hizb ut-Tahrir, and the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), have had links to various terrorist outfits based in Pakistan as well as to the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The present situation in Bangladesh opens up new possibilities for reviving these links. Jamaat-e-Islami is widely viewed as a key instigator of the recent riots that toppled Hasina. The Hasina government had banned it in 2013, but today it has re-emerged as a major political force.</p>

<p>The systematic targeting of Hindus also poses a challenge to India-Bangladesh ties as it will harden the mood in New Delhi against any engagement with Dhaka. Domestic politics in both nations will have to maturely handle rapidly deteriorating perceptions about each other.</p>

<h2><strong>Balancing Other Neighbours</strong></h2>

<p>In recent years, the two South Asian neighbours have been focused on enhancing trade and connectivity so as to turn the Bay of Bengal into a hub of regional economic framework. Political trust is a crucial variable in shaping today's economic partnerships. Unless the new government in Dhaka is able to generate trust in Delhi, it won't be possible to revive the old paradigm of bilateral economic engagement. This would be a loss for India as its ability to make its northeastern region economically dynamic is premised on strong India-Bangladesh economic ties. But it would also be a loss for Bangladesh, which has effectively leveraged its two regional economic partners - India and China - to reinvigorate its economic potential.</p>

<p>New Delhi would also be wary of Pakistan and China trying to fish in the troubled waters of the Bay of Bengal. The logic of geography dictates that both Delhi and Dhaka will have to engage each other to nurture their aspiration. It is easy to forget how much despair there was about India-Bangladesh ties before Hasina had come to power. But at a time when India sees itself as a leading global power, it cannot afford to ignore the challenges emanating from its most important partner in South Asia.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air India will not run flights to and from Tel Aviv amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, the airlines said. The decision to suspend services to Tel Aviv was first taken on August 2, but the Tata Group-owned carrier was expected to resume operations today.</p>

<p>But Air India has said that Tel Aviv flights will remain suspended until further notice.</p>

<p>"In view of the current situation in parts of the Middle East, scheduled operation of our flights to and from Tel Aviv are suspended with immediate effect until further notice," the airlines said in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</p>

<p>"We are continuously monitoring the situation and are offering a full refund to our passengers with confirmed bookings for travel to and from Tel Aviv. Safety of our guests and crew remains our topmost priority," it added.</p>

<p>Earlier this year also, Air India had briefly suspended flights to Tel Aviv at different points of time due to the Middle East tensions.</p>

<p>After nearly five months, the carrier had recommenced the services to the Israeli city on March 3.</p>

<p>Air India had suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv starting on October 7, 2023, after the Hamas group's attack on the Israeli city</p>

<p>Tensions continue to remain high in the Middle East amid conflict between Israel and various terror groups, including Hamas.</p>

<p>As Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.</p>

<p>A relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian strike on a supermarket in the eastern Ukrainian town of Kostyantynivka on Friday killed at least 10 people and injured 35, Ukraine's interior minister said.</p>

<p>The town is about 13 kilometres (eight miles) from the nearest Russian positions and faces almost daily strikes.</p>

<p>"10 were killed and 35 others were wounded," Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>He published photos of firefighters working amid the smouldering rubble of the destroyed building.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Police in England said Thursday that forces nationwide had now arrested nearly 500 people for alleged participation in the unrest that began on July 30, while around a dozen people were jailed on Thursday for involvement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Friday that authorities "have to stay on high alert going into this weekend", amid fears of further far-right riots in English towns and cities.</p>

<p>Starmer said the work by the criminal justice system in recent days, including judges swiftly handing down lengthy jail sentences to some rioters, had acted as a deterrent to more violence.</p>

<p>His comments came after two nights of relative quiet across England, after a week of near nightly unrest in more than a dozen towns and cities in the wake of a deadly knife attack that killed three children.</p>

<p>Disturbances have continued unabated in Northern Ireland, however, where police have blamed pro-UK loyalist paramilitaries for fuelling nightly violence in Belfast.</p>

<p>"I'm absolutely convinced that having the police officers in place these last few days, and the swift justice that has been dispensed in our courts have had a real impact," Starmer told UK broadcasters about the situation in England.</p>

<p>"But we have to stay on high alert going into this weekend because we absolutely have to make sure that our communities are safe and secure and feel safe and secure."</p>

<p>Speaking during a visit to the headquarters of London's Metropolitan Police, he said potential unrest caused by the start of the football season would be "added into the mix" of challenges facing police this weekend.</p>

<p>Some far-right rioters and agitators are believed to have links to England's decades-old football hooligan scene, which has diminished since its heyday in the 1980s but can still see violence on match days.</p>

<p>Police in England said Thursday that forces nationwide had now arrested nearly 500 people for alleged participation in the unrest that began on July 30, while around a dozen people were jailed on Thursday for involvement.</p>

<p>The disturbances, first sparked by a July 29 knife attack that killed three children, have seen mosques and migrant-related facilities attacked alongside police and other targets.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed misinformation spread on social media about the suspected perpetrator for fuelling the disorder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russia is moving army units with "BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, towed artillery guns, tanks transported on trawls, heavy tracked vehicles, Ural and Kamaz trucks" to Kursk's Sudzhansky District, the defence ministry said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Friday said it was deploying more troops and munitions to a frontier region where Ukraine has mounted a major ground offensive, while Russia struck a supermarket in east Ukraine, killing at least 10 people.</p>

<p>Kyiv's troops have been driving into Russia's western Kursk region since Tuesday in a surprise offensive that appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since Moscow invaded in February 2022.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it was sending columns of military hardware, including rocket launchers, artillery, tanks and heavy trucks to reinforce its defences in the region, state media reported Friday.</p>

<p>The Russian army said around 1,000 Ukrainian troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks were involved in the initial attack, although it has since claimed to have destroyed many more pieces of hardware.</p>

<p>Kyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the attack, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia needed to "feel" the consequences of its invasion.</p>

<p>Both sides also stepped up aerial attacks behind the frontlines on Friday.</p>

<p>A Russian artillery strike on a supermarket in the east Ukrainian town of Kostyantynivka during the middle of the day killed at least 10 people and wounded 35, Ukrainian Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>The town is about 13 kilometres (eight miles) from the nearest Russian positions and faces almost daily strikes.</p>

<p>"Russia will be held accountable for this terror," Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>AFP journalists on the scene saw dozens of people fleeing as police officers warned of a potential second strike.</p>

<p>Plumes of black smoke rose from the building and police cordoned off nearby streets. Drones and an uptick in artillery fire in the area were also audible.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Russia brought the war' -</strong></p>

<p>Russian troops have been slowly advancing for months in the Donetsk region where Kostyantynivka is located.</p>

<p>Ukraine's surprise offensive into the Kursk region has appeared to catch Russia off guard, with some analysts saying it may be an attempt to force Moscow to divert resources and relieve pressure on other parts of the sprawling front line.</p>

<p>Influential Russian military bloggers have blasted army leaders for failing to spot or quash the incursion.</p>

<p>Senior Kyiv officials have stayed largely tight-lipped, although Zelensky on Thursday appeared to justify the attack.</p>

<p>"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done," he said, without directly referring to the ongoing Ukrainian incursion.</p>

<p>"Everyone can see that the Ukraine army knows how to surprise and knows how to achieve results," he said in another apparent reference to the incursion.</p>

<p>Moscow has also not presented detailed information on the extent of the Ukrainian advance.</p>

<p>The defence ministry said on Friday its troops "continue to repel an attempted incursion by the Ukrainian armed forces" and that it had struck Ukrainian positions on the western edge of Sudzha, a town around eight kilometres (five miles) from the border.</p>

<p><strong>- 35 kilometres -</strong></p>

<p>Based on geolocated videos and photos, the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian units had pierced much further into Russian territory in a "rapid advance".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometres from the international border," the ISW said in its daily campaign assessment.</p>

<p>It cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces "most certainly do not control" that entire area.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a "large-scale provocation" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general has vowed to crush it.</p>

<p>Moscow has already rushed reserves to the region and used drones, artillery and aviation to try to quash the attack.</p>

<p>The health ministry said 66 civilians were wounded, including nine children, in the first three days.</p>

<p>On the first day of the assault, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said five civilians were killed.</p>

<p>Thousands have been evacuated from the region, with Russia putting on an extra train to Moscow from the regional capital, Kursk, for those looking to leave.</p>

<p>Ukraine on Friday expanded its own evacuation zone in the Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk.</p>

<p>"About 20,000 people need to be evacuated" from 28 settlements, Ukraine's national police force said.</p>

<p>Ukraine also said on Friday it had carried out a major air strike on a Russian military base in the Lipetsk region, around 280 kilometres (175 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>It said it had struck "warehouses containing guided aerial bombs and a number of other facilities."</p>

<p>Local Russian officials had earlier reported a "massive" Ukrainian drone attack on the region and state media reported a fire had broken out at the airbase.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iranian Revolutionary Guards said on Friday that its navy has new cruise missiles equipped with highly explosive warheads that are undetectable, state media reported.</p>

<p>The announcement by the country's most powerful security organisation coincides with fears of a full-blown Middle East war after Iran vowed to avenge the assassination in Tehran on July 31 of Ismail Haniyeh, leader of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas.</p>

<p>Iran has blamed Israel, while Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.</p>

<p>"In today's world you either have to be powerful to survive, or surrender. There's no middle ground," said the Guards' top commander, Major-General Hossein Salami.</p>

<p>"A large number of cruise missiles have been added to the Guards' navy fleet. These new missiles have capabilities of highly explosive warheads that are undetectable and can cause extensive damage and sink their targets," a Guards statement said.</p>

<p>The Guards' navy also said in a statement that various types of long and medium-range missile systems, as well as reconnaissance drones and naval radars, have been added to its fleet.</p>

<p>"These systems are among the most up-to-date anti-surface and sub-surface weapons in the Guards' navy," it said.</p>

<p>State television displayed several of the weapons on Friday. The navy added that only 210 of the 2,654 systems were shown as it was not possible to unveil other strategic ones for security reasons.</p>

<p>Iran has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, regarding such weapons as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against US and Israel in the event of war.</p>

<p>According to the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran is armed with the largest number of ballistic missiles in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is recalling more than one million electric stoves in the United States following reports of accidental fires that injured 40 people and killed pets, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday.</p>

<p>Owners of one of the 30 models affected by the voluntary recall are advised to contact Samsung for free replacement knob locks or covers, according to the commission's statement.</p>

<p>More than 1.1 million slide-in electric ranges sold between 2013 and 2024 fall under the recall.</p>

<p>Samsung said the announcement was issued due to reports the knobs could be accidentally activated by people or pets bumping into them. The company did not mention fires or pet deaths in its press release.</p>

<p>According to the safety commission, the Samsung stoves have been involved "in approximately 250 fires," which led to about 40 injuries, eight of which required medical attention.</p>

<p>The commission said there were also reports of seven fires involving pet deaths and 18 instances of "extensive property damage".</p>

<p>People continuing to use the recalled models were cautioned to keep children and pets away from the front-range knobs, and to check them before going to bed.</p>

<p>The South Korean electronics and appliances manufacturer said "consumers may continue to use their slide-in electric ranges while awaiting their set of free knob locks or covers."</p>

<p>Samsung's safety reputation suffered a major blow from a worldwide recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone over exploding batteries in 2016, which cost the company billions of dollars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guards beat female inmates in clashes that erupted at Tehran's Evin prison following a spate of executions, the family of jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi said, raising new concerns about her health.</p>

<p>Rights activist Mohammadi, 52, who won the 2023 prize for her campaigning including against the death penalty, has been jailed since November 2021, and has spent much of the past decade in and out of prison.</p>

<p>The Paris-based family of Mohammadi emphasised it had no direct contact with her since her right to make phone calls was cut in November.</p>

<p>But it said it had learned from several other families of detainees held in Evin that clashes erupted on Tuesday as the female prisoners launched a protest in the yard against the executions.</p>

<p>According to rights groups, around 30 convicts were hanged this week, including Gholamreza (Reza) Rasaei, who the Iranian judiciary said was executed on Tuesday in connection with 2022 protests.</p>

<p>"The protest by prisoners against the execution of Reza Rasaei led to a violent crackdown by prison guards and security agents," Mohammadi's family said in a statement late Thursday, citing the reports.</p>

<p>"Several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten. The confrontation escalated, resulting in physical injuries for some prisoners."</p>

<p>The family said that after being punched in the chest, Mohammadi suffered a respiratory attack and intense chest pain, causing her to collapse and faint on the ground in the prison yard.</p>

<p>She was bruised and treated in the prison infirmary but not transferred to a hospital outside, it said.</p>

<p>"We are deeply worried about her health and well-being under these circumstances," the family said.</p>

<p>Iran's prison authority denied that prisoners were beaten and blamed the confrontation on inmates.</p>

<p>Two prisoners "had heart palpitations due to the stress," but medical examinations determined that their general condition "is favourable," it said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.</p>

<p>Relatives and supporters had earlier this month raised new concern about Mohammadi's condition, saying they had been informed of the results of medical tests carried out in July "which showed a worrying deterioration of her health".</p>

<p>In the past eight months, Mohammadi has been suffering from acute back and knee pain, including a herniated spinal disc. In 2021, a stent was placed on her main heart artery due to a blockage.</p>

<p>Mohammadi has kept campaigning even behind bars and strongly supported the protests that erupted across Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22-year-old Iranian Kurd arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress rules for women.</p>

<p>Mohammadi in June received a new one-year prison term for "propaganda against the state", on top of a litany of other verdicts that already amounted to 12 years and three months of imprisonment, 154 lashes, two years of exile and various social and political restrictions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French police early Friday arrested an Egyptian wrestler taking part in the Olympics over allegedly groping a woman in a bar, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Authorities detained Mohamed Elsayed, 26, in front of a cafe in the French capital's 13th district at around 5 am after he was accused of "placing a hand on the buttocks of a woman patron", the Paris prosecutor's office said.</p>

<p>Elsayed, who won bronze at the Tokyo Games, lost to Azerbaijan's Hasrat Jafarov in the 67 kg Greco-Roman wrestling on Wednesday. His opponent went on to win the bronze medal.</p>

<p>A fellow Egyptian with the same name won a bronze medal in epee fencing at the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the wrestler had since been released.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is facing a bigger threat from Sam Altman's OpenAI even as it awaits a decision on how antitrust regulators in Washington plan to level the playing field in the internet search business.<br />
A US ruling on Monday, which found that Google built an illegal search monopoly, is being considered a big win for regulators. But an increasing number of people using AI tools including OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot is already eroding Google's dominance, sources, investors and analysts said.</p>

<p>"I think for Google right now, AI (is) a much bigger deal than the ruling. AI is fundamentally changing how the search product also works," said Arvind Jain, a former Google engineer who worked on products including Search for a decade.</p>

<p>Jain, who now runs an enterprise search firm called Glean, said AI's impact was immediate compared with any impact from these rulings that get appealed and take a long time to affect a market.</p>

<p>Google has long been synonymous with search, commanding around 90% of the global market share and bringing in about $175 billion in annual revenue through the business. Even Apple, which prefers to build all the software and much of the hardware that goes into its devices, has allowed Google to be its default search engine for a handsome fee.</p>

<p>But the days of preferential treatment for a fee are over even before slew of antitrust court cases resolve. In its AI foray, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to its upcoming devices. It emphasized the deal's non-exclusive basis and talked up the likelihood of bringing on Google as another partner.</p>

<p>A ruling against Google will speed up Apple's move towards AI-powered search services, if it is forced to end its Search deal with Google, analysts have said.</p>

<p>Microsoft-backed OpenAI said last month it was also breaking into the search game with a slow launch of SearchGPT, an AI-powered search engine with real-time access to information from the internet.</p>

<h3><strong>SEARCHGPT</strong></h3>

<p>One former senior Google executive predicted, "AI is going to move faster than the speed that DOJ can move against Google. The whole monopoly will be over, in other words, the speed at which AI will take over search."</p>

<p>Both the former Google executives as well as many Wall Street analysts agree that Google has the raw material needed to take a lead in AI - a large language model to train its AI and a search engine. But the company's efforts seem scattered in the face of OpenAI's onslaught, which is attracting younger users.</p>

<p>Generative AI's popularity caught Google by surprise. Despite being the source of foundational research behind the technology, it did not release a consumer product until well after ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer app in early 2023.</p>

<p>"The biggest threat to Google may be Google itself - key to adoption of any AI is trust, and its original missteps with Search Overviews showed that Google's engineers were focused more on rapid releases than getting it right as it tries to keep up with the pace of OpenAI and others," said Rebecca Wettemann, CEO and principal analyst at research firm Valoir.</p>

<p>Wettemann referred to Google's AI Overviews, a new feature that employs AI to answer search queries that appear ahead of links. It drew fire from publishers watching referral traffic from Google decline and was criticized for delivering errors including telling users to eat glue and saying Barack Obama was a Muslim. Google scaled back the feature earlier this year.</p>

<p>Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, believes the regulatory scrutiny as well as the AI threat are related. "Part of the reason (the DOJ) are coming after Google's business practices is that the market is in fact in flux right now and they want to make sure Google does not extend its current market dominance."</p>

<p>While the antitrust ruling may not have a big impact on Google yet, it should open the search market up for more players, said Richard Socher, CEO and founder of AI search engine startup You.com and former chief scientist at Salesforce.</p>

<p>He added, though, that ending Google's dominance in search will be "very hard."</p>

<p>"No one has really made a big dent into Google search dominance yet ... we'll have to see if this will be yet another domino piece that will fall into place to actually give consumers some more choices, real choices."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

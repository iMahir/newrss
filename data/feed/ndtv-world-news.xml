       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia expressed its "great concern" at the conflict in Lebanon on Monday, calling for the country's "sovereignty and territorial integrity" to be respected.</p>

<p>A foreign ministry statement said: "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is following with great concern the developments taking place in the Republic of Lebanon."</p>

<p>As the country's health ministry said more than a hundred people had been killed in Israel's strikes on targets across the country on Sunday, Riyadh stressed the need to respect Lebanon's sovereignty.</p>

<p>"The Kingdom calls on the international community to assume its responsibilities towards protecting regional peace and security to spare the region and its people the dangers and tragedies of wars," it added.</p>

<p>Israel has carried out several days of deadly strikes on targets in Lebanon, killing the leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group Hassan Nasrallah on Friday and other senior figures in the movement.</p>

<p>There have been growing calls internationally for restraint from Israel as it prepares for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon, amid fears of all-out war in the Middle East.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia has lost 651,810 troops since the onset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said. This figure, released on September 29, includes 1,170 Russian casualties recorded in just one day.</p>

<p>In addition to troop casualties, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid0r4aNSzquVq6yvzhBtrd9NJtQeifM6kKgeGXzCcgxKUGEtxqbRqLFXadSAVAZGGq8l">the report</a> said Russia lost 8,869 tanks, 17,476 armoured fighting vehicles, and 25,495 vehicles and fuel tanks.</p>

<p>Other significant losses include 18,795 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 962 air defence systems, 369 aeroplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,186 drones, 28 ships and boats and one submarine.</p>

<p>On the same day, at least 16 people were reported wounded due to a series of Russian strikes on Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine. The regional capital experienced multiple “massive aerial strikes” early in the morning, destroying a multi-storey building and several houses. Among the wounded were two children aged eight and 17, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/ukraine-war-briefing-zaporizhzhia-attacks-injured-russia ">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring Donetsk region, three killings and additional injuries were reported following Russian attacks on Pokrovsk, a city in the throes of the ongoing assault. Ukrainian emergency services said they were working to rescue those trapped under rubble.</p>

<p>Regional officials noted the extensive damage caused by the strikes, with Governor Ivan Fedorov confirming that one of the train stations in Zaporizhzhya was also hit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, condemned the attacks, accusing Russia of attempting to “terrorise” the civilian population. He reiterated calls for increased military support from Western allies, including advanced weaponry to intercept Russian missile strikes.</p>

<p>Denmark has pledged $194 million to support Ukraine's military, while Norway is considering border security measures.</p>

<p>Earlier, former US President <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-meets-ukraines-zelenskiy-vows-to-end-ukraine-war-quickly-6664967">Donald Trump met Ukrainian President</a> Volodymyr Zelensky at Trump Tower, stressing the need to end the war in Ukraine. Zelensky invited Trump to visit Ukraine, while the Republican presidential nominee claimed he could quickly resolve the conflict if re-elected.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Long Island man is facing murder charges after allegedly killing his friend during an altercation in the Hamptons early Saturday morning. Jeremy Allen, 43, was arrested after police discovered the body of Christopher Hahn, 43, hidden under a tarp on Allen's back patio.<br />
<br />
According to authorities, the two drunken men were discussing their plans for a 12-step recovery programme when their conversation turned heated. Prosecutors said Allen beat Hahn for approximately six hours before ultimately stabbing him in the head and neck with a large knife.<br />
<br />
Suffolk County prosecutor Elena Tomaro described the attack as “brutal and heinous to watch”. Allen's lawyer reported that the two men were “pounding down drinks” before the violent altercation. Allen has a history of drunk driving offences dating back to 2007, raising concerns about his conduct.<br />
<br />
After the attack, Allen texted a local handyman for cleanup assistance. However, the handyman discovered the bloodied body and instead contacted Southampton Town Police. Southampton Town Police responded to the scene shortly before 10 am, where Christopher Hahn was pronounced dead.<br />
<br />
Jeremy Allen was taken into custody about an hour later and was arraigned on Sunday, where he was ordered to be held without bail. He also has a pending rape case in Southampton and is currently on probation for a 2022 drunken driving conviction in Ulster County.<br />
<br />
This incident follows another case in Ohio where a 40-year-old man was charged with murder after <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-man-stabs-mother-to-death-after-being-denied-overnight-stay-at-family-home-6318691">fatally stabbing his mother</a> during a heated argument. The incident occurred in Green Township when Kenneth Mortimer's mother refused his request to stay overnight at their family home.<br />
<br />
The confrontation escalated, leading Mortimer to get a knife from the kitchen and attack both his parents. Despite his mother's attempts to flee and call for help, she succumbed to her injuries, while Mortimer's father remained in serious condition at a hospital. The man fled the scene but was later apprehended by police.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>K-pop star Suga, a member of the boy band supergroup BTS, has been fined 15 million won ($11,500) by a court for drunk driving while on an electric scooter. A judge at the Seoul Western District Court issued the fine in a summary judgment made last week after his case was referred to the prosecution, a court official said on Monday.</p>

<p>In August, the songwriter and rapper made an apology for the incident calling it "careless and wrong behaviour" with police also revoking his licence for riding the e-scooter while drunk.</p>

<p>Suga rode the scooter and tripped when parking at night, according to his label Big Hit Music, which is part of K-pop firm HYBE. The label also said he failed a breath test to measure his blood alcohol level conducted by police.</p>

<p>Since announcing a break from group projects in June 2022, BTS members pursued solo activities before starting military service.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old Suga has been engaged in social service work in order to meet his military duty commitment.</p>

<p>The drunk driving incident is the latest example of K-pop performers sometimes falling short of their squeaky-clean image.</p>

<p>The case prompted some BTS fans upset by his action to send flower wreaths near HYBE headquarters, with messages on boards asking him to leave the band.</p>

<p>Those notified of summary judgments can apply for a regular trial within seven days to challenge the decision.</p>

<p>Suga's label did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Metropolitan Police officer has been sacked after a misconduct panel concluded he assaulted a 12-year-old girl by "spanking her bare bottom on multiple occasions." The panel found that Ross Benson had been accused of hitting the child between April and August 2018, according to the Met Police.</p>

<p>The child was known to Benson, and the incidents, which occurred while he was off duty, were found to have a sexual element, the force added.</p>

<p>Following the disciplinary hearing, Benson was dismissed without notice and placed on the College of Policing's barred list, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6qgw97w92o" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benson had served in the North West Basic Command Unit in London.</p>

<p>In November 2020, Bedfordshire Police arrested Benson on suspicion of sexual assault, but by September 2021, he was informed that no further action would be taken. Bedfordshire Police then referred the case to the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, which launched a misconduct investigation. The investigation concluded on Friday, finding that Benson had committed gross misconduct by breaching the professional standards expected of police officers.</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Will Lexton-Jones told the media outlet: "My thoughts are with the victim, who showed great courage in coming forward. PC Benson's appalling behaviour has resulted in his immediate dismissal, a decision I fully support. I hope this outcome sends a clear message that we are committed to removing those who fail to uphold the high standards expected of our officers."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As jubilant Austrian far-right supporters celebrated their party's historic win in Sunday's national elections with beers, they knew forming a government would not be easy.</p>

<p>"It's a real success... (but) I predict that no matter who forms the government, we will certainly not have one before Christmas," Erik Berglund, a 35-year-old waiter, told AFP.</p>

<p>Led by sharp-tongued Herbert Kickl since 2021, the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) had been tipped to narrowly beat the ruling conservatives but Sunday's results -- with the party getting around 29 per cent -- were even slightly better than expected.</p>

<p>Like other party supporters around him in traditional Austrian dress, Berglund credited Kickl as the "most competent leader".</p>

<p>But he said it would now be up to the other parties to decide if the FPOe head can become chancellor.</p>

<p>"It will certainly be a very, very exciting time," he added as electric blue light -- the FPOe colour -- illuminated the restaurant in downtown Vienna where the party was celebrating.</p>

<h3><strong>'Mountain climber'</strong></h3>

<p>Chancellor Karl Nehammer, whose conservatives came second in the elections, has already said he would not form a coalition government with Kickl. Other party leaders have also rejected him.</p>

<p>"I am a mountain climber, but the bag that I have been given is not light," the sporty Kickl told his cheering supporters.</p>

<p>As supporters watched the vote night unfold on private television rather than public broadcaster ORF, which the FPOe has accused of being biased, they booed whenever other parties' representatives appeared onscreen.</p>

<p>Hilmar Kabas, an FPOe member since the 1960s, said other parties' "weakness" was the main reason that propelled the far right to victory.</p>

<p>But supporters wearing "Team Kickl" parkas also rattle off other reasons, such as asylum seeker applications deemed too many, a slumping economy and the high cost of living that has seen far-right parties across Europe gain ground.</p>

<p>But if no one is willing to form a coalition under Kickl, it's better to stay in the opposition, Kabas said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is not the other parties that decide for us," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>'Beacon in our night'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A loden-clothed activist from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was also among the crowd, having come specially from Bavaria state in neighbouring Germany to celebrate with his "friends".</p>

<p>"Germany is looking toward Vienna tonight," he said, declining to give his name.</p>

<p>With him, he brought a gift for Kickl: a small blue lighthouse engraved with his name because "he is a beacon in our night".</p>

<p>Outgoing lawmaker Petra Steger said President Alexander Van der Bellen must now give the mandate to Kickl to form a government "respecting the voters".</p>

<p>"That's how it works in a democracy," she said.</p>

<p>Having expressed reservations about Kickl a few months ago, Van der Bellen promised after the results were announced he would make sure a government is formed that respects the "foundations of our liberal democracy".</p>

<p>Not far from the FPOe celebration, in front of parliament, a few hundred people gathered to say "no to Kickl", leader of a party formed by former Nazis.</p>

<p>"Nazis out", they chanted.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it was to be expected that the FPOe would be in the lead, but it is quite sad (to have this result), because somehow we have learned nothing from history," Juliana Hofmann, a 19-year-old student, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A small town in Florida has been devastated by Hurricane Helene, leaving homes and businesses destroyed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tiny town of Steinhatchee on Florida's Gulf Coast has been left in ruins after Hurricane Helene unleashed winds of up to 140 mph (around 225 km) and a 10-foot storm surge earlier this week. Most of the town's 500 residents were evacuated before the storm, only to return to a scene of devastation.</p>

<p>“It's heartbreaking. We've been wiped off the map. There's nothing left. I have some insurance but now I have to rebuild,” Donna Landon told The New York Post. Ms Landon's mobile home on the outskirts of Steinhatchee was destroyed.</p>

<p>Few structures remain in the town, about 90 miles (around 145 km) southeast of Tallahassee, the state capital. Buildings that survived were badly damaged, making recovery an uphill battle for the close-knit community. “I don't think there's anyone who hasn't been touched by this. But this is a community where everyone looks out for each other,” Ms Landon added.<br />
<br />
On Friday, electrical crews from neighbouring states arrived in Steinhatchee, working to repair the town's power grid. However, the restoration of electricity is expected to take considerable time. “It's going to take weeks to fix it. We're going to have to start from scratch,” said Russ Rhodes, part of a team working to replace a downed power line.<br />
<br />
One of the town's most loved establishments, Roy's Restaurant, located along the Steinhatchee River, was obliterated by the hurricane. The restaurant reopened nine months ago after suffering extensive damage from Hurricane Idalia. “Our employees are safe. The restaurant didn't fare as well. But that's all right. We're thinking of our community, our employees, and everyone who is affected out there. We love them,” the manager shared in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/roys.steinhatchee/videos/1043112834274720/">Facebook Live message</a>.<br />
<br />
Despite the overwhelming loss, Roy's owner, Linda Wicker, has vowed to rebuild the 55-year-old restaurant. “I think we need to do that,” Wicker told the Palm Beach Post. While insurance will cover some of the damage, Wicker noted, “It's never enough,” as she reflected on the future of her business and its 30 employees.<br />
<br />
Steinhatchee is just one of many coastal communities in Florida dealing with the severe impact of Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that has claimed at least 45 lives as of September 28.<br />
<br />
In the nearby town of Perry, around 7,000 residents are assessing the destruction, reported The New York Post. Roads are blocked by fallen trees, electrical poles have snapped in half, and many buildings have lost their roofs. The town is currently without electricity or running water, further complicating recovery efforts.<br />
<br />
“I've been in Florida all my life. My entire life, and it's never been this bad. But I'm still alive and everyone I love is still alive, so I'm grateful to God for sparing us,” The New York Post quoted 80-year-old Perry resident Nancy Belleville as saying.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Sunday used a speech in key swing state Pennsylvania to urge a "violent" police crackdown on crime in the United States, while his White House rival Kamala Harris emphasized the need for immigration reform at a rally in Nevada.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is considered the most important of the seven toss-up states that will likely decide the November 5 presidential election, but Nevada is also one of the key battlegrounds.</p>

<p>The Republican former president and current candidate, who held a similar rally in swing state Wisconsin on Saturday, reprised his dark, racially charged message about an America crumbling under "invasion" by violent migrants and other criminals.</p>

<p>Recounting isolated -- but widely publicized -- incidents of thieves staging brazen daylight robberies of shops in major cities, Trump got a loud cheer when he said police should become "extraordinarily rough."</p>

<p>Criminals, he said, "have to be taught" and this could be done "if you had one really violent day."</p>

<p>"One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word would get out and it would end immediately," Trump said.</p>

<p>"The police aren't allowed to do their job" because "the liberal left won't let them."</p>

<p>Harris, the vice president and Democratic candidate, addressed the "serious problems" of border security at a rally in Las Vegas later in the day, where she reeled off her usual stump speech, emphasizing the economy, health care and the need for immigration reform.</p>

<p>"As president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after the transnational cartels," Harris said.</p>

<p>"We know Donald Trump won't solve them. When he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system," she added, calling for comprehensive reform but without offering details.</p>

<p>As on Saturday in Wisconsin, Trump spent much of his speech painting a picture of a failing United States, inundated by what he said was the "massive number of savage criminal aliens that Kamala Harris has allowed to invade."</p>

<p>He claimed "terrorists are pouring into our country" and cited "a big prison in the Congo, in Africa," as the source of "a lot of people" last week.</p>

<h3><strong>Insults</strong></h3>

<p>Anti-immigrant sentiment has been at the core of Trump's appeal in economically depressed, majority-white parts of the country ever since his 2016 presidential victory, but the rhetoric is turning ever more extreme as election day nears.</p>

<p>Following record numbers of illegal border crossings earlier in President Joe Biden's administration, a tightening of rules -- to the consternation of immigrant rights and civil liberties groups -- led to a plunge in numbers this year.</p>

<p>Crime, including murder, is also in steep decline nationwide, the FBI says.</p>

<p>Trump has long prided himself on his ability to coin insulting nicknames or slurs for his opponents and on Sunday, he repeated one that he aired on Saturday, calling Harris -- a former top California prosecutor and US senator -- "mentally impaired."</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Sad. But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way," Trump said to loud laughter from the crowd.</p>

<p>Harris did not address Trump's comments during her rally in Vegas, instead focusing on her usual bread-and-butter issues -- protecting access to abortion services and putting more money in the pockets of everyday Americans.</p>

<p>"When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law," she told supporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based Shia militant group has lost its chief in Israeli air strikes in the capital Beirut. The Israel Defence Forces have moved the conflict north and have vowed to uproot Hezbollah's political and military arsenal. In the last few weeks intense cross-border shelling and rocket attacks have been witnessed with no sign of a descalation.</p>

<p>Since the pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon which killed over 30 and injured thousands, the war between Hezbollah and Israel has intensified, with the former calling it a "massacre". Since Israel invaded Gaza last year to destroy Hamas, Hezbollah has been targeting northern Israel which led to a mass displacement of over 70,000 people due to frequent rocket attacks.</p>

<h3><strong>'Settling Scores'</strong></h3>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they have "settled the score" after killing Hezbollah General Secretary Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike. This came after a week-long aerial bombing campaign carried out by IDF across Lebanon. The heat signature detected by NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument explains the extent of attacks.</p>

<p>Pink indicates the urban settlement and the red dots show the region's active fire data for the last seven days. This is more likely a result of Israeli air strikes and artillery bombing. The data processed by VIIRS shows how Israeli raids were focused more on southern Lebanon, where it believed most of the Hezbollah cadre was stationed.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">NASA's Active Fire Data for the last three days</p>
</div>

<p>The bombing campaign over the weekend also included the capital Beirut, where Hassan Nasrallah was killed along with Ali Karaki, the southern front commander of Lebanon and 19 other Hezbollah members. On its east bordering Syria, the campaign was primarily aimed at blocking the supply of weapons from Syria - A state which has an ongoing conflict with Israel and is backed by Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The border between Syria and Lebanon acts as the supply line for weapons and reportedly some manufacturing units are located in southern Lebanon, as claimed by IDF in a post on X after it carried out strikes east of Beqqa valley, south and north Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When NASA's active fire data can be backed by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-29-2024" rel="no follow, no index">Institute for the Study of War</a> (ISW) analysis which geolocates the Israeli bombing campaign, suggesting that the heat signatures detected by VIIRS were indeed from the bombing campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We settled the score with the one responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of French," Netanyahu said after it was confirmed that Nasrallah was dead. Meanwhile, Israeli military spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said "the world would be a safer place with him (Hasrallah)."&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the IDF, it has eliminated most of the Hezbollah top cadre.</p>

Most of the deaths came last Monday, the deadliest day in Lebanon's history since the 1975-90 civil war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel says that it warned the civilian population to evacuate the region before the bombing but almost every attack was directed toward urban settlements. IDF claims that Hezbollah is hiding weapons in populated areas, which act as a shield against attacks.</p>

<p>"For the last 20 years, Hezbollah built its terror network within population centres in Lebanon - primarily throughout southern Lebanon, an area that they turned almost entirely into a launch pad to attack Israel."</p>

<h3><strong>Iran Is Furious</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah is part of Iran's "Axis of Resistance" - a group of nations, and proxies - that came into existence after the Iranian revolution in 1979. This includes Syria, Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hamas, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, Hezbollah and other Palestinian groups.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dni.gov/nctc/groups/hizballah.html">Hezbollah has participated in the Lebanese Government </a>since 1992. In 2005, a UN Security Council resolution called for disarming militias in Lebanon, but Hezbollah has actively tried to justify the retention of arms by calling itself the defender against Israeli aggression. Since the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, where the latter kidnapped two Israeli soldiers, it has sought to use the conflict to justify its move.</p>

<p>After the death of Nasrallah, Iran has lost an ally in the region that could wage war against Israel. The Hezbollah cadre remains but precision strikes came as a blow, especially after several reports suggest an Iranian spy colluded with Israel and gave coordinates for strikes against Nasrallah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran also vowed to avenge the killing of Revolutionary Guards General Abbas Nilforoushan, who died alongside the Hezbollah leader.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's death came around two months after Palestinian group Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in late July in Tehran where he had attended President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration.</p>

<p>Israel is fighting on two fronts - Gaza and Lebanon - while it has largely succeeded in destabilizing Hamas's chain of command, the cost of the war was borne by over 40,000 people who have died in a campaign that is in its eleventh month. A similar situation is unfolding in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Houthi rebels fired a rocket to express solidarity over Nasrallah's death. Late at night, Israel carried out air strikes in Yemen, killing four and injuring 33.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran - reeling from the economic impact of international sanctions - has managed to keep afloat its operations through proxies outside its territory but is treading with caution to avoid any major US response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tehran-based international relations professor <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/irans-serious-dilemma-after-hezbollah-chief-hassan-nasrallahs-killing-6678151">Mehdi Zakerian</a> said the Iran-aligned resistance front "was not only unable to contain Israel, it also suffered serious blows". "If the government wants to get involved in reconstructing Lebanon or re-equipping Hezbollah, it will aggravate Iran's economic crisis," he added.</p>

<p>Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group says, &nbsp;Iran "has every interest in trying to preserve whatever remains of Hezbollah. Hezbollah is Iran's shield. I don't think Iranians would give up on almost 40 years of investment in this project overnight because a dozen people were eliminated."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and Lebanon's Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, whose leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli air strike on a Beirut suburb, have been sworn enemies for decades.</p>

<p>Here is a history of their long conflict:</p>

<p><strong>1982: Israel invades Lebanon; the birth of Hezbollah</strong><br />
Hezbollah -- the "Party of God" -- was born in the wake of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon in the country's eastern Bekaa area, and overseen by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps.</p>

<p>In 1985 Hezbollah emerged from the shadows, establishing its armed wing the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon as the spearhead in the fight against Israel.</p>

<p>It carries out suicide car bombings and human wave attacks in the south against Israeli forces and their ally the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a mostly Christian militia.</p>

<p><strong>1992: Nasrallah becomes the group's leader</strong><br />
In February 1992 an Israeli helicopter gunship attack kills Hezbollah secretary-general Sheikh Abbas al-Musawi.</p>

<p>Aged just 32, Hassan Nasrallah is elected his successor. His baptism of fire comes a year later when Hezbollah, the only group that refused to give up its weapons after Lebanon's 15-year civil war ended in 1990, battles a large-scale Israeli incursion dubbed "Operation Accountability".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stature of the man considered at his death to be the most powerful in Lebanon begins to build.</p>

<p>It is enhanced even further in 1996.</p>

<p><strong>1996: 'Operation Grapes of Wrath'</strong><br />
On April 11, 1996, Israel launched "Operation Grapes of Wrath", raids aimed at breaking Hezbollah's military potential and halting the firing of rockets into northern Israel.</p>

<p>Over 17 days, Israeli forces launched 600 raids and fired 23,000 shells, killing 175 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians. More than 300,000 refugees flee their homes.</p>

<p>International calls for a ceasefire mount after artillery bombards a United Nations camp where fleeing civilians had sought shelter. More than 100 people are killed.</p>

<p>On April 26 an agreement is signed ending the Israeli operation.</p>

<p><strong>2000: Israel withdraws from Lebanon&nbsp;</strong><br />
Israel's army withdrew in May 2000 after its years-long occupation. The pull-out from its so-called "security" zone is intended to end a situation that had cost it 1,000 men.</p>

<p>Nasrallah will be seen as the architect of this climbdown, after a war of attrition by Hezbollah forces a change of heart among the Israeli population.</p>

<p>This pressure also led to the Israeli government accepting in 1998 a UN Security Council resolution demanding its immediate withdrawal from south Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>2006: Israel-Hezbollah war</strong><br />
In 2006 Hezbollah seized two Israeli soldiers on the Israel-Lebanon border. Hezbollah says it wants to exchange the pair for prisoners held inside Israel, but the outcome is war.</p>

<p>The conflict lasts through July and August and causes 1,200 deaths in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 in Israel, mostly military.</p>

<p>Israel is unable to vanquish Hezbollah, which paints the conflict as a victory.</p>

<p><strong>2023-2024: a new front opens up&nbsp;</strong><br />
When war began between Israel and Hamas after Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip attacked southern Israel on October 7, Iran-backed Hezbollah forces in south Lebanon fired into Israel in support of Hamas.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire, Israel on September 23 severely escalated deadly air strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel says it is acting to end attacks on it from south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel's military says it has killed most of Hezbollah's senior leadership. The Hezbollah chief is killed in an air strike on the group's southern Beirut bastion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Bronze Age coffin was found during the excavation of the Xiaohe Cemetery in 2003.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the 3,600-year-old coffin of a young woman was unearthed in northwestern China two decades ago, archaeologists uncovered a puzzling substance draped around her neck like jewellery. Remarkably, it turned out to be cheese; researchers now believe it's the oldest known cheese ever discovered, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/mysterious-white-substance-smeared-on-3600-year-old-mummies-is-worlds-oldest-cheese" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Live Science </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While regular cheese is soft, this one has dried out, becoming dense, hard, and powdery," said Fu Qiaomei, a paleogeneticist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and co-author of a study published Tuesday in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00899-7" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Cell</em></a>. In an interview with <em>NBC News</em>, Fu explained that DNA analysis of the cheese sheds light on the lives of the Xiaohe people- who lived in what is now Xinjiang- but also on the mammals they raised and the evolution of animal husbandry in East Asia.</p>

<p>The Bronze Age coffin was found during the excavation of the Xiaohe Cemetery in 2003. Thanks to the arid climate of the Tarim Basin desert, the woman's coffin was exceptionally well-preserved, as were her boots, hat, and the cheese that had adorned her body, Fu noted.</p>

<p>In ancient burial practices, significant items were often placed alongside the deceased. The discovery of kefir cheese near the woman suggests that cheese played a crucial role in their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheese production has been recorded in history for millennia, with murals in ancient Egyptian tombs dating back to 2000 BC, and European cheese-making evidence going back 7,000 years. However, the Tarim Basin cheese samples are the oldest physical examples found to date.</p>

<p>Fu and her team collected samples from three tombs and analyzed the DNA, tracing the evolution of bacteria involved in cheese-making over thousands of years. The cheese was identified as kefir cheese, made from fermenting milk with kefir grains. Evidence of both goat and cow milk was found in the samples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study also highlights how the Xiaohe people, despite being genetically lactose intolerant, consumed dairy before the advent of pasteurization and refrigeration. Cheese production, which reduces lactose levels, allowed them to include dairy in their diet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot arrived in Lebanon Sunday night, his ministry said, making him the first high-level foreign diplomat to visit since Israeli air strikes intensified one week ago.</p>

<p>The arrival of Barrot, who earlier called for an immediate halt to the strikes, came as the foreign ministry announced that a second French national had been killed in Lebanon, though details were unclear.</p>

<p>Barrot oversaw the delivery of 11.5 tonnes of French humanitarian aid, Lebanon's Health Minister Firass Abiad said.</p>

<p>After a meeting about the status of French nationals, Barrot on Monday will meet officials including Prime Minister Najib Mikati.</p>

<p>He is also due to meet the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon and members of the UN peacekeeping force in the south.</p>

<p>"We confirm the death of a second French national," his ministry said Sunday, adding that further details will be supplied later.</p>

<p>The death comes after an 87-year-old French woman died last Monday after a blast in a village in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel's military on Sunday said it struck more targets of Lebanon's Iran-backed group Hezbollah after its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a Beirut air raid on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The violence has raised strong fears of even further escalation in the Middle East.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has also appointed a former foreign and defence minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, as special envoy to Lebanon.</p>

<p>Le Drian has visited the country six times, most recently at the beginning of the week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former minister and rival of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the government on Sunday, strengthening the current coalition as Israel fights militant groups on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>Gideon Saar, who has held several ministerial posts in past governments, joined the cabinet again as a minister without portfolio.</p>

<p>"I appreciate the fact that Gideon Saar has answered my request and agreed today to return to the government," Netanyahu said in a televised statement.</p>

<p>"This move contributes to unity within us and unity against our enemies."</p>

<p>Saar's return gives Netanyahu an additional four seats in Israel's parliament, bringing his total to 68 out of 120.</p>

<p>This makes Netanyahu less vulnerable to a defection from far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has repeatedly threatened to bring down the government if it agrees to a truce deal with Hamas in the Gaza Strip or Hezbollah in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Saar, considered more right-wing than Netanyahu, has hawkish tendencies and has spoken out in favour of the annexation of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Just five years ago Saar openly challenged Netanyahu for leadership of Israel's right-wing Likud party.</p>

<p>Although he took part in the emergency government formed in the wake of Hamas's October 7 attack that triggered the war in Gaza, he joined the opposition in March after failing to get a seat in the war cabinet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SpaceX crew that will ferry back two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station docked with the orbiting laboratory Sunday, a live stream of the mission showed.</p>

<p>The Falcon 9 rocket took off at 1:17 pm (1717 GMT) from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday, with the Crew-9 mission on a Dragon spacecraft making contact with the ISS at 5:30 pm Sunday.</p>

<p>After docking was completed, NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov boarded the station just after 7:00 pm, embracing their floating colleagues on the space station.</p>

<p>"What a fabulous day it was today," NASA deputy administrator Pam Melroy said at a news conference.</p>

<p>When Hague and Gorbunov return from the space station in February, they will bring back two space veterans -- Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams -- whose stay on the ISS was prolonged for months due to problems with their Boeing-designed Starliner spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The newly developed Starliner was making its first crewed flight when it delivered Wilmore and Williams to the ISS in June.</p>

<p>They were supposed to be there for only an eight-day stay, but after problems with the Starliner's propulsion system emerged during the flight there, NASA was forced to weigh a radical change in plans.</p>

<p>After weeks of intensive tests on the Starliner's reliability, the space agency finally decided to return it to Earth without its crew, and to bring the two stranded astronauts back home on SpaceX's Crew-9 mission.</p>

<p>SpaceX, the private company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, has been flying regular missions every six months to allow the rotation of ISS crews.</p>

<p>But the launch of Crew-9 was postponed from mid-August to late September to give NASA experts more time to evaluate the reliability of the Starliner and decide how to proceed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It was then delayed a few more days by the destructive passage of Hurricane Helene, a powerful storm that roared into the opposite side of Florida on Thursday.</p>

<p>In total, Hague and Gorbunov will spend some five months on the ISS; and Wilmore and Williams, eight months.</p>

<p>In all, Crew-9 will conduct some 200 scientific experiments.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from powerful storm Helene jumped to at least 91 on Sunday, with one county in North Carolina alone reporting 30 deaths, authorities said, as rescuers battled to reach people in need across the southeastern United States.</p>

<p>The storm left a swathe of damage across several states, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, with high winds and torrential rain leaving some towns in ruins, roads flooded out and power cut off to millions.</p>

<p>"We're hearing (of) significant infrastructure damage to water systems, communication, roads, critical transportation routes, as well as several homes that have been just destroyed by this," the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, said Sunday.</p>

<p>"So this is going to be a really complicated recovery in each of these five states that have had these impacts," she said on CBS's "Face the Nation."</p>

<p>At least 91 people were killed in the extreme weather -- 37 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 17 in Georgia, 11 in Florida and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.</p>

<p>"We have another devastating update. We now have 30 confirmed losses due to the storm," Quentin Miller, the sheriff in North Carolina's Buncombe County, which includes the tourist city of Asheville, told a briefing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're still conducting search operations and we know that those also may include recovery operations."</p>

<p>Flash flood warnings remained in effect in parts of western North Carolina on Sunday, National Weather Service director Ken Graham said, adding that they were due to the risk of dam failures.</p>

<p>The weather was expected to ease in the affected areas by around Tuesday, he said.</p>

<p>Nearly 2.5 million households remained without power on Sunday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US Department of Energy official Matt Targuagno said that crews were working hard to restore electricity but warned it would be "a complex, multi-day response."</p>

<p>Thousands of people continued to seek assistance in shelters run by the American Red Cross, organization official Jennifer Pipa said.</p>

<h3><strong>Bridges washed away&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Helene blew into Florida's northern Gulf shore as a huge Category Four hurricane with winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even as it weakened, it wreaked havoc.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said Sunday that one of his senior advisors was in Florida monitoring the situation.</p>

<p>North Carolina saw some of the worst of the flooding, with Governor Roy Cooper saying rescuers were being forced to airlift supplies in some areas due to damaged or flooded roads.</p>

<p>"I don't know that anybody could be fully prepared for the amount of flooding and landslides that they are experiencing right now," Criswell said on CBS, adding that more search and rescue teams were being deployed.</p>

<p>William Ray, director of the state's emergency management department, warned that conditions were still extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Hundreds of roads across the region remained closed, with several bridges washed away by floodwaters.</p>

<p>Four major interstate highways were closed across North Carolina and Tennessee, with "multiple" bridges still out, said Kristin White of the US Department of Transportation.</p>

<p>Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina each had more than 100 road closures, she added.</p>

<p>In the Georgia city of Valdosta, the storm ripped the roofs off buildings and left road intersections a tangle of felled utility poles and trees.</p>

<p>"The wind started really hitting, like, felt branches and pieces of the roof hitting the side of the building and hitting the windows," said Valdosta resident Steven Mauro.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"And then we were looking out and then literally this whole street, just everything went black."</p>

<p>Republican former president and current candidate Donald Trump will visit Valdosta on Monday for a briefing on the disaster, his campaign said.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who has approved federal aid for several states in the wake of the disaster, intends to travel to hard-hit areas this week, "as soon as it will not disrupt emergency response operations," the White House said Sunday.</p>

<p>He directed Criswell, the FEMA administrator, to "determine what more can be done to accelerate support to those who are having the most difficult time accessing assistance in isolated communities," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lebanon claimed fresh Israeli strikes killed 105 people and injured 359 others on Sunday after Israel said it had kept up its bombardment of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/irans-serious-dilemma-after-hezbollah-chief-hassan-nasrallahs-killing-6678151" target="_blank">Hezbollah targets</a>.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lebanon's health ministry said there had been deadly air raids near the main southern city of Sidon, while dozens more had died in the east, in the south, and in and around Beirut.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Four people were also killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut on Monday, the first attack on the city itself since the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-iran-spy-told-israel-hezbollah-chiefs-location-before-airstrike-report-6675770" target="_blank">Iran-backed Hezbollah</a> engaged in cross-border fire with Israel after Hamas attacked Israeli towns on October 7 last year, triggering war in Gaza.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">France on Sunday said a second French national had been killed in Lebanon after a woman died following a south Lebanon blast on Monday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The announcement came as French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot arrived in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lebanon-urges-citizens-to-unite-after-israels-killing-of-hassan-nasrallah-6676861" target="_blank">Lebanon</a>, the first high-level foreign diplomat to visit since the Israeli attacks intensified.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lebanon has said more than 1,000 people have been killed and 6,000 injured since Israel increased the frequency of attacks against Hezbollah members two weeks ago.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to Reuters, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/body-of-hezbollah-chief-recovered-from-site-of-israeli-air-attack-in-lebanon-report-6676891" target="_blank">body of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah</a> has been recovered from the site of an Israeli air attack on Beirut and is "intact".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">His body had no "direct" wounds and it appeared the cause of death was "blunt trauma from the force of the blast", Reuters reported.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel's military said the air strike that killed Nasrallah had "eliminated" another <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/top-hezbollah-official-killed-in-air-strike-on-lebanon-says-israeli-army-6676767" target="_blank">20 Hezbollah members</a> after earlier strikes killed top leaders Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the assault on Lebanon, saying he wants to make Israel's northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee due to Hezbollah attacks.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Sunday it was striking several Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, including power stations and a seaport, using dozens of aircraft.</p>

<p>The strikes came a day after the Iran-backed rebel group said it targeted Israel's Ben Gurion Airport with a missile.</p>

<p>"In a large-scale air operation today, dozens of Air Force aircraft, including fighter jets, refuelling planes, and reconnaissance aircraft, attacked military-use targets of the Houthi terrorist regime in the Ras Issa and Hodeida areas of Yemen," military spokesman Captain David Avraham said in a statement to AFP.</p>

<p>"The IDF (military) targeted power stations and a seaport used for oil imports," a military statement said.</p>

<p>In July Israel also hit Hodeida port, causing what a port official said was at least $20 million in damage, after a Houthi drone strike penetrated Israel's air defences and killed a civilian in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The sites targeted Sunday were used by the Houthis, who seized the Yemeni capital Sanaa in 2014, to "transfer Iranian weaponry to the region and supplies for military needs", the statement said.</p>

<p>"The strike was carried out in response to recent attacks by the Huthi regime against the state of Israel," it added, after the rebels said they tried to hit Ben Gurion as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived back from New York.</p>

<p>The Houthi-controlled Al-Masirah station reported Sunday that Israeli strikes targeted "the ports of Hodeidah and Ras Issa" as well as two power stations after previously announcing "Israeli aggression on Hodeida".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bomb that Israel used to kill Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last week was an American-made guided weapon, a US senator said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mark Kelly, chair of the Senate Armed Services Airland Subcommittee, said Israel used a 2,000-lb (900-kg) Mark 84 series bomb, during an interview with NBC. His statement marks the first US indication of what weapon had been used.</p>

<p>"We see more use of guided munitions, JDAMs, and we continue to provide those weapons," Kelly said, using an abbreviation that stands for Joint Direct Attack Munitions. "That 2,000-pound bomb that was used, that's a Mark 84 series bomb, to take out Nasrallah," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said on Saturday it had eliminated Nasrallah in a strike on the group's central command headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs. The Israeli military has declined to comment on what weapons were used in the attack. The Pentagon was not immediately available for comment.</p>

<p>JDAMs convert a standard unguided bomb using fins and a GPS guidance system into a guided weapon. The US is Israel's longtime ally and biggest arms supplier.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has given Iran a serious dilemma -- how to cope with the loss of a crucial ally and still maintain its regional influence.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah group, which has long been armed and financed by Iran, on Saturday confirmed Nasrallah's death after Israel said it had "eliminated" him in an air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>His death was a sharp escalation in nearly a year of tit-for-tat cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel since the Gaza conflict began, and risks plunging the entire region into a wider war.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed Nasrallah's death "will not be in vain", and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref said it would bring about Israel's "destruction".</p>

<p>Iran also vowed to avenge the killing of Revolutionary Guards General Abbas Nilforoushan, who died alongside the Hezbollah leader.</p>

<p>"Nasrallah has been crucial to Iran's power expansion," said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment, noting that Hezbollah remains "the crown jewel" of the Islamic republic's regional allies.</p>

<p>His killing "has not altered the fact that Iran still does not want to get directly engaged" in the ongoing conflict, said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis group.</p>

<p>But it left Iran with "a serious dilemma", said Vaez, especially that the group's deterrence regarding Israel was now "in complete disarray".</p>

<p>Economic crisis</p>

<p>For Tehran-based international relations professor Mehdi Zakerian, developments have shown that the Iran-aligned resistance front "was not only unable to contain Israel, it also suffered serious blows".</p>

<p>Nasrallah's death came around two months after Palestinian group Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in late July in Tehran where he had attended President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration.</p>

<p>Iran blamed Israel for his death and vowed to retaliate.</p>

<p>Zakerian says rebuilding Hezbollah will be no small feat for Tehran amid its mounting economic challenges.</p>

<p>"If the government wants to get involved in reconstructing Lebanon or re-equipping Hezbollah, it will aggravate Iran's economic crisis," he said.</p>

<p>Iran has been reeling from the economic impact of international sanctions, which have contributed to soaring inflation, high unemployment and a record low rate for the Iranian rial against the US dollar.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian's government has boosted efforts to help ease the crippling sanctions and revive a 2015 landmark nuclear deal which collapsed when the United States unilaterally withdrew from the accord three years later.</p>

<p>Analysts have said Iran has been treading carefully since the outbreak of the Gaza conflict, trying to project power without provoking a US response.</p>

<p>Even during its first-ever direct attack on Israel in April -- retaliation for an air strike on Tehran's embassy annex in Damascus -- most projectiles were intercepted by Israeli defences or allied forces.</p>

<p>Iran said at the time it had informed the United States and given neighbouring nations a 72-hour warning before what it called its "limited" attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Still, Vaez said Iran "has every interest in trying to preserve whatever remains of Hezbollah. Hezbollah is Iran's shield."</p>

<p>"I don't think Iranians would give up on almost 40 years of investment in this project overnight because a dozen people were eliminated," he added.</p>

<p>'Weak and meagre'</p>

<p>And "Iran cannot abandon Hezbollah, because in that case it would also lose its other allies", said Zakerian.</p>

<p>Iran-backed militant groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen have all become involved in rising regional tensions since the Israel's war against Hamas erupted.</p>

<p>Another strong dilemma Iran may face is communicating with Hezbollah and the transfer of weapons, analysts say.</p>

<p>On Friday, Israel's military vowed to prevent Iran from supplying Hezbollah with weapons via Beirut airport, saying its fighters were patrolling the skies above.</p>

<p>"It is too late now for Iran to support Hezbollah with weapons," said political commentator Mossadegh Mossadeghpour.</p>

<p>But he said he believes the group "will repair itself as it has done in the past".</p>

<p>Hezbollah's internal communications were also dealt a heavy blow when sabotage attacks this month targeted members' pagers and walkie-talkies.</p>

<p>Vaez believes it would be "very difficult" for the Iranians to communicate now with their allies, unlike during the 33-day war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>He said Hezbollah's "weak and meagre" responses have been noted as the violence with Israel has escalated.</p>

<p>"The question is whether they are unwilling or unable to take action," he said.</p>

<p>Vaez maintains that Iran appears to be hoping that Hezbollah will "get its act together ... and mount a significant attack on Israel to demonstrate it's still standing."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

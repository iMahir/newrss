       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel carried out deadly air strikes in the Gaza Strip on Sunday as the war entered its 10th month, with fighting raging across the Palestinian territory and fresh diplomatic efforts underway to halt the violence.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement fired another 20 rockets at northern Israel, leaving one person injured there, the latest cross-border attacks launched in solidarity with Gaza's Palestinian group Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Efforts towards a truce continued with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoping to halt the worst-ever Gaza war, which has caused mass civilian casualties and devastated the coastal territory since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Egypt's Al-Qahera News reported that Cairo was "hosting Israeli and American delegations to discuss the outstanding points" for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, citing an unnamed high-level official source.</p>

<p>Mediators were in contact with Hamas amid "intensive Egyptian meetings this week with all parties to push efforts" for a truce, said the news report late Saturday, without giving further details or dates.</p>

<p>Israel has also said it would send a delegation in the coming days to continue talks with Qatari mediators, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said Friday that "gaps" remained with Hamas.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden announced a plan in late May that included an initial six-week truce and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Talks subsequently stalled, but a US official said Thursday that a new proposal from Hamas "moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal".</p>

<p>Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told AFP that the group's new ideas had been "conveyed by the mediators to the American side, which welcomed them and passed them on to the Israeli side", adding that "now the ball is in the Israeli court".</p>

<h3><strong>Heavy clashes</strong></h3>

<p>The fighting and bombardment in besieged Gaza raged on unabated on Sunday, with medics and emergency services in the Hamas-run territory reporting yet more deaths in several strikes.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said the bodies of six people including two children were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah.</p>

<p>And paramedics said six people were killed in one strike on a house in Gaza City and three in another elsewhere in Gaza's largest urban area.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent said Israeli drones were firing in Gaza City's Shujaiya district, which has been largely evacuated and rocked by intense battles for two weeks.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said that in Shujaiya, its "troops eliminated several terrorists, dismantled terror infrastructure sites and located numerous weapons, including explosive devices, AK-47 rifles, machine guns and pistols".</p>

<p>It also said 30 "terrorists" had been killed in far-southern Rafah over the past day and that Israeli forces had carried out an operation in nearby Khan Yunis where Hamas had taken up position in a municipality building.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Gaza health ministry said 16 people were killed in a strike on a school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA that was sheltering displaced people in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school.</p>

<h3><strong>'Catastrophic hunger'</strong></h3>

<p>The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,098 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>The war has uprooted 90 percent of Gaza's population, left almost 500,000 people enduring "catastrophic" hunger and shuttered most hospitals, UN agencies say.</p>

<p>"The situation is very difficult," said Dr Muhammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is no fuel in the hospital to work. We only operate the small generator for two hours a day and we have postponed many scheduled operations due to the lack of fuel."</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah rockets</strong></h3>

<p>Amid the Gaza war, Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have exchanged almost daily cross-border fire and the attacks and rhetoric have escalated over the past month, sparking fears of a full-scale war.</p>

<p>While the exchanges have been largely restricted to the border areas, Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside eastern Lebanon, including on Saturday in a strike that killed a Hezbollah operative.</p>

<p>Early on Sunday, air raid sirens again sounded across northern Israel and the army then reported that 20 rockets were fired, some of which were intercepted by air defence systems.</p>

<p>One person was wounded by shrapnel in Kfar Zeitim near Tiberias, around 30 kilometres (over 18 miles) inside Israel, local police said, adding they were in stable condition.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said that "in response to the attack and assassination that the Israeli enemy carried out", it had targeted "one of the main bases" in northern Israel, west of Tiberias, with "dozens of Katyusha rockets".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An overnight Ukrainian drone attack set a Russian munitions depot ablaze the Voronezh region, near the two countries' shared border, Russian and Ukrainian officials said Sunday.</p>

<p>"Several drones were detected and destroyed overnight by air defence systems above the Voronezh region," regional governor Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Their falling debris set off a fire in a depot" in the Podgorensky district, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Ukrainian borderm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Explosives began to detonate", Gusev said, adding that there were no indications anybody had been hurt.</p>

<p>Rescue teams were at the scene and Gusev said local people living near the depot were being evacuated.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian defence source told AFP that its drones hit the munitions factory in an overnight attack.</p>

<p>"The enemy stored surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, shells for tanks and artillery and boxes of ammunition" at the site, which was hit by drones resulting in a "powerful" explosion, the source said.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have used drones, including large explosive devices with a range of hundreds of kilometres (miles), extensively since Russia launched its military offensive in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian territory this year, targeting both energy sites it says supply the Russian army and towns and villages just across the border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair made an early intervention in British politics on Sunday after Keir Starmer's landslide election victory, urging him to have a "plan to control immigration".</p>

<p>Blair warned Starmer, who is beginning his second full day as prime minister with a visit to Scotland, that the anti-immigration Reform UK Party also posed a challenge to Labour, not just the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>The Reform UK party, led by Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage, maximised the damage to the Conservatives at the election by splitting the right-wing vote.</p>

<p>It won five seats in the Westminster parliament and 14 percent of the vote, prompting Farage to warn that it will target Labour voters next.</p>

<p>In a piece headlined "My advice to Keir Starmer", Blair wrote in the Sunday Times that "all over the western world, traditional political parties are suffering disruption".</p>

<p>"Where the system allows new entrants to emerge, they are running riot everywhere. Look at France or Italy.</p>

<p>"We need a plan to control immigration. If we don't have rules, we get prejudices," he added.</p>

<p>Blair, the only Labour leader to lead his party to three consecutive election victories starting with his own landslide win in 1997, couched his "advice" in an article about harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>He said he believed digital ID technology offered the best solution to controlling irregular immigration, a key issue on the doorstep during the election campaign.</p>

<p>"We should move as the world is moving to digital ID. If not, new border controls will have to be highly effective," he wrote.</p>

<p>Other suggestions included "a tough new approach to law and order" due to the fact that "at present criminal elements are modernising faster than law enforcement".</p>

<p>And he said the government should "avoid any vulnerability on 'wokeism'", warning against policies that many regard as overly politically correct.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[She worries Republican donors, has name recognition, and Democratic Party heavyweights are beginning to line up behind her.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She worries Republican donors, has name recognition, and Democratic Party heavyweights are beginning to line up behind her.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris would be President Joe Biden's natural successor if he bowed to growing pressure and stepped aside as the Democratic candidate in the 2024 election, top Democrats say.</p>

<p>Now party donors, activists and officials are asking: Does she have a better chance than Biden of beating Donald Trump? Biden is staying in the race, he has said repeatedly.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, a former U.S. senator and California attorney general, would be the first woman to become president of the United States if she were the party's nominee and prevailed in the Nov. 5 election. She is the first African American and Asian person to serve as vice president.</p>

<p>Her three-and-a-half-year White House tenure has been characterized by a lackluster start, staff turnover, and early policy portfolios including migration from Central America that did not produce major successes.</p>

<p>As recently as last year, many inside the White House and the Biden campaign team privately worried Harris was a liability for the campaign. The situation has changed significantly since then, Democratic officials have said, as she stepped forward on abortion rights and courted young voters.</p>

<h3><strong>Some Polls Favour Harris</strong></h3>

<p>Recent polls suggest Harris could do better than Biden against Trump, the Republican candidate, although she would face a tight contest.</p>

<p>A CNN poll released on July 2 found voters favor Trump over Biden by six percentage points, 49% to 43%. Harris also trailed Trump, 47% to 45%, within the margin of error.</p>

<p>It also found independents back Harris 43%-40% over Trump, and moderate voters of both parties prefer her 51-39%.</p>

<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll after last week's televised debate between Trump and a faltering Biden found Harris and Trump were nearly tied, with 42% supporting her and 43% backing him.</p>

<p>Only former first lady Michelle Obama, who has never expressed any interest in getting into the race, polled higher among possible alternatives to Biden.</p>

<p>Internal polling shared by the Biden campaign after the debate shows Harris with the same odds as Biden of beating Trump, with 45% of voters saying they would vote for her versus 48% for Trump.</p>

<p>Influential Democrats including U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, the man who was key to Biden's 2020 win; Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York congressman and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus and Summer Lee, a House Democrat from Pennsylvania have signaled Harris would be the best option to lead the ticket if Biden chooses to step aside.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has also privately signaled the same to lawmakers, a Congressional aide said.</p>

<p>Harris is taken so seriously, two Republican donors told Reuters they would prefer for Trump to face Biden than her.</p>

<p>"I would prefer Biden to stay in place" rather than be replaced by Harris, said Pauline Lee, a fundraiser for Trump in Nevada after the June 27 debate, who said she thought Biden had proved himself to be "incompetent."</p>

<p>And some on Wall Street, an important Democratic fundraising center, are starting to indicate a preference.</p>

<p>"Biden is already behind Trump, and is unlikely to be able to overcome that gap given where his campaign is currently. Having VP Harris likely improves Democrats' odds of taking the White House," said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group, a financial services company, after the debate. "There's potentially more upside for her chances than Biden's at this point."</p>

<p>A majority of Americans see Harris in a negative light, as they do both men running for president.</p>

<p>Polling outlet Five Thirty Eight said 37.1% of voters approve of Harris and 49.6% disapprove. Those numbers compare to 36.9% and 57.1% for Biden, and 38.6% and 53.6% for Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Women, Black Voters, Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>Since the Supreme Court repealed women's constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Harris has become the Biden administration's foremost voice on reproductive rights, an issue Democrats are betting on to help them win the 2024 election.</p>

<p>Some Democrats believe Harris could energize Democratic-leaning groups whose enthusiasm for Biden has faded, including Black voters, young voters and those who do not approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>"She would energize the Black, brown, and Asian Pacific members of our coalition...she would immediately pull the dispirited youth of our country back into the fold," said Tim Ryan, a former Democratic Congressman from Ohio, in a recent op-ed.</p>

<p>Democratic and Republican suburban women may also be more comfortable with her then Trump or Biden, he said.</p>

<p>As vice president, Harris's public Israel strategy is identical to Biden's, although she was the first senior leader of the U.S. government to call for a ceasefire in March.</p>

<p>"Simply swapping out the candidate does not address the central concern" of the movement, said Abbas Alawieh, a member of the national "Uncommitted" movement that withheld votes for Biden in the primary based on his support of Israel.</p>

<p>If Biden were to step aside, there could be a competition between other Democrats to become the nominee.</p>

<p>If the party were then to choose another candidate over Harris, some Democrats say it could lose the support of many Black voters who were critical to Biden's election win in 2020.</p>

<p>"There is no alternative besides Kamala Harris," said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of Black voter outreach group BlackPAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If the Democratic Party thinks that they have problems now with their base being confused... Jump over the Black woman, the vice president, and I don't think the Democratic Party actually recovers."</p>

<h3><strong>Too Lefty?</strong></h3>

<p>However, Harris may struggle to reel in moderate Democrats and the independent voters who like Biden's centrist policies, some Democratic donors said. Both parties seek independents to help pull them over the finishing line in presidential elections.</p>

<p>"Her greatest weakness is that her public brand has been associated with the far left wing of the Democratic Party ... and the left wing of the Democratic party cannot win a national election," said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a fundraiser and adviser to LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman. "That is the challenge that she will have to overcome if she is the nominee."</p>

<p>Harris would take over money raised by the Biden campaign and inherit campaign infrastructure, a critical advantage with just four months before election day on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>But any Democratic campaign still needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars more before November to be successful, strategists say. And there, Harris could be a liability.</p>

<p>"I can tell you we have a really tough time raising money for her" said a source at the Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>As a presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election, Harris lagged Biden in raising money. She dropped out of the race in December 2019, the same month her campaign reported $39.3 million in total contributions. Biden's campaign reported $60.9 million in the same period.</p>

<p>However, Biden's campaign raised a record $48 million in the 24 hours after he named Harris as his running mate in 2020.</p>

<p>Harris's prosecutorial background could shine in a head-to-head debate against Trump, some Democrats said.</p>

<p>"She is incredibly focused and forceful and smart, and if she prosecutes the case against the criminality of Donald Trump, she will rip him apart," said Mehlhorn.</p>

<p>Republican attacks on Harris are ramping up as she has been floated as a possible Biden replacement. Conservative talking heads are re-circulating criticism leveled at her during the 2020 race, including from some Democrats, that Harris laughs too much, that she is untested, and unqualified.</p>

<p>Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the attacks are part of a long history of objectifying and denigrating women of color in politics.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the reliance on both racist and sexist attacks and tropes against women running for office is historically common and persists to this day," said Dittmar.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[All is not well between Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All is not well between Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.</p>

<p>As per a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.themirror.com/news/royals/prince-harry-meghan-markle-rift-574899">The Mirror</a>, there seems to be a "growing rift" between the two.</p>

<p>The report added that the Duchess of Sussex is increasingly worried that her life is "not going in the direction she had planned".</p>

<p>Royal author and expert Tom Quinn told the news portal, "There is a growing rift between Harry and Meghan [Markle] caused by Meghan's increasing concern that her life is not going in the direction she had planned."</p>

<p>He added, "Meghan [Markle] loves media attention and hates the fact that surveys suggest she and Harry are no longer of much interest to the American public."</p>

<p>This comes after recent reports have suggested that the Duke and Duchess, who moved to Montecito, California in 2020, were initially welcomed and made many friends in Hollywood. However, surveys show their popularity has seen a downward trajectory.</p>

<p>Talking about Meghna Markle's brand&nbsp;&nbsp;America Riviera Orchard, Mr Quinn said, "The one fly in the ointment is Meghan's new internet brand, America Riviera Orchard. Meghan was in tears when the brand launched and her new jam was widely mocked for being expensive and nothing special."</p>

<p>American Riviera Orchard was launched in March by Meghna Markle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a60215028/all-details-meghan-markle-brand-american-riviera-orchard/">Harper's Bazaar</a>, the brand would focus on home decor and kitchen items. The site will also offer plenty of healthy edible options: "jellies, jams, marmalades, fruit preserves, edible oils and fats, and preserves, vegetable-based spreads, legume-based spreads, nut-based spreads, garlic-based spreads, sesame-based spreads, dairy-based spreads, nut butters, fruit butters," the report added.</p>

<p>Tom Quinn also added that Meghan Markle is "particularly sensitive" to any criticism of her luxurious lifestyle in the US, as she believes it should be admired, not criticised.</p>

<p>For Prince Harry, Mr Quinn claimed that he has become "increasingly bored" and is looking back to the UK, where most of his army and school friends still live. "He never sees [them] because they won't visit him in the States because they find Meghan difficult," the expert added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thirteen people were taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries in Kataragama, 280 kilometres (175 miles) south of the capital Colombo, a police spokesman said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the state-run Kataragama hospital said on Sunday, the day after the incident, that all the injured had been discharged.</p>

<p>Elephants are considered sacred in Sri Lanka, but animal cruelty laws are rarely enforced.</p>

<p>Animal rights groups have criticised the widespread use of elephants at temple ceremonies in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>There have been instances when the animals have gone berserk at parades involving loud music and fireworks.</p>

<p>In August 2023, dozens of pilgrims jumped into a lake in the central city of Kandy to escape five agitated young elephants. Several people were hurt and one woman was hospitalised.</p>

<p>In 2019, at least 17 people were injured when elephants ran amok at a temple festival in Colombo.</p>

<p>Official records show there are about 200 domesticated elephants in the island nation, along with a wild population of around 7,500.</p>

<p>The government has banned the capture of wild elephants but dozens of calves have been stolen in recent years, often after their mothers were killed by their captors.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France went to the polls on Sunday for the second round of a historic election that is expected to leave the far right as the biggest force in a deeply divided parliament.</p>

<p>The mood in the country is tense, with 30,000 police deployed to head off trouble and voters anxious about a potential electoral earthquake shifting the French political landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the village of Rosheim, outside the eastern city of Strasbourg, an "anguished" 72-year-old Antoine Schrameck said he feared France would see "a turning point in the history of the republic".</p>

<p>Adella Fournier, a 41-year-old civil servant, agreed: "I wish the public mood would calm, but we're a long way from that."&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections three years ahead of time after his forces were trounced in June's European parliament vote, a gamble which seems to have backfired.</p>

<p>Far right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) came top in the June 30 first round, and is on course to repeat the feat in Sunday's run off races.</p>

<p>But she may not win the outright majority that would force Macron to appoint Le Pen's lieutenant, the RN party leader Jordan Bardella, 28, as prime minister just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympics.</p>

<p>A hung parliament with a large eurosceptic, anti-immigration contingent could weaken France's international standing and threaten Western unity in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>European Union officials, already learning to deal with far right &nbsp;parties in power in Italy and the Netherlands, are watching France closely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And in Rome, Pope Francis chose the day of the French vote to warn against "ideological temptations and populists", adding: "Democracy is not in good health in the world today."&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the country on tenterhooks, last week saw more than 200 tactical-voting pacts between centre and left wing candidates in seats to attempt to prevent the RN winning an absolute majority.</p>

<p>This has been hailed as a return of the anti-far right "Republican Front" first summoned when Le Pen's father Jean-Marie faced Jacques Chirac in the run-off of 2002 presidential elections.</p>

<p>Opinion polls now forecast that the RN will fall well short of the 289 seats needed for an outright majority in the 577-seat National Assembly, while still becoming the largest party.</p>

<h3><strong>'Catastrophic'</strong></h3>

<p>Such an outcome could allow Macron to possibly build a broad coalition against the RN and keep Gabriel Attal as prime minister on a caretaker basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it could also herald a long period of paralysed politics in France, as it prepares to host the Olympics from July 26.</p>

<p>"Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.</p>

<p>Many in France remain baffled over why Macron called an election that could end with the RN doubling its presence in parliament and his contingent of centrist MPs halving in number.</p>

<p>But the president, known for his theatrical gestures, appears intent on executing what he calls a "clarification" of French politics, which he hopes will eventually leave three clear camps of far right, centre and hard left.</p>

<p>The final opinion polls published by two organisations on Friday projected the RN would win between 170 to 210 seats, followed by the New Popular Front (NFP) broad left-wing coalition on 145 to 185 and Macron's centrists on 118 to 150.</p>

<p>While Macron's Ensemble alliance is forecast to come third, the more successful NFP is a fragile mix of several warring factions ranging from traditional Socialists to the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) of firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon.</p>

<h3><strong>'Weaken France's voice'</strong></h3>

<p>"France is on the cusp of a seismic political shift," said analysts at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), warning that even if Macron controlled the government after the election he would face "legislative gridlocks".</p>

<p>This would weaken "France's voice on the European and international stage".</p>

<p>Macron, who disappeared from public view over recent days in order not to provoke the electorate further, has vowed to serve out his term until 2027, when he must step down.</p>

<p>That is when Le Pen scents her best chance to win the Elysee presidential palace at the fourth attempt.</p>

<p>After voting began on Saturday in France's overseas territories, polls opened in mainland France at 0600 GMT and were due to close by 1800 GMT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Projections -- which usually give a very close idea of the final outcome -- are published shortly afterwards, with the political leaders then reacting rapidly to any frenzy that grips the nation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis decried the state of democracy and warned against "populists" during a short visit to Trieste in Italy's northeast on Sunday ahead of a 12-day trip to Asia -- the longest of his papacy.</p>

<p>"Democracy is not in good health in the world today," Francis said during a speech at the city's convention centre to close a national Catholic event.</p>

<p>Without naming any countries, the pope warned against "ideological temptations and populists" on the day that France holds the second round of a snap parliamentary vote that looks set to see the far-right National Rally (RN) party take the largest share of the vote.</p>

<p>"Ideologies are seductive. Some people compare them to the Pied Piper of Hamelin: they seduce but lead you to deny yourself," he said in reference to the German fairytale.</p>

<p>Ahead of last month's European parliament elections, bishops in several countries also warned about the rise of populism and nationalism, with far-right parties already holding the reins to power in Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Francis also urged people to "move away from polarisations that impoverish" and hit out at "self-referential power".</p>

<p>After Venice in April and Verona in May, the half-day trip to Trieste, a city of 200,000 inhabitants on the Adriatic Sea that borders Slovenia, marked the third one within Italy this year for the 87-year-old pontiff, who has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.</p>

<p>Since travelling to the French city of Marseille in September 2023, the Argentine Jesuit has limited himself to domestic travel.</p>

<p>But he plans to spend nearly two weeks in Asia in September visiting Indonesia, Singapore and the islands of Papua New Guinea and East Timor.</p>

<p>He arrived in Trieste shortly before 9:00 am (0600 GMT) and was due to meet with various groups from the religious and academic spheres, along with migrants and the disabled.</p>

<p>The papal visit is due to conclude with a mass in the city's main public square before he departs for the Vatican in the early afternoon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sojan Joseph, a mental health nurse in the National Health Service (NHS) who migrated from Kerala 22 years ago, is among the new crop of Labour members of Parliament elected to the House of Commons in the UK general election this week.</p>

<p>Mr Joseph, 49, connected with the voters at the doorstep with his pledge to ensure more mental health services in his constituency and succeeded in making a dent in the Conservative stronghold of Ashford in Kent, south-eastern England.</p>

<p>In defeating Tory stalwart and former minister Damian Green, Mr Joseph also dealt a blow to the anti-immigration rhetoric of the right-wing candidates in a seat where the far-right Reform UK came in third place after the Tories.</p>

<p>“I am humbled with the trust you all placed in me and fully aware of the responsibilities that come with it. I will work hard for everyone in Ashford, Hawkinge and villages,” said Mr Joseph in his acceptance speech on Friday.</p>

<p>Being a local councillor and a BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) Officer would have prepared the medical professional for this new parliamentary challenge. But it is his over two decades' long NHS career as a mental health nurse that he feels gives him the empathy required for his new job in Parliament.</p>

<p>Also, his connect with the local communities of Ashford, where he has been living with his wife and three children for over 15 years, is his additional motivation.</p>

<p>“I take great pride in calling Ashford, and Willesborough, my home. I have taken part in a number of fundraising activities over the years, including running marathons for various charities and a dragon boat race for the local hospital charity,” said Mr Joseph, who has undertaken several international marathons for charity.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe in an inclusive society that works towards achieving the full potential for every individual in the community,” he adds.</p>

<p>Mr Joseph, who went to school in Kottayam, completed his nursing studies at B R Ambedkar Medical College in Bengaluru. In the UK, he studied for a Master's degree in healthcare leadership, focusing on diversity and inclusion in public healthcare. Many voters described him as extremely passionate about improving access to mental and physical healthcare services for everyone on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>When he takes his seat in the Commons next week, he will be joined by a number of other first-time Labour MPs of Indian heritage who are reflective of the nationwide swing towards the party after the Keir Starmer-led party won a landslide mandate to form a new government.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lashing rains in Nepal causing flash floods and landslides have killed at least 14 people across the country, with disaster teams searching for nine missing, police said Sunday.</p>

<p>Flooding in neighbouring India, as well as in downstream Bangladesh, has also caused widespread damage and impacted millions.</p>

<p>"Police are working with other agencies and locals to find the missing people," Nepalese police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP.</p>

<p>Those killed and missing are in multiple locations.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains from June to September bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the numbers of fatal floods and landslides have increased in recent years.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change and increased road construction are exacerbating the problem.</p>

<p>Parts of Nepal have been receiving heavy rainfall since Thursday, prompting disaster authorities in the Himalayan nation to warn of flash floods in multiple rivers.</p>

<p>There have been reports of inundation in several districts of lowland areas bordering India.</p>

<p>Last month 14 people were killed in Nepal in ferocious storms that brought landslides, lightning and flooding.</p>

<p>In India, floods have swamped the northeastern state of Assam, with six people killed in the last 24 hours, Assam's Disaster Management Authority said Sunday.</p>

<p>That takes the death toll from the downpours since mid-May to 58.</p>

<p>In low-lying Bangladesh, downstream from India, the disaster management agency said floods had impacted more than two million people.</p>

<p>Much of the country is made up of deltas where the Himalayan rivers the Ganges and the Brahmaputra wind towards the sea after coursing through India.</p>

<p>The summer monsoon brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Citing the data on access to adult content by minors, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called it "devastating" and told a Spanish newspaper, "Almost half of young people under 15 years of age consume it".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to restrict the access to online pornography by minors, Spain has come up with a new mobile application that will not only require users to verify their age, but also limits the number of credits for viewing adult content.</p>

<p>This comes after Dale Una Vuelta, an anti-pornography group that campaigns for tighter regulations on access to adult content online, earlier released statistics that raised concerns over the alarming spread of adult content among minors.</p>

<p>Calling the data "devastating," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told El Pais newspaper, "Almost half of young people under 15 years of age consume it".</p>

<h2>How will the app work?</h2>

<p>The mobile application, officially called the Digital Wallet Beta (Cartera Digital Beta), and locally known as the "pajaporte", will allow platforms to check whether the user is above the age of 18 years or not. To verify their age, the viewers will be asked to use the mobile app.</p>

<p>The application will work as a mobile phone wallet and will verify users' age through one of the five government-issued IDs.</p>

<p>Once verified, the users will then receive 30 "porn credits" with one-month validity. These credits will grant them access to adult content. Further, users will be able to put a request for extra credits.</p>

<h2>Launch date</h2>

<p>The mobile application will be available by the end of the summer, reports said.</p>

<p>Though it is being criticised by a section of activists and experts for its complexity, the Spanish government has defended the move. According to the government, the credit-based model is more privacy-friendly and ensures that the online activities are not easily traceable.</p>

<p>It will be voluntary, as online platforms can rely on other age-verification methods available to keep a check on inappropriate viewers.</p>

<p>The upcoming app is part of the broader effort to align with the European Union law that comes into effect in October 2027. Eventually, the porn passport in Spain will likely get replaced by the EU's own digital identity system (eIDAS2).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large clinical trial in South Africa and Uganda has shown that a twice-yearly injection of a new pre-exposure prophylaxis drug gives young women total protection from HIV infection.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The trial tested whether the six-month injection of lenacapavir would provide better protection against HIV infection than two other drugs, both daily pills. All three medications are pre-exposure prophylaxis (or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html">PrEP</a>) drugs.</p>

<p>Physician-scientist <a href="https://idm.uct.ac.za/contacts/linda-gail-bekker">Linda-Gail Bekker</a>, principal investigator for the South African part of the study, tells Nadine Dreyer what makes this breakthough so significant and what to expect next.</p>

<h2>Tell us about the trial and what it set out to achieve</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.purposestudies.com/">Purpose 1</a> trial with 5,000 participants took place at three sites in Uganda and 25 sites in South Africa to test the efficacy of lenacapavir and two other drugs.</p>

<p><a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/lenacapavir-drug-offers-new-hope-for-multi-drug-resistant-hiv/">Lenacapavir (Len LA)</a> is a <a href="https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/glossary/capsid-inhibitors#:%7E:text=Capsid%20inhibitors%20are%20a%20class,of%20the%20viral%20life%20cycle.">fusion capside inhibitor</a>. It interferes with the HIV capsid, a protein shell that protects HIV's genetic material and enzymes needed for replication. It is administered just under the skin, once every six months.</p>

<p>The randomised controlled trial, sponsored by the drug developers <a href="https://www.gilead.com/">Gilead Sciences</a>, tested several things.</p>

<p>The first was whether a six-monthly injection of <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2024/6/gileads-twiceyearly-lenacapavir-demonstrated-100-efficacy-and-superiority-to-daily-truvada-for-hiv-prevention">lenacapavir</a> was safe and would provide better protection against HIV infection as PrEP for women between the ages of 16 and 25 years than <a href="https://www.empr.com/home/news/drugs-in-the-pipeline/lenacapavir-superior-to-truvada-for-hiv-prevention-in-cisgender-women/">Truvada F/TDF</a>, a daily PrEP pill in wide use that has been available for more than a decade.</p>

<p>Secondly, the trial also tested whether Descovy <a href="https://www.prepwatch.org/products/oral-prep-f-taf/">F/TAF</a>, a newer daily pill, was as effective as F/TDF. The newer F/TAF has superior <a href="https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/clinical-pharmacology/pharmacokinetics/overview-of-pharmacokinetics">pharmacokinetic</a> properties to F/TDF. Pharmacokinetic refers to the movement of a drug into, through, and out of the body. F/TAF is a smaller pill and is in use among men and transgender women in high-income countries.</p>

<p>The trial had three arms. Young women were randomly assigned to one of the arms in a 2:2:1 ratio (Len LA: F/TAF oral: F/TDF oral) in a <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-a-Double-Blind-Trial.aspx">double blinded</a> fashion. This means neither the participants nor the researchers knew which treatment participants were receiving until the clinical trial was over.</p>

<p>In eastern and southern Africa, young women are the population who <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/despite-progress-adolescent-girls-continue-bear-brunt-hiv-epidemic-98000-new">bear the brunt of new HIV infections</a>. They also find a daily PrEP regimen <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169554/">challenging</a> to maintain, for a number of social and structural reasons.</p>

<p>During the randomised phase of the trial none of the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-06-year-women-full-hiv-trial.html">2,134 women</a> who received lenacapavir contracted HIV. There was 100 percent efficiency.</p>

<p>By comparison, 16 of the <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-06-year-women-full-hiv-trial.html">1,068 women</a> (or 1.5%) who took Truvada (F/TDF) and 39 of <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-06-year-women-full-hiv-trial.html">2,136</a> (1.8%) who received Descovy (F/TAF) contracted the HIV virus.</p>

<p>The results at a recent <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2024/6/gileads-twiceyearly-lenacapavir-demonstrated-100-efficacy-and-superiority-to-daily-truvada-for-hiv-prevention">independent data safety monitoring board</a> review led to the recommendation that the trial's “blinded” phase should be stopped and all participants should be offered a choice of PrEP.</p>

<p>This board is an independent committee of experts who are put in place at the start of a clinical trial. They see the unblinded data at stipulated times during the trial to monitor progress and safety. They ensure that a trial does not continue if there is harm or a clear benefit in one arm over others.</p>

<h2>What is the significance of these trials?</h2>

<p>This breakthrough gives great hope that we have a proven, highly effective prevention tool to protect people from HIV.</p>

<p>There were <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/global-statistics">1.3 million new HIV infections</a> globally in the past year. Although that's fewer than the <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/global-statistics">2 million infections</a> seen in 2010, it is clear that at this rate we are not going to meet the HIV <a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/Sep2019_2025targets-2ndStComMeeting-Report_en.pdf">new infection target</a> that UNAIDS set for 2025 (fewer than 500,000 globally) or potentially even the goal to end Aids by <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/evidence-brief-progress-towards-reaching-sustainable-development-goals-related#:%7E:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Sustainable%20Development,discrimination%20in%20the%20EU%2FEEA.">2030</a>.</p>

<p>PrEP is not the only prevention tool.</p>

<p>PrEP should be provided alongside HIV self-testing, access to condoms, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and access to contraception for women of childbearing potential.</p>

<p>In addition, young men should be offered <a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2007/february/20070228mcpt2#:%7E:text=Scientists%20say%20male%20circumcision%20probably,scratched%20or%20torn%20during%20sex.">medical male circumcision</a> for health reasons.</p>

<p>But despite these options, we haven't quite got to the point where we have been able to stop new infections, particularly among young people.</p>

<p>For young people, the daily decision to take a pill or use a condom or take a pill at the time of sexual intercourse can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169554/">very challenging</a>.</p>

<p>HIV scientists and activists hope that young people may find that having to make this “prevention decision” only twice a year may reduce unpredictability and barriers.</p>

<p>For a young woman who struggles to get to an appointment at a clinic in a town or who can't keep pills without facing stigma or violence, an injection just twice a year is the option that could keep her free of HIV.</p>

<h2>What happens now?</h2>

<p>The plan is that the Purpose 1 trial will go on but now in an “open label” phase. This means that study participants will be “unblinded”: they will be told whether they have been in the “injectable” or oral TDF or oral TAF groups.</p>

<p>They will be offered the choice of PrEP they would prefer as the trial continues.</p>

<p>A sister trial is also under way: <a href="https://www.purposestudies.com/purpose2/">Purpose 2</a> is being conducted in a number of regions including some sites in Africa among cisgender men, and transgender and nonbinary people who have sex with men.</p>

<p>It's important to conduct trials among different groups because we have seen differences in effectiveness. Whether the sex is <a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive-health/hiv-aids/causes/risk-of-exposure.html">anal or vaginal</a> is important and may have an impact on effectiveness.</p>

<h2>How long until the drug is rolled out?</h2>

<p>We have read in a Gilead Sciences <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases">press statement</a> that within the next couple of months the company will submit the dossier with all the results to a number of country regulators, particularly the Ugandan and South African regulators.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization will also review the data and may issue recommendations.</p>

<p>We hope then that this new drug will be adopted into WHO and country guidelines.</p>

<p>We also hope we may begin to see the drug being tested in more studies to understand better how to incorporate it into real world settings.</p>

<p>Price is a critical factor to ensure access and distribution in the public sector where it is badly needed.</p>

<p>Gilead Sciences has said it will offer licences to companies that make generic drugs, which is another critical way to get <a href="https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/hiv-treatment-cost">prices down</a>.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, governments will be able to purchase this affordably and it will be offered to all who want it and need protection against HIV.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tank tracks still fresh on his field in southern Gaza's coastal area of Al-Mawasi, Nedal Abu Jazar lamented the damage war has wrought on his trees and crops.</p>

<p>"Look at the destruction," the 39-year-old farmer told AFP, holding an uprooted tomato plant.</p>

<p>He pointed to his greenhouse's metal frame and its white plastic sheeting strewn across the plot, inside an area designated a humanitarian zone by the Israeli army.</p>

<p>"People were sitting peacefully on their farmland ... and suddenly tanks arrived and fired at us, and then there were (air) strikes."</p>

<p>Abu Jazar said the Israeli operation in late June destroyed about 40 dunams (10 acres) of land and killed five labourers.</p>

<p>His is not an isolated case. Across Gaza, 57 percent of agricultural land has been damaged since the war began, according to a joint assessment published in June by the UN's agriculture and satellite imagery agencies, FAO and UNOSAT.</p>

<p>The damage threatens Gaza's food sovereignty, Matieu Henry of the Food and Agriculture Organization told AFP, because 30 percent of the Palestinian territory's food consumption comes from agricultural land.</p>

<p>"If almost 60 per cent of the agricultural land has been damaged, this may have a significant impact in terms of food security and food supply."</p>

<p>The Gaza Strip exported $44.6 million worth of produce in 2022, mainly to the West Bank and Israel, with strawberries and tomatoes representing 60 percent of the total, according to FAO data.</p>

<p>That number fell to zero after the October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,098 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The damage assessment on the agricultural land comes as the UN's hunger monitoring system estimated in June that 96 percent of Gaza faces high levels of acute food insecurity.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, the Israeli army said it "does not intentionally harm agricultural land".</p>

<p>In a statement, it said Hamas "often operates from within orchards, fields and agricultural land".</p>

<h3><strong>No work, no income</strong></h3>

<p>The impact is worse in the Palestinian territory's north, where 68 percent of agricultural land is damaged, although the southern area encompassing parts of Al-Mawasi has seen the most significant increase in recent months due to military operations.</p>

<p>UNOSAT's Lars Bromley told AFP the damage is generally "due to the impact of activities such as heavy vehicle activity, bombing, shelling, and other conflict-related dynamics, which would be things like areas burning".</p>

<p>Near the southern city of Rafah, 34-year-old farmer Ibrahim Dheir feels helpless after the destruction of 20 dunams (five acres) of land he used to lease, and all his farming equipment with it.</p>

<p>"As soon as the Israeli bulldozers and tanks entered the area, they began bulldozing cultivated lands with various trees, including fruits, citrus, guava, as well as crops like spinach, molokhia (jute mallow), eggplant, squash, pumpkin and sunflower seedlings," he said, before listing more damage in a testimony of the area's past agricultural abundance.</p>

<p>Dheir, whose family exported its produce to the West Bank and Israel, now feels destitute.</p>

<p>"We used to depend on agriculture for our livelihood day by day, but now there's no work or income."</p>

<h3><strong>Lasting damage</strong></h3>

<p>Farmer Abu Mahmoud Za'arab also finds himself with "no source of income".</p>

<p>The 60-year-old owns 15 dunams (3.7 acres) of land on which crops and fruit trees used to grow.</p>

<p>"The Israeli army passed through the land, completely wiping out all trees and crops," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"They bulldozed and shelled the land, turning it into barren pits."</p>

<p>The harm done to farmland in Gaza will last far beyond tank tracks and explosions, said Bromley of UNOSAT.</p>

<p>"With modern weaponry, a certain percentage is always going to fail. Tank shells won't explode, artillery shells won't explode ... so clearing that unexploded ordnance is a massive task," he said.</p>

<p>It will require "probing every centimetre of the soil before you can allow the farmers back onto it".</p>

<p>Despite the risks, Dheir wants to return to farming.</p>

<p>"We want the war to stop and things to return to how they were so we can farm and cultivate our lands again."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A hacker, who goes by the name “ObamaCare”, has leaked 995 crore passwords, as per <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/07/05/new-security-alert-hacker-uploads-10-billion-stolen-passwords-to-crime-forum/">Forbes</a>.&nbsp; The information was released under a dataset named Rockyou2024 on Thursday, the report added.</p>

<p>As per researchers, it is considered the largest password data breach of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“In its essence, the RockYou2024 leak is a compilation of real-world passwords used by individuals all over the world. Revealing that many passwords for threat actors substantially heightens the risk of credential stuffing attacks,” researchers at <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/rockyou2024-largest-password-compilation-leak/">Cybernews</a> said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Threat actors could exploit the RockYou2024 password compilation to conduct brute-force attacks and gain unauthorised access to various online accounts used by individuals who employ passwords included in the dataset,” they added.</p>

<p>As per the researchers, the passwords have been leaked with the help of a mix of old and new data breaches.</p>

<p>“Moreover, combined with other leaked databases on hacker forums and marketplaces, which, for example, contain user email addresses and other credentials, RockYou2024 can contribute to a cascade of data breaches, financial frauds, and identity thefts,” the team said.</p>

<p>But this isn't the first time Rockyou2024 has leaked passwords. Before this, hackers leaked around&nbsp;8.4 billion plain text passwords, the report added.</p>

<p>People are advised to follow cyber hygiene practices to avoid falling prey to online crime. In April, the<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/university-body-to-educate-institutions-on-cyber-hygiene-5320664"> University Grant Commission</a> asked&nbsp;all higher educational institutions (HEIs) to participate in a webinar on 'Cyber Hygiene'.</p>

<p>"As per the directions of the Ministry of Home Affairs to promote mass awareness of students in the prevention of cybercrime, all higher education institutions (HEIs) are requested to participate in a 1-hour live webinar on 'Cyber Hygiene' by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (l4C), Ministry of Home Affairs, scheduled for April 3, 2024, Wednesday from 2:00 PM to 3:00 pm," read the official notification by UGC.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 6, 2023, Palestinian karate champion Mais Elbostami went to bed thrilled after winning a competition in the Gaza Strip. She awoke the next day to a different world.</p>

<p>"I'd won first place," the shy 18-year-old told AFP from a Cairo suburb, where her family now lives after escaping the war and where she is training in the hope to one day represent her country internationally.</p>

<p>She said she "hadn't even hung up the medals" she won on October 6 before Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Immediately, she and her family fled south from their home in the northern Gaza Strip as Israel launched a relentless retaliatory military campaign.</p>

<p>Over the past nine months, the war has reduced much of the besieged Palestinian territory to rubble and killed more than 38,000 people, according to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry.</p>

<p>Amid the hell of bombing and displacement, "every hour that passed felt like it aged you by a year", said Elbostami.</p>

<p>Death was all around her.</p>

<p>"In the first 10 days alone, I lost my coach Jamal al-Khairy, and his granddaughter who used to train with me," she said.</p>

<p>When the family made it to the Egyptian capital in April, Elbostami had two things on her mind: making sure relatives back home were safe, and getting back to her karate training.</p>

<h3><strong>'Raise the flag'</strong></h3>

<p>Despite being trapped in Gaza, Palestinian national team coach Hassan al-Raiy put her in touch with the Egyptian team, and within two weeks she was back on the mat.</p>

<p>"My coaches here in Egypt have practically adopted me, and they're working with me so I can get good enough to compete in the next championships," she said.</p>

<p>Whenever she can, she spars on the mat. But with limited resources and gym time, Elbostami has also had to train in the streets and gardens around her house.</p>

<p>She often finds her mind wandering to Gaza's Mediterranean shore.</p>

<p>"Training back home was different. Every Friday my teammates and I would go and train by the sea," she said.</p>

<p>Karate is known for its strong focus on discipline and self-control, and this has helped the young karateka to "detach from reality" -- living as a refugee from a brutal war -- even for a little while.</p>

<p>"My emotions sometimes get the best of me. There are times I can't get through a full session" without remembering "fleeing on foot as air strikes fell all around us", she said.</p>

<p>Elbostami tries to focus on her goal -- "to represent my country and raise its flag in international competitions".</p>

<h3><strong>'It's for my country'</strong></h3>

<p>She has a long way to go, and her first stop on that journey is Egypt's own national championships in August.</p>

<p>"It's a tough challenge," she said, because Egyptian karate athletes have historically outperformed their Palestinian counterparts."</p>

<p>"But it will bring my level up, too."</p>

<p>Elbostami's Egyptian coach, Mamdouh Salem, told AFP that the teenager was an "athlete with a lot of potential, dedication and persistence".</p>

<p>"We're working on her technique, but ultimately karate is more a game of skill than talent -- I expect Mais will excel."</p>

<p>He said he wants to help her raise the Palestinian flag around the world.</p>

<p>"If we can't fight with them" in Gaza, "we can at least help them represent their country abroad", he said, echoing widespread Egyptian solidarity with the Palestinian cause.</p>

<p>Her Gazan teammates, coaches and most of her relatives may remain trapped in Gaza -- and she said dozens of them have been killed -- but against all odds, Elbostami has survived.</p>

<p>"So I don't have any excuse to keep me from achieving my goal," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll do everything I can to highlight the Palestinian cause. Every championship and every time I represent Palestine, it's for my country, for the martyrs and for the wounded."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born at the start of the Cold War, NATO -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- is the world's biggest collective defence grouping with 32 members in Europe and North America.</p>

<h3><strong>How many divisions?</strong></h3>

<p>NATO's military forces come from its member countries, put under a unified Allied command each time it launches a mission.</p>

<p>US forces are by far the biggest contingent. In Europe, there are some 79,000 US servicemen and women deployed, more than 48,000 of them in Germany, according to the Pentagon.</p>

<p>The only military equipment NATO itself owns is a fleet of sensor-loaded AWACS planes and drones.</p>

<p>Sweden became its newest member in March, swelling its potential ranks by 50,000 more troops -- around half of them reservists -- to more than three million, according to several specialised institutes.</p>

<h3><strong>Brussels HQ</strong></h3>

<p>NATO was created from a Washington Treaty signed on April 4, 1949. Its mission at the time was to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union and to affirm the principle of mutual defence of its members.</p>

<p>In a Madrid summit following Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the alliance adopted a new strategic concept designating Russia as "the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security".</p>

<p>Its 12 founding nations (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States) have been joined by others over succeeding years, up to Sweden's adhesion.</p>

<p>NATO's first headquarters was in London, then it was moved to Paris before being transferred to Brussels in 1966 where it remains today. Its SHAPE military command is in Mons, also in Belgium.</p>

<p>The alliance's head since 2014 has been Jens Stoltenberg, a 65-year-old former Norwegian prime minister. His term runs to the end of October this year -- when he will be succeeded by former Dutch premier Mark Rutte, 57.</p>

<p>NATO's main decision-making body is the North Atlantic Council.</p>

<h3><strong>Article 5</strong></h3>

<p>The core of NATO is Article 5 of its founding treaty which stipulates that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.</p>

<p>It has been invoked just once to date: in 2001, in a show of allies' support for the United States the day after it was hit by the September 11 attacks.</p>

<p>NATO has carried out several missions over its history, including one in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001 attacks. That came to an end with a hasty pull-out in September 2021 of the 10,000 personnel deployed at the time.</p>

<p>NATO is present in Iraq and notably in Kosovo, where it has 4,500 troops in its KFOR stabilisation force sent from 27 countries.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden dismissed calls to end his reelection bid and denied that his debate performance wrought significant damage to his campaign, a defiant posture that risked further alarming Democrats who fear he has not honestly grappled with his biggest political crisis.</p>

<p>Biden on Friday in an ABC News interview refused to commit to an independent medical exam to reassure the public of his mental fitness, even as he insisted he has the stamina to serve another four years.</p>

<p>He did not accept that he trails Donald Trump in the polls, said he had not directly heard discussions among senior Democrats about asking him to step aside, and declared only the "Lord Almighty" would prompt him to even consider ending his bid.</p>

<p>And while the president, 81, avoided a significant gaffe like the ones that bedeviled his disjointed debate performance, the 22-minute prime-time interview with anchor George Stephanopoulos was unlikely to assuage concerns among the voters, donors, and Democratic officials who have spent the past week in a panic that he not only would fail to defeat his Republican opponent, but would not be able to serve another four years even if he managed reelection.</p>

<p>"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that's what this is about," Biden said when asked how he will feel in January if Trump wins the election, a nightmare scenario for Democrats.</p>

<p>Biden's posture is perhaps the only strategy available for a candidate who is determined to continue his bid to win a second term. After Biden unveiled a revamped stump speech earlier Friday that acknowledged his age and more forcefully attacked Trump, his campaign indicated he plans to soldier on with more events Sunday in battleground Pennsylvania and beyond.</p>

<p>Multiple polls released following the debate showed Biden losing ground to Trump, with several showing him trailing by 6 percentage points. The share of voters in a New York Times/Siena College poll who believe he is too old to be president grew to 74%.</p>

<h3><strong>Dismisses Polls</strong></h3>

<p>When asked if he believes he is not behind, however, Biden said "all the pollsters I talk to tell me it's a tossup."</p>

<p>One Democratic donor, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said they are angry at those in Biden's orbit for not encouraging him to step down, calling the continued campaign delusional and selfish.</p>

<p>"He is dangerously out-of-touch with the concerns people have" David Axelrod, a former Obama White House adviser who has been critical of Biden, posted on X after the interview.</p>

<p>Before Biden's ABC appearance, Illinois Representative Mike Quigley joined a group of more than half a dozen House Democrats who have either explicitly called on the president to drop out, or said they believe he would lose to Trump in November.</p>

<p>Biden acknowledged Senator Mark Warner, a prominent Democrat from Virginia, was looking to rally other lawmakers to pressure him to drop out. The president said he had heard from others that he should remain in the race.</p>

<p>"Mark and I have a different perspective," Biden told Stephanopoulos.</p>

<p>"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race. The Lord Almighty's not coming down," the president continued.</p>

<h3><strong>'Wasn't In Control'</strong></h3>

<p>Biden chalked up his poor debate performance to a "bad episode" brought on by a severe cold and that there was "no indication of any serious condition." Asked when he realized that he was having a bad night, Biden suggested that at one point he had been distracted by Trump shouting.</p>

<p>"I realized that I just wasn't in control," he said of that moment.</p>

<p>Asked if he had watched his debate performance, which alarmed Democratic allies, Biden said "I don't think I did, no."</p>

<p>The interview came during a trip to Wisconsin in which Biden flatly declared he was not considering dropping out of the race. He said those looking to pressure him were disrespecting the will of Democratic primary voters, and that he still believed he represented the best chance for Democrats of defeating Trump.</p>

<p>The issue will be put to the test over the coming week in the face of growing concern from Democratic lawmakers and donors.</p>

<p>After his trip to Pennsylvania, Biden hosts NATO leaders starting Tuesday at a summit in Washington. The president's ramped-up schedule is a response to panicked Democrats who have demanded he do more to prove to voters he is capable of serving another four years in the White House.</p>

<p>So far, some Democrats remain wary.</p>

<p>Biden met Wednesday behind closed doors with more than 20 Democratic governors in a bid to stem the crisis engulfing his presidency, telling them he is "in it to win it." He received public votes of confidence from several of them, including California's Gavin Newsom and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

<p>But privately, the governors had tough questions for the president and he acknowledged that he needs to get more sleep going forward, according to a person familiar with the discussion.</p>

<p>One of the participants, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, issued a statement Friday that stopped short of calling on Biden to drop out but appeared to push him to at least consider the possibility.</p>

<p>"I urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump," she said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO's 75th-anniversary summit was meant to showcase the triumph of a larger, stronger alliance. Instead, leaders are coming together in Washington in the shadow of setbacks in Ukraine and electoral headwinds on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, fighting for his political life after a disastrous debate against NATO sceptic Donald Trump, will turn his attention away from campaigning to welcome leaders of the 32-nation transatlantic alliance for three days from Tuesday.</p>

<p>Biden has also invited the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, a sign of NATO's growing role in Asia in the face of a rising China.</p>

<p>But the star of the summit is set to be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is looking for firm signs of support although NATO will not be extending his country an invitation to join.</p>

<p>Founded in 1949 to provide collective defence against the Soviet Union, NATO returned in some ways to its original mission when allies rallied to Ukraine's defence after it was invaded by Russia in 2022.</p>

<p>Ukrainians heartened most of the West by repelling Russia in its push for a quick victory. But Moscow's troops have been grinding on, making advances in the east.</p>

<p>A European official acknowledged the mood ahead of the NATO summit has become "gloomy" with Ukraine slipping on a fragile frontline.</p>

<p>"This summit will be very different from the initial plans because it is happening at a critical juncture for European security," the official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"Russia is today in a situation which is quite comfortable. They think they can simply wait it out," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump casts shadow</strong></h3>

<p>Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the summit comes at "the best of times, and the worst of times."</p>

<p>"The best of times, in the sense that the alliance knows what it's about -- deterring Russia. Alliance members are spending more," he said.</p>

<p>"But it's also sort of the worst of times -- obviously because of the war in Ukraine, challenges of ramping up European defence spending, concerns about the reliability of the United States."</p>

<p>Trump, who has voiced admiration in the past for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, has long criticized NATO as an unfair burden on the United States, which spends far more than any other ally.</p>

<p>The 2024 Republican presidential candidate -- whose first term was marked by an impeachment over his strong-arming of Zelensky -- has insisted he can stop the war, with his advisors floating the possibility of conditioning future US assistance on Ukraine entering negotiations to surrender territory.</p>

<p>Trump has enjoyed a narrow lead against Biden in recent polls. Meanwhile, France -- where President Emmanuel Macron has mulled sending troops to Ukraine -- is also facing a political shift with the strong gains in legislative elections by the far-right, which is historically close to Russia.</p>

<p>Those setbacks come as Putin recently hosted Viktor Orban, the Russia-friendly prime minister of Hungary, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.</p>

<p>The NATO summit is also expected to mark a diplomatic debut for a new leader -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after his Labour Party's landslide election victory.</p>

<h3><strong>Finding a path for Ukraine&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>NATO's outgoing secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has led efforts to put the alliance itself, not the United States, in the lead in coordinating military assistance for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg also wants allies to commit to provide at least 40 billion euros ($43 billion) per year in military aid to Ukraine, ensuring reliable and consistent support as Kyiv prepares for a long war against Russia.</p>

<p>Diplomats have dubbed such measures as "Trump-proofing" the alliance, although few believe that NATO or support for Ukraine could endure in the same way without the United States, which under Biden has approved $175 billion for Kyiv in military and other assistance.</p>

<p>The summit also comes on the heels of two more nations joining NATO -- Finland and Sweden -- which both overcame earlier reluctance to formally enter the alliance after witnessing the invasion of Ukraine, which had unsuccessfully sought membership.</p>

<p>Diplomats say that the United States is eager to stage a smooth, drama-free meeting and avoid the bitter recriminations at NATO's summit last year in Lithuania, where Zelensky failed to win firmer commitments for Ukraine to join the alliance.</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials acknowledge there is no chance of a change of heart in Washington. Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have led opposition to Ukrainian membership, believing that admitting a country already at war would be tantamount to NATO itself confronting nuclear-armed Russia.</p>

<p>Biden instead has reached a 10-year security agreement with Ukraine, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying the United States will soon announce $2.3 billion in new military assistance.</p>

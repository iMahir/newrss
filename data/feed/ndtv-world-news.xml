       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salvatore Strazzullo, the New York City lawyer notorious for his colourful client roster and personal scandals, was found dead in his car outside his parents' Brooklyn home on Saturday. He was 52. The circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear, with his cause of death not yet determined, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/12/us-news/sal-strazzullo-found-dead-night-life-lawyer-repped-strippers-celebs/ ">NY Post</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Night-Life Lawyer'</strong></p>

<p>Strazzullo, who earned the nickname "Night-Life Lawyer" given his penchant for taking on cases involving celebrities and embarrassing circumstances, was facing multiple ongoing criminal cases for allegedly exploiting elderly clients out of millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Famous Clientele&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, Strazzullo defended rapper Foxy Brown in a case where she was accused of flashing a neighbour she had been feuding with. Strazzullo was prepared to invoke "the underwear defence" if the case went to trial, arguing that his client had simply not worn underwear that day. The case, however, ended up getting dismissed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another case, Strazzullo represented Milana Dravnel, an exotic dancer who sued Oscar de la Hoya for $100 million in 2007. The case involved racy photos of the boxing legend in his underwear, which Ms Dravnel sold to a West Coast photo agency for $70,000. Mr De la Hoya's team claimed the photos were doctored.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Scandals</strong></p>

<p>The infamous lawyer faced numerous legal troubles, including allegations of sexual harassment and criminal charges for theft and fraud, throughout his career.</p>

<p>In 2011, Desiree DeMartino, a former paralegal and employee, pressed charges against Strazzullo for sexual harassment in Brooklyn Federal Court. The suit alleged that Strazzullo trapped Ms DeMartino in a conference room, pleasured himself in front of her, and committed other inappropriate acts, including forcibly kissing her and touching her breasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More recently, Strazzullo faced criminal charges for theft and fraud, accused of misusing his escrow account to fund a lavish lifestyle. In April, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez alleged that Strazzullo operated a Ponzi scheme, using funds from one client to pay off another while accumulating tens of thousands of dollars in charges at upscale restaurants and hotels. Prosecutors also alleged he spent the stolen funds on luxuries like a $100,000 BMW and a $13,000-per-month apartment.</p>

<p>Strazzullo pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of grand larceny and scheme to defraud, but the evidence against him was substantial. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez condemned Strazzullo's actions, stating he stole the "nest eggs" of senior citizens who trusted him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of his death, two criminal cases, including another alleged theft of $1.5 million from three clients, against Strazzullo were still pending.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump today spent nearly an hour discussing the recent assassination attempt, something he had promised never to talk about again. Trump and Musk discussed at length how a bullet narrowly missed the former US President during a rally at Pennsylvania's Butler.</p>

<p>At the Republican national convention last month, Trump had told the crowd about the close call and what he went through - but said he would do so only that one time. During the speech, his first following the assassination attempt, he promised never to narrate the ordeal.</p>

<p>But Trump went back on his word during the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-live-updates-x-owner-to-interview-republican-2024-us-elections-presidential-candidate-6324927">conversation with Musk</a>, saying "It was a miracle. If I hadn't turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now, as much as I like you."</p>

<p>"It was a hard hit. It was very, I guess you would say, surreal, but it wasn't surreal. You know, I was telling somebody, you have instances like this... where you feel it's a surreal situation. And I never felt that way. I knew immediately that it was a bullet," Trump said before elaborating the entire incident.</p>

<p>The start of the much-awaited interview though was delayed due to techinical glitches, which Musk claimed were caused due to a targeted cyber attack on the platform.</p>

<p>The glitches prevented people from listening to the event and led to widespread frustration among users. Many were met with error messages and resulted in 'crashed' and 'unable to fetch spaces' being the top trending hashtags on X.</p>

<p>The conversation was intended to help reinvigorate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-interviews-donald-trump-on-x-6323844">Donald Trump's</a> stuttering campaign, which has flagged since Biden dropped out of the race, to be replaced by a surging Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump said that the country "will go out of business," if Kamala Harris wins US elections 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States President Donald Trump was interviewed by billionaire Elon Musk on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) today. The interview had a rocky start and was delayed by 40 minutes after the Tesla Chief announced that there was a cyber attack on his social media platform. The two businessmen discussed a variety of topics ahead of US polls including immigration, layoffs, the assassination attempt on Mr Trump and climate change. Amid this, Mr Musk has now invited US Vice President Kamala Harris for a chat on X Spaces.</p>

<p>He took to the microblogging platform and wrote, "Happy to host Kamala on an X Spaces too."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Happy to host Kamala on an ? Spaces too</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1823217769229566251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Since being shared, his post has amassed a variety of reactions online.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign reacted to the post with a folded hands emoji.</p>

<p>A person joked, "Same chance of her agreeing to come on as me meeting Abraham Lincoln tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"It would be really smart of her to do this. Significantly simpler logistics than doing a rally, with a far larger potential impact. I'm sure you'd be a fair interviewer," said a person.</p>

<p>A user stated, "Free Speech! @VP should 100% do this. The American people deserve to hear your thoughts on the issues!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Republican candidate slammed Ms Harris and said, "The number of illegals Kamala (Harris) has welcomed into our communities is much bigger than we think." He told Elon Musk, "Countries are emptying their prisons - and sending them to our country. They're bringing crime and violence to our backyards," he said.</p>

<p>In a separate comment, he also said that the country "will go out of business," if she wins US elections 2024. "We don't have a president right now - and Kamala is even worse. She's a San Francisco liberal who destroyed that city, destroyed California, and will destroy our country if she's elected," Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the same, Ms Harris' presidential campaign<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1823194536983556377"> issued a statement on X</a>. They said, "Donald Trump's extremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda is a feature not a glitch of his campaign, which was on full display for those unlucky enough to listen in tonight during whatever that was on X.com."</p>

<p>They added, "Trump's entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself - self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden Administration looks forward to expanding its "critical and critically important" partnership with India and creating a more prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific, the White House has said.</p>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre made the remarks on Monday while responding to questions on the priorities of US President Joe Biden in the remaining six months of his administration.</p>

<p>“We look forward to continuing to expand our critical and critically important partnership and how it's going to benefit the American people," she said while addressing her daily news conference.</p>

<p>"We want to create a more prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and the world. That is going to continue to be our focus as we move forward,” she said.</p>

<p>“The president (Joe Biden) views our relationship -- the United States' relationship with India -- as one of the most consequential in the world. We work closely with India on our most vital priorities, including through the Quad and the US-India initiative on -- Critical and Emerging Technology,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, India's Ambassador-designate to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, arrived in the American Capital.</p>

<p>Kwatra, who previously served as Minister of Commerce in the Indian Embassy here, is expected to present his credentials to President Biden shortly.</p>

<p>The top Indian diplomat, who is well known in the US diplomatic circles, arrives in the US in the middle of an intense presidential election campaign, fast-moving developments in Bangladesh and two wars in which the US is currently engaged.</p>

<p>Over the next 90 days, India and the US are expected to have some high-level diplomatic engagements, including visits of cabinet-level officials on either side.</p>

<p>The overall ties between India and the US have witnessed a major upswing following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic state visit to Washington in June last year, followed by Biden's trip to India last September for the G20 summit.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finally got underway on Musk's social media platform X on Monday evening, following a lengthy delay caused by technical problems that kept many users from accessing the live stream.</p>

<p>Musk, who has endorsed Trump, began the event at 8:42 p.m. (0042 GMT Tuesday), more than 40 minutes after the scheduled start time. He blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was not confirmed.</p>

<p>More than 1.3 million people were listening about 45 minutes into the conversation, according to a counter on X.</p>

<p>Trump sought to turn the problems into a positive, congratulating Musk on the number of people trying to tune in.</p>

<p>The former president sounded at times as if he had a lisp, many listeners on X pointed out. Some said it made him sound like a cartoon character, others suggested it could be due to audio compression issues.</p>

<p>The technical issues recalled a similar event on X in May 2023, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the platform.</p>

<p>At the time, Trump mocked DeSantis on his own, social media platform, Truth Social. "My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!)" Trump posted, "Yours does not."</p>

<p>Ahead of Monday's event, Musk had written: "Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight &amp; tomorrow in advance of the conversation." X did not respond to requests for details or evidence of the alleged cyberattack.</p>

<p>Musk spent much of the early part of the interview lauding Trump for his bravery during the attempt on his life on July 13, when his ear was struck by a bullet.</p>

<p>Musk, the world's richest person, announced his support for Trump shortly after the shooting. He backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since.</p>

<p>Trump said he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the attack, for a rally in October.</p>

<p>As the conversation unfolded, Trump delivered his usual mix of grievances, exaggerated claims and personal attacks, with Musk offering occasional encouragement.</p>

<p>Trump claimed without evidence that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - all authoritarian strongmen - as at the "top of their game."</p>

<p>He also expressed anger that Vice President Kamala Harris had been swapped in for Biden on the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>"She hasn't done an interview since this whole scam started," Trump said, claiming falsely that Biden dropping off the ticket was a "coup." Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election, but is now trailing Harris in some of the same states.</p>

<p>In an interview that was light on policy detail, Trump also appeared to praise Musk for firing workers.</p>

<p>"You're the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: 'You want to quit?' They go on strike - I won't mention the name of the company - but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's okay, you're all gone.'"</p>

<h3><strong>TRUMP BACK ON X</strong></h3>

<p>The interview provided an opportunity for Trump to seize the limelight at a time when his campaign is facing new headwinds.</p>

<p>Harris has erased Trump's lead in opinion polls and energized Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies since she replaced Biden as the party's candidate three weeks ago. Her momentum could get another boost from the Democratic National Convention next week in Chicago.</p>

<p>Trump returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a series of posts on Monday for the first time in a year, reviving an account that had served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and his four years in the White House, including his followers' Jan. 6 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6 attack, citing concerns he would incite violence.</p>

<p>Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was launched in February 2022, but his posts there reach a much smaller audience than on X.</p>

<h3><strong>MUSK BACKS TRUMP</strong></h3>

<p>Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, has echoed Trump's false claims about voter fraud and Biden's immigration policies.</p>

<p>Musk has started an external super PAC spending group to support Trump's campaign. The political action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on gathering voter information.</p>

<p>Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears after Musk's endorsement.</p>

<p>"I'm for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice," Trump said at an early August rally.</p>

<p>United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of Harris, called Trump a "sellout."</p>

<p>The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.</p>

<p>Republicans in Congress, including Trump's running mate Senator JD Vance, have opposed those subsidies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump ran through his checklist of conspiracy theories Monday in a rambling conversation with his uber-wealthy supporter Elon Musk that was initially derailed by what the tech titan said was a technical glitch.</p>

<p>In a very one-sided conversation on X, Trump vented about a "zombie apocalypse" of immigration, repeatedly blasted President Joe Biden as "stupid" and mused on developing a new missile defense system based on the one that defends Israel.</p>

<p>The Republican standard-bearer also dismissed climate change, whose sea-level rises he said would simply create more real estate opportunities.</p>

<p>"The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years," he told Musk.</p>

<p>"You'll have more ocean front property, right? The biggest threat is not that. The biggest threat is nuclear warming, because we have five countries now that have significant nuclear power, and we have to not allow anything to happen with stupid people like Biden."</p>

<p>What was billed as a "no limits" conversation between the two billionaires started more than half an hour late, with many of those logging on unable to listen in live.</p>

<p>Musk, the world's richest man according to Forbes, claimed the platform formerly known as Twitter had experienced a cyber "attack."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Border 'apocalypse'</strong></h3>

<p>The conversation was intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign, which has flagged since Biden dropped out of the race, to be replaced by a surging Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The young men who view Musk as a hero are a prized target for Trump, whose following tends to skew older.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>

<p>The apparent technical difficulties come after Musk fired swathes of staff at the platform, and also served as an uncomfortable reminder that the Tesla boss had once backed Trump's rival Ron DeSantis, whose campaign launch on the platform was also beset by problems.</p>

<p>When things finally got under way, Musk said the "massive attack illustrates there's a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say."</p>

<p>Trump was banned from Twitter after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, but Musk reinstated him when he took the platform over and renamed it.</p>

<p>The South African-born billionaire has emerged as a major voice in US politics, but is accused of turning X into a megaphone for right-wing conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>He is one of the Democrats' fiercest critics, leveraging his 194 million-strong following on X to assail liberal efforts to boost diversity and inclusion -- what he calls the "woke mind virus" -- and the White House's handling of the southern border.</p>

<p>"We have people streaming over," Musk told Trump, likening the border to the "zombie apocalypse" depicted in the film "World War Z."</p>

<p>"It's just not possible for the United States to absorb, you know, everyone from Earth," said Musk, identifying himself as a "legal immigrant."</p>

<h3><strong>Cost 'cutter'</strong></h3>

<p>In his "chat" with Musk, Trump returned often to a favorite theme -- boasting about his relationship with autocrats like Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, and insisted America would be safer under his stewardship.</p>

<p>"One of the things we're going to do is we're going to build an Iron Dome," he said, referring to Israel's missile defense system.</p>

<p>"We're going to have the best Iron Dome in the world... because it just takes one maniac to, you know, start something."</p>

<p>Musk reiterated his strong support for Trump, saying the ex-president "was the path to prosperity and Kamala is the opposite."</p>

<p>At one point he also appeared to be touting for a job under a future Trump administration, suggesting he would like to serve on a cost-cutting committee.</p>

<p>"I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at these things and and just ensures that taxpayer money... is spent in a good way," he said. "I'd be happy to help out on such a commission."</p>

<p>Trump appeared sold on the job application.</p>

<p>"You're the greatest cutter," he told the man who slashed swathes of staff months after taking over Twitter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-interviews-donald-trump-on-x-6323844">recalled the moment</a> he was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania last month and narrated the events that followed, during a live conversation with X owner Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Trump, who survived the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-live-updates-x-owner-to-interview-republican-2024-us-elections-presidential-candidate-6324927">assassination bid</a> but was left with a bloodied ear, said he's "more of a believer" now.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that it was a bullet. I knew immediately that it was at the ear...," he said as over a million listeners joined to listen to the 78-year-old former president.</p>

<p>"For those people that don't believe in God, I think we all have to start thinking about that," he added.</p>

<p>He also pointed out that he turned his head at the "perfect angle", which saved his life.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm a believer. Now I'm more of a believer, I think. And a lot of people have said that to me. A lot of great people have said that to me, actually. But it was, it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle," the Republican presidential candidate said.</p>

<p>The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, wounded two rally-goers and killed another before he was shot dead by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's much-trailed interview with Donald Trump got off to a rocky start this morning after what the tech entrepreneur said was a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-is-ddos-attack-flagged-by-elon-musk-that-hit-donald-trump-interview-6324982">cyberattack</a> on his microblogging platform.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down," Musk, the world's richest man, wrote earlier on the platform, formerly known as Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump today praised Russia, China and North Korea heads saying that they are at the top of their game and the US needs a strong president to tackle them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(Vladimir) Putin, Xi (Jinping), Kim Jong Un are at the top of their game," Trump said during an interview with Elon Musk being streamed on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>He said that these leaders, who are often referred to as dictators, love their country, but "it is a different form of love".</p>

<p>Referring to Biden as "sleepy Joe", Trump also claimed Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if it hadn't been for Biden.</p>

<p>"I got along with Putin very well, and he respected me. We would talk about Ukraine. It was the apple of his eye. But I told him don't do it," he claimed.</p>

<p>The interview began more than 40 minutes after the scheduled start time due to tech glitches. Musk blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, a type of cyber attack in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was not confirmed.</p>

<p>The conversation is intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign, which has flagged since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump amplified a wave of false social media claims that his opponent Kamala Harris used artificial intelligence to fabricate a picture of her supporters at a Michigan rally last week -- an allegation disproved by photos and videos.</p>

<p>"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN'T EXIST!" the Republican presidential nominee wrote in the first of a series of posts Sunday on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>"There was nobody there!" he added in a second post.</p>

<p>Live footage and photos from numerous media outlets, including AFP, showed the crowd of supporters, who packed an airfield hangar and spilled onto the tarmac to see Harris and her freshly announced running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>The photo appeared to have been first posted by a Harris campaign official who received it from another staffer.</p>

<p>"This is an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan," the campaign's official rapid response page wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>The campaign shared an original copy of the image -- which appears dimmer than the high-exposure version available online and highlighted by Trump -- with the BBC, telling the British broadcaster that it was "not modified by AI in any way."</p>

<p>Drexel University digital forensic expert Matthew Stamm analyzed the image for AFP and said his specialized software "did not find any evidence that the image was generated by AI."</p>

<p>The University of California-Berkeley's Hany Farid also told AFP two models designed to identify traces of AI uncovered no evidence the technology was used in the image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The false claim circulated on right-wing and conspiratorial social media circles before reaching Trump, who shared a post from conservative commentator Chuck Callesto focusing on the lack of a reflection of the crowd on the side of the plane.</p>

<p>Experts said the crowd was likely not directly mirrored because of the distance between the aircraft and the audience and the angle of the reflection.</p>

<p>"The reflection on the hull of the plane and the engine will show the ground immediately in front of the plane," Stamm told AFP.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk said Monday his much-trailed interview with Donald Trump had been derailed by a cyber attack on his social media platform.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down," the world's richest man wrote on the platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>

<p>Trump was banned from Twitter after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, but Musk reinstated him when he took the platform over and renamed it.</p>

<p>The two men's conversation on Monday was intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign, which has flagged since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>Its apparent failure will be an embarrassment to both men.</p>

<p>"We tested the system with 8 million concurrent listeners earlier today," Musk wrote, pledging to host the live conversation with a limited number of listeners and post "the unedited audio" later.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has flagged a "massive DDOS attack" on X that disrupted the airing of his interview with former Donald Trump. Musk was set to interview Trump this morning, marking his return to the microblogging platform ahead of the US Presidential elections due in November.</p>

<p>In the worst case, the Tesla chief said, the platform would allow only a small number of live listeners and later post the conversation online.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later," the Tesla chief said in a post as the interview missed its scheduled timing.</p>

<p>What is DDOS attack?</p>

<p>DDOS attack stands for "Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack" that is disrupts a targeted server or network's normal traffic by flooding the target or its surrounding infrastructure with internet traffic.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity firm Fortinet has termed it a cybercrime.</p>

<p>"DDoS Attack means 'Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack' and it is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites," according to the firm.</p>

<p>DDoS attacks use multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic and the exploited machines could include computers and other networked resources, reads an explainer by IT service management firm Cloudfare.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 47,000 people died in Europe due to scorching temperatures in 2023, with countries in the region's south hit the hardest, according to a report by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) published on Monday.</p>

<p>Last year was the world's hottest on record. As climate change continues to increase temperatures, Europeans live in the world's fastest-warming continent, facing growing health risks stemming from intense heat.</p>

<p>The 2023 death count - below the more than 60,000 heat-related deaths estimated for the previous year - would have been 80% higher without measures introduced in the past 20 years to help people adapt to rising temperatures, such as early warning systems and healthcare improvements, according to the report by the Spanish research centre.</p>

<p>"Our results show how there have been societal adaptation processes to high temperatures during the present century, which have dramatically reduced the heat-related vulnerability and mortality burden of recent summers, especially among the elderly," said Elisa Gallo, researcher at ISGlobal and lead author of the study.</p>

<p>Researchers used death and temperature records from 35 European countries. They estimate that 47,690 died from causes related to high temperatures.</p>

<p>Adjusting the data for population, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain were the countries with the highest mortality rates related to heat.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is being interviewed on X by its billionaire owner Elon Musk -- an influential supporter -- as the Republican ex-president rejoins the platform following a lengthy absence. But most users are unable to tune in and are getting an error message on X.</p>

<p>Musk, acknowledged the issue, said ,"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later."</p>

<p>The interview, scheduled to take place on Twitter Spaces, has been plagued by technical glitches, with over 25,000 tweets using the hashtag "#crashed". While some users are criticizing the platform, others, including Trump supporters, are boasting that the interview has "crashed" the internet.</p>

<p>This development despite Musk announcing system scaling tests to prepare for the high-profile conversation. Despite these efforts, the platform has struggled to handle the traffic.</p>

<p>Trump, who was banned from Twitter after the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, recently rejoined the platform.</p>

<p>The snafu recalled a similar event in May 2023, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the platform.</p>

<p>The hour-long broadcast lost sound for extended stretches, and thousands of users were either unable to join or were dropped. DeSantis ultimately lost the nomination to Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The event, which was scheduled to begin at 5:30 AM IST,&nbsp;was delayed by more than 40 minutes due to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-is-ddos-attack-flagged-by-elon-musk-that-hit-donald-trump-interview-6324982#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">DDOS attack</a>, a type of cyberattack.</p>

<p>During the chat, which went on for over two hours, the two spoke in length about the assassination attempt on Trump last month. Their conversation also saw the Republican nominee attacking his Democratic rival Kamala Harris for the 2024 US presidential elections.</p>

<p>The interview,&nbsp;which was joined by more than 1.3 million users, was an opportunity for&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-on-vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-they-love-their-country-it-is-different-form-of-love-6325112#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Trump</a>&nbsp;to seize the limelight at a time when <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-shares-false-claim-that-kamala-harris-campaign-doctored-photo-6325111">Kamala Harris</a>&nbsp;has erased his lead in opinion polls, just weeks after she replaced Joe Biden in the race to the White House.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, during an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-on-vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-they-love-their-country-it-is-different-form-of-love-6325112">interview with Elon Musk on X</a> today, boasted that Joe Biden being forced to drop out of the US Presidential race was a "coup".</p>

<p>"I beat Biden so bad in the debate, he was forced out of the race - one of the greatest debate performances ever. Biden's exit, it was a coup." the 78-year-old said.</p>

<p>Musk doubled down on this claim by the former US President saying, ""They basically took him behind a shed and shot him."</p>

<p>During the interview, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-interview-crashed-unable-to-fetch-spaces-trend-on-x-as-musk-interviews-trump-6324955">Donald Trump</a> also recalled the assassination attempt last month where the Republican candidate narrowly survived, describing it as a 'hard hit'.</p>

<p>"It was a hard hit. It was very, I guess you would say, surreal, but it wasn't surreal. You know, I was telling somebody, you have instances like this... where you feel it's a surreal situation. And I never felt that way," Trump said of the moment when he said the bullet hit his ear..</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that it was a bullet. I knew immediately that it was at the ear... For those people that don't believe in God, I think we all have to start thinking about that," he added.</p>

<p>The interview got off to an eventful start as it was hit by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-is-ddos-attack-flagged-by-elon-musk-that-hit-donald-trump-interview-6324982">major tech issues</a> even before it could start, forcing the billionaire entrepreneur to run the interview only for a small number of users as several others were unable to tune in.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/PLHekD9jzW">https://t.co/PLHekD9jzW</a></p>
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823144316014911820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>More than 1 million people were listening as the conversation started, according to a counter on X.</p>

<p>"Congratulations on breaking every record in the book," Trump said, an apparent reference to the number of people who tried to tune into their conversation.</p>

<p>The interview was intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign as his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has jumped ahead in opinion polls and energised Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies. The Trump campaign has called it the "interview of the century".</p>

<p>"This is unscripted with no limits on subject matter, so should be highly entertaining!" 53-year-old Musk, who has an estimated net worth of $235 billion, posted in a preview of the interview on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trump's access to his X account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk taking ownership of the company. The account had been suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress by his supporters.Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social social media platform, which was launched in February 2022.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, posted on X for the first time on Monday in more than a year ahead of the interview, sharing a campaign video in which he portrayed himself as the victim of persecution by forces seeking to "destroy" the United States.</p>

<p>Musk, one of the Democrats' fiercest critics, endorsed Trump last month just minutes after the Republican narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a rally.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has rejected the allegations of the government's involvement in the Bangladesh crisis, including the protests in the country that led to the deaths of hundreds of people.</p>

<p>Refuting all the reports and rumours, the White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean Pierre, said in a media briefing on Monday (local time), "So, we have had no involvement at all. Any, reports or rumours that the United States government was involved in these, in these events is simply, simply false. That is not true."</p>

<p>Jean Pierre further stated that Bangladeshi people should determine the future of the Bangladeshi government.</p>

<p>"This is a choice for and by the Bangladeshi people. We believe that the Bangladeshi people should determine the future of the Bangladeshi government, and that's where we stand. Any allegations, certainly we will continue to say, and what I have said here is simply untrue," Jean Pierre said.</p>

<p>Recently, in an interview with ANI, Michael Kugelman, a US-based Foreign Policy expert, and Director of the South Asia Institute at The Wilson Center, refuted allegations of foreign interference behind the mass uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, stating he had not seen any "plausible evidence" to support these claims.</p>

<p>He noted that the Hasina government's harsh crackdown on protesters escalated the movement. "My view has been very simple. I see this as a crisis that was driven by purely internal factors, by students who were unhappy about a particular issue, job quotas that they didn't like and they were worried about the government. Sheikh Hasina's government cracked down very hard on the students and that then turned the movement into something much bigger. And this was simply driven by internal factors," Kugelman said.</p>

<p>Kugelman dismissed allegations from Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who claimed foreign interference behind the protests, saying that the unrest was driven by "internal factors."</p>

<p>"Now, you know, when there is a conspiracy theory that is rooted in issues of foreign influence, one cannot disprove such type of allegation. Also, at the same time, one cannot conclusively prove it. I think the onus, is the responsibility to provide a plausible explanation for how it can be true. I am yet to hear that from Sheikh Hasina's son, from anyone," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, speaking on the protests outside the White House against the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, White House Press Secretary, Jean Pierre said that the US is going to continue monitoring the situation.</p>

<p>Jean Pierre said, "We are certainly going to continue monitoring the situation. I don't have anything else to say or to add beyond that."<br />
"When it comes to any type of human rights issue here, the President has been very consistent in speaking loud and clear in public and also privately and he will continue to do that. But, I don't have any specific engagement to speak to at this time," she added.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is experiencing a fluid political situation, with Sheikh Hasina resigning from the post of Prime Minister on August 5 amid mounting protests. The protests, led mainly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations.</p>

<p>A large number of people protested outside the White House in Washington on Friday last week against alleged violence targeting minority Hindus and others in Bangladesh since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>Protesters carried American and Bangladeshi flags and held posters demanding that Bangladeshi minorities be "saved." They chanted slogans of "We want justice" and called for peace amid the recent surge in violence.</p>

<p>The crowd, which included activists from various human rights organizations, members of the Bangladeshi diaspora and Indian-American Hindu allies, came from Washington, Maryland, Virginia, and New York.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called for the "safety and protection" of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh in a message on X on Thursday.</p>

<p>"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been fleeing to neighbouring India to escape the violence. Hindus, who make up about 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million population, have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which has faced backlash following violent clashes between anti-quota protesters and security forces last month.</p>

<p>Several US leaders, including Republican Congressman Pat Fallon and Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, have also spoken out against the alleged violence in Bangladesh.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas representatives will go to Cairo on Saturday for talks on a possible ceasefire in Gaza, an official in the Palestinian militant group told AFP on Friday.</p>

<p>"A Hamas delegation will go to Cairo tomorrow for several meetings with Egyptian officials to discuss ideas for a ceasefire and a prisoner accord in the Gaza Strip," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p>

<p>The announcement came two days after a ceasefire went into effect between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.</p>

<p>The United States has also announced a new diplomatic effort with Qatar, Turkey and Egypt to reach a Gaza ceasefire and the release of hostages taken during Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that set off the current fighting.</p>

<p>That attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed 44,363 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry, which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>Some 251 hostages were also taken on October 7, and 97 are believed still in Gaza, including 34 people who the Israeli army says are dead.</p>

<p>The only ceasefire so far, in November 2023, saw the release of about 100 hostages by Hamas and its allies in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt have led multiple failed efforts since the start of the year to reach a new ceasefire and hostage release.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A dangerous weather phenomenon called a bomb cyclone that occurs in mid-latitudes - between Earth's tropics and the polar regions - can bring strong and damaging winds, torrential rains, heavy snowfall, flooding and frigid temperatures.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>WHAT IS A BOMB CYCLONE?</strong></big> A bomb cyclone, also referred to as explosive cyclogenesis or bombogenesis, is a mid-latitude cyclone that has rapidly intensified. A cyclone is a low-pressure weather system - one where the atmospheric pressure is lower at its center than in surrounding areas - with winds rotating inward. It circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere. A bomb cyclone's winds can reach hurricane force - 74 miles (119 km) per hour - and stronger. These storms tend to form during winter and can spawn copious amounts of precipitation. They have life spans of about a week during which they grow to peak intensity over roughly four to five days and then dissipate over the last two, according to Jon Martin, a professor of meteorology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>HOW DOES A BOMB CYCLONE FORM? </strong></big>Bomb cyclones form when the conditions at the surface and at the jet stream level are ideal for the storm to intensify. The jet stream is a narrow band of strong winds in the upper atmosphere. A variety of atmospheric processes combine to produce these storms. Almost all bomb cyclones have a precursor disturbance in the winds in the middle part of the troposphere - the lowest region of Earth's atmosphere - about 3-5 miles (5-8 km) above the planet's surface, Martin said. Another important feature common to many, but not all, explosive cyclogenesis events is a warm ocean surface. Many of the most intense bomb cyclones form over oceans. Precipitation can be prodigious. When water vapor changes into liquid and ice, as it does in these storms, enormous amounts of energy - called latent heat energy - are released. Some of that energy further intensifies the storm. By virtue of the atmospheric pressure getting so low, differences in pressure across the storm can become very large, powering strong winds that can have devastating effects.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>WHEN AND WHERE ARE THEY MOST LIKELY TO FORM?</strong></big> Explosive cyclogenesis occurs mostly over oceans and most commonly during the cold season in both hemispheres - roughly November to March for the northern hemisphere and roughly May through August in the southern hemisphere, though these storms can be earlier or later than that. Areas particularly prone are situated in so-called storm tracks along the east coast of continents because this is where the warmest ocean currents exist, such as the Kuroshio off Japan and the Gulf Stream off North America, Martin said. Bomb cyclones can be very destructive and pose particular danger to shipping interests, since many of them occur over the oceans, according to John Knox, an atmospheric scientist and professor of geography at the University of Georgia. Some bomb cyclones have occurred on the Great Lakes of North America and caused shipwrecks there, too, Knox said.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE?</strong></big> The average sea-level atmospheric pressure at middle latitudes is about 1012 millibars, or mb. In cyclones, this gets down to as low as 980 mb with regularity. With bomb cyclones, it can drop to 950 mb or lower, and the rate at which they intensify is at least 24 mb in 24 hours.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>WHY CAN WE NOT CALL IT A HURRICANE?</strong></big> While bomb cyclones can unleash hurricane-force winds and sometimes display characteristics of a hurricane, they are not hurricanes. They form from different physical processes and do not have the symmetry of hurricanes, which also are low-pressure systems. Bomb cyclones occasionally develop "eyes" resembling those at the center of a hurricane, Knox said. But a bomb cyclone has its origins in the mid-latitudes and is associated with weather fronts - a boundary between two air masses with different characteristics such as temperature - and a strong jet stream, Knox said. A hurricane originates in the tropics and is not associated with either weather fronts or a strong jet stream, Knox said.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>ARE BOMB CYCLONES BECOMING MORE COMMON?</strong></big> Global climate change, according to experts, is causing more frequent and more extreme weather events around the world. But are bomb cyclones becoming more common or more intense? Martin said it is not clear whether that is the case. The fact that Earth is warming has ramifications for cyclone dynamics that scientists are currently trying to figure out, Martin said. A warmer planet means more water vapor in the air and that would tend to make at least the latent heat portion of the empowerment of these storms stronger, Martin said. However, the warming is not uniform, Martin said. Since observations suggest more warming at high latitudes, Martin said, this could render the bomb cyclones weaker in general.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Earlier this month, China declared new "baselines" around Scarborough Reef, a large coral atoll topped by a handful of rocks barely above sea level in the South China Sea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, China <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/web/ziliao_674904/1179_674909/202411/t20241110_11524120.shtml">declared</a> new “baselines” around Scarborough Reef, a large coral atoll topped by a handful of rocks barely above sea level in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>By doing so, China reaffirmed its sovereignty claim over what has become a global flashpoint in the disputed waters.</p>

<p>This was a pre-calculated response to the Philippines' <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-philippines-spar-over-new-maritime-laws-baseline-drawings-south-china-sea-2024-11-13/">enactment</a> of new maritime laws two days earlier that aimed to safeguard its own claims over the reef and other contested parts of the sea.</p>

<p>This legal tit-for-tat is a continuation of the ongoing sovereignty and maritime dispute between China and the Philippines (and others) in a vital ocean area through which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/global-trade-at-risk-as-tensions-escalate-in-south-china-sea-.html#:%7E:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20United%20Nations%20Conference,one%2Dthird%20of%20global%20shipping.">one-third</a> of global trade travels.</p>

<p>The Philippines rejected China's declaration as a violation of its “long-established sovereignty over the shoal”. Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro <a href="https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/transcripts/2024-11-12/press-conference-australia-philippines-defence-ministers-meeting">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we see is an increasing demand by Beijing for us to concede our sovereign rights in the area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the tensions continue to worsen over these claims, there is an ever-increasing risk of an at-sea conflict between the two countries.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the Scarborough Reef?</strong></h2>

<p>Scarborough Reef is called Huangyan Dao in Chinese and Bajo de Masinloc by the Philippines. It is located in the northeast of the South China Sea, about 116 nautical miles (215km) west of the Philippine island of Luzon and 448 nautical miles (830km) south of the Chinese mainland.</p>

<p>At high tide it is reduced to a few tiny islets, the tallest of which is just 3 metres above the water. However, at low tide, it is the largest coral atoll in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>China asserts sovereignty over all of the waters, islands, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, as well as unspecified “historic rights” within its claimed <a href="https://time.com/4412191/nine-dash-line-9-south-china-sea/">nine-dash line</a>. This includes Scarborough Reef.</p>

<p>In recent years, the reef has been the scene of repeated clashes between China and the Philippines. Since 2012, China has blocked Filipino fishing vessels from accessing the valuable lagoon here. This prompted the Philippines to take China to international arbitration under the <a href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (UNCLOS) in 2013.</p>

<p>Three years later, an arbitration tribunal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-hague-ruling-philippines.html">ruled</a> that China has no historic rights to maritime areas where this would conflict with UNCLOS. The tribunal also <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/ar/cases/7/">concluded</a> China had “unlawfully prevented Filipino fishermen from engaging in traditional fishing at Scarborough Shoal.”</p>

<p>China <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/zy/gb/202405/t20240531_11367334.html">refused</a> to participate in the arbitration case and has strongly rejected its ruling as being “null and void” and having “no binding force”.</p>

<h2><strong>What did China do this month?</strong></h2>

<p>China declared the exact location of the base points of its territorial claim around Scarborough Reef with geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude), joined up by straight lines.</p>

<figcaption><small><em><span class="caption">China's new baselines claims at the Scarborough Reef.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Author provided</span></span></em></small></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The declaration of so-called “baselines” is standard practice for countries that want to claim maritime zones along their coasts. Baselines provide the starting point for measuring these zones.</p>

<p>A country's “territorial sea” is measured from this baseline outward to as far as 12 nautical miles (22km). Under the UNCLOS treaty, a country then has full sovereignty rights over this zone, covering the seabed, water, airspace and any resources located there.</p>

<p>Countries want their baselines to be as far out to sea as possible so they can maximise the ocean areas over which they can reap economic benefits and enforce their own laws.</p>

<p>China is no exception. Along with other countries (especially in Asia), it draws the most generous baselines of all – straight baselines. These can connect distant headlands or other coastal outcrops with a simple straight line, or even enclose nearshore islands.</p>

<p>China is especially fond of straight baselines. In 1996, it drew them along most of its mainland coast and around the Paracel Islands, a disputed archipelago in the South China Sea. China <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/zyxw/202403/t20240301_11252543.shtml">defined</a> additional straight baselines this March in the Gulf of Tonkin up to its land border with Vietnam.</p>

<p>China says these actions comply with UNCLOS. However, its use of straight baselines around Scarborough Reef conflicts with international law. This is because UNCLOS provides a specific rule for baselines around reefs, which China did not follow.</p>

<p>Based on our review of satellite imagery, however, China has only advanced the outer limit of its territorial sea by a few hundred metres in two directions. This is because its straight baselines largely hug the edge of the reef.</p>

<p>These new baselines around Scarborough Reef are therefore fairly conservative and enclose a dramatically smaller area than the <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LIS150-SCS.pdf">US had feared</a>.</p>

<p>China's declaration signals that it may have abandoned its much larger “offshore archipelago” claim to what it calls the Zhongsha Islands.</p>

<p>China has long asserted that Scarborough Reef is part of this larger island group, which includes the Macclesfield Bank, a totally underwater feature 180 nautical miles (333 km) to the west. This led to concern that Beijing might draw a baseline around this entire island group, claiming all the waters within exclusively for its use.</p>

<p>The South China Sea arbitration tribunal ruled that international law prohibits such claims. There will be a collective sigh of relief among many countries that China decided to make a much smaller claim over Scarborough Reef.</p>

<h2><strong>Significance and future steps?</strong></h2>

<p>However, China's clarification of its baselines around the reef signals it may be more assertive in its law enforcement here.</p>

<p>The China Coast Guard has <a href="http://www.mod.gov.cn/gfbw/qwfb/16350812.html">said</a> it will step up patrols in the South China Sea to “firmly uphold order, protect the local ecosystem and biological resources and safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights”.</p>

<p>Given the long history of clashes related to fishing access around Scarborough Reef, this sets the scene for more confrontation.</p>

<p>And what about the biggest prize of all in the South China Sea – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spratly_Islands_dispute">Spratly Islands</a>?</p>

<p>We can now expect China will continue its long straight baselines march to this island group to the south. The Spratlys are an archipelago of more than 150 small islands, reefs and atolls spread out over around 240,000 square kilometres of lucrative fishing grounds. They are claimed by China, as well as the Philippines and several other countries.</p>

<p>These countries can be expected to protest any attempted encirclement of the Spratly Islands by new Chinese baselines.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Italian Senate recently passed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/italy-makes-it-to-seek-surrogacy-treatment-abroad">law</a> making surrogacy a “universal crime”. In a country where surrogacy is already illegal, and has been since 2004, this decision takes restrictions to a whole new level.</p>

<p>While Italian law already prohibited surrogacy within Italy, the new ban will make it a crime for Italians to access surrogacy abroad – even in countries where the practice is legal.</p>

<p>The use of the term <a href="https://lespresso.it/c/archivio/2024/10/17/la-maternita-surrogata-diventa-reato-universale/52140">“universal crime”</a> (<em>reato universale</em>) to describe the ban has raised further concern. The language evokes the wording of the Italian criminal code for crimes considered so serious that they contravene <a href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n22/430/65/pdf/n2243065.pdf?OpenElement&amp;_gl=1*i8r4gu*_ga*MTgxMjI0MjE2Mi4xNzI4MTQzMzQx*_ga_TK9BQL5X7Z*MTczMDY1ODI1MS42LjAuMTczMDY1ODI1MS4wLjAuMA..">“universal values”</a>. The wording therefore puts surrogacy on a par with genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>Countries are not aligned on whether surrogacy should be allowed or prohibited. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/which-countries-allow-commercial-surrogacy-2023-04-05/">Several allow it</a>, albeit with different restrictions and safeguards. In Greece, non-commercial surrogacy has been legal <a href="https://www.lawspot.gr/nomikes-plirofories/nomothesia/n-3089-2002/arthro-deytero-nomos-3089-2002">since 2002</a>, allowing the intended parents to have legal parenthood at birth. In California, even so-called commercial surrogacy – where the surrogate receives compensation – <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;division=12.&amp;title=&amp;part=7.&amp;chapter=&amp;article">is allowed</a>.</p>

<p>Other countries, including France and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2999773">Germany</a>, prohibit surrogacy. This means that the surrogate is the legal mother when the child is born. But they still typically allow the intended parents to establish a legal bond with the child by other means, for example by giving legal recognition to the genetic father alongside the surrogate mother or to both parents via adoption, in cases where surrogacy has been sought abroad.</p>

<p>In the UK, the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2024.2344935">surrogate</a> is the legal parent at birth but courts can transfer parenthood to the intended parents through a <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/22/part/2/crossheading/parental-orders">parental order</a>, a surrogacy-specific mechanism designed to be less burdensome than adoption.</p>

<p>Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni called the new surrogacy ban <a href="https://x.com/GiorgiaMeloni/status/1846614492421279808">“common sense”</a> and celebrated it as protecting women and children from “commodification”. Others see the ban as the opposite of protecting women and children.</p>

<h2>International rulings</h2>

<p>The European Court of Human Rights often examines events in its member countries (which include Italy) to determine whether there is broader consensus on an issue. In 2014 it looked into surrogacy in its <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#%7B%2522sort%2522:%5B%2522kpdate%2520Descending%2522%5D,%2522itemid%2522:%5B%2522001-145389%2522%5D%7D">Mennesson v France</a> judgment. And in <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#%7B%2522sort%2522:%5B%2522kpdate%2520Descending%2522%5D,%2522itemid%2522:%5B%2522003-6380464-8364383%2522%5D%7D">2019</a> it issued an advisory opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>While it found no consensus on the lawfulness of surrogacy arrangements, it decided that the rights of children born through surrogacy require “a possibility of recognition of a legal parent-child relationship”. Italy's absolute ban goes against this reasoning.</p>

<p>In 2019, the British supreme court also invoked the <a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/14.html">child's welfare</a> as the main driver for judges to recognise intended parents as legal parents. To do otherwise in most cases, it concluded, risks leaving the child “legally parentless (and possibly also stateless)” – because they would be legally tied to a person living abroad and who did not intend to be their parent.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/lawfam/article/36/1/ebac030/6917125">UK study</a> found that most surrogates don't view themselves as the mother and would support recognising intended parents as legal parents from birth.</p>

<p>Meloni's government, led by the far-right Brothers of Italy, has consistently focused on policies that promote what it sees as a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/07/21/italy-no-country-for-non-traditional-families">“traditional” form of family</a>. Running on a platform focused on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/17/giorgia-meloni-brothers-of-italy-leader-far-right-elections-alliance-">fascist motto</a> of “God, family, fatherland”, Meloni's government has been open about its anti-LGBTQ+ stance.</p>

<p>Banning surrogacy was in the <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2022/09/28/lgbtq-and-womens-rights-advocates-worried-after-melonis-win-in-italy">party's manifesto</a>, along with policies against same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption. During the debate in the Senate, a Brothers of Italy senator called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/italy-makes-it-to-seek-surrogacy-treatment-abroad">motherhood</a> “the foundation of our civilisation”. Meloni's policies, from banning surrogacy to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/italy-abortion-meloni-de7f4d2af81cf94ecf1d8cde5802fcec">restrictions on abortion</a>, curtail reproductive choice – ideologically driven by an emphasis on “natural” motherhood.</p>

<p>While it is mostly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62rmv63069o">straight Italian couples</a> who use surrogacy by going abroad, many of them will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/25/inhumane-wicked-surrogacy-italians-angry-ban">hide the fact</a> that they had a child this way. Same-sex couples are even more restricted since they obviously cannot fly under the radar in the same way. Under Italian law, they also have no other choices for having a child together: they are banned from accessing IVF or adopting.</p>

<p>While legal scholars and activists <a href="https://lespresso.it/c/politica/2024/6/21/maternita-surrogata-la-lega-raddoppia-chiesti-10-anni-di-carcere-2-milioni-di-multa-e-punibilita-per-chi-registra-i-bambini/51325">question</a> whether the law can hold up to legal scrutiny or how it will be applied in practice, same-sex parents express <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66860266">fear</a> that they are faced with two impossible options: leave their country indefinitely, or stay in Italy and face prison time. Under the new law, they face up to two years in prison and a fine of up to €1 million (£836,000).</p>

<p>Italy's surrogacy ban is perhaps no surprise in an era of populist politics, where LGBTQ+ and women's rights are increasingly weaponised, but it should still worry us.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Hindu temples were vandalised by a slogan-shouting mob on Friday in Bangladesh's Chattogram which has witnessed protests and violence since a former ISKCON member was booked under sedition charges.</p>

<p>The attack took place around 2:30 pm in the port city's Harish Chandra Munsef Lane, where the Shantaneshwari Matri Temple, the nearby Shoni Temple, and the Shantaneshwari Kalibari Temple were targeted, news portal BDNews24.com reported.</p>

<p>"A group of several hundred slogan-shouting people threw brickbats at the temples, damaging the Shoni Temple and the gates of the other two temples," the news portal quoted temple authorities as saying.</p>

<p>Kotwali Police Station chief Abdul Karim confirmed the attack, saying that assailants attempted to damage the temples.</p>

<p>Police, however, said the damage to the temples was minimal after the confrontation between the two sides, with both groups throwing brickbats at each other, it added.</p>

<p>Tapan Das, a permanent member of the Shantineshwari Main Temple management committee, told bdnews24.com: "A procession of hundreds arrived after the Juma prayers. They started shouting anti-Hindu and anti-ISKCON slogans." "We did not obstruct the attackers. When the situation worsened, we called the army, who arrived quickly and helped restore order. All the temple gates were closed before noon. The miscreants arrived unprovoked and carried out the attack," BDNews24.com said further quoting him.</p>

<p>Spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former member of International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) of Bangladesh, was arrested in connection with a sedition case on Monday and denied bail on Tuesday.</p>

<p>It triggered protests by Hindu community members in various locations in Bangladesh, including in the capital Dhaka and Chattogram.</p>

<p>On October 30, a sedition case was filed against 19 people, including Das, at Chattogram's Kotwali Police Station, accusing them of disrespecting Bangladesh's national flag in Chattogram's New Market area during a rally of the Hindu community.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, New Delhi expressed concern over the leader's arrest and denial of bail, and asked Bangladesh to ensure the safety of Hindus and other minorities.</p>

<p>The week's anti-Hindu incidents have led to a diplomatic row between the two South Asian neighbours.</p>

<p>India on Friday said the interim government in Bangladesh must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities as it expressed serious concern over the "surge" of extremist rhetoric and increasing incidents of violence against Hindus as well as attacks on temples.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told Parliament that India has taken serious note of incidents of violence against minorities in Bangladesh and that it is the primary responsibility of Dhaka to protect the life and liberty of all the citizens, including minorities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bangladesh on Friday expressed deep concern over the violent protest at the Deputy High Commission in Kolkata and urged New Delhi to ensure the safety of all its diplomatic missions in India.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Tell a man he shouldn't think of a pink elephant and he can't get that beast out of his mind!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This <a href="https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/City_in_the_Sky/GvRQAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=pink%20elephant&amp;dq=city%20in%20the%20sky&amp;printsec=frontcover">quote</a>, from Curt Siodmak's 1974 novel City in the Sky, describes how hard it can be to suppress our thoughts. “Don't think of a pink elephant” has become a classic example of how difficult it can be to intentionally avoid visualising.</p>

<p>Research <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.53.1.5">suggests</a> many of you, having read about a pink elephant, will have imagined seeing one.</p>

<p>However, some people, like us, have aphantasia – we cannot visualise. So we are a little confused at the idea other people can imagine seeing things that aren't there.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2024.10.020">new study</a>, we have found evidence the pink elephant problem is not universal. Some people – including people with aphantasia – can block involuntary visual thoughts from their minds.</p>

<h2>What is aphantasia?</h2>

<p>People with aphantasia cannot voluntarily imagine seeing things in our mind's eye. So if you ask us not to think about a pink elephant, we won't visualise one, because we can't.</p>

<p>Aphantasia is typically described as a deficit. When people first learn they have aphantasia they are often upset, as they realise other people can do things they cannot. It might be nice to imagine seeing the characters described in a book, for example, or to visualise an absent loved one.</p>

</figure>

<p>However, deficits are often balanced by benefits. There are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.0267?">suggestions</a> people with aphantasia (or aphantasics, as we're sometimes called) may have a heightened resistance to involuntary intrusive thoughts.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it is that aphantasics are one portion of a natural diversity of human minds, with people having different capacities to visualise. Where aphantasics have no capacity, most people would have an average ability, and a small number of people would have an extremely strong ability to visualise.</p>

<h2>Vivid mental imagery and involuntary visualisations</h2>

<p>In our new study, we looked at links between the intensity of people's visual imaginations and their tendency to visualise, even when they try not to. People with vivid visual imaginations were more likely to have involuntary visualisations, and we could predict these outcomes by measuring brain activity.</p>

<p>Some people might enjoy being able to imagine seeing detailed scenes whenever they wish. However, this seems to come at the cost of not being able to shut down these experiences.</p>

<p>Most people have less vibrant imagery, but they seem to be more able to suppress these thoughts.</p>

<h2>Do aphantasics have peaceful minds?</h2>

<p>Aphantasics are unlikely to have involuntary visualisations. Does that mean they have peaceful minds?</p>

<p>In our study people who reported having weak imagery were less likely to imagine seeing things they were trying not to think about. However, they were more likely to report mind-wandering.</p>

<p>If this describes aphantasics, instead of visualising things we are told not to think about, we may turn our minds to other thoughts, such as what's for dinner. So we would not have more peaceful minds, just a resistance to think about things we are trying to put out of mind.</p>

<h2>If aphantasics do not visualise, do they have daydreams?</h2>

<p>From our own experience, we can confirm at least some aphantasics have minds that wander. But when our minds wander, neither of us imagines seeing things. Our experiences are different.</p>

<p>When Derek's mind wanders he imagines hearing and engaging in purely audio conversations. As daydreaming is typically associated with vision, he did not realise until very recently these imagined conversations could be described as his experience of daydreaming.</p>

<p>Loren cannot visualise <em>or</em> imagine hearing things. She experiences her thoughts as different sensations of texture and imagined feelings of movement – and these are what she experiences when her mind wanders.</p>

<h2>Are aphantasics resistant to trauma from re-living events?</h2>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p>While our evidence suggests aphantasics are resistant to involuntary visualisations, more research will be needed to work out if we are resistant to reliving traumas, or if these will simply trigger different types of imagined experience.</p>

<p>What is clear is that Siodmak was wrong. If you tell people they shouldn't think of a pink elephant, some of us will happily put that beast out of our minds, and turn our thoughts to other matters.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union's aviation authorities have lifted a four-year ban on Pakistan's beleaguered national airline that was at the centre of a pilot license scandal, officials said Friday.</p>

<p>Pakistan International Airlines was barred from flying to the EU in June 2020, a month after one of its aircraft plunged into a Karachi street, killing nearly 100 people.</p>

<p>The disaster was attributed to human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and was followed by allegations that nearly a third of the licences for its pilots were fake or dubious.</p>

<p>It remains banned from operating in the United States.</p>

<p>"EASA has lifted the suspension of the third country operator authorisation issued to Pakistan International Airlines," the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This marks the end of a long process initiated in 2020, based on factual and verifiable evidence that the ability of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) to certify and oversee its air operators had degraded below acceptable level."</p>

<p>It added that the EASA "has now re-established sufficient confidence in the PCAA oversight capabilities".</p>

<p>PIA, which employs 7,000 people, has long been accused of being bloated and poorly run -- hobbled by unpaid bills, a poor safety record and regulatory issues.</p>

<p>Pakistan's government has said it is committed to privatising the debt-ridden airline and has been scrambling to find a buyer.</p>

<p>Last month, a deal fell through after a potential buyer reportedly offered a fraction of the asking price.</p>

<p>In 2023 PIA made losses of $270 million according to local media. Its liabilities were nearly $3 billion, about five times the total worth of its assets.</p>

<p>Last year, dozens of flights were cancelled when it could not afford fuel for its planes.</p>

<p>Nadir Shafi Dar, the head of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, confirmed the ban had been lifted.</p>

<p>A PIA spokesperson meanwhile said the airline would "strictly adhere to EASA's regulations and guidelines".</p>

<p>"This milestone has been achieved after four years of relentless efforts by the PIA management," the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>PIA came into being in 1955 when the government nationalised a loss-making commercial airline, and enjoyed rapid growth until the 1990s.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several American universities have issued travel advisories for their international students as well as staff and urged them to return to the US before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in January next year amid concerns over travel bans that may be enacted by his administration.</p>

<p>Trump will take the oath of office on January 20 and has announced that he will sign several executive orders on issues of economy and immigration on his first day as the 47th President of the United States.</p>

<p>Amid concerns over the disruptions caused by travel bans during his first term as president, several top US universities are issuing travel advisories for their international students and faculty who may be travelling outside the country around Trump's inauguration.</p>

<p>According to data from the US Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and the Institute of International Education, India and China made up over half (54 per cent) of all international students in the United States.</p>

<p>But for the first time since 2009, India became the leading place of origin with 331,602 international students in the United States in 2023/2024, reflecting a 23 per cent increase from the prior year, surpassing China, according to data from the 'Open Doors 2024 Report on International Educational Exchange'.</p>

<p>China was the second leading place of origin, despite a 4 per cent decline to 277,398 students. It remained the top-sending country for undergraduates and non-degree students, sending 87,551 and 5,517, respectively.</p>

<p>Associate Dean and Director at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) International Students Office David Elwell in a post following the presidential elections said that with every election, "when there is a change in administration on the federal level there can be changes in policies, regulations, and legislation that impacts higher education as well as immigration and visa status matters".</p>

<p>Elwell urged students to assess their travel plans over the upcoming winter break, noting that new executive orders under Trump may impact travel and visa processing.</p>

<p>In addition, election transitions also impact staffing levels at US Embassies/Consulates abroad, which could impact entry visa processing times.</p>

<p>"Students who would need to apply for a new entry visa at the US Embassy/Consulate abroad to return to the US in their student status should assess the possibility of facing any extensive processing times and have a backup plan if they must travel abroad and wait for a new entry visa to be issued. Any processing delays could impact students' ability to return to the US as planned," Elwell said.</p>

<p>The Office of Global Affairs at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in an advisory recommended that its "international community-- including all international students, scholars, faculty and staff under UMass immigration sponsorship" strongly consider returning to the US before the presidential inauguration if they are planning on travelling internationally during the winter holiday break.</p>

<p>While noting that this was not a requirement or mandate from UMass, nor was it based on any current US government policy or recommendation, the university added that "given that a new presidential administration can enact new policies on their first day in office (January 20) and based on previous experience with travel bans that were enacted in the first Trump administration in 2017", the Office of Global Affairs is making this advisory out of an abundance of caution to hopefully prevent any possible travel disruption to members of our international community.</p>

<p>"We are not able to speculate on what a travel ban will look like if enacted, nor can we speculate on what particular countries or regions of the world may or may not be affected." The Wesleyan Argus, the college newspaper of Wesleyan University, said in a report that the university has been "evaluating the potential future impacts" of the Trump administration on international and undocumented students.</p>

<p>"Much uncertainty surrounds the possible changes to American immigration policy that could be enacted by the Trump administration beginning January 20, 2025." The report added that Wesleyan's Office of International Student Affairs (OISA) has been "concerned about sweeping policy changes" that could be implemented soon after Trump's inauguration.</p>

<p>"With the presidential inauguration happening on Monday, January 20, 2025, and uncertainties around President-elect Donald Trump's plans for immigration-related policy, the safest way to avoid difficulty re-entering the country is to be physically present in the US on January 19 and the days thereafter of the spring semester," an email sent on November 18 to international students studying under the F-1 visa read, according to the Wesleyan Argus report.</p>

<p>Within a week of his first term as president, Trump had in January 2017 signed an executive order banning nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - from entering the US for 90 days, causing massive disruptions among communities and outrage and concerns by civil rights organisations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gaza Strip has spiralled into chaos, with widespread hunger, looting, and violence, including rising cases of rape in shelters, as public order collapses, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palestinians are suffering on an unprecedented scale, with the situation in Gaza City being described as "horrendous" by Ajith Sunghay, head of the UN Human Rights Office in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>Sunghay said the Palestinians are distressed "on a scale that has to be seen to be truly grasped".</p>

<p>The breakdown of public order and safety has exacerbated the situation, with rampant looting and fighting over scarce resources. The UN has warned about the impending anarchy in Gaza, which is now a harsh reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The anarchy in Gaza we warned about months ago is here", Sunghay said. Young women, many of whom have been displaced multiple times, have highlighted the lack of safe spaces or privacy in their makeshift tents.</p>

<p>Cases of gender-based violence, rape, abuse of children, and other forms of violence within the community have increased in shelters, according to Sunghay. The situation is dire, with thousands of displaced people sheltering in inhumane conditions, facing severe food shortages and terrible sanitary conditions.</p>

<p>He said for the first time, he saw dozens of women and children now scavenging in giant landfills.</p>

<p>The UN is being blocked from delivering aid to the 70,000 people still living in northern Gaza, due to repeated impediments or rejections of humanitarian convoys by the Israeli authorities. The UN is calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages and those arbitrarily detained.</p>

<p>"And every effort must be made to urgently provide the full quantities of food, medicine and other vital assistance desperately needed in Gaza", UN Human Rights Office spokesman Jeremy Laurence said.</p>

<p>"The killing must end," he added.</p>

<p>The conflict has resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people in Israel, most of whom were civilians, and 44,363 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening by the day, with the UN urging for immediate action to address the crisis.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK member of Parliament Bob Blackman, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for British Hindus, has raised concerns in the House of Commons over the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>During a Parliament session on Thursday, the MP for Harrow East in north London condemned the persecution of minorities and the imprisonment of Hindu spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>He pointed out that Das is the spiritual leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), which runs the Bhaktivedanta Manor temple at Elstree in Watford, one of the UK's largest Hindu temples on the outskirts of London.</p>

<p>"[He] is under arrest in Bangladesh and Hindus across Bangladesh are being subjected to death, with their houses and temples being burnt," Blackman told MPs.</p>

<p>"There was today (Thursday) an attempt in Bangladesh's High Court to rule that ISKCON should be banned from the country, which is a direct attack on Hindus. There is now a threat from India to take action and we have a responsibility because we enabled Bangladesh to be free and independent," he said.</p>

<p>The Opposition Conservative Party MP stressed that it "cannot be acceptable that religious minorities are persecuted in this way" and called for freedom of religion to be preserved globally.</p>

<p>"We support freedom of religion or belief everywhere and that includes Bangladesh. I will certainly ask Foreign Office Ministers to look at coming forward with a statement about what is happening to Hindus in Bangladesh," said Lucy Powell in her response on behalf of the UK government as the Leader of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Blackman's intervention was welcomed by the diaspora group Friends of India Society International (FISI) UK which condemned the numerous attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, including "arson, looting, theft, vandalism, and desecration of temples and deities".</p>

<p>It follows a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement calling on Bangladesh authorities to ensure the "safety and security of Hindus and all minorities, including their right of freedom of peaceful assembly and expression".</p>

<p>The MEA statement said: "We have noted with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das, the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote spokesperson. This incident follows the multiple attacks on Hindus and other minorities by extremist elements in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"There are several documented cases of arson and looting of minorities' homes and business establishments as well as theft and vandalism and desecration of deities and temples. It is unfortunate that while the perpetrators of these incidents remain at large, charges should be pressed against a religious leader presenting legitimate demands through peaceful gatherings. We also note with concern the attacks on minorities protesting peacefully against the arrest of Shri Das."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's nuclear ambitions pose a major global security threat even after setbacks dealt to Hamas and Hezbollah, the UK's foreign intelligence chief said Friday.</p>

<p>"Iran's allied militias across the Middle East have suffered serious blows," Secret Intelligence Service chief Richard Moore said in a speech in Paris. "But the regime's nuclear ambitions continue to threaten all of us."</p>

<p>Moore added that "the Iranian regime maintains its efforts to eliminate dissidents at home and abroad".</p>

<p>Iran was to hold talks with Britain, France and Germany in Geneva on Friday over its nuclear programme, in the context of extreme tension in the Middle East between Iran and its allies, and Israel.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel would do "everything" to stop Tehran acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>The UN nuclear agency has confirmed that Iran plans to install around 6,000 new centrifuges to enrich uranium, according to a report seen by AFP Friday.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kyiv on Friday said Russian authorities returned over 500 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in combat, with most having died in the eastern Donetsk region.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been exchanging bodies and prisoners of war since the first months of the conflict -- with casualties estimated to be high on both sides.</p>

<p>"As a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 502 fallen defenders were returned to territory controlled by the government of Ukraine," Kyiv's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said on social media.</p>

<p>The centre said that 397 of the bodies were returned from the embattled Donetsk region, where fighting is most intense.</p>

<p>It said 24 were returned from the eastern Lugansk region and 64 from the southern Zaporizhzhia area, while 17 were handed back from morgues on Russian territory.</p>

<p>"We are grateful for the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross," Kyiv's centre said.</p>

<p>It said the bodies will be taken for forensic medical examination and that "together with the expert institutions, the deceased will be identified as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Russia, for its part, does not announce the return of its bodies.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have been nearly inseparable since the elections earlier this month and their bonhomie was once again at display, during a Thanksgiving dinner in Florida.</p>

<p>A viral video of the event shows Mr Musk sitting at a table with Mr Trump, incoming First Lady Melania Trump and their son Barron. As Mr Trump taps on Mr Musk's shoulder, the X boss raises his hand and grooves to the 'YMCA' song that can be heard in the background.</p>

<p>Trump then shifts his focus to Barron, encouraging him to join in. Barron, however, simply smiles but remains seated. The event was held at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.</p>

<p>"Hope you had a great Thanksgiving," Mr Musk wrote on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">??Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!?? <a href="https://t.co/CQMGaAODKq">https://t.co/CQMGaAODKq</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Musk, who owns X and rocket company SpaceX, and is chief executive of the electric car company Tesla Inc, also spent time with American actor Sylvester Stallone at the event.</p>

<p>"I was telling @TheSlyStallone that I just watched Demolition Man again and how well it predicted the crazy woke future 30 years ago!" Mr Musk wrote on X, referring to the movie that stars Stallone.</p>

<p>Mr Musk has been using his social media platform X to endorse Mr Trump's cabinet picks and promote his own-preferred candidates.</p>

<p>Mr Musk, who has over 206 million followers on X, posted or reposted about Mr Trump's cabinet picks more than 70 times between November 7 and November 20, a Reuters review found.</p>

<p>In between his constant postings of memes of himself and Trump, the X boss has even embraced a title suggested for his role: "First Buddy".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Members of Parliament of the House of Commons voted in favour of a bill that will grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales with less than six months to live the right to die with medical assistance under proper legislation.</p>

<p>The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill can now go through a lengthy process of amendments by the House of Lords before becoming a law - since the bill got 330 votes in favour and 275 against.</p>

<p>MPs were deeply divided by this issue and were given a free vote without any constraints on the lines of parties.&nbsp;“People across the country will be paying extremely close attention to today's vote, but this is a matter of conscience,”&nbsp;Prime Minister Keir Starmer spokesperson said, who voted for the bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legislation delineates a maximum 14-year prison sentence for anyone who coerces someone to take lethal medication or request assisted dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are not talking about a choice between life or death – we are talking about giving people a choice about how to die,"&nbsp;Labour MP Kim Leadbeater told MPs during a five-hour debate in the Commons. The bill was tabled by Leadbeater as a private member bill. She has actively been campaigning about this issue since weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has insisted that compared to any assisted dying legislation anywhere in the world, her bill contains "the most robust safeguards". The bill includes two independent doctors' approval for the decision, followed by a high-court judge and the concerned person having to administer the drugs themselves.</p>

<p>The bill has also attracted some high-profile support - like former Prime Minister David Cameron who agrees that people who are in agony and face imminent death, should have an option of shortening their pain.</p>

<p>However, there are challenges surrounding the bill, like the possibility of vulnerable people being coerced into opting for assisted dying.</p>

<p>British Indian Conservative MP Neil Shastri-Hurst backed the bill and argued that people should have access to "the death they deserve".</p>

<p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also voted in favour of the bill. Meanwhile&nbsp;Suella Braverman was among those voting against.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations' top court next week begins hearings on the legal obligation of countries to fight climate change and the consequences for states of contributing to global warming, the outcome of which could influence litigation worldwide.</p>

<p>While the advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) are non-binding, they are legally and politically significant. Experts say the ICJ's eventual opinion on climate change will likely be cited in climate change-driven lawsuits in courts from Europe to Latin America and beyond.</p>

<p>The hearings begin a week after developing nations denounced as woefully inadequate an agreement reached at the COP29 summit for countries to provide $300 billion in annual climate finance by 2035 to help poorer nations cope with climate change.</p>

<p>Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's special envoy for climate change and the environment, said it was imperative fossil fuels be phased out and more money provided to poorer nations bearing the brunt of climate change, such as his Pacific island nation.</p>

<p>"We're not seeing that in the outcome of the COPs," Regenvanu told Reuters.</p>

<p>"We are hoping (the ICJ) can provide a new avenue to break through the inertia we experience when trying to talk about climate justice," he added.</p>

<p>Fiji's Attorney General Graham Leung called the hearings an historic opportunity for small island developing states in their quest for climate change justice.</p>

<h2><strong>CLIMATE LITIGATION</strong></h2>

<p>Climate litigation is on the rise.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Europe's top human rights court ruled that the Swiss government had violated the rights of its citizens by failing to do enough to combat climate change. But it also rejected two other cases, pointing to the complexities of the growing wave of climate litigation.</p>

<p>Vanuatu, one of the small developing nations that pushed for an ICJ advisory opinion, says it disproportionately suffers the effects of climate change as a result of increasingly intense storms and rising sea levels.</p>

<p>Vanuatu will be the first of 98 countries and twelve international organisations to present arguments to the ICJ, also known as the World Court. It is the United Nations' highest court for resolving international disputes between states and can be tasked by the U.N. General Assembly to give advisory opinions.</p>

<p>In 2023, the assembly asked it for a formal opinion on questions including the legal obligations of states to protect the climate system and whether large states that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions may be liable for damages, in particular to small island nations.</p>

<p>"As COP29 failed to provide a clear direction for climate justice and ambition, any developments from the ICJ will now only become more weighty," said Lea Main-Klingst, a lawyer with ClientEarth.</p>

<p>Aside from small island states and numerous Western and developing countries, the court will also hear from the world's top two emitters of greenhouse gases, the United States and China. Oil producer group OPEC will also give its views.</p>

<p>The hearings will start at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) local time on Monday and run until Dec. 13. The court's opinion will be delivered in 2025.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of people were feared dead after a boat capsized on the Niger River in central Nigeria, a waterways agency spokesperson said on Friday.</p>

<p>National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) spokesperson Makama Suleiman said the boat was carrying mostly traders from Missa community in the central Kogi state heading to a weekly market in the neighbouring Niger state.</p>

<p>Suleiman said that rescue operations were currently underway, but the exact number of fatalities was unknown.</p>

<p>None of the passengers were wearing life jackets, which significantly increased the risk of fatalities, he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday inspected the gleaming restored interior of Notre Dame cathedral, saying workers had done the "impossible" by healing a "national wound" caused by a 2019 fire that ravaged the mediaeval landmark.</p>

<p>Eight days ahead of the December 7 reopening of the cathedral, Macron conducted an inspection, broadcast live on television, which provided the first official insight into how the 850-year-old edifice now looks inside.</p>

<p>"You have achieved what was thought impossible," Macron told workers and officials who packed Notre Dame after the French president toured the cathedral.</p>

<p>"The blaze at Notre Dame was a national wound, and you have been its remedy through will, through work, through commitment," he said, adding the cathedral's re-opening will be a "shock of hope."</p>

<p>"This is an immense source of pride for the entire nation," Macron said, expressing hope that the spirit of "fraternity" would endure.</p>

<p>Notre Dame will welcome visitors and worshippers again over the December 7-8 weekend, after a sometimes challenging restoration to return the imposing Paris cathedral to its former glory after it was badly damaged by fire on April 19, 2019.</p>

<p>World leaders are expected to attend but the guest list has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>The French president is hoping the re-opening of Notre Dame will be a major feather in his cap amid the current political deadlock following early parliamentary elections this summer.</p>

<p>"We were told many times at the beginning that it wouldn't be possible, that it was crazy, that it was arbitrary, that we were going to do it wrong," Macron said.</p>

<p>"But in the end," he added, "you did it."</p>

<p>Macron toured the key areas of the cathedral, including the nave, choir and chapel, and spoke to experts.</p>

<p>"Sublime," said a visibly pleased Macron, who was accompanied by Paris' archbishop Laurent Ulrich, the culture minister, the mayor of Paris and other officials.</p>

<p>"It is much more welcoming," he added, praising Notre Dame's pale-coloured stones and saying everyone involved in the reconstruction should "be proud".</p>

<p><strong>'Insane challenge'</strong></p>

<p>After the devastating fire Macron set the ambitious goal to rebuild Notre Dame within five years and make it "even more beautiful" than before, a target that the French authorities say has been met.</p>

<p>The "building site of the century" was a "challenge that many considered insane", Macron has said.</p>

<p>Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were brought it for restoration work costing hundreds of millions of euros.</p>

<p>All 2,000 people who contributed to the effort had been invited to Friday's event.</p>

<p>The restoration cost a total of nearly 700 million euros (more than $750 million at today's rate).</p>

<p>It was financed from the 846 million euros in donations that poured in from 150 countries in an unprecedented surge of solidarity.</p>

<p>The 19th-century gothic spire has now been resurrected with an exact copy of the original, the stained windows have regained their colour, the walls shining after fire stains cleaned and a restored organ ready to thunder out again.</p>

<p>Unseen to visitors is a new mechanism to protect against any future fires, a discreet system of pipes ready to release millions of water droplets in case of a new disaster.</p>

<p>Notre Dame, which welcomed 12 million visitors in 2017, expects to receive an even higher figure of 14 to 15 million after the reopening, according to the church authorities.</p>

<p>French ministers have also floated the idea of charging tourists an entrance fee to the site but the Paris diocese has said free admission was an important principle to maintain.</p>

<p><strong>Reopening ceremony</strong></p>

<p>Macron had hoped to speak inside Notre Dame to mark the reopening but after negotiations with the diocese, he was now set to speak in the forecourt only.</p>

<p>France is by its constitution a secular country with a strict division between church and state.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday December 8, will see the first mass and consecration of the new altar.</p>

<p>Macron said in December 2023 he had invited Pope Francis to the reopening of the cathedral but the head of the Catholic church announced in September, to the surprise of some observers, that he would not be coming.</p>

<p>Instead, the pontiff is making a landmark visit during the subsequent weekend to the French island of Corsica.</p>

<p>The French Catholic church has in recent years been rocked by a succession of sexual abuse allegations against clerics, including most recently the monk known as Abbe Pierre who became a household name for providing aid to the destitute.</p>

<p>Over five years on, the investigation into what caused the fire is ongoing, with initial findings backing an accidental cause such as a short circuit, a welder's torch or a cigarette.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron praised on Friday the more than 1,000 craftspeople who helped rebuild Paris' Notre-Dame Cathedral in what he called "the project of the century", five-and-a-half years after fire gutted the Gothic masterpiece.</p>

<p>The 12th-century cathedral, one of the French capital's most beloved and visited monuments, will reopen its doors next week to tourists and to the Catholic faithful.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>"Never before have we seen such a construction site. You all had your share in the project of the century," Macron told a gathering that included carpenters, stonemasons, art restorers, firefighters and donors.</p>

<p>"The burning of Notre-Dame was a national wound and you were its remedy, (restoring it) through determination, hard work and commitment."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>The workers, who include members of the elite 'Compagnons du Devoir', a centuries-old guild of artisans considered France's finest, burst into joyful applause when Macron concluded his address with a final 'thank you'.</p>

<p>The reconstruction work restored the cathedral's spire, its rib vaulting, flying buttresses, stained-glass windows and carved stone gargoyles to their past glory, with the white stone and gold decorations shining brighter than ever.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>It is a far cry from the evening of April 15, 2019, when TV viewers in France and worldwide watched with horror as the cathedral's roof and spire burst into flames and collapsed in a raging fire that also threatened the main bell towers, which narrowly avoided destruction.</p>

<p>On his visit to the site, Macron seemed deeply impressed as light poured into the nave through the renewed windows.</p>

</div>

<p>"This is overwhelming," he said as he toured the cathedral with his wife Brigitte, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo and other senior officials.</p>

<h2><strong>'EXCEPTIONAL'</strong></h2>

<p>"It was an exceptional renovation project," stone-carver Samir Abbas, 38, told Reuters, relieved at having finished on schedule.</p>

</div>

<p>An opening ceremony - to which celebrities and heads of state have been invited - is planned for the evening of Dec. 7, followed by days of special Masses to celebrate the reopening and to thank those who helped save and rebuild the cathedral.</p>

<p>So much money poured in for the renovation from all over the world - more than 840 million euros ($882 million), according to Macron's office - that there are still funds left over for further investment in the building.</p>

</div>

<p>The Catholic Church now expects the cathedral to welcome some 15 million visitors annually.</p>

<p>"We are very eager to welcome the whole world under the roof of our cathedral," Paris' Archbishop Laurent Ulrich said in a message on the cathedral website, expressing the Church's gratitude to all those who helped save it.</p>

<p>"On the night of April 15, hundreds of thousands of people committed themselves to what then seemed an impossible bet: to restore the cathedral and give it back its splendour within the unprecedented deadline of five years."</p>

</div>

<p>The guest-list for the reopening ceremony has not yet been published, but one source familiar with the planning said U.S. President Joe Biden's wife Jill would come, while President-elect Donald Trump had not yet confirmed his attendance.</p>

<p>Parisians expressed excitement and relief at the prospect of the cathedral reopening.</p>

<p>"I'm so happy," said 50-year-old architect Sebastien Truchot, who lives nearby. "Whether you believe in God or not, Notre-Dame is a universal symbol, and it's amazing to have it back and to rediscover it."</p>

<p>Albert Abid, a bookseller whose stall stands on the quay, was shocked to see it burn five years ago. "It's a relief. Finally, Notre Dame is restored," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sample from the asteroid Ryugu was overrun with Earth-based life forms after they were brought to the planet, scientists have concluded in a study. The research, published in the journal Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science, explains how successful terrestrial microorganisms are at colonisation, even for extraterrestrial materials.</p>

<p>These samples have been collected by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft of the&nbsp;Japan&nbsp;Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). It was launched in December 2014 and successfully rendezvoused with Ryugu in June 2018.</p>

<p>Later, it spent a year examining the asteroid having a diameter of roughly 3,000 feet (900 meters), before scooping out a sample, which returned to The Earth on December 6, 2020. Haybusa2 continued with its study of more asteroids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sample was split and sent to different teams of scientists, including the one that conducted the latest research. Team leader Matthew Genge, who is from Imperial College London told Space.com that they have discovered microorganisms in the sample returned from the asteroid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They appeared on the rock and spread with time before finally dying off," Genge said.</p>

<p>The "change in the number of microorganisms" further confirmed these were living microbes. "However, it also suggested they only recently colonised the specimen just before our analyses and were terrestrial in origin," Genge added.</p>

<p>The team observed filamentous microorganisms as the discovery took the form of filaments and rods of organic matter, Space.com reported.</p>

<p>However, the researcher noted the type of microorganisms was still unknown.</p>

<p>"Without studying their DNA, it is impossible to identify their exact type... However, they were most likely bacteria such as Bacillus since these are very common filamentous microorganisms, particularly in soil and rocks," Genge noted.</p>

<p>The team has ruled out the possibility of these microorganisms being already there on Ryugu when the samples were gathered.</p>

<p>"Before we prepared the sample, we performed nano-X-ray computed tomography, and no microbes were seen," Genge said, adding the change in population suggests they only appeared after the sample was exposed to the atmosphere upon its return to the Earth.</p>

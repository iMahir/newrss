       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ivanka Trump took her 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, along with her friends to the Taylor Swift concert in Miami, despite her father, Donald Trump, once publicly declaring he hated the 14-time Grammy Award-winner.</p>

<p>The singer's Eras Tour was in Miami at the Hard Rock Stadium over the weekend. Among the famous names in the crowd was Ivanka “to see one of her daughter's favourite artists,” sources told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://pagesix.com/2024/10/22/entertainment/ivanka-trump-takes-daughter-to-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-in-miami/" rel="nofollow,noindex">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>Their outing comes weeks after Swift endorsed US Vice President and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for the November 5 US presidential election, prompting Donald Trump to issue a statement on social media that read, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”</p>

<p>Arabella, who celebrates her birthday in July, earlier showed her love for Swift through a theme-based birthday cake decorated with lyrics from the 2014 single Blank Space -- 'Boys only want love if it's torture.'</p>

<p>Earlier, Ivanka shared a few photographs from her daughter's birthday party on Instagram. In one of the images, she wrote, "Best cake for my favourite Swiftie”.</p>

<p>On September 11, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/shell-pay-for-it-says-donald-trump-after-taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-6542169">Swift extended support to Harris</a> in a lengthy post on Instagram. "I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," she wrote, adding that Harris is "steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos."</p>

<p>In her viral post, she also called out the fake AI image of herself endorsing Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me' falsely endorsing Donald Trump's presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI and the dangers of spreading misinformation," she said.</p>

<p>Swift signed off her post as “Childless cat lady”, taking a dig at Trump's running mate JD Vance. Her endorsement post came after Trump and Harris' presidential debate last month.</p>

<p>Responding to Swift's support for Harris, Trump said in an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-taylor-swift-endorsing-harris-just-question-time" rel="nofollow,noindex">Fox &amp; Friends</a>, "I was not a Taylor Swift fan... It was just a question of time... But she's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the climate crisis deepens, scientists have been pondering ways to cool the planet. A new study proposes to spray millions of tonnes of diamond dust in the Earth's upper atmosphere every year to cool it down. The study, published in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL110575" rel="nofollow,noindex">Geophysical Research Letters</a> journal, was conducted by a multi-institutional team of climatologists, meteorologists and Earth scientists. The team found evidence based on 3D climate models that compared aerosols that may be utilised to cool the planet.</p>

<p>Prior studies suggested that Earth was at or nearing its tipping point, causing significant changes to global weather patterns. With time, the planet will continue to grow warmer.</p>

<p>Experts, therefore, have argued the only solution to this issue is cooling the planet. Among other suggestions, scientists have also advised deploying millions of devices to pull carbon from the air that could later be sequestered.</p>

<p>However, a problem with this idea is that if the Earth has already reached its tipping point, simply removing carbon from the air won't help. Scientists will have to look out for ways to not just put a brake on warming but also to actively cool down the planet, Phys.org reported.</p>

<p>The latest proposed solution is injecting aerosols into the atmosphere. It will reflect heat and sunlight into the space.</p>

<p>To find a solution, the team of researchers in their latest study tried to look for material that could best serve as the best medium to cool the planet.</p>

<p>For this, they came up with the idea of building a 3D climate model, showing the impact of spreading aerosols into the atmosphere. This also included effects of different aerosols such as light and heat reflection, meaning how it would eventually settle to the ground and whether these aerosols would clump together in the atmosphere, thereby retaining more heat.</p>

<p>In their study, the team modeled the impact on the Earth of injections of calcite, silicon carbide, diamond, aluminum, anatase, rutile and sulfur dioxide.</p>

<p>Ultimately, they concluded that diamond dust was the best option because its particles go on to reflect the most light and heat, besides staying aloft for a longer duration. Another positive side of it is that since they are chemically inert, they may not react to form acid rain.</p>

<p>In their study, the researchers found that the Earth could be cooled down by at least 1.6 degree Celsius in 45 years if 5 million tons of synthetic diamond dust is injected into the atmosphere. A downside, though, is that it will cost approximately $200 trillion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris said Tuesday that America is "absolutely" ready to elect its first woman president but downplayed her historic bid, saying she simply wants to turn the page for a nation "exhausted" by Donald Trump.</p>

<p>With two weeks to Election Day, Harris and Trump are saturating swing states with rallies and taking to the airwaves and podcasts on the hunt for an advantage in a race that polls suggest is effectively tied.</p>

<p>Speaking on the national NBC network, Harris responded "absolutely" when asked if America was ready to elect its first woman -- but also noted her candidacy was about "turning the page."</p>

<p>"People are exhausted with Donald Trump and his approach, because it's all about himself," she said.</p>

<p>Trump, speaking to supporters in North Carolina, pitched a very different message.</p>

<p>"This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence, failure and disaster, or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country," he said to cheers.</p>

<p>He repeatedly called Harris and her running mate Tim Walz stupid during the rally.</p>

<p><strong>'Lock him up'</strong></p>

<p>The race is overshadowed by extraordinary tensions and fears of violence or a refusal by Trump to recognize the results if he loses, as he continues to do over his 2020 loss to Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Harris told NBC that her campaign was "of course" ready for a scenario where Trump prematurely claims victory during a vote-counting process that could take days to complete.</p>

<p>Biden, who has been an infrequent presence in Harris's campaign, took a shot at Trump Tuesday by re-wording the ex-president's notorious anti-Hillary Clinton chant of "Lock her up".</p>

<p>On a visit to New Hampshire, Biden told a small crowd that "we got to lock" Trump up –- adding quickly, "politically lock him up."</p>

<p>With Trump facing multiple pending criminal charges as he competes against Harris to succeed Biden, the White House has been very careful not to weigh in on the Republican's legal problems.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign responded that Biden and Harris had a "plan all along... to politically persecute their opponent."</p>

<p>About 18 million Americans have already voted by mail or in person -- representing more than 10 percent of the total in 2020.</p>

<p>Some polls appear to be giving the Republican, who at 78 is the oldest nominee from a major party in US history, a slight edge recently -- but all within the margin of error.</p>

<p>Whatever the result, US voters will make history on November 5: they will either elect the country's first woman president, or they will put the first convicted felon into the White House.</p>

<p><strong>Early voters</strong></p>

<p>Harris, 60, is also deploying two of her party's most popular emissaries onto the campaign trail: Barack and Michelle Obama.</p>

<p>The former president, speaking at a rally in Madison on Tuesday, rolled back the years with fiery attacks on Trump.</p>

<p>"Don't boo, vote!" he implored people after his jibes.</p>

<p>Laster in the day, Rapper Eminem upped the star factor when he introduced Obama at a major Harris campaign event in Detroit, drawing a rapped reply from the ex-president.</p>

<p>"I don't usually get nervous, but I was feeling some kinda way following Eminem," Obama said before launching into a recitation of the lyrics to the rapper's hit "Lose Yourself".</p>

<p>At the same time, Trump has increasingly repeated conspiracy theories on the campaign trail, often taking aim at migrants and his political opponents.</p>

<p>While speaking to Latino leaders Tuesday in Florida he said: "As president, you have tremendous — it's called extreme power. You have extreme power."</p>

<p>"You can, just by the fact, you say, 'Close the border,' and the border's closed," he added.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign has begun to hammer at his mental and physical fitness to occupy the Oval Office while trying to woo moderate Republican voters.</p>

<p>One of Trump's top aides as president, former Marine general John Kelly, confirmed Tuesday to The New York Times previous reports that he considered the Republican to be a fascist.</p>

<p>"Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he's certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators -- he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure."</p>

<p>Joe Rogan, host of one of the most listened to podcasts in America, said his interview with Trump is due out Friday.</p>

<p>Non-traditional media, including podcasts, have played a key role in the campaign in targeting specific audiences like young women and Black men.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In the northeastern corner of Qatar, lies Al Jassasiya, the country's largest and most significant rock art site. This barren desert landscape is home to approximately 900 ancient rock carvings, or petroglyphs, created centuries ago.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The carvings, mostly enigmatic cup marks arranged in various patterns, also feature sailing ships, symbols and signs. “Some of the carvings in Al Jassasiya are unique and cannot be found anywhere else,” Ferhan Sakal, head of excavation and site management at Qatar Museums told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/qatar-al-jassasiya-petroglyphs-cmd/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>. He highlighted the petroglyphs of ships seen from a bird's-eye view, demonstrating “a high degree of creativity and observation skills” by the artists.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Some researchers suggest these marks may have been used for playing the board game Mancala, while others cite their use in rituals or for sorting pearls.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It is very difficult to answer,” Mr Sakal acknowledged regarding the purpose of the cup marks. “We have no direct clues about the motifs used in Al Jassasiya,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The age of the carvings remains uncertain, with estimates ranging from Neolithic to late Islamic times. Mr Sakal said, “Petroglyphs – and rock art, in general – are very challenging to date.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">A previous study found no evidence of the carvings being more than a few hundred years old, but further research is needed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ship carvings at Al Jassasiya provide important insights into Qatar's fishing and pearling industries. These vessels typically feature pointed stern and detailed designs, with some anchors indicating traditional maritime practices.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Experts speculate on the significance of the high concentration of ship carvings at Al Jassasiya, with references to ancient beliefs surrounding boats as symbols of transition to the afterlife.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Visitors to Al Jassasiya are advised to take water and wear sun protection, as the site lacks shaded areas. The best times to visit are at sunrise and sunset, and the site is located near Azerbaijani Beach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold their first bilateral meeting in five years Wednesday, Indian officials said, days after their countries reached a deal on their contested border.</p>

<p>The meeting will take place on the sidelines of the three-day BRICS gathering hosted by President Vladimir Putin in the Russian city of Kazan, a sign of a potential thaw between the neighbours since clashes between their troops in 2020.</p>

<p>"There will be a bilateral meeting held between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping... on the sidelines of the BRICS summit," senior Indian foreign ministry official Vikram Misri said late Tuesday.</p>

<p>The leaders of the world's two most populous nations last held face-to-face formal talks when Xi visited PM Modi in the Indian city of Mahabalipuram in October of 2019.</p>

<p>Months later, in 2020, relations plunged after a skirmish along their contested frontier in the high-altitude Himalayan region of Ladakh, in which at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed.</p>

<p>China and India are intense rivals and have accused each other of trying to seize territory along their unofficial divide, known as the Line of Actual Control.</p>

<p>Since then, both sides pulled back tens of thousands of troops and agreed not to send patrols into a narrow dividing strip.</p>

<p>But India on Monday said that "agreement has been arrived at on patrolling arrangements" with China, easing the military standoff.</p>

<p>PM Modi and Xi met briefly in Bali in Indonesia on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' meeting in 2022, and in Johannesburg in South Africa in 2023.</p>

<p>India, however, maintained that ties could not return to normal unless the pre-clash status quo at their Ladakh frontier was restored.</p>

<p>In the last four years, New Delhi made it harder for many Chinese companies to invest in critical Indian sectors, and banned hundreds of Chinese gaming and e-commerce apps, including TikTok.</p>

<p>New Delhi also forged deeper ties with the so-called Quad, a US-led group that includes India, Australia and Japan, and hopes to counter China's influence in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>India eased laws for Western companies to invest and co-produce military hardware in the country.</p>

<p>Beijing is now expected to push New Delhi to restore economic ties and access for its companies in the fast-growing Indian market.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has rejoined the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time since Aug. 6 as his media startup's stock surges alongside his odds in political betting markets.</p>

<p>The former president's fortune rose to $6.5 billion Tuesday, ranking him 481st on the list of the world's 500 richest people. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp., which owns Truth Social, has nearly tripled in value since late September, boosting his paper wealth.</p>

<p>Trump Media has been trading as a proxy for betting on the likelihood that Trump will be the next US president. The odds that Trump will win the Nov. 5 election have spiked in recent weeks on betting sites Polymarket and PredictIt.</p>

<p>Trump's net worth is the highest it's been since July 22, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, which led to Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic nominee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Chief Executive Officer Mike Jeffries was charged by the US with running a sex-trafficking ring that coerced young men to engage in sexual acts with him in hopes of a career in modeling.</p>

<p>Jeffries, 80, was arrested along with his romantic partner and another man, accused of one count of sex trafficking and 15 counts of interstate prostitution, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Aspiring fashion models knew that a place on one of Abercrombie's iconic ads could be the ticket to success," Breon Peace, the US attorney in Brooklyn, said at a news conference announcing the case. "While Jeffries was the CEO of one of the most recognizable clothing retailers in the world, he was using his power, his wealth and his influence to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure and that of his romantic partner, Matthew Smith."</p>

<p>If convicted of the sex-trafficking charge, the most serious, the defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison and a minimum of 15 years behind bars.</p>

<p>Brian Bieber, a lawyer for Jeffries, said in a statement: "We will respond in detail to the allegations after the indictment is unsealed, and when appropriate, but plan to do so in the courthouse - not the media." A lawyer for Smith didn't immediately return voicemails and emails seeking comment. Jeremy Schneider, who represents the third defendant, James Jacobson, declined to comment.</p>

<p>A representative of Abercrombie, which wasn't charged, also declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company's shares closed down 3.2% at $154.82.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sex 'Tryouts'</strong></p>

<p>From at least late 2008 to early 2015, Jeffries and Smith spent millions of dollars to operate a "massive" sex-trafficking ring to victimize the men and "prolific amounts of money for staff to run the sex events," the US alleged.</p>

<p>They paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the men to travel to their homes in the Hamptons on Long Island as well as to hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco and the Caribbean for "sex events," according to Peace. Meanwhile, Jacobson, who worked for the couple, operated sex "tryouts" and recruited men as candidates, the US said.</p>

<p>The defendants allegedly used alcohol, muscle relaxants known as poppers and "force, fraud and coercion" to operate the illicit business while Jeffries and Smith relied upon their "vast financial resources" and Jeffries' position as the CEO to prey on the men. The men were required to sign nondisclosure agreements and threatened with reprisals if they complained, according to the government.</p>

<p>At least 15 men were lured with the promise of modeling opportunities for the fashion brand, Peace said. He said the actual number of victims may be in the "dozens and dozens" and asked any victims to come forward as the investigation continues. The FBI has also set up a hotline.</p>

<p>Jeffries and Smith appeared before a magistrate in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday. Jeffries was released on a $10 million bond. Smith, who is a UK citizen, was ordered held without bail. Jacobson appeared in federal court in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was released on a $500,000 bond, Peace spokesman John Marzulli said.</p>

<p><strong>'All-American Look'</strong></p>

<p>Jeffries was hired in 1992 by Leslie Wexner, founder of the company's former parent, Limited Brands (now L Brands), which also owned Victoria's Secret. He used racy marketing to sell an aspirational image of the "cool kid," one who plays rugby barechested and sports an "all-American" look.</p>

<p>Jeffries has also been sued over allegations he forced models to take drugs and engage in sex acts with him and others in exchange for the chance to be featured in the company's provocative fashion catalogs. One lawsuit against him and Abercrombie, in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that he used his position to recruit men and invite them to casting sessions at his homes in New York, the Hamptons and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the suit, filed by former Abercrombie model David Bradberry, the ex-CEO used his role "to prey upon attractive young men who believed that Jeffries was going to hire them as an Abercrombie model - the pinnacle of the modeling industry for men during the relevant time period."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bradberry claims Abercrombie "knew that it was providing the financial lifeblood for a sex-trafficking organization led by its CEO from at least 1992 through 2014," and that there could be more than 100 victims.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Jeffries and Abercrombie defended themselves in a filing this month, seeking the suit's dismissal.</p>

<p><strong>Prosecutor's Warning</strong></p>

<p>Brad Edwards, a lawyer for Bradberry who also represents victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said the criminal charges have brought his client "an overwhelming sense of validation." He said "it took a tremendous amount of courage for each of these men to come forward and speak out."</p>

<p>New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie, once known for its perfumed stores and shirtless models, has made a comeback among Gen Z and millennial adults, reinventing its brand by embracing more inclusive sizing and expanding its denim offerings. Jeffries left the company in 2014 after the Abercrombie and Hollister clothing lines lost their cachet with teenage shoppers.</p>

<p>"This case should serve as a warning" Peace said at the press conference. "Sexually exploiting vulnerable human beings is a crime."</p>

<p>The case is US v. Jeffries, 24-cr-00423, US District Court, Eastern District of New York (Central Islip).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Marriage apps describe themselves as "halal", or permissible in Islam, offering options to blur profile pictures for privacy and making clear the purpose is to reach a proposal.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's traditional matchmakers play a revered role in moulding daughters into potential brides, but marriage apps marketing themselves as halal are offering women a new route to finding a husband.</p>

<p>"When I saw my colleague happy after being married to someone she met online... I thought, since we have tried rishta aunties for four or five years, let's try this too," Ezza Nawaz, a textile designer in Lahore, told AFP.</p>

<p>Rishta aunties -- or traditional matchmakers -- polish up women and present them to the families of potential suitors, in a country where dating is considered dishonourable.</p>

<p>But in the last few years, marriage apps for Muslims have emerged in Pakistan promising so-called "love matches".</p>

<p>Some offer a "chaperone" option -- which provides a weekly transcript of sent and received messages to a chosen relative, satisfying families wary of their son or daughter connecting with strangers.</p>

<p>For Ezza, it was a success: just three months after meeting Waseem Akhtar on Muzz, she was married.</p>

<p>"We went on a couple of dates before we got our family involved. We took our time," she said.</p>

<p>More than 80 percent of Pakistanis have arranged marriages, according to a survey by Gallup and Gilani Pakistan, where families decide the union, sometimes settling an engagement without the bride and the groom even meeting.</p>

<p>Parents enlist the help of professional rishta aunties to help find a suitable family, with the first impression often based on how the young woman looks as she pours tea for her potential in-laws.</p>

<p>The app, however, says 1.2 million Pakistanis have signed up since it launched last year with an advertising campaign in major cities, and 15,000 people have already married.</p>

<p>Marriage apps describe themselves as "halal", or permissible in Islam, offering options to blur profile pictures for privacy and making clear the purpose is to reach a proposal.</p>

<p>But they continue to battle a stigma linking them to casual dating apps such as Tinder, which has been banned in Pakistan for being "immoral".</p>

<p>"I do not tell people how I met my wife until I am sure that the person would not judge us," said Waseem.</p>

<h3><strong>Tradition dates modernity</strong></h3>

<p>Marriage is viewed as a coming together of two families in Pakistan, where many live in multigenerational households.</p>

<p>Choosing your husband or wife yourself can be seen as a challenge to the deeply ingrained reverence towards elders and a threat to the traditional family structure.</p>

<p>Rishta aunties are therefore relied upon to find suitors from acceptable families -- a process that young women, who are widely expected to marry by the age of 25, can sometimes find demeaning.</p>

<p>"I was asked not to tell the guy's family that my hobbies are hiking or photography, but are cooking and cleaning... it made me angry," said Rida Fatima.</p>

<p>"They had the audacity to talk about how I looked, what I did, how much I earned, who my family is, how many brothers I have, what are my future aspirations. So every little thing is judged."</p>

<p>Fatima was presented with several potential matches through a rishta auntie appointed by her parents, but was asked to pay around $700 for an introductory meeting with a guy.</p>

<p>The rate fluctuates depending on whether the match has a foreign passport, she added.</p>

<p>Eventually, she ditched the process, becoming part of the 18 percent of Pakistanis who have a "love marriage" after meeting her husband by chance.</p>

<p>"No matter how the guy looks, even if he is bald or has a big belly, he wants a wife who looks like a model," said Muskan Ali, the managing director at a marriage consultancy in Karachi.</p>

<h3><strong>Waste of time</strong></h3>

<p>Rishta aunties do not feel threatened yet.</p>

<p>Their offices buzz with parents and their children crafting profiles on computers, as matchmakers strive to digitise their businesses with sleek websites and WhatsApp groups for client communication.</p>

<p>Consultants teach young women how to walk, talk and dress to best correspond to the wishes of their future in-laws.</p>

<p>Many traditional matchmakers like Fauzia Aazam, the head of a community of rishta aunties in Rawalpindi, reject marriage apps altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People waste time on these apps," she said.</p>

<p>"Chatting together all through the night, I just don't like it."</p>

<p>For Aisha Sarwari, a feminist author, the matchmaking process is about exercising "control" over daughters-in-law.</p>

<p>"I would say that we need to find a good middle ground, where the respect is equal on both sides and there is no sense of demeaning a human being just because they look a certain way or they are from a particular race," she told AFP.</p>

<p>Aneela, a digital media artist, whose name has been changed, tried her best to avoid being poured over by a matchmaker and turned to a marriage app, but found a new set of concerns.</p>

<p>"It is hard being on an app... men lie," she said, swiping through her profile at a cafe in Islamabad.</p>

<p>She later admitted to using a fake name and pictures on her profile so that men cannot identify her.</p>

<p>"The only option left is to go for an arranged marriage instead."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scurvy is often considered a historical ailment, conjuring images of sailors on long sea voyages suffering from a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Yet doctors in developed countries have recently reported treating cases of scurvy, including Australian doctors who <a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136//bcr-2024-261082">reported their findings</a> today in the journal <a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/">BMJ Case Reports</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>What is scurvy?</strong></h2>

<p>Scurvy is a disease caused by a severe deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), which is essential for the production of collagen. This protein helps maintain the health of skin, blood vessels, bones and connective tissue.</p>

<p>Without enough vitamin C, the body cannot properly repair tissues, heal wounds, or fight infections. This can lead to a range of <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400884544/html">symptoms</a> including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>fatigue and weakness</li>
	<li>swollen, bleeding gums or loose teeth</li>
	<li>joint and muscle pain and tenderness</li>
	<li>bruising easily</li>
	<li>dry, rough or discoloured skin (reddish or purple spots due to bleeding under the skin)</li>
	<li>cuts and sores take longer to heal</li>
	<li>anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells, leading to further fatigue and weakness)</li>
	<li>increased susceptibility to infections.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>It historically affected sailors</strong></h2>

<p>Scurvy was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23183299/">common</a> from the 15th to 18th centuries, when naval sailors and other explorers lived on rations or went without fresh food for long periods. You might have heard some of these milestones in the history of the disease:</p>

	<p><strong>in 1497-1499</strong>, Vasco da Gama's crew <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13131-5/fulltext#:%7E:text=After%205%20weeks%20at%20sea,lemons%2C%20clearing%20up%20the%20condition">suffered severely from scurvy</a> during their expedition to India, with a large portion of the crew dying from it</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>from the 16th to 18th centuries</strong>, scurvy was rampant among European navies and explorers, affecting notable figures such as <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26305889">Ferdinand Magellan and Sir Francis Drake</a>.

<p>Both patients presented with leg weakness and compromised skin, yet the doctors didn't initially consider scurvy. This was based on the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/7/1963">premise</a> that there is abundant vitamin C in our modern food supply, so deficiency should not occur.</p>

<p>On both occasions, treatment with high doses of vitamin C (1,000mg per day for at least seven days) resulted in improvements in symptoms and eventually a full recovery.</p>

<p>The authors of both case reports are concerned that if scurvy is left untreated, it could lead to inflamed blood vessels (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasculitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20363435">vasculitis</a>) and potentially <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211419X11001625">cause fatal bleeding</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, a major New South Wales hospital undertook a <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2023/219/10/serum-vitamin-c-status-people-new-south-wales-retrospective-analysis-findings">chart review</a>, where patient records are reviewed to answer research questions.</p>

<p>This found vitamin C deficiency was common. More than 50% of patients who had their vitamin C levels tested had either a modest deficiency (29.9%) or significant deficiency (24.5%). Deficiencies were more common among patients from rural and lower socioeconomic areas.</p>

<p>Now clinicians are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.5694/mja2.52146">urged to</a> consider vitamin C deficiency and scurvy as a potential diagnosis and involve the support of a dietitian.</p>

<h2><strong>Why might scurvy be re-emerging?</strong></h2>

<p>Sourcing and consuming nutritious foods with sufficient vitamin C is unfortunately <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10260575/">still an issue</a> for some people. Factors that increase the risk of vitamin C deficiency include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>poor diet</strong>. People with restricted diets – due to poverty, food insecurity or dietary choices – <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10296835/">may not get enough</a> vitamin C. This includes those who rely heavily on processed, nutrient-poor foods rather than fresh produce</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>food deserts</strong>. In areas where access to fresh, affordable fruits and vegetables is limited (often referred to as food deserts), people may <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9587807/">unintentionally suffer from a vitamin C deficiency</a>. In some parts of developing countries such as India, lack of access to fresh food is <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10296835/">recognised as a risk</a> for scurvy</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>the cost-of-living crisis</strong>. With greater numbers of people <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10935407/">unable to pay for fresh produce</a>, people who limit their intake of fruits and vegetables may develop nutrient deficiencies, including scurvy</p>
	</li>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>weight loss procedures and medications</strong>. Restricted dietary intake due to weight loss surgery or weight loss medications may <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.24067">lead to nutrient deficiencies</a>, such as in this <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3320124/">case report of scurvy</a> from Denmark</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>mental illness and eating disorders</strong>. Conditions such as depression and anorexia nervosa can lead to severely restricted diets, increasing the risk of scurvy, such as in this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32291151/">case report</a> from 2020 in Canada</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>isolation</strong>. Older adults, especially those who live alone or in nursing homes, may have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136//bcr-2024-261082">difficulty</a> preparing balanced meals with sufficient vitamin C</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>certain medical conditions</strong>. People with digestive disorders, malabsorption issues, or those on restrictive medical diets (due to severe allergies or intolerances) can develop scurvy if they are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8248877/">unable to absorb or consume enough vitamin C</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How much vitamin C do we need?</strong></h2>

<p>Australia's dietary guidelines <a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-c">recommend</a> adults consume 45mg of vitamin C (higher if pregnant or breastfeeding) each day. This is roughly the amount found in half an orange or half a cup of strawberries.</p>

<p>When more vitamin C is <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/australian-health-survey-usual-nutrient-intakes/latest-release">consumed</a> than required, excess amounts leave the body through urine.</p>

<p>Signs of scurvy can appear as early as a month after a daily intake of less than 10 mg of vitamin C.</p>

<p>Eating vitamin C-rich foods – such as oranges, strawberries, kiwifruit, plums, pineapple, mango, capsicum, broccoli and Brussels sprouts – can resolve symptoms within a few weeks.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is also readily available as a supplement if there are reasons why intake through food may be compromised. Typically, the supplements contain 1,000mg per tablet, and the <a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-c">recommended upper limit</a> for daily Vitamin C intake is 2,000mg.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[The European Space Agency estimates there are more than 40,000 pieces larger than 10cm in orbit, and more than 130,000,000 smaller than 1cm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large communications satellite has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/satellite-orbiting-earth-broken-intelsat-lost-1972438">broken up in orbit</a>, affecting users in Europe, Central Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, and adding to the growing swarm of space junk clouding our planet's neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.satcat.com/sats/41748">Intelsat 33e satellite</a> provided broadband communication from a point some 35,000km above the Indian Ocean, in a geostationary orbit around the equator.</p>

<p>Initial reports on October 20 said Intelsat 33e had experienced a sudden power loss. Hours later, <a href="https://www.space-track.org/">US Space Forces-Space</a> confirmed the satellite appears to have broken up into at least 20 pieces.</p>

<p>So what happened? And is this a sign of things to come as more and more satellites head into orbit?</p>

<h2><strong>A space whodunnit</strong></h2>

<p>There are no confirmed reports about what caused the breakup of Intelsat 33e. However, it is not the first event of its kind.</p>

<p>In the past we've seen <a href="https://www.space.com/3415-china-anti-satellite-test-worrisome-debris-cloud-circles-earth.html">deliberate satellite destructions</a>, <a href="https://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/2010/06/analysis_of_debris_from_the_co.html">accidental collisions</a>, and loss of satellites due to <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5193/">increased solar activity</a>.</p>

<p>What we do know is that Intelsat 33e has a history of issues while in orbit. Designed and manufactured by <a href="https://www.boeing.com/content/dam/boeing/boeingdotcom/space/boeing_satellites/pdf/Bkgd_SatFam_Intelsat.pdf">Boeing</a>, the satellite was launched in August 2016.</p>

<p>In 2017, the satellite reached its desired orbit three months later than anticipated, due to a <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/01/30/intelsat-satellite-in-service-after-overcoming-engine-trouble/">reported issue</a> with its primary thruster, which controls its altitude and acceleration.</p>

<p>More propulsion troubles emerged when the satellite performed something called a station keeping activity, which keeps it at the right altitude. It was <a href="https://spacenews.com/intelsat-33e-propulsion-problems-to-cut-service-life-by-3-5-years/">burning more fuel than expected</a>, which meant its mission would end around 3.5 years early, in 2027. Intelsat lodged a US$78 million insurance claim as a result of these problems.</p>

<p>However, at the time of its breakup, the satellite was reportedly <a href="https://spacenews.com/intelsat-33e-loses-power-in-geostationary-orbit/">not insured</a>.</p>

<p>Intelsat is <a href="https://www.intelsat.com/newsroom/intelsat-reports-is-33e-satellite-loss/">investigating</a> what went wrong, but we may never know exactly what caused the satellite to fragment. We do know another Intelsat <a href="https://www.spaceintelreport.com/sudden-failure-of-intelsat-is-33-satellite-forces-fresh-look-at-companys-five-remaining-boeing-702-mp-models/">satellite of the same model</a>, a Boeing-built EpicNG 702 MP, failed in 2019.</p>

<p>More importantly, we can learn from the aftermath of the breakup: space junk.</p>

<h2><strong>30 blue whales of space junk</strong></h2>

<p>The amount of debris in orbit around Earth is increasing rapidly. The European Space Agency (ESA) <a href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris">estimates</a> there are more than 40,000 pieces larger than 10cm in orbit, and more than 130,000,000 smaller than 1cm.</p>

<p>The total mass of human-made space objects in Earth orbit is some <a href="https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/">13,000 tonnes</a>. That's about the same mass as 90 adult male blue whales. About one third of this mass is debris (4,300 tonnes), mostly in the form of leftover rocket bodies.</p>

<p>Tracking and identifying space debris is a challenging task. At higher altitudes, such as Intelsat 33e's orbit around 35,000km up, we can only see objects above a certain size.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Visualisation of debris around the Earth.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of the most concerning things about the loss of Intelsat 33e is that the breakup likely produced debris that is too small for us to see from ground level with current facilities.</p>

<p>The past few months have seen a string of <a href="https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/ODQNv28i4.pdf">uncontrolled breakups</a> of decommissioned and abandoned objects in orbit.</p>

<p>In June, the <a href="https://spacenews.com/low-intensity-explosion-caused-russian-satellite-to-spew-debris/">RESURS-P1 satellite</a> fractured in low Earth orbit (an altitude of around 470km), creating more than 100 trackable pieces of debris. This event also likely created many more pieces of debris too small to be tracked.</p>

<p>In July, another decommissioned satellite – the <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/dmsp-5d2.htm">Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) 5D-2 F8 spacecraft</a> – broke up. In August, the upper stage of a <a href="https://spacenews.com/chinese-rocket-stage-breaks-up-into-cloud-of-more-than-700-pieces-of-space-debris/">Long March 6A (CZ-6A) rocket fragmented</a>, creating at least 283 pieces of trackable debris, and potentially hundreds of thousands of untrackable fragments.</p>

<p>It is not yet known whether this most recent event will affect other objects in orbit. This is where continuous monitoring of the sky becomes vital, to understand these complex space debris environments.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is responsible?</strong></h2>

<p>When space debris is created, who is responsible for cleaning it up or monitoring it?</p>

<p>In principle, the country that launched the object into space has the burden of responsibility where fault can be proved. This was explored in the 1972 <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introliability-convention.html">Convention of International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects</a>.</p>

<p>In practice, there is often little accountability. The <a href="https://theconversation.com/space-is-getting-crowded-with-satellites-and-space-junk-how-do-we-avoid-collisions-215545">first fine over space debris</a> was issued in 2023 by the US Federal Communications Commission.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether a similar fine will be issued in the case of Intelsat 33e.</p>

<h2><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>

<p>As the human use of space accelerates, Earth orbit is growing increasingly crowded. To manage the hazards of orbital debris, we will need continuous monitoring and improved tracking technology alongside deliberate efforts to minimise the amount of debris.</p>

<p>Most satellites are much closer to Earth than Intelsat 33e. Often these low Earth orbit satellites can be safely brought down from orbit (or “de-orbited”) at the end of their missions without creating space debris, especially with a bit of forward planning.</p>

<p>In September, ESA's <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cluster/Goodnight_Cluster_brilliant_end_to_trailblazing_mission">Cluster 2 “Salsa” satellite</a> was de-orbited with a targeted re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, burning up safely.</p>

<p>Of course, the bigger the space object, the more debris it can produce. NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iss-deorbit-analysis-summary.pdf">calculated</a> the International Space Station would produce more than 220 million debris fragments if it broke up in orbit, for example.</p>

<p>Accordingly, planning for de-orbiting of the station (ISS) at the end of its operational life in 2030 is now well underway, with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-international-space-station-us-deorbit-vehicle/">contract awarded</a> to SpaceX.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A person died and 49 others fell ill following an E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/e-coli-O157.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CDC</a>). The outbreak has primarily affected residents in the US states of Colorado and Nebraska. The slivered onions used in the burgers are suspected to be the source of contamination.</p>

<p><strong>What is E. coli?</strong></p>

<p>Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a type of bacteria commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals. While most strains of E. coli are harmless and help maintain gut health, some can cause serious foodborne illness.</p>

<p><strong>E. coli outbreak at McDonald's: What's happening?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/where-people-got-sick-e-coli-o157-2024.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CDC</a>, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), identified onions as a "likely source," leading <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mcdonalds-responds-to-e-coli-bacterial-outbreak-linked-to-its-quarter-pounder-hamburgers-in-us-6852564">McDonald's</a> to suspend sales of Quarter Pounders in 12 states, including Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and Utah. The fast-food chain has also stopped using the onions in question, although investigations are underway to determine whether the hamburger patties themselves could also be contributing to the outbreak. The outbreak was tied to E. coli O157.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, 10 people, including a child with a complicating illness, have been hospitalised, while a Colorado resident has died. The CDC's investigation suggests the actual number of sick people may be higher than reported, as many individuals recover without seeking medical attention. They warned it was a "fast-moving outbreak," with infections primarily occurring between customers who ate the burgers between late September and mid-October.</p>

<p><strong>E. coli: Symptoms</strong></p>

<p>Common symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Severe stomach cramps</li>
	<li>Diarrhoea, often bloody</li>
	<li>Vomiting</li>
	<li>Fever, though not always present and usually mild if it occurs</li>
</ul>

<p>Symptoms usually appear three to four days after exposure to the bacteria, but can sometimes start as early as a day or as late as 10. Most people recover within 5 to 7 days. In severe cases, E. coli can lead to a serious complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which affects the kidneys and may require hospitalisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CDC advises to seek medical help if you experience:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Diarrhoea that lasts more than 3 days</li>
	<li>High fever (over 102 degree F)</li>
	<li>Bloody diarrhoea</li>
	<li>Severe vomiting that prevents keeping liquids down</li>
	<li>Signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth, dizziness or reduced urination</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A severe E. coli outbreak linked to Quarter Pounder hamburgers at McDonald's has led to the death of one person and hospitalization of at least 10 others in the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the outbreak began in late September and spread to 10 states with most of the 49 cases reported in Colorado (27) and Nebraska (nine).</p>

<p>"10 people have been hospitalized. One older person in Colorado has died. Additionally, one child is hospitalized with complications of hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS," the health agency said in an official statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Everyone interviewed has reported eating at McDonald's before their illness started, and most specifically mentioned eating a Quarter Pounder hamburger," it said.</p>

<p>The CDC also said the "true number" of sick people is likely "much higher" than the number reported because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/e-coli-outbreak-whats-is-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-causes-and-symptoms-6852562" target="_blank">E. coli</a>.</p>

<p>It said the specific ingredient linked to illness has not yet been identified, but investigators are focused on two ingredients in particular: fresh slivered onions, and fresh beef patties.</p>

<h3><strong>McDonald's Responds</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mcdonalds-linked-to-one-death-dozens-of-food-poisonings-in-us-6851585#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">McDonald's</a> said the initial findings from the investigation indicate that a subset of illnesses may be linked to slivered onions used in the Quarter Pounder and sourced by a single supplier that serves three distribution centers.</p>

<p>"As a result, and in line with our safety protocols, all local restaurants have been instructed to remove this product from their supply and we have paused the distribution of all slivered onions in the impacted area," the fast food chain said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Out of an abundance of caution, we are also temporarily removing the Quarter Pounder from restaurants in the impacted area," it said.</p>

<p>Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald's US, also released a video message and said, "Food safety is so important to me and everyone at McDonald's."</p>

<p>All other menu items, including other beef products like the Cheeseburger, Hamburger, Big Mac, McDouble and the Double Cheeseburger will be available.</p>

<h3><strong>E. coli Symptoms</strong></h3>

<p>Most people infected with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/5-bacteria-types-claimed-6-8-lakh-lives-in-india-in-2019-lancet-study-3542529" target="_blank">E. coli</a> experience severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting.</p>

<p>Symptoms usually start 3 to 4 days after swallowing the bacteria and most people recover without treatment after 5 to 7 days, the CDC said.</p>

<p>Some people may develop serious kidney problems (hemolytic uremic syndrome) and would need to be hospitalized.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pink cocaine, a highly potent and unpredictable designer drug, is a powdery mixture of various psychoactive substances.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British pop star&nbsp;Liam Payne&nbsp;fell to his death last week from the third-floor hotel balcony in Argentina's Buenos Aires, sending shockwaves across the entertainment world. Now, a toxicology report revealed that he had "multiple substances in his system" at the time of his death, including a drug known as "pink cocaine". According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/pink-cocaine-drug-liam-payne-death-mdma-ketamine-1972999">Newsweek,</a></em> pink cocaine is a designer drug that experts have likened to "Russian roulette."&nbsp;This substance poses significant health risks, including potential long-term psychological damage and even death.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Pink Cocaine?</strong></p>

<p>Pink cocaine, a highly potent and unpredictable designer drug, is a powdery mixture of various psychoactive substances, including&nbsp;methamphetamine, MDMA, hallucinogens, crack, bath salts, benzodiazepines, and caffeine. The drug gets its distinctive pink colour from added food colouring and is sometimes strawberry-flavoured. Also known as "Tusi," it has gained popularity in the Latin American party scene since 2018. In New York, a gram can cost between US$20 and US$100 and the drug is mostly sold online and through social media.</p>

<p>Despite its name, pink cocaine doesn't necessarily contain traditional cocaine and has also been found in four regions across the UK and Europe.</p>

<p>Its composition and effects are significantly different from traditional cocaine. Users report euphoric and psychedelic experiences, altered sensory perception, and intense euphoria, setting it apart from the purely stimulant effects of regular cocaine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Potential side effects can vary but may include anxiety, hallucination, nausea and vomiting,&nbsp;&nbsp;increased heart rate and blood pressure, and elevated body temperature. The drug poses serious health risks, including overdose, long-term psychological damage, and addiction. Its unpredictable potency and composition make it a dangerous gamble for users, thus earning the name&nbsp;"Russian roulette."&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Pink cocaine is referred to as 'Russian roulette' because its composition varies drastically between batches. This inconsistency means that users never know what they are consuming, as the drug often contains a mixture of various substances, sometimes including dangerous or unknown chemicals. Such unpredictability significantly increases the risk of overdose or severe adverse reactions,''&nbsp; Joseph Janes, a lecturer in Criminology at Swansea University told <em>Newsweek.</em></p>

<p><i>''</i>In addition to its unpredictable composition, pink cocaine is particularly concerning due to its deceptive appeal. Its bright colour and recent associations with celebrities can give the impression that it's a safer, more glamorous alternative to traditional drugs, especially in lively party settings. However, the reality is far more dangerous, as it often contains a mix of unknown and potentially lethal substances,'' Mr Janes further said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It remains unclear whether pink cocaine played a role in the death of singer Liam Payne, and conclusive toxicology reports are not expected for several weeks. However, the drug has been increasingly linked to a rising number of drug-related fatalities. In addition to pink cocaine, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/liam-payne-had-multiple-drugs-in-his-system-at-the-time-of-death-report-6843807">drugs detected</a> in Payne's bloodstream included benzodiazepine, crack, and cocaine.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Liam Payne</strong></p>
</article>

<aside id="stk_cnt">
<p>Payne rose to global fame as part of the since-disbanded pop band One Direction, alongside Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson.&nbsp;The boy band got its start after finishing third on the British version of the X Factor music competition show in 2010, but the group broke up in 2016 as its members pursued different projects including solo careers.</p>

<p>One Direction was ranked the third greatest boy band of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2024. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Payne's One Direction and solo career helped garner a net worth of some $70 million.</p>

<article>
<p>In a joint statement, Payne's former bandmates expressed their devastation over his death emphasising their cherished memories of him and calling for privacy as they grieve. "In time, and when everyone can, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly," they said. They also stated that their thoughts were with the English singer's family, friends and fans.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human-caused climate change worsened floods that have killed hundreds of people and displaced millions in Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Sudan this year, according to a study published on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The intense rainy season has unleashed a humanitarian crisis across large areas of the Sahel region bordering the Sahara desert.</p>

<p>A new analysis by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) network of scientists found warming driven by the use of fossil fuels had exacerbated the flooding in Sudan.</p>

<p>The researchers also said climate change would have made this year's torrential rains around five to 20 percent more intense across the Niger and Lake Chad basins, citing a previous WWA study of similar floods in 2022.</p>

<p>"This is only going to keep getting worse if we keep burning fossil fuels," said Clair Barnes from the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>Speaking at a briefing ahead of the study's publication, she said such downpours "could happen every year" if global temperatures increase to two degrees Celsius (35.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>"It's pretty serious," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Downpours and storms</strong></p>

<p>Global warming is not just about rising temperatures -- the extra heat trapped in the atmosphere and seas has knock-on effects and can result in more intense downpours and storms.</p>

<p>The researchers said there was a clear link between the extreme rainfall and a warming planet.</p>

<p>In the study, they focused on war-torn Sudan, where millions of displaced people have been uprooted by conflict and driven into flood-prone areas.</p>

<p>The scientists used modelling to compare weather patterns in our world and one without human-induced warming, and found that month-long spells of intense rainfall in parts of Sudan had become heavier and more likely due to climate change.</p>

<p>At the current 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming, they said similar periods of rainfall are expected to occur on average about once every three years, and have become about 10 percent heavier due to climate change.</p>

<p><strong>'Incredibly concerning'</strong></p>

<p>"These results are incredibly concerning," said Izidine Pinto, one of the study's authors and a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.</p>

<p>He warned that "with every fraction of a degree of warming, the risk of extreme floods will keep increasing", and called for the UN's COP29 climate summit to "accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels" when it meets in Azerbaijan next month.</p>

<p>Joyce Kimutai, a researcher at Imperial's Centre for Environmental Policy, said the floods underscored the need for a loss and damage fund for nations devastated by climate change.</p>

<p>A key meeting ahead of COP29 earlier this month ended with countries making little progress over how to finance a deal for poorer nations.</p>

<p>"Africa has contributed a tiny amount of carbon emissions globally, but is being hit the hardest by extreme weather," Kimutai said.</p>

<p>The role of climate change in the floods was compounded by other human-made problems, the researchers said, and they called for better maintenance of dams and investment in early warning systems.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Britain's King Charles will be offered the title of high chief in Samoa in a three-day visit starting Wednesday and will be shown the impact of rising sea levels due to climate change in the Pacific island nation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's King Charles will be offered the title of high chief in Samoa in a three-day visit starting Wednesday and will be shown the impact of rising sea levels due to climate change in the Pacific island nation.</p>

<p>Lenatai Victor Tamapua, a Samoan chief and member of parliament, said he planned to offer the title of 'Tui Taumeasina' to the monarch during a traditional ceremonial welcome to Charles and Queen Camilla on Thursday.</p>

<p>He will later lead Charles through a walkway on a mangrove reserve highlighting the impact of climate change on the Pacific nations and its communities.</p>

<p>"The king tide today is about twice that it was 20, 30 years ago, and that is affecting our land, and it's eating away at some of the areas that are so hard for us to control, and people (have to) move inwards, inland now," Tamapua said.</p>

<p>Charles has spent a lifetime campaigning on environmental issues and in 2020 described global warming and climate change as the greatest threat that humanity has faced.</p>

<p>The offer of a high chief title for Charles comes after he was accused of "genocide" by an Australian Indigenous senator at Parliament House in Canberra during the monarch's six-day visit to Australia which concluded on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Australian royal tour was Charles' inaugural visit to an overseas realm as sovereign, his first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer, and his first visit by a British monarch to Australia in 13 years.</p>

<p>Charles is head of state in Australia, New Zealand and 12 other Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom, although the role is largely ceremonial.</p>

<p>He is also the symbolic head of the Commonwealth and is travelling to Samoa, his first to the island of around 200,000 people, for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. He is expected to leave Samoa on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Over half of the Commonwealth's members are small states, many of them Pacific island nations facing the threat of rising sea levels caused by climate change. The leaders are expected to make a declaration on protecting the ocean, with climate change a key topic for discussion.</p>

<p>Britain has said it will not bring the issue of reparations for historical transatlantic slavery, demanded by Caribbean countries, to the table at CHOGM, but is open to engage with leaders who want to discuss it.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The '#HandsOffMyPorn' campaign is warning viewers that prominent allies of Donald Trump want to ban pornography and lock up the stars who bring it to vivid, graphic life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Donald Trump may have become involved with a porn star, but if elected president he could try shutting down the entire industry, adult film stars are warning in a push to get young men to vote against the Republican next month.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign has spent $200,000 so far on ads to run on adult websites, warning viewers that prominent allies of Trump want to ban pornography and lock up the stars who bring it to vivid, graphic life.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">And they want Americans to fight back at the ballot box.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"If you care about adult entertainment, if you consume or create adult entertainment, you gotta vote November 5," porn actress Siouxsie Q told AFP. "There's no two ways about it."</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The initiative comes in response to Project 2025, a blueprint for reshaping the federal government should Trump, the Republican nominee, win the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Page five of the 900-page tome's foreword states: "Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned."</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025. But dozens of his allies and former administration members co-wrote the document, and Democrats have argued that many of its policies match his own positions.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign is aimed primarily at men, who are four times more likely to report watching porn than women, according to the Institute for Family Studies.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Just weeks before the extremely close US election between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, pollsters report a giant gender division among voters.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Trump enjoys a strong lead among male voters, regularly taking his machismo-drenched pitch to young men on right-wing podcasts.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Now, #HandsOffMyPorn's "public service announcements" are being played to users in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, often just before they watch adult videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Stars like Siouxsie Q appear and say: "Hey, I know you're busy. I know you're doing something. Hold on. If you want to keep doing this, you really need to vote on November 5... Enjoy!"</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Harris is not in any way affiliated with the #HandsOffMyPorn campaign, which is paid for by the independent Artists United for Change committee, noted Siouxsie Q.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"Hopefully, secretly, she likes what we're doing," she added.</p>

<h3><strong>'Lightning rod'</strong></h3>

<p>Crackdowns on pornography are nothing new for the United States.</p>

<p>But Holly Randall, a 26-year veteran of the adult industry, said she has never seen such a potentially devastating threat to the sector.</p>

<p>That even includes when her parents, who worked in porn during Ronald Reagan's crackdown in the 1980s, had to film hardcore scenes in secret.</p>

<p>"I've seen these attacks come and go.... Project 2025, is the most explicit iteration of wanting to completely outlaw porn," she said.</p>

<p>"Absolutely, I am worried about imprisonment," added Siouxsie Q, who made her name performing in feminist, queer and bondage films, before moving on to producing.</p>

<p>Porn stars also warn that the consequences could extend far beyond even their wildly popular industry.</p>

<p>According to Siouxsie Q, pornography is the "canary in the coal mine" for the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. She pointed also to Republican-led banning of sex education books from school libraries.</p>

<p>And Randall said adult entertainment is a "lightning rod" for wider issues such as trans rights, same-sex marriage and even reproductive rights.</p>

<p>"It's always the easiest thing to attack, because it represents people's uncertainty and fear about the changing morals of sexuality and of gender fluidity," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Outlawed'</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has repeatedly claimed he has nothing to do with Project 2025.</p>

<p>However, a New York Times investigation this week found "well over half" of the document's authors had been in Trump's previous administration or on his campaign or transition teams.</p>

<p>Randall noted the irony of Trump -- convicted for fraud over "hush money" payments to porn star Stormy Daniels -- becoming embroiled in the movement, even if she suspects he personally "doesn't actually care whether or not it's outlawed."</p>

<p>"But it's the people around him, like (Trump running mate) J.D. Vance, these ultra-right-wing conservatives, who want to ban porn," she said.</p>

<p>Vance wrote the foreword to an upcoming book by Kevin D. Roberts -- the author of the Project 2025 section that calls for a ban on porn.</p>

<p>"I think Trump will easily step aside and allow that to happen," said Randall.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karen Makishima is the only female running for Japan's ruling party in her 20-seat prefecture for the Oct. 27 general election, reflecting the tough battle women face in breaking into the country's male dominated politics.</p>

<p>Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has promised to narrow one of the widest gender gaps among lawmakers in the democratic world, but even with a record fifth of all election candidates being women, it and other parties will likely fail to hit a government target of 35% female lower house candidates by 2025.</p>

<p>While surveys show societal attitudes towards women in Japan are a barrier, some also say the ruling LDP, which has governed for almost all the post-war period, is not serious about shrinking the gender gap in lawmakers, citing its failure to implement bolder measures.</p>

<p>Only 16% of LDP candidates in the upcoming poll are women, compared with 22% for the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), according to a Reuters' analysis.</p>

<p>Gender inequality may not be a top issue in the snap election, but the scandal-hit LDP, which also faces an upper house poll by July, needs every vote, both from men and women, with polls suggesting it may lose its long-held majority.</p>

<p>Between making stump speeches and posing for photos in her coastal constituency of Odawara, about two hours drive from the capital Tokyo, Makishima told Reuters that female candidates struggle to overcome societal views that the long hours and cut and thrust of Japanese politics is not for women.</p>

<p>"The biggest drawback of having a low number of female legislators is that it doesn't change the traditional perceptions, such as that women are not suited to politics," said Makishima.</p>

<p>Japan's perennial gender gap problem has become a source of international embarrassment.</p>

<p>It currently has just over 10% female lawmakers in its lower house versus an average of 30% in other Group of Seven (G7) advanced democracies, according to a 2024 G7 report. It ranked 118 out of 146 countries in this year's World Economic Forum gender gap report.</p>

<p>Last year the LDP set its own party gender target of 30% female lawmakers by 2033, but some gender equality experts say the party needs more concrete plans like gender quotas.</p>

<p>"The LDP's dominance is really key to why there are so few women in politics," said Emma Dalton, a senior lecturer at Australia's La Trobe University who has studied gender inequality in Japan.</p>

<p>Some of its lawmakers agree that its time for bolder action.</p>

<p>Tomomi Inada, a former defence minister, told Reuters she believed the party should consider implementing a quota system or set out a detailed plan for how it will hit its promised 30% female lawmakers by 2033.</p>

<p>"A realistic path, that's what we need," she said.</p>

<p>In an emailed response to Reuters questions', the LDP said it had no plans for quotas and limited scope to add female candidates in the election because many of its seats were held by incumbents. While parties must support women in politics, "a shift in societal attitudes is also necessary," the LDP said.</p>

<p>Distorted Democracy</p>

<p>The issues facing women in politics in Japan include gender stereotypes, difficulties balancing other commitments such as child rearing, and harassment, according to report issued by the government in 2021.</p>

<p>"When I've been out campaigning, people have kicked my signs, and when I have responded to discriminatory remarks some people have said, 'how dare a woman talk back!'," said Harumi Yoshida, the shadow minister for gender equality in the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ).</p>

<p>Nearly 60% of female respondents to a survey of more than 5,000 local lawmakers in 2020-21 said they had suffered harassment from the public or colleagues versus a third of male respondents.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, newly-anointed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba unveiled a new cabinet with just two women in what a rights group called a "clear backslide" in efforts towards gender parity. The CDPJ's shadow cabinet had eight.</p>

<p>In a letter to LDP leadership a week later, Inada and a group of other female lawmakers said the low number of women in parliament "distorts democracy itself".</p>

<p>The letter made several recommendations to improve gender parity in the election including ranking women higher on lists of non-constituency candidates selected by proportional representation, which gives them a better chance of winning seats.</p>

<p>A Reuters' review of those lists found higher rankings mainly dominated by men. The LDP said a record 39% of its candidates on the lists were female but declined to comment on their ranking.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Makishima, who won her seat by a large margin in 2021, remains hopeful for broader change.</p>

<p>"We are in a transitional period," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Inside her cafe in the frontline Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, Anna appeared calm as she poured a capuccino, filling the room with the scent of Java roast. Russian troops are barely 10 kilometres (six miles) from the city but here, the sounds of war are drowned out by the whir of the coffee machine.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"Our defenders need us," the 35-year-old said, praising the many Ukrainian soldiers stationed in the city.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"They also want to have their good cup of hot coffee with a hot dog," she added.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Despite urgent calls to evacuate as Moscow's army closes in, thousands of people have chosen to stay in Pokrovsk, often elderly residents who have lived in the city their whole lives.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Anna's cafe, with its window display of candy-pink doughnuts, offers a brief semblance of normality to those who have remained.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">It allows them to socialise and enjoy simple comforts while they try and deal with the trauma of living in a war zone.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Two weeks ago, the cafe's manager wanted to close the business, when Russian troops increased their bombardment of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub, but Anna was adamant they remain open.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"We told him: 'Please, let us work!'" she said.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"The guys come by and say: 'Oh you're open. Thank God,'" she said of the soldiers.</p>

<h3><strong>'It's really scary'</strong></h3>

<p>In the eastern Donetsk region, overstretched and outmanned Ukrainian soldiers are ceding dozens of towns and villages to Moscow as the Kremlin ramps up its offensive.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk was home to around 60,000 people before the February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>By October this year only 12,000 were left, many having fled since the summer, when Russian attacks on the city intensified.</p>

<p>Yevgen, a customer, said places like Anna's were essential.</p>

<p>"Thanks to them for continuing to work," the 52-year-old told AFP, tea in one hand and cigarette in the other.</p>

<p>"You can at least come, socialise, even meet friends here," he added.</p>

<p>"Everyone has to have their own place like that."</p>

<p>Pokrovsk doesn't have many similar spots left.</p>

<p>When Anna spoke about the many shops that had closed, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"It was all full of life," she recalled. Now, "it's really scary".</p>

<p>Anna has already sent her family away and her time in Pokrovsk is also running out. She reckons the cafe only has two weeks left before the situation becomes too dangerous.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk already looks like a ghost town.</p>

<p>Public transport is no longer running and most residents do not stay outside for long.</p>

<h3><strong>'Our pizza makers left'</strong></h3>

<p>Not far from Anna's cafe, one of the last restaurants still open advertises pizzas dripping with melted cheese.</p>

<p>But pizza is no longer on the menu, said Svitlana, 39, who works both in the kitchen and front of house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Electricity has become a rare commodity, and the restaurant can no longer turn on its pizza oven.</p>

<p>"All our pizza makers left," she said, sighing.</p>

<p>Apart from that, "we have everything", she said, with pride. "Meat, first course, main course."</p>

<p>The restaurant also lacks running water, like almost the whole of Pokrovsk, so has to rely on a private well and bottled water.</p>

<p>But Svitlana is not giving up.</p>

<p>For local residents, many of whom have no electricity at all, her establishment with its generator makes it possible "to have a warm meal", she said.</p>

<p>'There's no way out'</p>

<p>Under the glare of a white fluorescent light, Svitlana served dishes to her eager customers, while the fridge was stocked with sodas and a few non-alcoholic beers.</p>

<p>The sale of alcohol is banned in several regions close to the front line.</p>

<p>At one table, 60-year-old Igor had just finished his soup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He used to eat at the canteen at the mine where he works but he told AFP it was destroyed by a Russian missile.</p>

<p>Despite the risks, he still comes to the restaurant, which he said allows him to feel "like a normal person".</p>

<p>At the till, Valery, a regular, was waiting for his order.</p>

<p>"We won't let them go anywhere," said the 71-year-old pensioner with gold teeth, glancing at Svitlana.</p>

<p>At this point, the waitresses are "combat veterans", he smiled.</p>

<p>But he knows this cannot last.</p>

<p>A native of Pokrovsk, he plans to leave but keeps putting it off.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to leave everything. But there's no way out."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has recently donated about $50 million to a nonprofit organization supporting Kamala Harris' US presidential run, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The donation to Future Forward, the main outside fund-raising group backing Harris, was meant to stay under wraps as Gates has not publicly endorsed the Democrat candidate, who is up against Republican Donald Trump in the November 5 US presidential election.</p>

<p>According to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/elections/bill-gates-future-forward-kamala-harris.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NYT report</a>, Gates, in private calls this year to friends and others, has also expressed "concern" about what a second <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-targets-latino-voters-as-race-with-harris-enters-final-two-weeks-6849983" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> presidency would look like.</p>

<p>His philanthropic organization, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is significantly concerned about potential cuts to family planning and global health programs if Trump is elected again, the report said.</p>

<p>Gates, however, has stressed that he could work with either candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement in response to the NYT report, Gates stressed his bipartisanship, but also said that "this election is different."</p>

<p>"I support candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change in the US and around the world," he told The New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have a long history of working with leaders across the political spectrum, but this election is different, with unprecedented significance for Americans and the most vulnerable people around the world," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with FRANCE 24 in July, when <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-vs-donald-trump-campaigns-take-up-pace-in-final-stages-of-election-6843983" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> was made the new Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid, Gates had welcomed the prospect of "somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI".&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Harris turned 60 last week, her rival Trump is 78 and is the oldest nominee for president in United States history.</p>

<p>Gates' ex-wife and philanthropist Melinda French Gates had earlier publicly endorsed 60-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>According to Forbes, at least <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/billionaires-funding-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-in-2024-6778853" target="_blank">81 billionaires have so far backed Harris</a> in her fight against Trump. But one of the world's richest men&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-elon-musk-donates-nearly-75-million-for-donald-trumps-presidential-cause-6807420" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> is supporting Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taipei said Wednesday it had detected a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing towards waters separating Taiwan and China, a day after Beijing held a live-fire exercise near the self-ruled island.</p>

<p>China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has ramped up military activity around the island in recent years to pressure Taipei into accepting its claims of sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Liaoning aircraft carrier group was spotted overnight in waters near the Taipei-administered Pratas Islands, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) southwest of Taiwan, and heading north towards the sensitive Taiwan Strait. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese navy vessels "led by the aircraft carrier Liaoning, sailed through waters near Dongsha (the Pratas Islands) and continued northward toward the Taiwan Strait," Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement on the social media platform X.</p>

<p>Taiwan's military "monitored the situation and responded accordingly", the ministry said.</p>

<p>The Liaoning took part in China's large-scale military drills around Taiwan last week that were condemned by Taipei and its key backer Washington.</p>

<p>China sent a record number of fighter jets as well as warships to encircle Taiwan in what Beijing said was a "stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces".</p>

<p>That was followed by an announcement that China would hold a live-fire exercise on Tuesday in an area about 105 kilometres from Taiwan.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, a US and a Canadian warship passed through the 180-kilometre Taiwan Strait, part of regular passages by Washington and its allies meant to reinforce its status as an international waterway.</p>

<p>Beijing condemned the passage as disrupting "peace and stability" in the strait.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

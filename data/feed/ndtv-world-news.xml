       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Ohio woman and her boyfriend have been arrested following a shocking incident in which her 6-year-old son was handcuffed as a form of "corporal punishment" before being attacked by a pit bull, according to police. Angelina Williams, 27, of Cleveland, and her boyfriend, Taylor Marvin-Brown, now face charges of endangering children and obstructing justice.</p>

<p>In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ashlandcountysheriff.org/news-releases/2024/8/20/savannah"><em>release,</em></a> the Ashland County Police said, "On Saturday, August 17, 2024, at 5:06 pm the cops received a 911 call for a squad to be sent to 23 Chapel Street, Savannah, Ohio. Dispatchers were told that a Pitbull had bitten a 6-year-old child on the neck and ear. When the squad members and deputies arrived, the child was in serious condition, and Life Flight was called. Deputies identified the mother as Angelina Williams of Cleveland, Ohio, who was living with a family member of Robert Michalski, who was the owner of the house and dog. Robert had left the house with Pitbull prior to deputies arriving."</p>

<p>Detectives and deputies learnt through an investigation that the 6-year-old child had been restrained with handcuffs on his hands and feet when the Pitbull attacked him.</p>

<p>A search warrant was executed at the house where deputies recovered evidence to support the investigation. Also, they found Robert and the Pitbull hiding in a cubbyhole upstairs at the residence. The Pitbull was taken into custody to be housed as a vicious dog.</p>

<p>Angelina Williams and Robert Michalski were taken into custody and taken to jail. Angelina's boyfriend, Taylor Desiree Marvin-Brown, was at the house and assisted with the restraining of the 6-year-old child. She was taken into custody along with Williams and Michalski.</p>

<p>The investigation will continue, and the case will be forwarded to the Ashland County Prosecutor's Office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Iraqi criminal court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for a businessman and a former government official wanted over their alleged involvement in stealing $2.5 billion of public funds.</p>

<p>The scandal dubbed the "heist of the century", sparked widespread anger in Iraq, which is ravaged by rampant corruption, unemployment and decaying infrastructure after decades of conflict.</p>

<p>The criminal court issued the warrants for businessman Nour Zuhair and Haitham al-Juburi, a former adviser to then prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, state news agency INA reported.</p>

<p>The two suspects are among several facing a trial which opened in mid-August, but are on the run and failed to appear in court.</p>

<p>According to the tax authorities, the defendants allegedly expropriated the $2.5 billion between September 2021 and August 2022 through 247 cheques cashed by five companies.</p>

<p>The money was subsequently withdrawn -- in cash -- from the firms' accounts.</p>

<p>The owners of those accounts -- most of whom are also on the run -- have also been subject to arrest warrants.</p>

<p>Around 30 suspects are facing trial, INA reported, including six already behind bars or awaiting extradition to Iraq, the national anti-fraud agency has said.</p>

<p>In October 2022, Zuhair was arrested at Baghdad airport as he was trying to leave the country.</p>

<p>A month later he was released on bail after giving back more than $125 million and pledging to return the rest in instalments.</p>

<p>Juburi also returned $2.6 million of the allegedly embezzled funds before disappearing, a judicial source told AFP.</p>

<p>The current whereabouts of both men is unknown.</p>

<p>However, wealthy businessman Zuhair was back in the news over the few days after he reportedly had a car crash in Lebanon, following an interview he gave to an Iraqi news channel.</p>

<p>"The Nour Zuhair affair is a scandal... that concerns the entire political system," Iraqi journalist and commentator Hamed al-Sayyed told AFP.</p>

<p>He blamed the authorities for releasing him on bail two years ago, allowing him "to flee".</p>

<p>"His release from jail, at a time when he was being investigated, shows that the political system, at the highest echelons, is complicit," Sayyed added.</p>

<p>Corruption is endemic in Iraqi state institutions, with the top echelons of power often evading accountability.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Singapore soon to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two nations. The specific dates for the prime minister's official visit are not known yet, but it will happen shortly, a top official said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Singapore was mentioned by Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan after senior ministers of India and Singapore concluded a high-level meeting to further their strategic ties.</p>

<p>A four-member Indian delegation comprising Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, and Railway &amp; IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw participated in the second India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) in Singapore.</p>

<p>Calling the meeting "productive", Mr Balakrishnan said, "We will, very shortly, be announcing an official visit by Prime Minister Modi to Singapore. I cannot give you the specific date, but it will occur shortly".</p>

<p>During the multi-ministerial meeting, the two countries discussed ways to boost bilateral cooperation in the digital arena, skill development, sustainability, healthcare, connectivity and manufacturing.</p>

<p>Mr Balakrishnan further said that advanced manufacturing and semiconductors, as well as aviation and maritime connectivity are the new areas that Singapore and India have added to their bilateral talks.</p>

<p>"A country with more than 1.4 billion people is now embarking on a major upgrade of its aviation sector. This is a once in a two, three-decade opportunity, and it's good that we are, in a sense, in the front seat and have a chance (to collaborate)," he said.</p>

<p>At the meeting, Singapore was represented by Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, Digital Development and Information Minister Josephine Teo, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng and Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat.</p>

<p>"During the meeting, the ministers reaffirmed the close and long-standing relationship between the two nations, underpinned by strong economic and people-to-people ties," Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a joint release.</p>

<p>Besides a link-up between Singapore's PayNow and India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in February 2023, which lets financial institutions from both sides transfer funds in real time, the two countries have also facilitated investments in renewable energy, such as green ammonia.</p>

<p>"I am confident that the discussions we had today and those in the future will pave the way to foster greater collaboration between Singapore and India," Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>An official announcement by the Ministry of External Affairs regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit is awaited.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said the West was playing with fire by considering allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with Western missiles and cautioned the United States on Tuesday that World War Three would not be confined to Europe.</p>

<p>Ukraine attacked Russia's western Kursk region on Aug. 6 and has carved out a slice of territory in the biggest foreign attack on Russia since World War Two. President Vladimir Putin said there would be a worthy response from Russia to the attack.</p>

<p>Sergei Lavrov, who has served as Putin's foreign minister for more than 20 years, said that the West was seeking to escalate the Ukraine war and was "asking for trouble" by considering Ukrainian requests to loosen curbs on using foreign-supplied weapons.</p>

<p>Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly warned of the risk of a much broader war involving the world's biggest nuclear powers, though he has said Russia does not want a conflict with the U.S.-led NATO alliance.</p>

<p>"We are now confirming once again that playing with fire - and they are like small children playing with matches - is a very dangerous thing for grown-up uncles and aunts who are entrusted with nuclear weapons in one or another Western country," Lavrov told reporters in Moscow.</p>

<p>"Americans unequivocally associate conversations about the Third World War as something that, God forbid, if it happens, will affect Europe exclusively," Lavrov said.</p>

<p>Lavrov added that Russia was "clarifying" its nuclear doctrine.</p>

<p>Russia's 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out when its president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons "when the very existence of the state is put under threat".</p>

<p><strong>RUSSIA'S RESPONSE</strong></p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier this month that the assault on Russia's Kursk region showed that Kremlin threats of retaliation were a bluff.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy said Ukraine, because of the restrictions imposed by allies, could not use the weapons at its disposal to hit some Russian military targets. He urged allies to be bolder in their decisions about how to help Kyiv in the war.</p>

<p>Russia has said that Western weaponry, including British tanks and U.S. rocket systems, have been used by Ukraine in Kursk. Kyiv has confirmed using U.S. HIMARS missiles to take out bridges in Kursk.</p>

<p>Washington says it was not informed about Ukraine's plans ahead of the surprise incursion into Kursk. The United States has also said it did not take any part in the operation.</p>

<p>Putin's foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, said on Tuesday that Moscow did not believe Western assertions that it had nothing to do with the Kursk attack. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the involvement of the United States was "an obvious fact".</p>

<p>The New York Times reported that the United States and Britain provided Ukraine with satellite imagery and other information about the Kursk region in the days after the Ukrainian attack.</p>

<p>The Times said that the intelligence was aimed at helping Ukraine keep better track of Russian reinforcements.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five more murder cases have been filed against Bangladesh's ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina taking the total number of cases filed against the Awami League leader to 71, a media report said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Four of the new cases were filed in Dhaka and one in Rajshahi against the 76-year-old deposed former prime minister, several former ministers and police officials, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>In the first case, Hasina and 48 others were booked for the death of one Dulal alias Selim in the city's Jatrabari area on August 3 during mass protests.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Mostafa Kamal filed the case against the Awami League president and others with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Saddam Hossain.</p>

<p>Former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader, former Awami League lawmakers Shamim Osman and Ramesh Chandra are among the accused, The Daily Star said.</p>

<p>In the second case, Sheikh Hasina along with 21 others was booked on the charge of killing one Mansur Miah, a machine operator of Buriganga Filling Station at Basila of Mohammadpur on July 19.</p>

<p>In the third case, Sheikh Hasina and 91 others were sued for the death of one Miraz Hossain at Sanarpar in the city's Demra area on August 5.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Khorshed Alam filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Belal Hossain.</p>

<p>The fourth case was filed against Sheikh Hasina and 40 others for the death of 21-year-old Nahidul Islam at Mirpur-10 on July 19.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Md Sabuj filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mehedi Hasan.</p>

<p>Quader, Asaduzzaman, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana, son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Harun Or Rashid and former DMP commissioner are among the accused.</p>

<p>In Rajshahi, SM Salahuddin Ahmmed Shamim Sarkar, a member of Bagha upazila Chhatra Dal in Rajshahi, filed a case against Hasina, former state minister for foreign affairs Shahriar Alam and 52 others, said Bagha police station's officer-in-charge Abu Siddque.</p>

<p>The number of cases filed against Hasina has risen to 71 with four new cases filed in Dhaka, the report said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India on August 5 after unprecedented anti-government student-led protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs.</p>

<p>The Hasina-led government was replaced by an interim government, and 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was named its Chief Adviser.</p>

<p>Over 230 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government, taking the death count to more than 600 since the massive protest by students against a controversial quota system in government jobs first started in mid-July.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops have recovered an Israeli hostage in "a complex rescue operation" in the southern Gaza Strip, the military said on Tuesday, more than 10 months after he was abducted by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7.</p>

<p>It said 52-year-old Qaid Farhan Alkadi, a member of the Bedouin community in southern Israel, had been transferred to a hospital and his medical condition was normal.</p>

<p>The operation, following the rescue of four Israeli hostages in June, comes as talks have continued to try to agree a halt to the fighting in Gaza and the return of more than 100 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>"We are doing everything to save the hostages," the head of the military Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israeli television stations showed a military helicopter landing at a hospital as medical staff stood by.</p>

<p>Alkadi was taken hostage in Kibbutz Magen, one of a string of communities around the Gaza Strip that were attacked by Hamas-led fighters on Oct. 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 39-year-old woman died on the first day of Burning Man, the popular counterculture festival held annually in the Nevada desert, according to the New York Post. Kendra Frazer was found unresponsive at the festival around 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, and despite efforts to revive her, she was pronounced dead, Burning Man organizers said in a statement.</p>

<p>Pershing County Sheriff Jerry Allen stated that the cause of death is under investigation, pending autopsy and toxicology results, in a statement shared on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=904349431727786&amp;set=a.329297399232995" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Facebook</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Kendra's family and friends," Allen added.</p>

<p>Authorities noted that the death occurred before the official start of the event, which festival organizers confirmed began at 6 p.m. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/us-news/woman-dies-at-opening-day-at-burning-man-festival/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The New York Post</em></a> also reported that participants were not permitted to enter the festival until midnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>"It is with heavy hearts that Burning Man Project confirms the death of a participant in Black Rock City in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family and friends affected by this loss. The participant has been identified by the Pershing County Sheriff's Office as 39-year-old Kendra Frazer," Burning Man organisers said in a statement.</p>

<p>"On Sunday, August 25, 2024, at 11:29 am, Burning Man's emergency services personnel responded to a report of an unresponsive individual. Once on scene, life-saving measures were immediately attempted but were unsuccessful," they added.</p>

<p>Burning Man is a nine-day festival centred around community and art, culminating in the symbolic burning of a large wooden effigy.</p>

<p>The event takes place in Black Rock City, a temporary city constructed in the Black Rock Desert of northwestern Nevada.</p>

<p>According to the <em>Guardian</em>, the festival began early Sunday after the gates were closed for 12 hours due to severe weather.</p>

<p>About 20,000 people were already on the Playa - a silt-alkaline salt flat - before the gates reopened, and organizers anticipate more than 70,000 attendees throughout the nine-day event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that his military had recently carried out the first successful test of a domestically produced ballistic missile.</p>

<p>His announcement in Kyiv came in the wake of two consecutive nights of large-scale Russian bombardments across Ukraine that killed several people and battered energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>"There has been a positive test of the first Ukrainian ballistic missile. I congratulate our defence industry on this. I can't share any more details about this missile," he said at a press conference in the Ukrainian capital.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite a late-season boost, the overall cyclone activity remains below historical averages, and direct hits on Hawaii are rare due to environmental factors.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 Northeast Pacific hurricane season, which had been quiet up until recently, got a late-week shot in the arm. On August 25, Hurricane Hone-which had developed from a disturbance well southeast of Hawaii-reached Category 1 intensity before passing south of the Big Island, according to <em>the NASA Earth Observatory.</em></p>

<p>Though Hone did not strike the island chain directly, it still delivered damaging winds, soaking rains, and life-threatening surf. Some parts of Hawaii received more than 10 inches (25 centimetres) of rain within 24 hours and faced localised flash floods. Some 24,000 utility customers lost power initially, though the number dropped to 2,400 by the afternoon of August 26, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://poweroutage.us/area/state/hawaii"><em>PowerOutage.us.</em></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Hone continued to move along west, Hurricane Gilma did the same, reaching Category 3 but was likely weakening owing to unfavourable weather. In the eastern Pacific, the other troublemaker was Tropical Storm Hector, expected to fade.</p>

<p>This new breed of planetary storms received further attention from the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA), which is thought to have combined three of the most powerful storms in Earth's memory into a stunning video showing them wreak havoc over an ocean.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>These planetary storms are documented in the video as merging over the vast ocean.</p>

<p>This season has seen the Northeast Pacific spawn just nine named storms, most of them very short-lived despite that late surge. Nevertheless, Hone and Gilma, collectively, did a lot to put a better dent in the overall activity for the basin this season. Researchers say that so far this season, accumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, is running below the historical average, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153242/storms-line-the-northeast-pacific"><em>NASA Earth Observatory.</em></a></p>

<p>While direct hits to Hawaii are quite rare, tropical storms do occasionally make runs at the state. Strong wind shear, a steering high-pressure system, and colder ocean temperatures usually break apart or weaken the storm before it makes a direct landfall on the islands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relations between Moscow and Paris have reached a nadir following the arrest of Russian-born Telegram boss Pavel Durov, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, after the tech billionaire's detention was extended until Wednesday.</p>

<p>Durov, who has French as well as Russian nationality, was arrested near Paris over the weekend as part of an investigation into crimes related to images of child sex abuse, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions on the platform, French prosecutors said on Monday.</p>

<p>It remains unclear if he knew about the threat of arrest in France. Durov's French lawyer did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Durov's arrest has plunged Moscow-Paris ties to their lowest level, Lavrov said on Tuesday, capping months of deteriorating relations between the two nations.</p>

<p>French authorities accused Russia of trying to destabilise it ahead of the Paris Olympics in response to its more hawkish stance on the Ukraine war - claims Russia has denied.</p>

<p>Durov's detention was extended by 48 hours late on Monday, a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor's office said on Tuesday. After that, prosecutors will either need to charge or release him. Should he face charges, his flight risk status is a factor judges have to include in their assessment of possible pretrial detention, according to French law.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday that Russia was ready to provide Durov with all necessary assistance given his Russian citizenship, but that his French citizenship complicated the situation. Durov also holds a UAE passport.</p>

<p>"The charges are very serious indeed," said Peskov. "They require a no less serious basis of evidence. Otherwise they will be a direct attempt to limit freedom of communication."</p>

<p>FREE SPEECH DEBATE</p>

<p>Durov's arrest has sparked a debate about the limits of free speech online, with X-owner Elon Musk saying the right to expression in Europe was under attack. It also underlines a movement by governments around the world to take a tougher line on policing illegal activity that flourishes on some platforms.</p>

<p>Brazil's supreme court briefly suspended Telegram nationwide in 2022 over its failure to comply with judicial orders.</p>

<p>With close to 1 billion users, Telegram is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. It presents itself as a haven for free speech, but is also widely used by far-right, anti-vax and conspiracist movements, as well as political dissidents.</p>

<p>The platform has become crucial to battlefield communications in the war in Ukraine and is used by governments and soldiers on both sides of the war to share war-related news and propaganda.</p>

<p>Without providing evidence, Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, earlier said the United States, through France, was attempting to exert control over Telegram.</p>

<p>"Telegram is one of the few and at the same time the largest Internet platforms over which the United States has no influence," Volodin said in a post.</p>

<p>"On the eve of the U.S. presidential election, it is important for (President Joe) Biden to take Telegram under control."</p>

<p>The White House has yet to comment on Durov's arrest.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who is known to be an avid user of the app, has said that the arrest was "in no way a political decision".</p>

<p>Russia has previously tried, and failed, to block Telegram and fined the company several times for failing to delete what it deemed illegal content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of Indian student graduates have staged protests against a new federal policy in Canada that puts them at risk of getting deported from the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many international students, particularly those from India, dream of moving to the North American country in hopes of building a better life, but the announced immigration policy changes have left the future of more than 70,000 student graduates in uncertainty.</p>

<p>Indian students have camped in front of the legislative assembly in Canada's Prince Edward Island province, protesting the sudden policy change for more than three months. Similar demonstrations were also seen in the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia.</p>

<p>The new policies are aimed at reducing the number of permanent residency nominations by 25 per cent as well as limiting study permits.</p>

<p>The change comes as Canada saw rapid population growth over the last few years. Around 97 per cent of last year's population increase in Canada was driven by immigration, according to Federal data.</p>

<p>Representatives from student advocacy group Naujawan Support Network warned the graduates are at risk of being deported when their work permits expire at the end of this year.</p>

<p>"I spent the most crucial six years of my life taking many risks to come to Canada," says Mehakdeep Singh, a former international student who is facing deportation.</p>

<p>"For the past six years, I studied, I worked, I paid taxes, I earned enough CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) points but the government has just taken advantage of us," Mr Singh said.</p>

<p>Like many international students, Mr Singh had spent his family's life savings on college tuition fees in the hopes of eventually gaining permanent residency.</p>

<p>Amid a local housing and jobs crisis, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is under pressure to reduce the number of temporary residents, which has seen a staggering growth in recent years. Mr Trudeau has been trailing in polls ahead of an election expected next year.</p>

<p>The Canadian government is also reducing the number of temporary foreign workers it brings in, reversing its decision to expand the programme in 2022. The programme allows immigrants to work in the country on a short-term basis, meant to fill labour shortages.</p>

<p>According to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), 183,820 temporary foreign worker permits were granted in 2023, a steep 88 per cent increase from 2019. The ESDC on Monday criticised employers for using the programme to "circumvent hiring talented workers in Canada".</p>

<p>Under the new changes, work permits will be denied in regions where the unemployment rate is at or above 6 per cent. The changes will exempt sectors like agriculture, food processing, construction and healthcare.</p>

<p>"We're looking at the various streams to make sure that as we move forward, Canada remains a place that is positive in its support for immigration, but also responsible in the way we integrate and make sure there's pathways to success for everyone who comes to Canada," Justin Trudeau told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>The government has also promised more measures to reduce the temporary resident population to 5% of Canada's total population in three years.</p>

<p>The International Sikh Student Organization, an advocacy group, insisted that the prevailing employment and housing issues are rooted in broader policy failures rather than the migration of international students.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight people were stabbed and police arrested hundreds during last weekend's Notting Hill Carnival, one of the world's largest street festivals held annually in west London.</p>

<p>Updating on their policing operation late Monday, the capital's Metropolitan Police said five people were stabbed on the final day of the world-renowned three-day celebration of British Afro-Caribbean identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That followed three knifings on Sunday, with three of the victims of the violence over the long weekend left in a life-threatening condition, the force said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Officers made at least 230 arrests on Monday, including 49 for possession of an offensive weapon, on top of scores of arrests the previous day.</p>

<p>Three firearms were seized and 35 officers were also injured during the event, which attracts around a million people annually over the August bank holiday weekend.</p>

<p>The policing numbers were similar to last year, when there were 10 stabbings and around 300 arrests.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of revellers packed the streets of west London for the carnival, filling the Notting Hill neighbourhood and surrounding districts with colour, costumes, dancing and music.</p>

<p>Around 7,000 officers were on duty for the event, which has repeatedly been marred by violence, in particular knife crime, but is enjoyed by the vast majority incident-free.</p>

<p>However, the Met's deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said he was "tired of saying the same words every year" after a woman attending the carnival with her child was among those stabbed.</p>

<p>"We only very narrowly avoided a fatality," he added, urging carnival-goers to report any crimes they witness.</p>

<p>The celebration of British Afro-Caribbean culture traces its roots back to the 1950s after the first surge in arrivals from former British colonies post-World War II.</p>

<p>Feathered dancers, steel bands and earth-shaking sound systems feature in the vibrant yearly event.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has commended Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his "message of peace" and "humanitarian support" for Ukraine, as they discussed his historic visit to Kyiv and the prospects for the early return of peace through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>The phone conversation between Biden and Modi on Monday, initiated by the US president, came three days after Modi paid a high-profile visit to Kyiv during which he told President Zelenskyy that Ukraine and Russia should sit together to end the war and that India was ready to play an "active role" to restore peace.</p>

<p>In a post on 'X', Joe Biden said, "I spoke with Prime Minister Modi to discuss his recent trip to Poland and Ukraine, and commended him for his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine." "We also affirmed our commitment to working together to contribute to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific," Biden said.</p>

<br />

— President Biden (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1828202012971786608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This was the first call between the two leaders after PM Modi's trip to Russia, Poland and Ukraine and the recent political developments in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The White House readout of the call had no reference to Bangladesh, which was mentioned in an 'X' post by Prime Minister Modi.</p>

<p>PM Modi's nearly nine-hour visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister since its independence in 1991, came six weeks after he held summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin that triggered anguish in some Western capitals.</p>

<p>The White House, in a readout of the call, said the two leaders discussed Modi's recent trip to Poland and Ukraine, as well as the United Nations General Assembly meetings in September.</p>

<p>"The President commended the prime minister for his historic visits to Poland and Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister in decades, and for his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine, including its energy sector," it said.</p>

<p>Biden and PM Modi affirmed their continued support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict under international law, based on the UN Charter.</p>

<p>"The leaders also emphasised their continued commitment to work together, including through regional groups like the Quad, to contribute to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific," the White House said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile. commenting on Biden's telephonic conversation with Modi, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said, "I think it's safe to say they certainly talked about Ukraine and the Prime Minister's trip to Kyiv and the prospects for moving forward under President Zelenskyy's plan for a just peace.</p>

<p>"We welcome any other country that wants to help President Zelenskyy work towards this just peace," he said.</p>

<p>"And any country that's willing to come at that discussion by starting with President Zelenskyy's perspective, by hearing him out, by signing on to that proposal - and I won't speak for India and what they're signing on to or not; that's for the Prime Minister and his team to talk to," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Kirby said the US certainly welcomes any nation that is willing to be helpful and to start that conversation by ascribing to President Zelenskyy's just peace proposal and getting his perspectives.</p>

<p>Earlier, in a post on X, PM Modi said that during the call with Biden, they had a detailed exchange of views on various regional and global issues, including the situation in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"I reiterated India's full support for early return of peace and stability," the prime minister said.</p>

<p>Moreover, PM Modi said that he and Biden also discussed the ongoing situation in Bangladesh and stressed the need for the early restoration of normalcy and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus.</p>

<p>Following the unfolding political developments in Bangladesh, India has been consistently pressing to ensure the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in the neighbouring country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN nuclear watchdog head Rafael Grossi kicked off a visit Tuesday to "independently assess" conditions at Russia's Kursk nuclear plant following Ukraine's unprecedented cross-border offensive into the Russian region.</p>

<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned of the dangers of fighting around nuclear plants following Russia's full-scale military offensive into Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/russia-s-deadly-air-attack-on-ukraine-830425" target="_blank"> Russia's</a> nuclear agency, Rosatom, told AFP that Grossi had arrived at the power plant as he personally leads a mission to assess the situation there, which he has warned is "serious".</p>

<p>In the first days of the conflict, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, and also briefly held the decommissioned <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/elephants-foot-formed-by-chernobyl-disaster-is-the-most-dangerous-object-5685885" target="_blank">Chernobyl</a> plant in the north.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-video-russian-sky-scrapper-hit-by-ukrainian-drone-in-9-11-like-attack-6420941" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> launched its surprise incursion into Kursk on August 6 and has said it is making advances, even as Russian forces move deeper into eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Ukraine of trying to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is less than 50 kilometres (30 miles) from fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.</p>

<p>The IAEA confirmed that it had been told by Russian authorities that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-launches-drones-missiles-towards-kyiv-in-massive-air-attack-ukraine-military-6419804" target="_blank">drone</a> fragments were found last Thursday roughly 100 metres from the Kursk plant's spent nuclear fuel storage facility.</p>

<h3><strong>Serious situation</strong></h3>

<p>Grossi said Monday he would "independently assess what is happening" at the plant, "given the serious situation".</p>

<p>"The safety and security of all nuclear power plants is of central and fundamental concern to the IAEA," Grossi said in a statement.</p>

<p>The plant lies some 60 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border, next to the Seym river, and less than 50 kilometres away from Kursk city, the region's capital with a population of around 440,000.</p>

<p>The plant has four reactor units though only two are operational and two more reactors are under construction.</p>

<p>All four reactors are the same type as Ukraine's Chernobyl <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/safety-deteriorating-at-ukraine-nuclear-plant-after-nearby-dronea-strike-un-watchdog-6360523" target="_blank">nuclear power plant</a>, without a protecting dome around them.</p>

<p>In 1986, a reactor at Chernobyl exploded during a botched safety test, resulting in the world's worst nuclear accident that sent clouds of radiation across much of Europe and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.</p>

<p>Tariq Rauf, a former IAEA official, said these types of reactors have since undergone "significant safety upgrades".</p>

<p>Robert Kelley, a former IAEA director of inspections, said: "The possibility of a Chernobyl-type incident with the reactor blowing up and burning for days is zero."</p>

<p>But he added that an errant bomb or large artillery strike on spent fuel storage ponds could damage the fuel and release radioactive gases and particles.</p>

<h3><strong>Maximum restraint</strong></h3>

<p>Russia has repeatedly sounded the alarm over a possible hit since Ukrainian troops and tanks charged into Kursk.</p>

<p>The IAEA urged both Russia and Ukraine to exercise "maximum restraint" to "avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences".</p>

<p>On Sunday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian forces had taken control of two more Russian settlements in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-russia-both-claim-advances-in-kursk-region-6346537" target="_blank">Kursk region</a>, adding to dozens already captured.</p>

<p>More than 130,000 people have been displaced so far.</p>

<p>Kyiv has said the offensive aims to prevent cross-border strikes from Russia into its Sumy region and to force Russia to the negotiating table "on our own terms".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China said Tuesday it was "verifying" claims by Japan of the first confirmed incursion by a Chinese military aircraft into its airspace.</p>

<p>Japan <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/japan-scrambles-jets-after-china-aircraft-volates-airspace-6421337">condemned</a> the incursion as a "serious violation" of its sovereignty, saying Beijing was becoming "increasingly active".</p>

<p>Japan, a close ally of Washington, said it had scrambled fighter jets after the two-minute incursion from 11:29 am (0229 GMT) on Monday by the Y-9 surveillance aircraft off the Danjo Islands in the East China Sea.</p>

<p>Asked about Tokyo's claims, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said "The relevant Chinese departments are in the process of gathering information and verifying the situation".</p>

<p>"The two sides have maintained communication through existing working channels," he added.</p>

<p>"I would also like to emphasise here that China has no intention of intruding into the territorial airspace of any country," Lin said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Reports in Bangladesh have claimed that the flooding in the country is caused partially due to the opening of the Farakka barrage in West Bengal, prompting a fact-check by the Government of India, which trashed all such reports as "fake".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh is facing devastating floods across the country caused by relentless monsoon rain and overflowing rivers. The death count from the floods has risen to 23, and more than 12.4 lakh families are stranded across 11 districts in the country. 57 lakh people remain isolated and in urgent need of food, clean water, medicine and dry clothes.</p>

<p>In such times, reports in Bangladesh have claimed that the flooding is caused partially due to the opening of the Farakka barrage in West Bengal, prompting a fact-check by the Government of India.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs on Monday rejected all reports linking the floods in Bangladesh with the opening of Farakka barrage gates in India, calling such reports "fake".</p>

<p>"We have seen fake videos, rumours and fear-mongering to create misunderstanding. This should be firmly countered with facts," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>He added that relevant data is shared with joint river commission officials concerned in Bangladesh on a "regular and timely basis, and it was done this time as well".</p>

<p>"We have seen media reports of the opening of Farakka barrage gates that will allow the flow of over 11 lakh cusecs of water downstream of the river in its natural course into the Ganga/Padma river," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>"This is a normal seasonal development that takes place due to increased inflow from heavy rainfall in the Ganga river basin catchment areas upstream," he added.</p>

<p>Explaining in detail, Mr Jaiswal said, "It is to be understood that Farakka is only a barrage and not a dam. Whenever the water level reaches the pond level, whatever inflow comes, that passes. It is merely a structure to divert 40,000 cusecs of water into the Farakka canal that is carefully done using a system of gates on the main Ganga/Padma river, while the balance water flows into the main river to Bangladesh."</p>

<p><strong>What Is The Farakka Barrage</strong></p>

<p>The Farakka Barrage is situated on the Ganga River in West Bengal's Murshidabad district. It is located approximately 18 km from the border with Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The construction of the Farakka Barrage began in 1962 and was completed in 1970 at a cost of nearly USD 1 billion. The barrage officially commenced operations on April 21, 1975.</p>

<p>The purpose of the barrage is to merely divert 40,000 cusecs of water into the Farakka canal and is carefully done using a system of gates on the main Ganga river, while the balance water flows into the main river which then flows to Bangladesh in its natural course.</p>

<p><strong>The Farakka Barrage Agreement, 1977 And The Ganga Water Treaty, 1996</strong></p>

<p>The Ganga river flows from India into Bangladesh, where its primary distributary is known as the Padma river. The river ultimately drains into Bay of Bengal after a confluence with the river Meghna.</p>

<p>The reason for India to establish the Farakka barrage was to flush out the silt of Bhagirathi Hoogly river to ensure smooth operation of Kolkata port. Bangladesh said that Ganga is an international river, so the water from it must be regulated as per a mutual agreement.</p>

<p>The two nations, in 1972, established a Joint River Commission (JRC) to negotiate terms of the water settlement.</p>

<p>Bangaldesh opposed India's suggestions and in 1977, the then President of Bangladesh, Zia-Ur-Rehman, took the Farakka barrage issue to the United Nations General Assembly or UNGA.</p>

<p>The UNGA urged him to resolve the issue at a bilateral level.</p>

<p>In November 1977, then Deputy Prime Minister of India, Babu Jagjivan Ram went on an official visit to Bangladesh and signed an agreement to resolve the Farrakka issue.</p>

<p>In 1996, Bangladesh's Awami League and the new government signed a fresh treaty with India - known as The Ganga Water Treaty, 1996. The agreement was to share the surface waters at the Farakka Barrage near the India-Bangladesh border.</p>

<p><strong>Flood-Prone Bangladesh</strong></p>

<p>An analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in central Japan are urging beachgoers to steer clear of dolphins after a sharp increase in biting incidents, with one expert saying the culprit may be a single overly playful individual.</p>

<p>This year has so far seen 18 swimmers bitten at several beaches in the Fukui region, according to the local Tsuruga coastguard, which logged just a handful of injuries related to dolphins in each of the past two years.</p>

<p>Most of the bites were minor -- some were little more than scratches -- but in one recent incident, an elementary school child wound up requiring 20 to 30 stitches, coastguard official Shoichi Takeuchi told AFP.</p>

<p>At Suishohama Beach -- also known as "Diamond Beach" -- a local tourism association is calling for vigilance, issuing warnings on its website and handing out fliers advising people not to approach or touch the animals.</p>

<p>"Dolphins are usually calm creatures, but they can make you bleed by biting you with sharp teeth, drag you underwater and, in the worst-case scenario, threaten your life," the association warns online.</p>

<p>The coastguard said it was unclear whether a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lonely-sexually-frustrated-dolphin-behind-attacks-on-swimmers-in-japan-say-experts-6427280">single dolphin</a> was behind the incidents or whether there were multiple culprits.</p>

<p>One expert, however, thinks one rogue dolphin may be responsible for the incidents, given identifying characteristics such as its dorsal fin and scars.</p>

<p>"It is probably the work of the same individual," Tadamichi Morisaka, a professor of cetology at Mie University, told broadcaster NHK.</p>

<p>"Instead of trying to harm humans, it might be seeking to interact with humans the way it does with fellow dolphins."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The path to the White House this November runs through a handful of swing states, including Nevada, whose six electoral college votes will be crucial in deciding who gets the keys to the White House.</p>

<p>The state's vast rural hinterlands are solidly Republican and likely to all but cancel out the primarily Democratic vote in the gambling capital Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The state's final electoral color will depend on Washoe County, a long, thin strip abutting <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-ai/elon-musk-grok-ai-california-bill-elon-musk-voices-support-for-california-bill-requiring-safety-tests-on-ai-models-6426863" target="_blank">California</a>, whose main city is Reno.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are some key facts about Washoe County:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Electoral bellwether</strong></h3>

<p>Nevada as a whole is finely balanced and, for the last four decades, has voted Republican and Democratic in line with the national mood, except in 2016, when the state went for Hillary Clinton, who lost to winner <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/at-rally-in-nevada-donald-trump-proposes-ending-taxes-on-tips-5860963" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>.</p>

<p>In 2020, Joe Biden scooped the honors in the state by a wafer-thin 33,000 votes more than Trump.</p>

<p>With about half a million people, Washoe is home to just 16 percent of Nevada's population. By comparison, Clark County, which contains Las Vegas, has more than four times as many people.</p>

<p>But Washoe punches way above its weight.</p>

<p>"It ultimately decides how Nevada votes in the national elections," political scientist Fred Lokken told AFP.</p>

<p>A look at the voter rolls reveals why: independents represent 30.8 percent of registered voters, compared to 31.4 percent who are <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/our-party-acts-like-a-cult-anti-trump-republicans-at-democrat-event-6390844" target="_blank">Republicans</a> and 29.8 percent who are Democrats.</p>

<p>Unlike their fellow Americans, however, Nevadans unhappy with the choice of Trump or Kamala Harris can simply vote "None of these candidates" -- an official option on the ballot.</p>

<h3><strong>Quickie divorces</strong></h3>

<p>Washoe County borders the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains. Its desert expanses host the annual <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/exodus-begins-at-drenched-burning-man-festival-in-us-desert-4360197" target="_blank">Burning Man festival</a>, but most of the population is concentrated in its capital Reno.</p>

<p>The self-proclaimed "Biggest Little City in the World" was America's divorce capital for much of the 20th century, with a lively procession of visitors from elsewhere in the country eager to dissolve unhappy unions with a minimum of fuss.</p>

<p>Splitting up may have been historically easy in Washoe. However, Nevada's famously legal brothels would require a drive: Washoe is among a handful of counties in the state where prostitution is not allowed.</p>

<h3><strong>Battery power</strong></h3>

<p>Electric car giant Tesla built a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/elon-musks-mother-visits-tesla-gigafactory-in-texas-shares-pic-5491734" target="_blank">gigafactory</a> -- a massive manufacturing facility for electrification and other high-tech EV technology -- just outside Reno in 2014, kickstarting the green power industrial revolution in Washoe.</p>

<p>Panasonic and Google followed suit, and the area is now home to a booming high tech and manufacturing sector, aided by attractive tax incentives.</p>

<p>Tech companies, many of which relocated from high-tax California, brought with them good-paying jobs, reducing the county's reliance on tourism.</p>

<p>The influx of tech workers could be changing the political complexion of Washoe.</p>

<p>"This workforce is primarily male and in their twenties," said Lokken.</p>

<p>"If they vote, they're more likely not to vote Republican," he said -- and "this could push us into the blue column as a state."</p>

<h3><strong>Latino vote</strong></h3>

<p>The flipside of this gentrification has been the pressure it has brought to bear on some of the state's poorer people.</p>

<p>The average price of a single-family home in Washoe County is now $550,000, double what it was less than a decade ago.</p>

<p>While Californians think it's cheap, the rapid rise in prices has put houses out of reach for many locals.</p>

<p>Around a quarter of the population of Washoe are Latino, a group that suffered disproportionately from the shuttering of casinos during the Covid-19 pandemic, and who are overwhelmingly concentrated in lower paying jobs.</p>

<p>As in other parts of the country, persistent inflation has made life hard for those who already lived in precarious <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/will-a-potential-us-economic-slowdown-impact-india-826037" target="_blank">economic situations</a>.</p>

<p>While Latinos in the West have traditionally voted Democratic, there are increasing signs of disenchantment with the party, at least in part because of the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

<p>That could be good news for Trump.</p>

<p>However, the Democratic Party has rock-solid support from the Culinary Union, which represents casino and hotel workers in the state, and organizes a vast door-to-door operation to get out the vote.</p>

<p>"Over the past 20 years, it's been the Democrats' most effective political weapon in Nevada," said Lokken.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The standoff ultimately delayed the flight's departure by an hour before it finally took off.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in China faced widespread criticism for failing to control her unruly child on a domestic flight from Chongqing, causing a one-hour delay. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3275811/cramped-china-mother-and-child-demand-free-upgrade-first-class-disrupt-flight">South China Morning Post</a></em>, the incident occurred on August 15 when the boy, whose age was not disclosed, became upset about the limited legroom in their economy-class seats. He cried, complained, and stood in the aisle, before barging into the first-class cabin, disrupting fellow passengers and prompting a delay in the flight's departure.</p>

<p>Despite flight attendants' repeated requests, the mother refused to restrain her son and allowed him to enter the first-class cabin. Multiple attendants attempted to reason with the duo, but their efforts went in vain.</p>

<p>''There are empty seats. Why don't you just let us sit here?'' the woman said in a video that went viral on social media in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As tensions escalated, fellow passengers grew angry, with some loudly demanding, "Remove them from the plane!" and "Stop negotiating, just eject them!" The standoff ultimately delayed the flight's departure by an hour before it finally took off.</p>

<p>The mother's actions sparked a torrent of outrage on Chinese social media, drawing widespread condemnation and criticism from internet users.&nbsp;One user wrote, ''It's not the child's fault. The parent's education is the issue. She should be held fully responsible for the inconvenience she caused to other passengers.''</p>

<p>People also criticised the airline's handling of the incident, questioning their response to the disruption and whether more could have been done to resolve the situation promptly.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''The flight attendants did not do a good job in dealing with the disturbance. Also, the company has not issued a statement explaining to passengers why the flight was delayed, or offering them compensation,'' another user commented.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The country has witnessed several similar incidents involving plane seats, including a notable case last year on a Jiangxi Airlines domestic flight. An elderly woman allegedly hurled expletives at a young passenger who declined to exchange seats, citing her health conditions as the reason for wanting the window seat. A flight attendant intervened, relocating the elderly woman to a different seat and defusing the tense situation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kamala Harris is some 70 days away from possibly making history as not only the first woman President of the United States but also the first president of Black and South Asian origin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At last week's Democratic Party convention, however, she made it clear that these firsts are not badges she needs to acknowledge, especially against an opponent whose platform relies heavily on "othering." In her acceptance speech, she did not mention her skin colour at all, except to note that her father was from Jamaica, and only referenced the word "woman" when speaking about her mother, whom she described as a "brilliant five-foot-tall woman with an accent."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris has recognised that this short, 100-day campaign gives her a chance to transcend her gender, her identity, and even her tenure as the nondescript Vice President under a deeply unpopular President. It also allows her to remain deliberately vague on policies while still positioning herself as a representative of all that is best in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala, The 'Guardian'</strong></h2>

<p>Harris has realised she has the opportunity to win on a platform filled with positivity, patriotism, and even joy. She aims to position herself, not opportunistically but realistically, as the guardian of all Americans. As she said, throughout her career as a prosecutor and a politician, her only client has been "the people." She seeks to broaden her battle cry for "freedom" - which includes women's rights over their bodies - into a wider canvas of freedom even encompassing disparate elements like sexual preference, clean air, and creating an "economy of opportunity." She also credibly claims the mantle of being presidential against an ex-President variously described as "weird," "unserious," and "out of their minds"- a characterisation that seems credible not only due to his record in office but also because he continues to display these traits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What circumstances have given her this opening? According to Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard law and history professor: "Many Americans want to be able to feel good and positive about the country's political future in the face of all that we have lived through this past decade," referring not only to the horrific days of COVID but also to the severe inflation and housing prices under Biden, which have convinced many Americans that the economy is a disaster when, in fact, it has rarely been stronger.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>'For All Americans'</strong></h2>

<p>In the "acceptance" portion of her 38-minute speech, Ms. Harris captured this sentiment brilliantly, even as she took swipes at Trump: "Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans...And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. To hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms. Harris and the Democrats arrived at the convention riding high on the wave of "Kamalamania" since Biden handed over the baton. But they faced three formidable challenges at the event: to introduce Kamala Harris to a public that knew little about her; to shift Biden's strategy from portraying Trump as an autocrat threatening democracy to framing him as something small yet very dangerous; and, most importantly, to persuade the approximately 10% of undecided and independent voters, in an otherwise almost equally divided electorate, to join their cause.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most political observers in the US, from across party lines, agree that the first two objectives were achieved at the convention with notable skill. However, the jury is still out on the third and most critical objective.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>'We Are Not Going Back'</strong></h2>

<p>Ms. Harris began her address by introducing her immigrant parents, but every reference to them focused on the values they instilled that Americans hold dear. From her father: be fearless.

<p>Harris described Trump as "unserious," while emphasising that his success in the election would have very "serious" consequences. Overall, she positioned herself as a safer bet for the future of the U.S., using the words "forward" or "future" eight times in her speech and making "we are not going back" (a reference to Trump and his dystopia) her signature phrase.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Trump's Takedown</strong></h2>

<p>The evisceration of Donald Trump was, as expected, a collective effort, in which every major convention speaker participated, notably, Oprah Winfrey, the Clintons, and the Obamas. However, nobody did it better than Michelle Obama. She mentioned him only once but brought the house down with this line: "We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth." And then the coup de grâce: "Who is going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking may be one of those Black jobs?" - a pointed reference to Trump's remark at a meeting with Black journalists that immigrants were taking "Black jobs".</p>

<p>Drawing from their own experience, the Obamas stressed that the election would be very close and urged Democrats to seize every opportunity to bolster their vote. MAGA supporters are largely drawn from non-college-educated Gen X men, rural folks, and believers. Harris can reasonably hope that popular Minnesota Governor Tim "Coach" Walz, her VP nominee, can attract some of those votes in the three Rust Belt swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oprah Winfrey explicitly reached out to independents and undecided voters, even as she took a swipe at Trump, saying, in effect, that America is an ongoing project requiring commitment, values, character, decency, respect, plain common sense - and an adult conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Centrist Approach</strong></h2>

<p>Ms. Harris's speech notably leaned toward the centre in terms of policies and posture, with no extravagant promises on healthcare or the economy. Some observers even described the speech as leaning conservative, particularly in her promise to bring back the bipartisan tough border bill that Trump had torpedoed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there was little in the convention speeches that would seriously challenge the widespread perception that Trump has a better handle on the economy or prompt a reconsideration among core MAGA supporters. Trump has sharp political instincts and, as a firm believer in transactional politics, has no hesitation in abandoning even the firmest ideological positions if the ground shifts. Seeing how the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision on abortion rights has given the Democrats a distinct lead among women voters, Trump has not only distanced himself from the extreme MAGA position of advocating a national ban on abortion but also claimed his election would be good for "reproductive rights." He hasn't elaborated on how, but he is using terminology that pro-lifers abhor.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why Democrats Are Hopeful</strong></h2>

<p>The hard fact remains that Trump still leads Harris in five of the seven swing states that will determine the election. However, Democrats draw hope from three developments. First, the Democratic Party has begun to stem its declining support among blue-collar Americans, Blacks, and Hispanics. Second, Harris has pulled ahead in at least two states and reduced the deficit in the other five where Biden was trailing in all seven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, unlike Hillary Clinton, this contender is not underestimating Trump. Far from it. Knowing, as Obama put it, Trump's "weird" fascination with crowd size, Harris and Walz campaigned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republicans had held their "Victory is Ours" convention in June, on Day 2 of the Democratic convention. And they chose the same venue and drew a similarly large and enthusiastic crowd. And you can be sure that, unlike Clinton, Harris and Walz will aggressively campaign in the swing states in the remaining days leading up to the November 5 election.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Something "Magical" In The Air&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Republicans have dubbed this period as Harris' "honeymoon" and correctly predict tough days ahead for her. Her performance against Trump in the debate on September 10 will have a significant impact on undecided and independent voters. The U.S. media is eager to scrutinise her when she gives her first press conference or detailed interview as the Democratic nominee. Her bid for the party nomination in 2020 was effectively derailed by a disastrous press interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrats were in deep despair after Biden's poor performance in the debate with Trump in late June. They could not have known that this disaster would be the best thing to happen to them: it pushed Biden out and, unexpectedly for Trump, brought in Kamala, who came out swinging and surprised everyone with her style and savvy. Today, when Michelle Obama says there is something "magical" in the air, even Republicans are beginning to acknowledge it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Republican strategist Mark Mackinnon put it: "This feels like something completely different is happening. And I don't know what it is yet, but, you know, just the circumstances, the timing, the compressed election, the nomination - it just feels, looks and smells like something completely different. I don't know what it is. That's the problem. We'll see."&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can't wait to see.&nbsp;</p>

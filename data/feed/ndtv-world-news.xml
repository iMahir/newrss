<p>Votaries of the US presidential debate - including many of our senior politicians - may want to hold their horses. The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, after all, has not turned out to be the symposium of policy and polity ideas that some hoped it would be. It certainly was massively entertaining. Nobody still knows who will be the next president of the United States in November or what their plan of action will be at home and in the world. One is forced to examine, therefore, whether the purpose of these presidential debates is entertainment - poli-tainment.</p>

<h2><strong>The Post-9/11 Television</strong></h2>

<p>Interestingly, the Trump-Harris debate was telecast live on the eve of the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 attacks - an event that set a new tone for decades to come for not just the US establishment but the media as well. Let's rewind to 2001. The television ably aided the military-industrial complex of the United States in the project of what Noam Chomsky calls manufacturing consent. This consent was built not just around military action on foreign land but also heightened security measures within. This was done via 'militainment' - cultural products revolving around the military. Think in terms of all the war films Hollywood churned out each time the US soldiers engaged in military action on foreign soil. Post-9/11, the television brought all the fighting to the American living rooms with a renewed vigour. Heightened awareness of the enemies of the United States meant a better chance of convincing Americans about their government's decision to continue fighting them. And it was being done ostensibly under the garb of entertainment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Politainment, on the other hand, aims to serve entertainment in the name of politics. Entertainment often equals commercialism, and there seems to be no other form of entertainment bigger than the presidential polls in the US at the moment. The biggest names in the entertainment world have joined the fray, the latest being Taylor Swift, the biggest artist in the world of 2023, with her endorsement of Kamala Harris. Like TV, with a small hiatus in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, jumped right back into commercial programming and labelled it "public service," presidential polls become the public service events for artists and platforms every four years.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Is It Time To Retire The Debate?</strong></h2>

<p>The televised US presidential debate, initiated by the most showman-like of all American presidents, John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, also turns sixty-four this month. Is it now time to retire it? The supporters uphold it as the democratisation of political information. But what does it really mean in terms of electoral participation and outcome? Scholars like Markus Prior have demonstrated that "Cable TV and the Internet increase gaps in knowledge and turnout between people who prefer news and people who prefer entertainment".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political scientists have already analysed the Trump-Harris debate threadbare. Precious little has emerged about the policy direction that the most powerful country in the world will take in the next four years under a new president. Instead, it spawned industrial supplies of highly imaginative entertainment products like memes, parodies, and social media videos. Multimedia content creators are likely to have generated substantial wealth thanks to this debate, which was pretty low on political information. Even if it were high, there is no evidence that this debate would have elevated the average levels of political knowledge in the American population. Sure, Kennedy won the election after his super successful maiden debate with Nixon, but was it not owing more to his personality cult than any of his policy positions? &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Demagoguery 101</strong></h2>

<p>These days, one almost feels sorry for the poor television. It tries to do a tightrope walk between public service and entertainment. In the US, television is constantly trying to reprieve its respectable status as a regulated private industry originally thought to operate for the general welfare. It is also torn in the opposite direction by capitalist motives of profit maximisation. Events like the presidential debates allow television to make the two ends meet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scholars like Roland Barthes have argued how history and memory create and further national narratives. Television serves as not just a creator but also an observer and a repository of both history and memory. At present, the national psyche of the US-bifurcated along party lines - lends itself to being exploited by television for the creation of a national narrative of fractured solidarities and policy chaos. There are deep disagreements among both Republican and Democrat supporters. Ongoing foreign wars have distilled these disagreements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that both Trump and Harris were unable to offer any policy framework during the debate and mounted only personal attacks against each other leaves a discerning audience with a sense of impending doom. Politics of issues has been firmly pushed into the background while emotionally charged demagoguery takes centre stage.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forty five Indians who were illegally made to join the Russian army and fight for them on the battle fronts against Ukraine have been rescued from the war zone and discharged from the Russian military, the Ministry of External Affairs said today.</p>

<p>There are fifty more Indian nationals still on battlefields in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and efforts are underway to rescue them and get them released too, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs added.</p>

<p>During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir had assured Mr Modi that Russia will discharge any and all Indians who had been misled and falsely inducted in the Russian Army and subsequently forced to go the battlefields in Ukraine.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW INDIANS WERE MISLED INTO JOINING RUSSIAN ARMY</strong></h3>

<p>A human trafficking network extending from New Delhi to Tamil Nadu used social media platforms and local agents to lure people to Russia by offering them lucrative jobs or admission to what Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) called "dubious private universities".</p>

<p>Once they reached Russia, however, the victims' passports were taken and they were trained in combat roles before being deployed at the front.</p>

<p>Roughly hundred Indian nationals find themselves trapped in this situation and at least four Indians have been killed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Police in India have arrested at least four people involved in the job racket.</p>

<p>A viral video earlier this year showed a group of men from Punjab and Haryana - wearing army uniforms - claiming they were tricked into fighting the war in Ukraine and doubling down on their request for help.</p>

</div>

<p>New Delhi has said that every case brought to its attention is being "strongly taken up" with Russia to ensure the "early discharge" of stranded people, and 10 Indians have been brought back as part of this effort so far.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said that the "toughest legal action" will be taken against agents who duped students from Kerala into fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>"It is totally unacceptable that any Indian should be taken to a conflict zone and in any manner be made to work for a conflict, for an army...," Mr Jaishankar had said earlier this year.</p>

<h3><strong>PM MODI RAISES ISSUE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN</strong></h3>

<p>During his visit to Moscow in July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue with President Vladimir Putin following which Russia decided to discharge all Indians working in the Russian army.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientists at the institute have developed a new nanovaccine that shows promise in providing universal protection against all major Covid-19 variants.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wuhan Institute of Virology in China,&nbsp;which has conducted extensive research on bat coronaviruses, has faced controversy and scrutiny from various countries, including the US, regarding allegations of a lab leak contributing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, scientists at the institute have&nbsp;developed a new nanovaccine that shows promise in providing universal protection against all major Covid-19 variants and potential future coronavirus mutations, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3278004/chinas-wuhan-virology-institute-creates-nasal-covid-19-vaccine-future-pandemics">South China Morning Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the research team, current vaccines have played a crucial role in preventing the spread of Sars-CoV-2 and reducing mortality rates. However, they believe that existing vaccines lack universal protection against all variants of the virus. So, they developed a&nbsp;universal COVID-19 vaccine by combining coronavirus epitopes (specific parts of antigens that trigger an immune response) with the blood protein ferritin. This combination creates an intranasal nanoparticle vaccine that shows promise in protecting multiple variants of Sars-CoV-2, including Delta, Omicron, and WIV04.</p>

<p>The WIV04 strain refers to an early variant of Sars-CoV-2 that was initially detected in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the Covid-19 pandemic first emerged.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''The ongoing and future pandemics caused by Sars-CoV-2 variants and mutations underscore the need for effective vaccines that provide broad-spectrum protection,'' the researchers wrote in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal ACS Nano in June.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''Our constructed nanovaccine targeting the conserved epitopes of the pre-existing neutralising antibodies can serve as a promising candidate for a universal Sars-CoV-2 vaccine,'' the paper added.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">While the global risk level of COVID-19 has significantly decreased, researchers warn that the virus's ongoing mutation will continue to generate new variants, some of which may possess increased transmissibility and potentially trigger future outbreaks or even another global pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">That's why the team believes that&nbsp;nanovaccines offer an "excellent vaccine platform" and have&nbsp;long-lasting immune responses.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The nanovaccine was first tested on mice, which&nbsp;demonstrated promising results.&nbsp;Mice receiving the nanovaccine, followed by two booster shots within 42 days, showed significantly higher levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies compared to control groups. When vaccinated mice were exposed to various coronavirus variants, including Omicron and Delta, they exhibited enhanced resistance to virus-induced lung symptoms, showcasing the vaccine's protective efficacy against different strains.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The nanoparticle vaccine “has the potential protective capability as a broad spectrum vaccine against various [coronaviruses]”, the team wrote.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite the lack of credible reports, the false information has been widely shared and amplified by public figures, including former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Springfield, Ohio, have found no evidence to support claims circulating on social media about Haitian immigrants abducting and consuming pets. Despite the lack of credible reports, the false information has been widely shared and amplified by public figures, including former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance. Mr Vance had previously made statements about <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1833505359513661762">Haitian immigrants causing disruptions in Springfield</a> and recently claimed that there were reports of pets being taken and eaten by people ''who shouldn't be in the country''.</p>

<p>During a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump also reiterated the above claims. Despite city officials denying the allegations, Trump insisted that he had seen people making these claims on television. Officials have confirmed that these claims are unfounded and lack any credible evidence.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs — the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there and this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Where did the pet-eating claim come from?</strong></h2>

<p>A video recently went viral that claimed a Haitian immigrant in Springfield killed and ate a pet cat.&nbsp;An investigation by The Springfield News-Sun suggests that the claim may have started with a viral post in a local Facebook group, which was then amplified by others, including high-profile figures. However, the case pertains to an incident in Canton, Ohio,&nbsp;about 170 miles (273km) away from Springfield.</p>

<p>On August 16, a woman in Ohio was arrested and charged with animal cruelty after allegedly killing a cat by stomping on it and then consuming it in front of multiple witnesses. According to a police report, officers allege that &nbsp;Allexis Ferrell "smashed the cat's head with her foot and then began to eat the cat." The Canton Police Department also released <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-woman-arrested-after-eating-cat-canton-police-release-bodycam-footage-incident/530-3f8ac79a-cd97-4cee-9ed1-16943a04a658">bodycam footage</a> of the 27-year-old being arrested. Rumours soon started swirling on social media that she was an immigrant. The case also became a part of online presidential campaign chatter.</p>

<p>However, this incident in Canton is entirely unrelated to the false claims circulating about Haitian immigrants in Springfield. As per reports,&nbsp;Ferrell is not a Haitian immigrant, but an American citizen. She was born in Ohio and graduated from Canton McKinley High School in 2015.&nbsp;She was charged with prohibitions concerning companion animals, animal cruelty, and disorderly conduct.</p>

<p><strong>Another Misleading claim</strong></p>

<p>A photo of a Black man holding a goose has also been misused on social media to falsely claim that Haitian immigrants are eating geese in Springfield. However, the man who took the photo has come forward to set the record straight.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="659" style="height:500px"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1eebfta/this_is_ohio/">This is Ohio</a><br />
by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/isitmeyourelooking4x/">u/isitmeyourelooking4x</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/">Ohio</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>He confirmed that he took the photo on July 28 in Columbus and posted it on Reddit because it was an unusual sight. CBS News has verified the location of the photo and confirmed that it is not related to the false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield.</p>

<p>In addition to Trump and Vance, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has also shared memes referencing the false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield. However, the Canton Police debunked the claims and told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77l28myezko" rel="nofollow, noindex">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>BBC</em></a>&nbsp;"We have not dealt with any complaints of Haitian immigrants at all."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Springfield City also issued a statement saying there have been "no credible reports" of pets being harmed by the Haitian community.</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, a Springfield police spokesperson said, "In response to recent rumours alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said today that there has been "some progress" with China on the boundary issue. The minister said that approximately 75 per cent of the "disengagement" problems has been resolved.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who is in Geneva, Switzerland for bilateral meetings, said this at an interactive session at the Global Centre for Security Policy - an independent think-tank. The minister further said that the bigger issue has been the increasing militarisation of the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said the Galwan Valley clashes of June 2020 affected the "entirety" of India-China ties, asserting that "One cannot have violence at the border and then say the rest of the relationship is insulated from it".</p>

<p>"Negotiations are going on. We made some progress. I would say roughly you can say about 75 per cent of the disengagement problems are sorted out," he said, adding "We still have some things to do."</p>

<p>Ties between India and China have been at an all-time low as the militaries of both nations have been standing their ground since the standoff in Ladakh began in May 2020. The disengagement process began in February 2021 and has been on since.</p>

<p>Roughly 75% of the disengagement problems with China has been sorted out, Mr Jaishankar said. Mr Jaishankar is scheduled to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his visit to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Talks at both the diplomatic and military levels between India and China have held on an ongoing basis. "We hope that if there is a solution to the disengagement and there is a return to peace and tranquility, then we can look at other possibilities," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>While partial disengagement from Galwan, Hot Springs, and Gogra happened in July 2020 while full disengagement from Pangong Lake north and south banks took place in February 2021. However, Chinese soldiers are firmly entrenched in the Depsang Plains in northeastern Ladakh and show no signs of moving.</p>

<p>The Line of Actual Control or LAC between India and China, including China-occupied Tibet, is around 3,500 km in length.</p>

<p>India has maintained that its ties with China cannot be normal unless there is peace in the border areas.</p>

<p>"The basis obviously for a good relationship, I would say even for a normal relationship, was that there would be peace and tranquility in the border. After things started to take a better turn in 1988, we had a series of agreements which stabilised the border," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p><strong>VIOLATIONS BY CHINA</strong></p>

<p>Speaking about how China unilaterally changed the status-quo along the LAC, Mr Jaishankar said "What happened in 2020 was in violation of multiple agreements for some reasons which are still entirely not clear to us; we can speculate on it."</p>

<p>"The Chinese actually moved a very large number of troops to the Line of Actual Control at the border and naturally in response, we moved our troops up. It was very difficult for us because we were in the middle of a Covid lockdown at that time," he said.</p>

<p>Describing the development as very dangerous and referring to the Glawan clashes, Mr Jaishankar said, "Now we could see straight away that this was a very dangerous development because the presence of a large number of troops in these extreme heights and extreme cold in near proximity could lead to a mishap. And that's exactly what happened."</p>

<p>"We have now been negotiating close to four years and the first step of that is what we called disengagement which is their troops go back to their normal operating bases and our troops go back to their normal operating bases and where required we have an arrangement about patrolling because both of us patrol regularly in that border as I said it is not a legally delineated border." Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p><strong>IMPACT ON INDIA-CHINA TIES</strong></p>

<p>Since the military clashes and subsequent standoff in Ladakh, the ties between India and China have been at an all-time low. The economic ties between the two nations have been imbalanced for the last few decades.</p>

<p>Speaking about trade ties, Mr Jaishankar said, the economic relationship with China has been "very unfair" and "unbalanced". But he has maintained that India is not closed for business with China.</p>

<p>Two days ago, during his visit to Germany, Mr Jaishankar had said that India is "not closed to business from China", but the issue is in which sectors the country does business with Beijing and on what terms.</p>

<p>"We are not closed to business from China...I think the issue is, which sectors do you do business and what terms do you do business? It's far more complicated than a black and white binary answer," Mr Jaishankar had said.</p>

<p>Since the Ladakh standoff, India has tightened its scrutiny of investments from Chinese companies and stopped all major projects, including in infrastructure. But as progress is made with China on disengagement along the LAC, government officials, including Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, have backed suggestions to allow more Chinese investment in the country.</p>

<p>Along with investment scrutiny, India has also virtually blocked visas for all Chinese nationals since 2020, but is now considering easing them for Chinese technicians, as it had hindered investments worth billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Since the Ladakh standoff, passenger flights between India and China had also stopped, but with progress in disengagement, though slow, resumption of flights is now being discussed.</p>

<p>Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said today that early resumption of direct flights between India and China have been discussed by both nations.</p>

<p>According to a news report by Reuters, China has been pressing India since June to resume direct passenger flights, but New Delhi is resisting it as the disengagement in Ladakh is not complete.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking crime that has stunned Switzerland, former Miss Switzerland finalist Kristina Joksimovic was allegedly murdered, with her body dismembered and dissolved by her husband, Thomas, Swiss officials revealed. The 38-year-old former model was discovered dead on February 13 in the laundry room of her home in Binningen, located about two miles southwest of Basel, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/former-model-and-miss-switzerland-finalist-kristina-joksimovic-pureed-in-blender-by-husband-reports-13213183" rel="nofollow, noindex">Sky News</a></em> reported.&nbsp;Authorities concluded during the investigation that Ms Joksimovic had been strangled before her death. Her 41-year-old husband, identified only as "Thomas" in local media, was arrested and later confessed to the crime. The federal court in Lausanne rejected his appeal for release on Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trigger Warning: Disturbing content</em></strong></p>

<p>An autopsy determined that Ms&nbsp;Joksimovic was strangled before her death, a detail corroborated by Thomas in his confession. Her body was dismembered in the laundry room using a jigsaw, knife, and garden shears. According to local media outlet <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bzbasel.ch/basel/baselland/bundesgericht-mord-in-binningen-ehemann-soll-die-leiche-seiner-frau-verstuemmelt-haben-ld.2668305">Basel</a></em>, some of her remains were later chopped with a hand blender, "pureed," and dissolved in a chemical solution.</p>

<p>Thomas claims that he killed his wife in self-defence, stating that she attacked him with a knife. After the murder, he reportedly panicked and proceeded to dismember her body.</p>

<p>However, medical-forensic reports contradict Thomas's self-defence claim. Investigators have found "concrete indications of a mental illness" in Thomas and described him as having "sadistic tendencies." They noted his "remarkably high level of criminal energy, lack of empathy, and cold-bloodedness" following the murder of his wife.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also disclosed that Thomas had previously strangled his wife. Additionally, a former partner claimed that he had once grabbed the beauty queen by the neck and slammed her head into a wall.</p>

<p><strong>Who was&nbsp;Kristina Joksimovic?</strong></p>

<p>Born in Binningen with Serbian heritage, Kristina Joksimovic initially pursued a career in modelling, winning the Miss Northwest Switzerland title in 2003 and becoming a finalist in the 2008 Miss Switzerland competition. She later transitioned to coaching, empowering aspiring models and businesswomen to build confidence and improve their personal and professional presence. Additionally, she successfully ran a coaching agency and worked in IT recruitment.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[An effective definition of terrorism is necessary to provide the operational rules of engagement to national security agencies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When members of Al-Qaeda flew commercial jetliners into New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the idea of who was a terrorist crystallised for the world. But, 23 years on, the reality is there is no one "kind" of terrorist. As security forces around the world grapple with myriad threats from all manner of groups, an essential agreement on who the opponent is becomes crucial.</p>

<p>An effective definition of terrorism is necessary to provide the operational rules of engagement to national security agencies and, at an international level, to facilitate combined efforts based on the shared perspective of peace and war, of friends and enemies, of the threat scenarios.</p>

<h3><strong>Good, evil and the terrorist</strong></h3>

<p>A person is a terrorist because of what they do, not because of what they believe, and for their actions, they are prosecuted.</p>

<p>Discussing terrorism on the theoretical level of &nbsp;"good and evil" is counterproductive and pointless. Even if we all agree that terrorism is the expression of evil, it is not possible to reach an agreement on who the terrorists are.</p>

<p>This is because the category of evil, in today's fragmented world, is understandable only at a local level, difficult to share outside one's cultural boundaries. Evil as a concept depends on cultural perspectives and therefore it cannot lead to a definition of terrorism based on an objective assessment of damages and threats.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in a world of conflict, the same effect can be generated by terrorists, insurgents, freedom fighters, and other groups using violence and doing the same thing, for different reasons, with a different label. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole question about the "good or evil" of an action depends on the reasons that motivate that action, so again it is a vague criterion. The acceptance or rejection of actions cannot depend on the value of "good or evil", nor on the reasons that generate them.</p>

<p>So this is one more reason to change how we measure terrorism, forgetting "good and evil", instead focusing on the results of terrorism, banning its effects we cannot accept. Those effects, unlike the ideas that constitute motivations, can be counted and measured. &nbsp;When "an act of terrorism is such because of the effects that the act generates, and not because of the causes that drove it", then the way is open for all to agree to a common counter strategy to terrorism.</p>

<h3><strong>Defining terrorism</strong></h3>

<p>Ten years after 9-11, Alex P. Schmid, Distinguished Fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT) and Director of the Terrorism Research Initiative (TRI), collected the opinions of dozens of experts to arrive at a scientific definition of terrorism for the 21st century.</p>

<p>The result has been a long list of characteristics, among which the objective of "terrorising" is emphasised, identifying communication as a specific element of terrorism, and the use of violence, indiscriminately directed towards "civilian" targets.</p>

<p>This plethora of definitions makes it difficult to come up with a common operational perspective for countering terrorism threats. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, too many definitions of terrorism, refer to the experience around this phenomenon gained in a world that no longer exists.</p>

<p>Italy is a fine example of this.</p>

<h3><strong>A history of violence</strong></h3>

<p>Italy is notorious for the violence it experienced during the last 30 years of the 20th century from groups on the far left, such as the Brigate Rosse (Red Brigades) to those on the far right (Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari) along with the mafia and other organised crime.</p>

<p>Italy experienced violent political terrorism that wanted to change the state to affirm another idea of the state.</p>

<p>Counterterrorism laws that still address the phenomenon were created based on that experience.</p>

<p>However, today's terrorism no longer has anything to do with the terrorism of that time. So old regulatory tools are still used to regulate a phenomenon that has changed.</p>

<p>This means that for an effective, updated response to terrorism, we have to go back to identifying the phenomenon as it appears today, asking the basic question: "What is terrorism?".</p>

<p>In recent years, terrorism has proven to be flexible, adaptable and opportunistic. It is very skilled in exploiting an enemy's vulnerabilities and from this ability it gains strength.</p>

<p>Europol, in the TE-SAT Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2023, lists current terrorism types and dangerous groups, and warns that "the lines between different types of terrorism, including right-wing, left-wing, anarchist, jihadist, and other ideologies, are likely to become more blurred in the future".</p>

<p>Europol unlights that points of convergence have already been observed among terrorist and violent extremists across the whole ideological spectrum.</p>

<h3><strong>Salad Bar terrorism</strong></h3>

<p>Ideologically today one can talk about Salad Bar terrorism (or Mixed Ideology terrorism), where the ideological dimension is present, but it is articulated according to a personal taste, to justify the choice of violent affirmation of one's ideas.</p>

<p>Yet, the actual reasons for terrorism can be found in terrorism itself as a choice and action. They lie in the conviction terrorists have that only violence can change a situation already irrecoverable, urgent, and dramatic. The personalised ideology terrorists create for themselves is the justification for the terrorist action and not the real motivation.</p>

<p>In this framework, recruitment and propaganda are strategic pieces of the ideological puzzle: ideas are to be reassembled according to a flexible and adaptable image that constitutes the scenario in which the terrorist's violence will be expressed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This fragmentation is the main feature of terrorism affecting young people's identities (since young people are the main victims of terrorist propaganda and recruitment). &nbsp;A fragmentation where geographical, political and cultural borders are no longer useful, reorganised by the global network of communication technologies. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>More than ideology</strong></h3>

<p>The first challenge that comes out is the need to reconsider the meaning of nation and state.</p>

<p>The paths that can lead to terrorism are many and this is why the definition of terrorism based on reasons and motivations does not work: the unpredictable Salad Bar Ideology offers many ways to become a terrorist. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ideologies no longer provide sufficient analytical categories to identify and, subsequently, prevent threats effectively. The reasons that drive radicalization today are multiple and come from various inputs. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A good example of the failure to adequately address terrorism today is the numerous tools developed by law enforcement to identify potential terrorists are the so-called Terrorist Risk Assessment Instruments. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All these have, so far, led to poor results, because they are based on the wrong assumptions of continuity, linearity, and ideal coherence, while today's Salad Bar Terrorism offers a circular route, rapid and unpredictable, always original for everyone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the Australian Institute of Criminology recently released a report on the use of four risk assessment tools designed to gauge the threat posed by radicalised offenders and, in some cases, justify them being held behind bars or closely supervised after their sentences have been served. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The AIC report found there was a "relative lack of research into the efficacy of these tools", something it found was a "barrier to their use and undermines confidence in expert assessments that rely on these tools".</p>

<p>There are often no credible signs to identify the "typical terrorist" until it is too late.</p>

<p>Today, a more effective method for identifying a potential terrorist risk could be adopting a so-called "Digital Humint" approach, which analyses both the "real" and "virtual" dimensions together, exploring not only the network of offline relationships and habits but also the social media ecosystem and chat rooms.</p>

<h2><strong>A new approach</strong></h2>

<p>A new approach, abandoning the ideological dimension as a founding dimension of terrorism is pivotal and it means "an act of terrorism is such for the effects that this act generates, not for the causes that drove it". &nbsp;</p>

<p>This approach is not just backed up by the previous empirical results and failures of counterterrorism efforts. It also has a theoretical foundation from the field of crisis management, where a crisis is defined as an event whose effects are not controlled by a system. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It also has a practical basis, in seeking an agreement on "what terrorism is" by referring to the effects, to the damage caused, for which an objective assessment can be agreed. &nbsp;This is in total alignment with the needs of the criminal justice system and legal framework.</p>

<p>In the EU, terrorism is defined by its aims to: "a) seriously intimidating a population; b) unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act; c) seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation", without any reference to a typology of ideological motivations.</p>

<p>Terrorism is no longer what it used to be, but those who fight terrorism have not realised this. Bold decisions have to be made to abandon obsolete approaches and tools that cannot deliver any more results. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What worked 50 years ago to fight terrorism in the 70s and 80s is irrelevant today, because contemporary terrorism bears little resemblance to its previous expressions. After all, human society has changed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 71, of Honolulu, was arrested in August 2020 after admitting to an undercover FBI agent that he sold US secrets to China, the US Department of Justice said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He admitted that he had facilitated the provision of classified information to intelligence officers employed by China's Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB).</p>

<p>Ma has been sentenced to 10 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release announced Assistant Attorney General Matthew G Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division, US Attorney Clare E Connors for the District of Hawaii and Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI's National Security Branch.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Ma, a US citizen born in Hong Kong worked for the CIA from 1982 until 1989.</p>

<p>Officials said Ma collaborated with a relative who is now deceased, and who worked for the CIA from 1967 until 1983.</p>

<p>As CIA officers, both Ma and his relative held top secret security clearances that granted them access to sensitive and classified CIA information, and both signed non-disclosure agreements, officials said.</p>

<p>Ma admitted in the plea agreement, in March 2001, over a decade after he resigned from the CIA, that he was contacted by SSSB intelligence officers, who asked him Ma to arrange a meeting between his relative and the SSSB.</p>

<p>During the meetings that were held in a Hong Kong hotel room for three days, Ma's relative provided the SSSB with a large volume of classified US information in return for USD 50,000 in cash.</p>

<p>In March, while living in Hawaii, Ma took up a job as a contract linguist in the FBI's Honolulu Field Office.</p>

<p>"The FBI, aware of Ma's ties to PRC intelligence, hired Ma as part of a ruse to monitor and investigate his activities and contacts with the SSSB," prosecutors said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ma, they said worked part-time at an offsite location for the FBI from August 2004 until October 2012.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the plea agreement, Ma must cooperate with the United States for the rest of his life, including by submitting to debriefings by US government agencies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As protests grow, Benjamin Netanyahu clings to power in what appears to be a gambit to shape his own political and legal future, regardless of the cost.</p>

<p>War-weary and angry, hundreds of thousands of Israelis are taking to the streets week after week, calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut a deal and bring the remaining hostages from the October 7 Hamas attack home.</p>

<p>Their calls remain unanswered.</p>

<p>These massive public demonstrations, including the largest nationwide strike in 18 months, are met with renewed conditions for any deal with Hamas and commitments to continuing the war into its second year.</p>

<p>Despite the more than 750,000 protesters calling for his resignation and an end to the war, clinging to power and continuing the fight against Hamas appears to be Netanyahu's only plan for the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What started the protests?</strong></h3>

<p>The protests began after another six Israeli hostages were found dead in Gaza at the beginning of September. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A key demand of the protesters has been for Netanyahu to sign a ceasefire with Hamas that would see the release of the remaining Israelis still held captive since the October 7, 2023 attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite increasing public dissent, Netanyahu has refused to sign any ceasefire and continues to add new conditions to any potential deal. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest sticking point is Israel's insistence that it retain a permanent military presence in the Philadelphi Corridor - a strip of land on the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas refuses to accept any such stipulation, arguing that all Israeli troops should evacuate the Gaza Strip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Egypt has also expressed its concern at the prospect of Israeli troops stationed on its border, &nbsp;amid concerns of miscalculation from either Egyptian or Israeli troops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding to the public pressure on Netanyahu is the political pressure from both inside and outside of his ruling coalition.</p>

<p>Externally, his political rivals accuse Netanyahu of lying to the Israeli public and for putting his political survival ahead of any deal to bring the hostages home.</p>

<p>Inside his coalition, there is more pressure to continue the war until all vestiges of Hamas are destroyed and the Palestinians are pacified.</p>

<p>While commentators speculate on how long Netanyahu can survive, perhaps the more relevant question is how he got here in the first place.</p>

<h3><strong>Netanyahu's narrow window</strong></h3>

<p>The root cause of Netanyahu's current dilemma is a series of 2016 allegations of corruption. &nbsp;Subsequent police investigations led to Netanyahu being charged in 2019 with breach of trust, accepting bribes, and fraud.</p>

<p>Since the allegations became public, Netanyahu has tried &nbsp;various political manoeuvres to avoid fronting court and a potential guilty verdict and likely jail sentence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, these involved using parliamentary procedures to impede the judicial process. &nbsp;This included the Attorney General being accused of interfering in the investigation and deliberately delaying the indictment, as well as Netanyahu seeking immunity from prosecution from the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset.</p>

<p>When these efforts failed, Netanyahu's trial began in May 2020. &nbsp;Then, in March 2021, Netanyahu lost the election and the prime ministership, leaving him without any institutional protection - something he covets.</p>

<p>After another inconclusive election in November 2022 Netanyahu made a Faustian bargain with several right-wing nationalist parties to regain the prime ministership. &nbsp;In return for entering his coalition, Netanyahu agreed to pursue the nationalists' political agenda. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One of his government's first acts was to try and enact sweeping judicial reforms that would give the government oversight of Israel's Supreme Court. &nbsp;These reforms could benefit both Netanyahu and his coalition partners.</p>

<h3><strong>Political bargain offers no way out</strong></h3>

<p>Because Israel has just one parliamentary house, the Supreme Court acts as a check and balance on the Knesset's power. &nbsp;The government's intention to ensure it always had a majority on the committee that appoints judges was of particular concern to many Israelis. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Opponents feared these reforms could give Netanyahu the power to appoint sympathetic judges to the Supreme Court and potentially gain immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>For the nationalists, the proposed reforms would remove many of the institutional checks and balances imposed by the Supreme Court on the expansion of Israeli settlements and the appropriation of Palestinian land in the West Bank - something &nbsp;Israeli nationalists have wanted for years. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If successful, it would mean Israel's 57-year occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem would become permanent, sounding the death knell for any future Palestinian state, something that did not go unnoticed by Hamas.</p>

<p>The proposed reforms provoked unprecedented public backlash, with massive weekly protests racking Israel from January to October 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was only when Hamas attacked on October 7 that Netanyahu's government gained some reprieve. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But the attacks posed an additional problem for Netanyahu because they were a massive security failure that resulted in the &nbsp;largest loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Throughout his political career, Netanyahu has always portrayed himself as being the only politician capable of ensuring the safety and security of Jews and the state of Israel. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This includes refusing to accept the possibility of a Palestinian state, which he deems an existential security threat to Israel. &nbsp;The fact that Netanyahu presided over this massive security failure strikes at the core of his political popularity.</p>

<p>This made him vulnerable politically and increasingly beholden to his coalition partners to remain in power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If any of these parties left the coalition, it would no longer hold a majority in the Knesset, meaning fresh elections that, &nbsp;given the current political climate, Netanyahu could conceivably lose. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unable to influence the political and judicial process, Netanyahu would find himself at the mercy of the justice system he sought to undermine. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Clinging to power</strong></h3>

<p>Consequently, Netanyahu is determined to do whatever is necessary to remain in power. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This means acceding to the nationalists' demands by advocating for negotiation positions he knows Hamas will reject.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite mounting political pressure, the government's dogmatic approach to negotiations gives the nationalists time to pursue their ideological objectives by altering irrevocably the face of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the Hamas attacks, there has been an explosion of Israeli settler outposts throughout the West Bank appropriating Palestinian land.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military has also recently launched the largest military incursion in the West Bank since October 2023. &nbsp;In addition to the more than 41,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, more than &nbsp;650 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank.</p>

<p>While Israel claims it is combating terrorism, the ultimate purpose of these actions, alongside Israel's actions in Gaza, appears to be to crush any organised Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation and its appropriation of Palestinian land. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If successful, the nationalists' dream of a wholly Jewish state from the river to the sea would be closer than ever. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A 40-year-old New York resident is facing serious charges after allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting women he met through an online ‘sugar daddy' website. Andrew J Gallo was arrested on Wednesday and charged with rape by causing impairment, strangulation, drug and alcohol offenses and corruption of minors, reported <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/man-charged-drugging-raping-women-met-sugar-daddy-113601790 ">ABC</a> News. He is currently being held on $500,000 cash bail following his arraignment.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Gallo is accused of drugging at least six women, ages 17 to 30, over the past 15 months. The investigation revealed that Gallo, using the alias “DREWSTER420” on SugarDaddiesMeet.com, laced his victims' drinks with drugs such as methamphetamine, ecstasy and cocaine. Gallo gave his victims alcohol mixed with these substances, leaving them immobile and unable to resist his advances.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Prosecutors revealed that the victims experienced a lack of control during the assaults, with Bucks County District Attorney Jen Schorn noting that Gallo's actions rendered the women so impaired that they were unable to consent to sexual acts.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">One of the earliest known incidents occurred on Christmas Eve last year, when a 24-year-old New Jersey woman met Gallo for dinner. She reported that after drinking a margarita Gallo prepared, she felt unusually disoriented and feared that if she fell asleep, she might not wake up. Authorities believe the drink was laced with methamphetamine, reported the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/11/andrew-gallo-pennsylvania-drug/ ">Washington Post</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Gallo also allegedly strangled some women until they nearly or completely passed out.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hundred years after acquiring one of Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers", Britain's National Gallery in London will bring his vision to life by showcasing three works side-by-side for the first time.</p>

<p>The triptych, which features two from his sunflower series, forms part of a major exhibition dedicated to the Dutch painter and titled "Van Gogh: Poets and Lovers".</p>

<p>The exhibit focuses on the post-impressionist's output during the two years that he spent in the south of France, in Arles and Saint-Remy de Provence, between February 1888 and May 1890.</p>

<p>"His art takes on a new amplitude, a&nbsp;new inventiveness, everything emerges from it," exhibition co-curator Christopher Riopelle told AFP of the period in Van Gogh's life.</p>

<p>"He becomes ever braver and bolder in how he paints, new freedom, new rhythms that enter in," Riopelle added.</p>

<p>The exhibition brings together some fifty paintings and drawings, which testify to Van Gogh's talent for raising emotions thanks to his subtle and intense use of colours.</p>

<p>Many are already well-known masterpieces, such as "Starry Night," but some had never left their original private collections or museums.</p>

<p>In a room with yellow walls, three paintings are notably exhibited: two "Sunflowers", one belonging to the National Gallery since 1924, and the other specially loaned by the Washington museum.</p>

<p>They surround "The Lullaby", a painting representing a woman, seated on an armchair.</p>

<p>"At a certain moment in beginning of 1889 he had five or six of these pictures in his studio, and he began to think, how do I want to show them?" Riopelle explained.</p>

<p>"And he had this wonderful idea that he should flank a 'Sunflowers' with a yellow background, with a 'Sunflowers' with a blue background.</p>

<p>"And in the middle, he should have "La Berceuse" (The Lullaby)... and that the three pictures together would comfort sailors at sea."</p>

<p>Riopelle added that Van Gogh's intention, as explained in letters to his brother Theo, would represent "something consoling in life".</p>

<p>This is the first time that the works have been exhibited together in this way.</p>

<p>Predictably, nature and the landscapes of the south of France are at the heart of the works arousing feelings in the viewer.</p>

<p>He saw this productive period in southern France as "a chance to make a mark," said Cornelia Homburg, co-curator of the exhibition, stressing that the exhibition strives to "be respectful" of Van Gogh's "artistic ambitions".</p>

<p>There is a series on olive trees, another on the mountains around Saint-Remy de Provence, and also the gardens of a psychiatric institution in the same city, where Van Gogh stayed for several months.</p>

<p>"He was not just a person tormented and suffering all of that," concluded Riopelle.</p>

<p>"He was a person deeply committed to the beauty of nature, deeply committed to friends and family and deeply committed to establishing a career as an Avant-Garde artist."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 24-year-old Indian-origin Israeli soldier from the Bnei Menashe community was killed in a vehicle-ramming attack close to the West Bank's Beit El settlement, community members said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Staff Sergeant Geri Gideon Hanghal was a resident of Nof HaGalil and a soldier in the Kfir Brigade's Nahshon Battalion, the Israeli Army said.</p>

<p>Community members told PTI that they were "in shock at the news of the loss of a young life" on Wednesday near Asaf Junction.</p>

<p>His funeral will be held on Thursday, they said.</p>

<p>Hanghal immigrated to Israel from northeast India in 2020.</p>

<p>Some 300 Bnei Menashe youngsters are said to be doing Army duty during the current war, most of them serving in combat units.</p>

<p>The Bnei Menashe, hailing from India's north-eastern states of Manipur and Mizoram, are believed to have descended from the Israelite tribe of Menasseh, one of the "lost tribes" of ancient times.</p>

<p>Shlomo Amar, Sephardic Chief Rabbi, declared them descendants of Menasseh in 2005 paving the path for their immigration to Israel as members of a "lost tribe".</p>

<p>Some 5,000 members of the Bnei Menashe community are said to have immigrated to Israel, including almost 1,500 in the past five years. Another 5,500 still live in India and are waiting to immigrate.</p>

<p>Nof HaGalil Mayor, Ronen Plot, was quoted by Ynetnews as saying that "the city of Nof HaGalil mourns and grieves the loss of Staff Sgt. Hanghal. Gideon was a member of the Bnei Menashe community, which is very dear to my heart-good, humble and patriotic people".</p>

<p>Footage from the scene of the attack showed a truck with a Palestinian license plate veering off a busy highway and barrel full speed into an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) guard post adjacent to a bus stop before coming to a halt.</p>

<p>The suspect was named by Israeli security sources as 58-year-old Hayil Dhaifallah, from the central West Bank town of Rafat.</p>

<p>The attack follows a series of attempted suicide bombings and shooting incidents emanating from the West Bank and claimed by Islamic Hamas.</p>

<p>Hamas on October 7 last year launched a dastardly attack on Israel, leading to the ongoing war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel has said that it is stepping up its counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank claiming that Iran-backed groups are smuggling weapons into the area from Jordan and trying to carry out attacks in Israeli territory.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry in the West Bank on Wednesday said that five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Tubas overnight.</p>

<p>Another two people were injured by Israeli fire, one critically, as troops raided Tubas and the neighbouring town of Tammun, Palestinian state agency Wafa reported.</p>

<p>IDF confirmed the airstrikes, once a rare occurrence in the West Bank, saying it targeted members of a terror cell.</p>

<p>The IDF has carried out more than 70 airstrikes in the West Bank since October 7, using drones, attack helicopters, and fighter jets.</p>

<p>Local media reports have been eluding that the Israeli defence brass is increasingly worried that the violence in the West Bank could swell into a major conflagration.</p>

<p>The spiralling violence has also been fuelled by hardline Israeli settlers in the central and northern West Bank who have carried out several attacks on Palestinians in recent weeks, including a fiery rampage on a village last month in which a Palestinian man was killed while trying to confront the rioters.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority (PA) health ministry has claimed that more than 670 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the West Bank, which is under the PA control, since October 7.</p>

<p>The IDF has said that the vast majority of those dead were gunmen killed in exchanges of fire, rioters who clashed with troops, or terrorists carrying out attacks.</p>

<p>Israel is said to have also arrested some 5,000 wanted Palestinians across the West Bank over the last eleven months, including more than 2,000 said to be linked to Hamas.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Rock legend Jon Bon Jovi has been praised on social media for his heroic actions in helping a woman in distress who was standing on the ledge of a bridge in Nashville, in the US state of Tennessee, on Tuesday night. According to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, Bon Jovi, 62, and his team were on the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge when they noticed the woman standing precariously over the Cumberland River.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">A video released by police shows the woman holding onto the railing while standing on the ledge, before Bon Jovi and another woman approach her. The singer can be seen waving hello and leaning on the railing near her, helping to calm her down. They successfully coaxed her back onto the bridge, preventing a potential tragedy. The rescue was met with relief as Bon Jovi and the other woman embraced the woman in a hug.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After trekking deeper into space than any humans in the last half-century, a pioneering private crew is set to make history Thursday with the first-ever spacewalk by non-professional astronauts.</p>

<p>The SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission, led by fintech billionaire Jared Isaacman, launched early Tuesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, reaching a peak altitude of 870 miles (1,400 kilometres).</p>

<p>That's more than three times higher than the International Space Station, in a region of space called the inner Van Allen radiation belt -- a zone teeming with dangerous, high-energy particles.</p>

<p>Now, with their Dragon spaceship's elliptical orbit reduced to a low point of roughly 120 miles and a high of 430 miles, the crew of four is gearing up for the mission's centrepiece: an audacious extravehicular activity (EVA) scheduled for 0958 GMT on Thursday, with a backup window on Friday.</p>

<p>SpaceX pushed the time back by a few hours early Thursday, without explaining why. It plans a webcast of the event starting about an hour beforehand, on its website.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Bit of a dance'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Prior to the hatch opening, the crew will complete a "pre-breathe" process to purge nitrogen from their blood, preventing decompression sickness caused by nitrogen bubbles. The cabin pressure will then be gradually reduced to match that of space.</p>

<p>After it's opened, Isaacman and crewmate Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, will take turns peeking out from a structure attached to the hatch dubbed "Skywalker," equipped with hand and footholds.</p>

<p>"It'll look like we're doing a little bit of a dance," Isaacman quipped during a recent press conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In reality, they're stress-testing SpaceX's next-generation suits, which boast heads-up displays, helmet cameras and enhanced joint mobility systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, they won't float away on a tether like early spacefarers such as Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov or NASA's Ed White did in 1965. Instead, they'll cling to the spacecraft as it orbits Earth at roughly 17,500 mph.</p>

<p>Since the Crew Dragon capsule lacks an airlock, the entire crew will be exposed to the vacuum of space for the duration of the spacewalk, around two hours. After the hatch is closed, the cabin will be repressurized, and oxygen and nitrogen levels will return to normal.</p>

<p>Mission pilot Scott Poteet and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon will monitor vital support systems during the activity, while Isaacman and Gillis are expected to each spend about 15 to 20 minutes partially outside the craft.</p>

<p>"The risk is greater than zero, that's for sure, and it's certainly higher than anything that has been accomplished on a commercial basis," former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe told AFP.</p>

<p>"This is another watershed event in the march toward commercialization of space for transportation," he added, comparing the crewmates to early aviators who paved the way for modern air travel.</p>

<h3><strong>First of three Polaris missions&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>All four underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving and summiting an Ecuadoran volcano.</p>

<p>Beyond their spacewalk, the crew will test laser-based satellite communications between the spacecraft and the vast Starlink satellite constellation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They'll also carry out 36 scientific experiments, including tests on contact lenses with embedded microelectronics to monitor changes in eye pressure and shape in space.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn is the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman and SpaceX.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the partnership remain under wraps, but Isaacman, the 41-year-old founder and CEO of Shift4Payments, reportedly poured $200 million of his fortune into leading the 2021 all-civilian SpaceX Inspiration4 orbital mission.</p>

<p>The final Polaris mission aims to be the first crewed flight of SpaceX's Starship, a prototype next-generation rocket that is key to founder Elon Musk's ambitions of colonizing Mars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles shared a joyful moment with the New Zealand women's rugby union team at Buckingham Palace, where he exchanged hugs with the Black Ferns.</p>

<p>The rugby team also clicked a selfie with King Charles, in a memorable moment shared by the Black Ferns on social media.</p>

<p>It was New Zealand's winger Ayesha Leti-I'iga who broke the protocol and asked the King if he was okay to share hugs with the Black Ferns. To which King Charles did not waste any time and immediately agreed to it.</p>

<p>"We all wanted a hug, but only if it's okay with you," Leti-I'iga asked politely.</p>

<p>"A hug? Why not?" King Charles replied.</p>

<p>Currently, The Black Ferns are in the UK to take on England's Red Roses on Saturday at Twickenham.</p>

<p>Ahead of the match, Buckingham Palace hosted the New Zealand women's rugby union team to honour the visiting players.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is set to lay off approximately 1,800 employees in the United States, marking its first major round of layoffs since 2009. The job cuts, affecting about 2.5 per cent of the US workforce, span various roles, from associates to managing directors, and include business services, audit and tax. The cuts are primarily focused on the US advisory and products and technology operations, with about half of the affected employees based offshore.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The restructuring, which includes significant changes to its technology group, comes as the firm faces a slowdown in demand for parts of its advisory services.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">PwC US leader Paul Griggs announced the restructuring and layoffs to staff in a memo, obtained by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pwc-laying-off-1-800-employees-plans-restructuring-of-products-business-b5dfe7c1?mod=latest_headlines ">Wall Street Journal</a>, stating that the firm is “positioning our firm for the future, creating capacity to invest, and anticipating and reacting to the market opportunities of today and tomorrow.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The announcement, made on September 11, also acknowledged the sombre anniversary of the firm's loss of five colleagues in the 2001 attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This development marks a significant shift for PwC, which had avoided layoffs in the US since 2009, unlike its peers Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG) and Deloitte.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The restructuring will see PwC's products and technology teams more deeply integrated into individual business lines. The changes come as part of a broader structural overhaul initiated by Paul Griggs, who took over as US leader in May.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Tim Grady, PwC's US chief operating officer (COO), said, “To remain competitive and position our business for the future, we are continuing to transform areas of our firm and are aligning our workforce to better support our strategy,” as per the WSJ report.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, PwC's China office is also facing a crisis after losing a major client, Country Garden Holdings. This loss comes amid scrutiny over PwC's role in auditing China Evergrande Group, which is accused of a $78 billion fraud, Reuters reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As a result, PwC China has implemented cost-cutting measures and layoffs. Reuters reported on September 5 that over 50 Chinese firms, including Bank of China, have dropped PwC as their auditor or scrapped plans to rehire it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Country Garden cited PwC's failure to meet the deadline for publishing its audited 2023 financial statements as the reason for its decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The act of doxxing by releasing someone's personal information without consent will be made a criminal offence in Australia under new government privacy laws.</p>

<p>Mark Dreyfus, Australia's Attorney-General, on Thursday, introduced legislation to Parliament that would make doxxing illegal and entitle victims of serious invasions of privacy to seek compensation through the court system, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Under the laws, anyone found guilty of the malicious release of personal data online -- a practice known as doxxing -- will face jail time.</p>

<p>The legislation imposes a maximum penalty of six years in jail for publishing someone's personal information with the intent of causing harm.</p>

<p>The maximum prison sentence will be increased to seven years in cases where a person or group is targeted based on their religion, race, gender, disability, nationality or ethnic origin.</p>

<p>The move to criminalise doxxing is part of broader reforms that Dreyfus said would bring the existing Privacy Act into the digital age.</p>

<p>"Strong privacy laws are essential to Australians' trust and confidence in the digital economy and digital services provided by governments and industry," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Australians have got the right to have their privacy respected and when they're asked to hand over their personal data they have a right to expect it will be respected," the statement further read.</p>

<p>Additionally, the legislation introduced on Thursday would give Australians the right to sue for damages if they have been the victim of a serious invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>Dreyfus said the bill is the first stage of the government's commitment to provide Australians with greater control over their personal information.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A photogenic political scion, a military model-maker and a hardliner hoping to become Japan's first woman prime minister are among nine candidates vying to lead the world's fourth-largest economy.</p>

<p>AFP gives a rundown of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers competing to win the ruling party's leadership contest -- and therefore become prime minister -- on September 27:</p>

<h3><strong>The surfer</strong></h3>

<p>Surfing, media-savvy Shinjiro Koizumi is the youthful, photogenic son of the popular former premier Junichiro Koizumi.</p>

<p>As environment minister, Koizumi backed greater use of renewables.</p>

<p>He also took paternity leave in the post, saying he wants to share parenting duties with his television presenter wife.</p>

<p>But this doesn't endear him to LDP elders, who might see Koizumi, 43, as too young and too lightweight to be prime minister.</p>

<h3><strong>Model-maker</strong></h3>

<p>Shigeru Ishiba is a former defence minister who is popular with voters but less so with LDP lawmakers, resulting in four failed attempts to be party leader.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old has questioned the Bank of Japan's maverick interest rate policy while calling for efforts to counter rural depopulation.</p>

<p>He likes making military models -- including one of a Soviet aircraft carrier for the visit of a Russian defence minister -- as well as trains and 1970s pop idols.</p>

<h3><strong>The nationalist</strong></h3>

<p>Sanae Takaichi is a vocal nationalist popular with the LDP's conservative wing. She was close to assassinated ex-premier Shinzo Abe, whose supporters are still powerful.</p>

<p>Takaichi, 63, is a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine to Japan's war dead -- including convicted war criminals -- so her nomination would likely rile China and South Korea.</p>

<p>Like Abe, Takaichi, who also ran for the leadership in 2021, backs aggressive monetary easing, active fiscal spending and nuclear power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But unlike her hero Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, she played drums in a student heavy metal band.</p>

<h3><strong>The liberal</strong></h3>

<p>Taro Kono, currently minister for digital transformation, is an experienced and outspoken reformist who was defeated by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in the last leadership race in 2021.</p>

<p>US-educated Kono, 61, has held multiple minister jobs and has 2.5 million followers on X. His views are liberal-leaning by LDP standards.</p>

<p>Thirteen years after the Fukushima disaster, he has softened his opposition to nuclear power to meet growing energy demands, including from AI data centres.</p>

<h3><strong>The diplomat</strong></h3>

<p>Harvard-educated former consultant and current foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa is one of two women in the running along with Takaichi.</p>

<p>While justice minister, Kamikawa ordered 16 executions, including that of the head of the Aum doomsday cult responsible for the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway.</p>

<p>As Japan's top diplomat, the 71-year-old has won plaudits, including for a visit to Kyiv, but she reportedly struggled to secure the support needed to run as a candidate.</p>

<h3><strong>'Trump Whisperer'</strong></h3>

<p>With strong English, Abe's former golf partner Toshimitsu Motegi was dubbed the "Trump whisperer" for his deft handling of tricky US-Japan trade talks.</p>

<p>The Harvard-educated LDP secretary-general has been economy and foreign minister, and is respected for his policy knowledge.</p>

<p>But Motegi, 68, is reportedly feared for having a short fuse. Even Trump reportedly told Abe that he thought Motegi was "too tough".</p>

<h3><strong>The others</strong></h3>

<p>Former foreign minister and current chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, former health minister Katsunobu Kato and former economic security minister Takayuki Kobayashi are also in the running.</p>

<p>Anything could happen, with the race more open this time around after most of the LDP's factions were disbanded in the wake of a funding scandal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>China's Cyberspace Administration and its Ministry of Public Security have mooted an initiative to create internet identification for netizens in China. Plans are afoot to issue digital identification that will be used by netizens instead of their real identities when opening online profiles. The justification for this move is to safeguard users from sharing personal data, which may be retained by private digital platforms. While the authorities have maintained that applying for internet identification is voluntary, there is apprehension that the Communist Party of China (CPC) will exercise greater oversight over the Net in future.</p>

<p>These developments point to Chinese President Xi Jinping tightening his grip on civil society. The exercise is not limited to public life but seems to encompass the education sector and the military as well. The Party leadership met in mid-July for its yearly plenary session, which determined the direction of important policy initiatives. The resolution of the session announced plans to work on a unified national population management system.</p>

<h2><strong>Project Of 'National Rejuvenation'</strong></h2>

<p>A new set of regulations was issued recently with respect to educational institutions that seek to improve the pool of educators. The main aim of the Party-state is to uplift the societal status of teachers, enhancing their skills, and paring down their workload. Xi wants teachers to not merely impart lessons but to incubate a high-quality workforce for his vision of a modern Chinese economy. At the same time, the rules seek educators to be in sync with the Party's line on ideological matters, and draw the line with respect to any violations. According to government statistics, China has one of the largest combine of teachers, totalling over 18 million.</p>

<p>Concomitantly, students, too, are in the Party's crosshairs. In what may be seen as the importance of the education sector, China's political elite in its Politburo Standing Committee and officials across provinces attended Xi's address to mark Teachers' Day this month. While Xi made a pitch to expand academic exchanges overseas and research cooperation and sought a greater say in international education governance, he also underscored the need to impart more political training in classrooms.</p>

<p>He emphasised that this ideological guidance would serve as the foundation for his project of 'national rejuvenation', which seeks to build the nation's strength. There is also stress on fostering a 'sense of community' for the Chinese nation through the use of the official script and language.</p>

<h2><strong>Protecting Future Generations From 'Sabotage'</strong></h2>

<p>In an article published in the Communist Party of China's journal, <em>Qiushi</em>, Xi raised the bogey of hostile forces in the West trying to subvert the Party's leadership, and plans of a 'colour revolution' in China. He justifies the moves of the Party at exerting greater control in order to protect the future generation from sabotage, and create 'socialist successors'.</p>

<p>Chinese state-run media builds on Xi's thesis, warning of efforts by intelligence agencies to specifically target young students for recruitment and infiltration through social media. In a damage-control mode, new textbooks have been issued on the theme of national security that seek to wean students away from pop culture's potential for instigating a 'colour revolution'.</p>

<h2><strong>The Ideological Oversight Over PLA</strong></h2>

<p>In the realm of defence, Xi, as the chairperson of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is tasked with oversight of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), highlighted the need for rectification in the services. China's Ministry of National Defence posted an article that credited Xi for tackling the challenge of "lax discipline" in the PLA ranks that endured during his predecessors' tenures. The commentary supported improved supervision mechanisms, citing Chairman Mao Zedong's Yan'an Rectification campaign. The ministry seeks better discipline within the ranks. The Yan'an campaign of the 1940s sought to improve the Party's ideological moorings with rank-and-file poring over Mao's speeches. Historians state that the rectification campaign's outcome was that cadres critical of Mao were on the Party's sidelines, with the Chairman strengthening his position.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Relying On 'Faithfuls'</strong></h2>

<p>In recent years, the issue of corruption in the armed forces has also come to light. Recently, two former defence ministers - Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu - were expelled from the Party over accusations of bribery. In a conference of the military brass convened in June, incidentally in Yan'an, Xi stated his intent to come down heavily on corrupt elements and terminate the root causes of corruption. He already supports scrutiny of departments engaged in defence-related manufacturing by anti-corruption officials to unearth corruption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xi has underlined that the Party's strength lies in PLA's organisational accord and that the 'gun' (meaning the army) ought to be headed by those faithful to the Party. In line with this, the PLA is increasingly being staffed by "politically reliable" personnel in the upper echelons. For example, He Hongjun, who served as the executive deputy director of the Central Military Commission (CMC) Political Work Department, which is in charge of party-building and political education within the military, was named General.</p>

<h2><strong>A Flailing Economy</strong></h2>

<p>The triggers for Xi calling for greater control citing the bogeyman of a colour revolution lie in conditions that have developed as a result of his own policies. Chinese policymakers targeted a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth of around 5% this year but could achieve only up to 4.7% in the April to June quarter. Factory output has stalled and the sale of new flats is at an 18-year low. Unemployment remains high; the Party even stopped publishing the damaging statistics recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, labour unrest in the form of strikes in factories increased in the January-June period, according to China's official data. Social unrest has caught the Party unawares, as also evidenced by the demonstrations that broke out across China in December 2022 against COVID-19 restrictions. In the same year, protests against the Party took the form of many boycotting paying mortgages on property to financial institutions in light of the worsening economic situation due to the pandemic-induced curbs.</p>

<p>To conclude, as the economic situation worsens in China, Xi is tightening his grip on disparate sectors like military, education, and civil society interactions. Through greater social control, the Party seeks to protect itself from the fate of the Soviet Union, whose political model forms the foundation for China.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peru's former president Alberto Fujimori, who ruled his country with an iron fist and then spent 16 years in prison for crimes against humanity, died on Wednesday at age 86 in the capital Lima.</p>

<p>"After a long battle with cancer, our father, Alberto Fujimori, has just departed to meet the Lord," his children Keiko, Hiro, Sachie and Kenji Fujimori wrote on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Thank you for so much, Dad!" they added.</p>

<p>Fujimori, who led Peru from 1990 to 2000, was released from prison on humanitarian grounds in December, two-thirds of the way through a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity during his rule.</p>

<p>He was a key part of Peru's so-called war on terrorism in the form of Shining Path and Tupac Amaru leftist rebels. It left more than 69,000 people dead and 21,000 missing from 1980 to 2000, most of them civilians, according to a government truth commission.</p>

<p>Sources close to his family told AFP earlier Wednesday that Fujimori's health had deteriorated rapidly after completing treatment for tongue cancer in August.</p>

<p>He was last seen in public on Thursday as he was leaving a clinic in the Miraflores district of Lima, where he said he had undergone a CT scan.</p>

<p>As news of his death spread quickly on social media, supporters and detractors quarrelled over his legacy.</p>

<p>Many Peruvians called Fujimori, who was of Japanese descent, "el chino," or the Chinese man.</p>

<p>After his death Wednesday supporters gathered outside his house chanting "El chino did not die! El chino is present!"</p>

<p>Just a month earlier his daughter Keiko had announced that the rightwinger would run for president again in 2026.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen expressed his condolences to the Fujimori family. "We want his children and relatives to know we feel sorrow," he said.</p>

<p>Adrianzen said he would talk to the family about what kind of funeral they want. It was not clear whether Fujimori would receive a state funeral.</p>

<p>Fujimori was convicted and sent to prison in 2009 over massacres committed by army death squads in 1991 and 1992 in which 25 people, including a child, were killed in what he presented as anti-terrorist operations.</p>

<p>In December 2017, then-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori due to his ill health.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court later annulled the pardon and in January 2019, he was returned to jail from hospital.</p>

<h3><strong>Hostage crisis&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>He was released again in December 2023 after a court reinstated his pardon.</p>

<p>He was adored and reviled in equal measures in Peru.</p>

<p>As he turned 80 in 2018, Fujimori sent a message to AFP which read in part: "Let history judge what I got right and what I got wrong."</p>

<p>He also expressed the conviction that he had paved the way for Peru to become one of the leading countries of Latin America.</p>

<p>Supporters credited him with saving the nation from left-wing Shining Path and Tupac Amaru guerrillas and shoring up the economy.</p>

<p>Opponents saw him as a power-thirsty autocrat.</p>

<p>Sociologist Eduardo Toche expressed scathing criticism of Fujimori when he was convicted of crimes against humanity in 2009, saying the Fujimori government represented the lowest, worst point in the history of Peru as he made up his own rules and ignored the country's institutions.</p>

<p>"For him there was no legal framework. The legal framework was that of his will and that of his friends, nothing more," Toche told AFP at the time.</p>

<p>One of the most dramatic episodes of his presidency was a four-month hostage ordeal at the Japanese embassy in Lima in late 1996 and early 1997.</p>

<p>The standoff ended with Fujimori sending in commandos who rescued all 72 hostages and killed 14 rebels.</p>

<p>But the later Fujimori years were dominated by a bribery scandal involving his intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos.</p>

<p>Fujimori went into self-imposed exile in Japan and memorably faxed in his resignation but was arrested years later in Chile and sent back to Peru for trial.</p>

<p>His daughter Keiko has made three failed bids for the presidency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

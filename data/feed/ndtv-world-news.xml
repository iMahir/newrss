       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday promised more combat test-firing of an experimental hypersonic missile fired at Ukraine, as Volodymyr Zelensky appealed for updated air-defence systems to meet the new threat.</p>

<p>The latest statements from the leaders came hours after Ukraine's parliament shut down over heightened fears of a missile attack.</p>

<p>A day after Moscow fired the new missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, Putin said there would be more tests of the new Oreshnik missile.</p>

<p>"We will continue these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and character of the security threats posted to Russia," Putin said in a televised meeting with military chiefs.</p>

<p>Russia would also begin serial production of the new weapon, he added.</p>

<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday they were already looking for updated air-defence systems from their allies in response to the new threat.</p>

<p>Earlier Friday, China's foreign ministry had repeated its call for "calm" and "restraint" in the war after Russia confirmed it had fired the new ballistic missile.</p>

<p>In his video address however, Zelensky said: "From Russia, this is a mockery of the position of states such as China, states of the Global South, some leaders who call for restraint every time."</p>

<p><strong>Missile threat</strong></p>

<p>The introduction of the new weapon into the battlefield has further raised tensions in the nearly three-year-long war, and comes as Kyiv's forces are struggling on the ground.</p>

<p>On Friday, Russia claimed the capture of another village in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Putin's hints Thursday of strikes on Western countries raised fears of the war spilling over into a global conflict.</p>

<p>That sent the Russian ruble plunging on Friday to its lowest level against the US dollar since March 2022.</p>

<p>In a hawkish address to the nation on Thursday, Putin said Russia reserved the right to fire missiles at countries that allow Kyiv to hit Russian territory with their weapons, after the United States and the UK gave Kyiv the green light to do so.</p>

<p>Those strikes could be by the new Oreshnik missile.</p>

<p>Experts believe it flies at 10 times the speed of sound and may be able to strike targets up to 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles) away -- enough to make good on Putin's threats of targeting Kyiv's European allies but not enough to reach the United States.</p>

<p><strong>'Russian madness'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Branding the strike "this latest bout of Russian madness", Zelensky on Friday urged Ukraine's allies to step up their provision of air defences.</p>

<p>"Whatever the Russian missile threat, it cannot be ignored," the president added -- especially with Ukraine's army on the back foot.</p>

<p>A source in the Ukrainian military said Russian forces were advancing by "200-300 metres a day" near the besieged Ukrainian logistics hub of Kurakhove, in the eastern Donetsk region that the Kremlin claims is part of Russia.</p>

<p>In Moscow, Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said Russia's advances in war-battered eastern Ukraine had "ground down" Kyiv's best units.</p>

<p>Russia also said its forces had "liberated" the frontline village of Novodmytrivka, about 10 kilometres north of Kurakhove.</p>

<p><strong>'Anything can happen'</strong></p>

<p>In Kyiv, frequently targeted by Russian drones and missiles, parliament cancelled its usual Friday questions to the government over fears of a strike.</p>

<p>Several MPs said they were working remotely and that Friday's session had been scrapped. Lawmaker Yevgenia Kravchuk told AFP there were signs of "increased risks of attacks" to come.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the capital, the government district has until now been spared of bombings.</p>

<p>Analysts say Moscow and Kyiv are racing to gain battlefield advantages ahead of January 2025, when Donald Trump is due to take office in the United States. Trump has vowed to end the war, without saying how.</p>

<p>Thursday's Oreshnik missile attack, which apparently targeted an aerospace manufacturing plant in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, sparked immediate condemnation from Kyiv's allies.</p>

<p>It also shocked residents of Dnipro, which has suffered routine Russian bombardments throughout the invasion.</p>

<p>Yan Valetov, a writer from the area, said he had heard a very "strong roar" and a "series of explosions".</p>

<p>The roof of a boiler room supplying heating to a rehabilitation centre completely collapsed from the blast wave, while debris and tiles lay scattered around underfoot.</p>

<p>Boiler room worker Oleksandr Parkhomenko, 63, said he was relieved the missile had caused few casualties, but worried about what might come next.</p>

<p>"Anything can happen," he said.</p>

<p>In the streets of Moscow, supporters of President Vladimir Putin voiced confidence in Russia's victory.</p>

<p>"Russia will overcome everything... Nobody can defeat it," said Alexei Peshcherkin, a 57-year-old plumber.</p>

<p>But Yulia Kim, a 52-year-old doctor, said: "I am worried that a nuclear war will start".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A child in California has become the first in the United States to test positive for bird flu infection, authorities said Friday, as health officials offered checks and preventive treatment to exposed contacts at the child's day-care center.</p>

<p>The child, from Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay area, had mild symptoms and was said to be recovering at home following treatment with flu antivirals, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).</p>

<p>As a precaution, close family members of the child were tested, with all results coming back negative.</p>

<p>Local officials have also contacted caregivers and families at the day-care facility, where the child showed mild symptoms before testing positive.</p>

<p>The initial test detected low levels of bird flu virus, suggesting the child was likely not infectious at the time of testing. A follow-up test four days later returned negative.</p>

<p>In the United States, day-care centers typically cater to children from six weeks to five years old.</p>

<p>"It's natural for people to be concerned, and we want to reinforce for parents, caregivers and families that based on the information and data we have, we don't think the child was infectious," said CDPH director Tomas Aragon.</p>

<p>"No human-to-human spread of bird flu has been documented in any country for more than 15 years," he added.</p>

<p>Official statements emphasized that in the rare instances of bird flu transmission between individuals, the spread has been confined to a small number of close contacts.</p>

<p>Isolated and infrequent human cases of bird flu, with unclear sources of exposure or infection, are anticipated. They have occurred both historically and during the ongoing outbreak, which public health officials began monitoring in 2022.</p>

<p>"Including this most recent case, 55 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States during 2024, with 29 in California," said the CDC.</p>

<p>The CDC continues to estimate the risk for the general public is low -- albeit higher for those working directly with livestock animals including birds, dairy cattle and more.</p>

<p>A multistate outbreak of the flu -- technically the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or H5N1 bird flu -- was first reported in March in dairy cows.</p>

<p>The rising frequency and diversity of mammalian infections in recent years have heightened concerns about the virus's adaptability and its potential for cross-species transmission.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Queen Camilla has pulled out of an event on Friday night as she continues to experience some symptoms of illness after suffering a chest infection earlier this month, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Camilla, 77, was due to attend the Royal Variety Performance at the Royal Albert Hall in central London with husband King Charles, but he will now go to the charity entertainment show alone.</p>

<p>"The queen continues to experience some lingering post-viral symptoms, as a result of which doctors have advised that, after a busy week of engagements, Her Majesty should prioritise sufficient rest," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>A chest infection in the first week of November forced Camilla to cancel events for several days, but she had since returned to official duties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and Japan on Friday deliberated on a reciprocal provision of supply and services agreement for greater interoperability between the militaries of the two strategic partners amid common concerns of over China's military muscle-flexing in strategic waters.</p>

<p>The proposed pact was discussed at a meeting between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani that took place on the sidelines of a regional security conclave in Vientiane, the capital city of Laos.</p>

<p>The defence ministry said both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in co-production and co-development of military hardware.</p>

<p>"To further improve interoperability between the Indian and Japanese forces, reciprocal provision of supply and services agreement between the two countries and participation of militaries in various bilateral and multilateral exercises were discussed by both the ministers," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>The reciprocal supply and services pact, if sealed, would provide for the militaries of the two countries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh and Gen Nakatani also agreed to explore new areas of cooperation in the air domain, the ministry said.</p>

<p>It said the two sides reiterated the importance of India-Japan defence industry and technology cooperation.</p>

<p>"Recalling the milestone event of signing of Memorandum of Implementation (MoI) of UNICORN mast in Japan last week, both sides agreed for enhanced cooperation in co-production and co-development in the defence manufacturing sector," it said.</p>

<p>The MoI was inked for the co-development of UNICORN (Unified Complex Radio Antenna) mast, a key equipment for warships to increase their stealth characteristics.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh also held a separate bilateral meeting with Philippines Defence Minister Gilberto Teodoro.</p>

<p>"Both sides agreed to expand and deepen cooperation in exchange of subject matter experts, defence industry, counter-terrorism, space and maritime domain," the ministry said.</p>

<p>Prior to his departure to Delhi, Singh visited the Wat Sisakat temple (a Buddhist temple) in Vientiane, and sought blessings from Mahaveth Chittakaro, Abbot of Sisaket temple.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh arrived in Vientiane on Wednesday, primarily to attend a meeting of the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus).</p>

<p>The ADMM-Plus is a platform comprising 10-nation ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its eight dialogue partners -- India, China, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States.</p>

<p>Laos hosted the meeting in its capacity as the current chair of ADMM-Plus.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who were tapped by Republican President-elect Donald Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, have revealed plans to wipe out scores of federal regulations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who were tapped by Republican President-elect Donald Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, have revealed plans to wipe out scores of federal regulations crafted by what they say is an anti-democratic, unaccountable bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Getting rid of federal agency rules can be a monumental task, according to experts. Here is a look at the hurdles and legal challenges Trump could face if he follows through on the panel's recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE DOGE'S PLANS?</strong></p>

<p>In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published on November 20, Musk and Ramaswamy said they and "a lean team of small-government crusaders" embedded at federal agencies will review regulations to identify ones they deem invalid. The review will be guided by a pair of recent US Supreme Court decisions that placed significant limits on agencies' rulemaking powers, they said.</p>

<p>DOGE will present its findings to Trump, who could issue executive orders immediately pausing enforcement of specific rules and directing agencies to repeal them, according to the op-ed. Federal regulations impact every facet of American society, from education, healthcare and immigration to environmental pollution, drug safety, tax policy and labor rights.</p>

<p>Musk and Ramaswamy said DOGE will also recommend mass layoffs across federal agencies and identify billions of dollars in government spending that is invalid because it was not authorized by Congress. They said they are aiming to complete the panel's work by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the country's founding.</p>

<p><strong>CAN THE PRESIDENT REPEAL REGULATIONS?</strong></p>

<p>Trump cannot rescind rules on his own and would instead have to direct agencies to do so, which in most cases would not be legally binding, according to legal experts. If an agency opted to repeal a rule, the process would be governed by a complex law, the Administrative Procedure Act, that lays out the procedures for doing so.</p>

<p>Agencies often repeal rules adopted by previous administrations, but the process is lengthy, complicated, and legally fraught, and many agencies likely lack the resources needed to repeal a large number of rules at once.</p>

<p>To rescind a rule, the APA requires agencies to release a detailed proposal, including legal justifications and potential costs, and accept and respond to public comments. That can take months or longer.</p>

<p>Agency rules can also be wiped out by Congress with the president's approval, but only within a short period after they are enacted, so that process cannot be used to eliminate older rules.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT CAN TRUMP DO TO BLOCK RULES FROM BEING ENFORCED?</strong></p>

<p>There are federal laws authorizing the president to block certain agency rules, such as some immigration regulations. Otherwise, any call by Trump to stop enforcing a rule is more of a recommendation, though one that a loyal appointee may be likely to comply with.</p>

<p>Agencies and their politically appointed heads have some latitude in setting enforcement priorities. But they are legally bound to enforce the law in many cases, and cannot stop enforcing a regulation as a way around the cumbersome process of repealing it, experts said.</p>

<p>And, any effort by Trump and his appointees to cease enforcement of rules by agencies will not prevent individuals from filing lawsuits alleging violations of them. Many agency regulations are issued pursuant to laws that allow for private lawsuits, such as environmental and wage laws.</p>

<p><strong>WILL AGENCIES BE SUED FOR REPEALING RULES?</strong></p>

<p>Moves by Trump and his appointees to eliminate existing rules will be met with legal challenges, as many progressive groups and Democratic officials have made clear. Lawsuits seeking to block repeals or reinstate rules that have been rescinded have become common, and typically claim that agencies failed to adequately justify eliminating them or did not respond to concerns raised in public comments.</p>

<p>The first Trump administration was rebuked on several occasions for not following those procedures in eliminating Obama-era policies.</p>

<p>If Trump follows through on DOGE's recommendations, it would likely trigger a flood of lawsuits across the country, yielding mixed results.</p>

<p>Trump appointed 234 judges in his first term, including dozens to appeals courts, and many have shown deep skepticism of the administrative powers long wielded by federal agencies. Opponents of Trump's policies could turn to friendlier courts with more Democratic appointees, mirroring a trend of conservative and business groups bringing challenges to the Biden administration in certain courts in Texas.</p>

<p><strong>HOW WILL THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS GUIDE DOGE'S WORK?</strong></p>

<p>In a 2022 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that agencies cannot address "major questions" with broad economic or societal impact without explicit permission from Congress. And in a landmark June ruling, the court overturned its own precedent and said courts no longer were required to defer to an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous law.</p>

<p>Musk and Ramaswamy said their review will focus on regulations that are invalid in light of those decisions, which were seen as major victories in a campaign by conservative groups to rein in the "administrative state." But the Supreme Court's holdings in those cases were nuanced, and it will take years for courts to sort out how they apply to individual regulations, lawyers and other experts said.</p>

<p>Many regulations are explicitly authorized by Congress or have been upheld by courts on their merits rather than out of deference, making it more difficult to justify repealing them under the recent Supreme Court rulings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new draft deal at UN climate talks Friday proposes that rich nations commit $250 billion a year to help poorer nations combat global warming in an 11th-hour bid to break the deadlocked negotiations.</p>

<p>African countries and climate activists quickly denounced the figure as "unacceptable" and inadequate to meet the realities of a rapidly warming world, but wealthy nations including the United States have insisted that massive packages are not politically realistic.</p>

<p>With the gathering scheduled to end later Friday, delegates from nearly 200 nations had eagerly awaited COP29 hosts Azerbaijan's new proposal after two weeks of fraught bargaining.</p>

<p>The text sets an ambitious overall target to raise at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 from not only the public money but also the private sector.</p>

<p>It is the first time concrete numbers were formally proposed at talks dominated by divisions over how to increase assistance for developing nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.</p>

<p>Developing countries were seeking a significant boost in the existing pledge that commits rich nations to $100 billion a year in climate finance.</p>

<p>"The proposed target to mobilise $250 billion per year by 2035 is totally unacceptable and inadequate to delivering the Paris Agreement," said Ali Mohamed, chairman of the African Group of Negotiators.</p>

<p>He said it would "lead to unacceptable loss of life in Africa and around the world, and imperils the future of our world."</p>

<p>"The $250 billion target is not enough -- not big enough, not fast enough, not good enough," said Friederike Roder from activist group Global Citizen.</p>

<p>"Inadequate, divorced from the reality of climate impacts and outrageously below the needs of developing countries," said Jasper Inventor from Greenpeace.</p>

<p>But the US, which President-elect Donald Trump is expected to pull out of climate diplomacy, signalled it was not looking to negotiate a higher figure.</p>

<p>"It has been a significant lift over the past decade to meet the prior, smaller goal. $250 billion will require even more ambition and extraordinary reach," said a senior US official, whose team in Baku comes from outgoing President Joe Biden's administration.</p>

<p>COP29 host Azerbaijan said the $250 billion reflected the submissions made by rich nations during the negotiations.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan said it would keep working on "final adjustments" on outstanding issues.</p>

<p>- Azerbaijan under pressure -</p>

<p>An influential negotiation bloc of 134 developing nations including China had pushed for at least $500 billion from developed countries.</p>

<p>But major contributors such as the European Union have said that private-sector money inevitably must play a part.</p>

<p>The EU also wanted newly wealthy emerging economies like China, the world's largest emitter, to contribute to the overall goal.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan, an authoritarian state that relies on oil and gas exports, has been accused of lacking the experience and bandwidth to steer such large and complex negotiations.</p>

<p>"This is the worst COP in recent memory," Mohamed Adow, speaking for the Climate Action Network, said at a press conference before the text's release, adding that "no deal is better than a bad deal" for developing countries.</p>

<p>Sindra Sharma from the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network, an activist coalition, expressed "a complete sense of frustration" at the talks.</p>

<p>"I've never seen a presidency like this, I've never seen a process like this," she said.</p>

<p>The EU had also called for stronger leadership from Azerbaijan, whose leader, Ilham Aliyev, opened the conference by railing against Western nations and hailing fossil fuels as a "gift of God".</p>

<p>- Fossil fuel fight -</p>

<p>Apart from splits over money, many nations fear the climate deal in negotiation does not reflect the urgency on phasing out coal, oil and gas -- the main drivers of global warming.</p>

<p>Last year's COP28 summit in Dubai made a landmark call on the world to transition away from fossil fuels after long negotiations in Dubai.</p>

<p>But a Saudi official speaking on behalf of the Arab Group said the bloc would "not accept any text that targets any specific sectors, including fossil fuel" in Baku.</p>

<p>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock singled out Saudi Arabia as she said it was "essential" to keep last year's call on fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"Apparently some had a different goal here, and that is turning back the clock," she told reporters.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese hackers are positioning themselves in US critical infrastructure in the event of a clash with the United States, a top American cybersecurity official said on Friday.</p>

<p>Morgan Adamski, the executive director of US Cyber Command, said ongoing Chinese-linked cyber operations are aimed at gaining "an advantage in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the US"</p>

<p>Adamski made the comments to researchers at the Cyberwarcon security conference in Arlington, Virginia. On Thursday, US Senator Mark Warner told the Washington Post that a suspected China-linked hack on US telecommunications firms was "the worst telecom hack in our nation's history - by far."</p>

<p>That cyberespionage operation, dubbed "Salt Typhoon," has included stolen call records data, the compromise of communications of top officials of both major US presidential campaigns before the Nov. 5 election, and telecommunications information related to US law enforcement requests, the FBI said in a recent statement.</p>

<p>Beijing routinely denies cyber operations targeting US entities. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite international efforts to sanction North Korea for developing weapons of mass destruction, the country continues to receive illicit supplies of refined petroleum products. These products are crucial for manufacturing weapons.</p>

<p>A recent analysis using <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.planet.com/pulse/planets-data-used-to-reveal-illicit-shipping-networks-delivering-fuel-to-north-korea-in-violation-of-un-sanctions/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Planet's</a> satellite tasking system has revealed North Korea's involvement in an organized criminal network to obtain fuel in violation of international sanctions. The network relies on a complex and convoluted shipping system.</p>

<p>At the center of this operation is the tanker "Diamond 8." Satellite imagery shows how fuel is transferred from one ship to another, eventually arriving in North Korean ports. This secretive supply chain allows North Korea to bypass international sanctions and continue developing its weapons program.</p>

<p>"It's a constant game of cat and mouse and they are always trying to stay ahead. You cannot see what they are doing without satellite data," Lauren Sung, an analyst at The Center for Advanced Defense Studies said.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4pr0gyyzo" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">BBC</a>, it is estimated that Russia has been supplying more than a million barrels of oil to North Korea, as a payment for the troops they have received from them for the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>North Korea is the only country that cannot buy oil on the open market and the number of barrels it can receive is capped at 500,000 by the UN.</p>

<p>It is against UN sanctions to transfer or sell oil to North Korea except in small quantities, in order to make sure they do not develop nuclear weapons and the satellite images clearly show violation of the sanctions. Moreover, there are pictures to support the same, where it is visible that the tankers arrive empty and leave full.</p>

<p>"While Kim Jong Un is providing Vladimir Putin with a lifeline to continue his war, Russia is quietly providing North Korea with a lifeline of its own," Joe Byrne from the Open Source Centre, said.</p>

<p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has told the BBC that, "To keep fighting in Ukraine, Russia has become increasingly reliant on North Korea for troops and weapons in exchange for oil."</p>

<p>Since March, North Korea has received more oil from Russia than double the annual cap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Go Myong-hyun, a senior research fellow at South Korea's Institute for National Security Strategy, said, "If you're sending your people to die in a foreign war, a million barrels of oil is just not sufficient reward."</p>

<p>Shin Won-sik, Seoul's top security advisor, has said that Russia seems to have helped North Korea with financial and technological support for its space programme.</p>

<p>However, the real concern is what else can be traded between the two countries, since Kim Jong Un has stepped up his support for Russia's war.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russian missile that struck the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday reached a top speed of more than 13,000 kph (8,000 mph) and took about 15 minutes to reach its target from its launch, Ukraine said on Friday in its first public assessment of the new weapon.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow struck a Ukrainian military facility with a new intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile known as "Oreshnik" as a warning to the West against supporting Ukraine's war effort.</p>

<p>The attack took place with fighting in the war nearing the three-year mark and Ukraine firing longer-range missiles supplied by its Western allies at targets inside Russia.</p>

<p>"The flight time of this Russian missile from the moment of its launch in the Astrakhan region to its impact in the city of Dnipro was 15 minutes," the military's Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The missile was equipped with six warheads: each equipped with six submunitions. The speed at the final part of the trajectory was over Mach 11."</p>

<p>Mach is a measurement of supersonic speed. Mach 11 equals about 13,600 kph.</p>

<p>HUR added that the weapon was likely to be from the Kedr missile complex, which deputy head Vadym Skibitsky told Ukrainian media is related to the Oreshnik system and was first tested in June 2021.</p>

<p>Skibitsky said Russia could have at least 10 more such missiles to test before they enter mass production, news agency Ukrinform reported.</p>

<p>Kyiv initially suggested Russia had fired an intercontinental ballistic missile, but US officials and NATO echoed Putin's description of the weapon as an intermediate-range ballistic missile.</p>

<p>Ukraine's foreign ministry on Thursday urged the international community to react swiftly to the strike.</p>

<p>NATO will hold an emergency meeting with Ukraine at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss Moscow's strike, a NATO source said on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.</p>

<p>The justices, who heard arguments in the case on Nov. 6, dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed a 2018 class action led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The Supreme Court opted not to resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been taken up. Its action leaves the lower court's decision in place.</p>

<p>The court's dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Facebook dispute was one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month involving the right of private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, was argued on Nov. 13. The Supreme Court has not ruled yet in the Nvidia case.</p>

<p>The complainants in the Facebook case claimed the company unlawfully withheld information from investors about a 2015 data breach involving British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica that affected more than 30 million Facebook users. They accused Facebook of misleading investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, a 1934 federal law that requires publicly traded companies to disclose their business risks.</p>

<p>Facebook's stock fell following 2018 media reports that Cambridge Analytica had used improperly harvested Facebook user data in connection with Donald Trump's successful US presidential campaign in 2016. The investors have sought unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock they held.</p>

<p>At issue was whether Facebook broke the law when it failed to detail the prior data breach in subsequent business-risk disclosures, and instead portrayed the risk of such incidents as purely hypothetical.</p>

<p>Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone expressed disappointment "in the Supreme Court's decision not to clarify this part of the law."</p>

<p>"The plaintiff's claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court," Stone said.</p>

<p>Facebook argued that it was not required to reveal that its warned-of risk had already materialized because "a reasonable investor" would understand risk disclosures to be forward-looking statements.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration supported the shareholders in the case.</p>

<p>US District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, prompting Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>George Washington University law professor Alan Morrison said that following the Supreme Court's dismissal of Facebook's appeal, the complainants would be expected to seek discovery, a process that involves the exchange of information among parties in a case. Morrison added that Facebook "might renew their motion to dismiss under a somewhat different standard - partially for purposes of delay."</p>

<p>The Cambridge Analytica data breach prompted US government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, various lawsuits and a US congressional hearing. The US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 brought an enforcement action against Facebook over the matter, which the company settled for $100 million. Facebook paid a separate $5 billion penalty to the US Federal Trade Commission over the issue.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court in prior rulings has limited the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency that polices securities fraud.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Friday that hospitals have only two days' fuel left before they must restrict services, after the UN warned aid delivery to the war-devastated territory is being crippled.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Friday that hospitals have only two days' fuel left before they must restrict services, after the UN warned aid delivery to the war-devastated territory is being crippled.</p>

<p>The alarm came a day after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant more than a year into the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas militants.</p>

<p>The United Nations and others have repeatedly decried humanitarian conditions, particularly in northern Gaza where Israeli security services said Friday they had killed two commanders involved in Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.</p>

<p>Medics in the Palestinian territory said an overnight Israeli raid on Beit Lahia and nearby Jabalia resulted in dozens killed or missing.</p>

<p>"We raise an urgent warning as all hospitals in Gaza Strip will stop working or reduce their services within 48 hours due to the occupation's (Israel's) obstruction of fuel entry," Marwan al-Hams, director of Gaza's field hospitals, said during a press conference.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization had already expressed grave concern Tuesday for hospitals still partly operating in Gaza.</p>

<p>"It's getting harder and harder to get the aid in," WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said in Geneva.</p>

<p>Late Thursday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Muhannad Hadi, said: "The delivery of critical aid across Gaza, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies, is grinding to a halt."</p>

<p>In a statement, he said that for more than six weeks Israeli authorities "have been banning commercial imports" while "a surge in armed looting" has targeted aid convoys.</p>

<p><strong>'Absurd and false'</strong></p>

<p>Vowing to stop Hamas from regrouping in northern Gaza, Israel on October 6 began its air and ground operation in Jabalia and then expanded it to Beit Lahia.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence rescue agency could not immediately give an exact toll after the latest Israeli raid, but the health ministry says Israel's operation in the north has killed thousands.</p>

<p>The UN says more than 100,000 have been displaced from the area, and an official told the Security Council last week that people "are effectively starving".</p>

<p>Issuing the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, the Hague-based ICC said there were "reasonable grounds" to believe they bore "criminal responsibility" for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare, and crimes against humanity including over "the lack of food, water, electricity and fuel, and specific medical supplies".</p>

<p>The unprecedented move drew a furious reaction from Netanyahu, who said in a statement: "Israel rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions and accusations made against it."</p>

<p>Netanyahu also said the judges were "driven by anti-Semitic hatred of Israel".</p>

<p>On Friday he thanked his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban for his show of "moral clarity" for inviting him to visit in defiance of the ICC warrant which Orban branded "political".</p>

<p>Hungary currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose country is Israel's top military supplier, called the warrants against Israeli leaders "outrageous", but other world leaders expressed support for the court.</p>

<p>Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said Friday Netanyahu would be arrested if he set foot in the country.</p>

<p><strong>Warrant for Hamas chief</strong></p>

<p>The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif, saying it had grounds to suspect him of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the attacks on Israel that sparked the war, and including "sexual and gender-based violence" against hostages.</p>

<p>Israel said it killed Deif in July, but Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p>

<p>On the day the warrants were issued, a UN representative said an Israeli raid on Syria this week was "likely the deadliest" by Israel on the country so far. On Friday a war monitor said the strikes on Palmyra killed 92 pro-Iran fighters.</p>

<p>Israel again bombed Gaza on Friday.</p>

<p>In Gaza City, just south of Jabalia, one man who said he took his cousins to hospital after a strike urged "the world... to put an end" to the war.</p>

<p>"We've had enough," said Belal, who gave only his first name and said 10 members of his family had been killed.</p>

<p>"I'm the only one left," he said.</p>

<p>At least 44,056 people have been killed in Gaza during more than 13 months of war, most of them civilians, according to figures from Gaza's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>Hamas triggered the war with the deadliest attack in Israeli history, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The war expanded to Lebanon in late September when Israel escalated air strikes against Iran-backed Hezbollah and later sent in ground troops to southern Lebanon against the group, after nearly a year of tit-for-tat cross border clashes which Hezbollah said were in support of Hamas.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry says more than 3,580 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them since late September.</p>

<p>Thousands of UN peacekeepers are based in southern Lebanon. They have reported coming under attack numerous times, blaming both Israel and "non-state" actors.</p>

<p>On Friday, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Hezbollah was probably behind a rocket attack that hit their position and left four Italian peacekeepers lightly hurt.</p>

<p>Israeli air strikes again hit Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold Friday, as well as south Lebanon, the official National News Agency said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow would carry out more tests of the hypersonic Oreshnik ballistic missile in "combat conditions," a day after firing one on Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We will continue these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and character of the security threats posted to Russia," Putin said in a televised meeting with military chiefs.</p>

<p>Russia fired the new-generation missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro early on Thursday in a major escalation of the weaponry being deployed in the nearly three-year conflict.</p>

<p>The Kremlin boss also ordered the missile, which flies at speeds of Mach 10 -- 10 times the speed of sound -- to be put into serial production (mass production). Russia is developing similar advanced systems, he added.</p>

<p>"We need to begin serial production. The decision... has in effect been taken," Putin said, praising the "particular strength of this weapon and its power.</p>

<p>"The weapon system that was tested yesterday is another faithful guarantee of Russia's territorial integrity and sovereignty," he added.</p>

<p>Putin claimed no other countries in the world had such missile technology. While he conceded other states would soon develop them, he said: "That will be tomorrow, after a year or two. But we have this system now. That's important."</p>

<p>His choreographed meeting with the defence minister and those in charge of developing the missile came at the end of a week that has seen the Ukraine conflict escalate rapidly.</p>

<p>Putin said the firing of the Oreshnik missile was a direct response to Kyiv's forces using US- and UK-supplied missiles on Russian territory for the first time.</p>

<p>In an address to the nation on Thursday, Putin said Russia reserved the right to fire missiles at military facilities in countries whose weapons are being used by Ukraine -- specifically the United States and Britain.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The judge in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case ordered on Friday that sentencing be delayed indefinitely, a legal win for the President-elect as he prepares to return to the White House.</p>

<p>Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in May after a jury found he had fraudulently manipulated business records to cover up an alleged sexual encounter with a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Prosecutors argued that concealing the alleged tryst was intended to help him win his first run for the White House.</p>

<p>Trump, who had been scheduled to be sentenced on November 26, had fought against any effort to sentence him before his return to the presidency in January.</p>

<p>"It is... ordered that the joint application for a stay of sentencing is granted to the extent that the November 26, 2024 date is adjourned," said judge Juan Merchan in an order.</p>

<p>Trump's legal team have cited a Supreme Court ruling giving presidents sweeping immunity for official acts.</p>

<p>That landmark ruling saw the court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, decide that presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for a range of official acts committed while in office.</p>

<p><strong>'Motion to dismiss'</strong></p>

<p>Ahead of the election, Trump's lawyers moved to have the case thrown out in light of the Supreme Court decision, a move which prosecutors have firmly rejected.</p>

<p>On Friday the judge granted Trump leave to seek to have the conviction thrown out, likely meaning several further hearings that could be delayed once Trump is sworn in.</p>

<p>"The defendant's request for leave to file a motion to dismiss... is granted," added Merchan's order.</p>

<p>In a separate 2020 election interference case, Special Counsel Jack Smith moved to vacate deadlines, delaying the case indefinitely -- but not yet dropping it outright.</p>

<p>The move was in line with long-standing Department of Justice policy not to prosecute sitting US presidents.</p>

<p>The Manhattan prosecutor previously acknowledged in correspondence with the court that "these are unprecedented circumstances" and called for the competing interests of the jury's verdict and Trump's election to be balanced.</p>

<p>Trump's former attorney general Bill Barr previously said that both the New York case as well as others around the country had been "plainly brought for political purposes (and) have now been extensively aired and rejected in the court of public opinion."</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly derided the hush money case as a witch hunt, saying it "should be rightfully terminated."</p>

<p>Alongside the New York case, brought by state-level prosecutors, Trump faces two active federal cases: one related to his effort to overturn the 2020 election and the other connected to classified documents he allegedly mishandled after leaving office.</p>

<p>However, as president, he would be able to intervene to end those cases, and Smith, the special counsel handling both cases, has reportedly begun to wind them down.</p>

<p>A Trump-appointed federal judge already threw out the documents case, but Smith had sought to appeal that decision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of residents from the Russian border region of Kursk have been returned to Russia from Ukraine following rare and "painstaking" talks between Moscow and Kyiv, Moscow said Friday.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a major ground offensive into the Kursk region in August, capturing large swathes of Russian territory home to thousands of civilians.</p>

<p>It was not clear why the residents had been transported into Ukraine, and there was no immediate comment from Kyiv.</p>

<p>"Today, 46 residents of the Kursk region returned to Russia from Ukraine as a result of a negotiation process with the Ukrainian side," Russian human rights ombudsman Tatiana Moskalkova said.</p>

<p>The residents were all from the Sudzhansky district, home to the border town of Sudzha which Ukraine captured shortly after launching its offensive, according to local governor Alexei Smirnov.</p>

<p>"The painstaking and lengthy negotiations to return our fellow countrymen to their homeland have brought results," he said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The residents included 12 children and were returned via Belarus, with all of them being given "all necessary assistance", he added.</p>

<p>One of the children being returned in the deal was three-year-old Darina, her mother, Anastasia Gridina, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They are already on the way. In four hours I will meet Darina," she said.</p>

<p>Gridina had gone to Moscow for temporary work, leaving her daughter with her grandmother in the Kursk region village of Lebedevka when Ukraine launched its shock offensive.</p>

<p>In October she told AFP she had been pleading for help "everywhere," even writing a personal letter to President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>At one point she tried to cross the front line herself, but was forced to turn back.</p>

<p>The deal comes at a tense moment in the Ukraine conflict, with Kyiv firing British and US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia and Moscow firing a hypersonic missile at its neighbour.</p>

<p>The limited return of civilians, as well as exchanges of captured soldiers and bodies of killed fighters have become the only areas of co-operation between the two sides, which have been fighting since Moscow launched its full-scale offensive in February 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers have spotted orbiting around a young star a newborn planet that took only 3 million years to form - quite swift in cosmic terms - in a discovery that challenges the current understanding of the speed of planetary formation.</p>

<p>This infant world, estimated at around 10 to 20 times the mass of Earth, is one of the youngest planets beyond our solar system - called exoplanets - ever discovered. It resides alongside the remnants of the disk of dense gas and dust circling the host star - called a protoplanetary disk - that provided the ingredients for the planet to form.</p>

<p>The star it orbits is expected to become a stellar type called an orange dwarf, less hot and less massive than our sun. The star's mass is about 70% that of the sun and it is about half as luminous. It is located in our Milky Way galaxy about 520 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).</p>

<p>"This discovery confirms that planets can be in a cohesive form within 3 million years, which was previously unclear as Earth took 10 to 20 million years to form," said Madyson Barber, a graduate student in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>"We don't really know how long it takes for planets to form," UNC astrophysicist and study co-author Andrew Mann added. "We know that giant planets must form faster than their disk dissipates because they need a lot of gas from the disk. But disks take 5 to 10 million years to dissipate. So do planets form in 1 million years? 5? 10?"</p>

<p>The planet, given the names IRAS 04125+2902 b and TIDYE-1b, orbits its star every 8.8 days at a distance about one-fifth that separating our solar system's innermost planet Mercury from the sun. Its mass is in between that of Earth, the largest of our solar system's rocky planets, and Neptune, the smallest of the gas planets. It is less dense than Earth and has a diameter about 11 times greater. Its chemical composition is not known.</p>

<p>The researchers suspect that the planet formed further away from its star and then migrated inward.</p>

<p>"Forming large planets close to the star is difficult because the protoplanetary disk dissipates away from closest to the star the fastest, meaning there's not enough material to form a large planet that close that quickly," Barber said.</p>

<p>The researchers detected it using what is called the "transit" method, observing a dip in the host star's brightness when the planet passes in front of it, from the perspective of a viewer on Earth. It was found by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, space telescope.</p>

<p>"This is the youngest-known transiting planet. It is on par with the youngest planets known," Barber said.</p>

<p>Exoplanets not detected using this method sometimes are directly imaged using telescopes. But these typically are massive ones, around 10 times greater than our solar system's largest planet Jupiter.</p>

<p>Stars and planets form from clouds of interstellar gas and dust.</p>

<p>"To form a star-planet system, the cloud of gas and dust will collapse and spin into a flat environment, with the star at the center and the disk surrounding it. Planets will form in that disk. The disk will then dissipate starting from the inner region near the star," Barber said.</p>

<p>"It was previously thought that we wouldn't be able to find a transiting planet this young because the disk would be in the way. But for some reason that we aren't sure of, the outer disk is warped, leaving a perfect window to the star and allowing us to detect the transit," Barber added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said Thursday it had launched a joint investigation with its French counterparts into "suspected bribery and corruption" at the France-based multinational defence giant Thales.</p>

<p>"Investigators from the SFO and French authority Parquet National Financier (PNF) have informed the company of the investigation," it said, noting the two agencies were probing "in their respective jurisdictions".</p>

<p>Thales has its headquarters in Paris. Thales UK is a subsidiary and one of the British government's key defence contractors, employing over 7,000 staff at 16 sites across the country.</p>

<p>It built hundreds of lightweight missiles which the UK sent to Ukraine in September.</p>

<p>A Thales spokesperson confirmed that the SFO and the PNF had "commenced an investigation in relation to four of its entities in France and the UK".</p>

<p>"Thales is co-operating with the PNF in France and the SFO in the UK. The group complies with all national and international regulations.</p>

<p>"As the investigation is ongoing, Thales will not comment further."</p>

<p>The SFO announcement follows police in France, the Netherlands and Spain searching the multinational's offices in June, over suspicions of corruption linked to arms sales, according to reports.</p>

<p>SFO director Nick Ephgrave said he hoped the joint probe would reinforce the SFO's and PNF's "long-standing relationship, built on mutual cooperation and shared success".</p>

<p>"We will together rigorously pursue every avenue in our investigation into these serious allegations," he added in a statement, which did not provide any further details about the accusations.</p>

<p>The SFO is a specialist prosecuting authority tackling top level serious or complex fraud, bribery and corruption, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Thales specialises in defence electronics, and built the 650 so-called Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMMs) that the UK announced it would supply to Ukraine in September, costing 162 million Pounds ($204 million).</p>

<p>The firm also won a 1.8-billion Pound UK defence contract in February, which will see it maintain the Royal Navy's fleet of ships and submarines for the next 15 years.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government indicated on Friday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be arrested on an International Criminal Court arrest warrant if he travelled to the UK.</p>

<p>The ICC on Thursday issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant in response to accusations of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the militant Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman refused to be drawn specifically on whether UK police would detain Netanyahu, telling reporters he would not "get into hypotheticals in relation to individual cases".</p>

<p>But he added: "The UK will always comply with its legal obligations as set out by domestic law and indeed international law."</p>

<p>Britain signed the Rome Statute, the international treaty that created the ICC, in 1998 and ratified it three years later.</p>

<p>The UK's ICC Act 2001 stipulates that when a government minister receives a request from the ICC for the arrest of an indictee they "shall transmit the request and the documents accompanying it" to an appropriate court.</p>

<p>"If the request is accompanied by a warrant of arrest and the appropriate judicial officer is satisfied that the warrant appears to have been issued by the ICC, he shall endorse the warrant for execution in the United Kingdom," the act adds.</p>

<p>Officials say the act has not yet been used because someone charged by the ICC has never visited Britain.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether the UK court process begins after the ICC issues the arrest or once the indicted person lands on British soil.</p>

<p>"We would obviously fulfil our obligations under the act," added Starmer's spokesman.<br />

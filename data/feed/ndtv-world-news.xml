       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two US officials told Reuters.</p>

<p>The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program.</p>

<p>"We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003," said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>The intelligence assessment could help explain US opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>US officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so.</p>

<p>"We're all watching this space very carefully," the Biden administration official said.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program.</p>

<p><strong>Key Iran ally weakened</strong></p>

<p>In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month.</p>

<p>The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself.</p>

<p>Beth Sanner, a former US deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is "higher now than it has been" and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>That would still take time, however.</p>

<p>"They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months," said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.</p>

<p>Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN watchdog.</p>

<p>The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to "a week or a little more," according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president.Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Israeli attack</strong></p>

<p>Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the US military.</p>

<p>The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat.</p>

<p>The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel.</p>

<p>Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: "That's the thing you wanna hit, right?"</p>

<p>Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead.</p>

<p>"The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity," he said.</p>

<p>"They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first of two naval ships evacuating Turkish citizens and their families from war-torn Lebanon landed at a port in southern Turkey late on Thursday, an AFP correspondent at the scene said.</p>

<p>The TCG Bayraktar, which set sail from Beirut around 8:00 am (0500 GMT), pulled into the port of Mersin around 9:00 pm carrying the first batch of 966 people.</p>

<p>As it pulled into the port, a large group of journalists were waiting on the quayside.</p>

<p>A second boat carrying a similar number of passengers was set to dock around midnight, officials said.</p>

<p>Turkish officials said around 2,000 people had signed up to leave Lebanon on navy ships in the first such evacuation by sea.</p>

<p>Turkey, which is estimated to have 14,000 citizens registered with its consulate in Lebanon, announced the move on Tuesday because of the deteriorating security situation in the country.</p>

<p>Speaking to AFP in Beirut ahead of the boats' departure on Wednesday, Turkish ambassador in Lebanon Ali Baris Ulusoy told AFP the evacuation was a first and came after "a growing number of requests from our Turkish nationals living in Lebanon to be evacuated".</p>

<p>He said they were allowing close relatives "who are not necessarily Turkish nationals, like spouses, children or parents" to travel too.</p>

<p>Israel and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily fire on the country's southern border since the start of the Gaza war a year ago.</p>

<p>But Israel has intensified its strikes against Hezbollah since September 23, killing more than 1,200 people in Lebanon and displacing more than a million from their homes.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noting that conflicts in different parts of the world are having the most negative impact on the countries of the Global South, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called for the restoration of peace and stability in Eurasia and West Asia.</p>

<p>Addressing the 19th East Asia Summit, PM Modi also asserted that solutions to problems cannot come from the battlefield.</p>

<p>He also said a free, open, inclusive, prosperous and rule-based Indo-Pacific is important for the peace and progress of the entire region.</p>

<p>Peace, security and stability of the South China Sea is in the interest of the entire Indo-Pacific region, he said.</p>

<p>“We believe that maritime activities should be conducted under the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS). It is necessary to ensure freedom of navigation and air space. A strong and effective Code of Conduct should be created. And it should not curb the foreign policy of regional countries,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>“Our approach should be one of developmentalism and not expansionism,” he said.</p>

<p>Noting that the conflicts going on in different parts of the world are having the most negative impact on the countries of the Global South, PM Modi said everyone wants whether it is Eurasia or West Asia, peace and stability should be restored as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“I come from the land of Buddha, and I have repeatedly said that this is not the era of war. Solutions to problems cannot come from the battlefield,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is necessary to respect sovereignty, territorial integrity and international laws. Keeping a humanitarian approach, dialogue and diplomacy will have to be given priority,” the prime minister asserted.</p>

<p>Fulfilling the responsibility of ‘Vishwabandhu', India will continue to contribute in every possible way in this direction, he added.</p>

<p>His remarks came amidst conflicts between Ukraine and Russia in Eurasia and the Israel-Hamas war in West Asia.</p>

<p>“Terrorism is also a serious challenge to global peace and security. To face it, forces believing in humanity will have to work together,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>At the start of his address, he also expressed his deepest condolences to the people affected by “Typhoon Yagi”, a destructive tropical cyclone which impacted Southeast Asia and South China in September this year.</p>

<p>“In this difficult time, we have provided humanitarian assistance through Operation Sadbhav,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>PM Modi also said India has always supported ASEAN Unity and Centrality and pointed out that ASEAN is also at the centre of India's Indo-Pacific vision and Quad cooperation.</p>

<p>“There are deep similarities between India's ‘Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative' and ‘ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific',” he said.</p>

<p>“We support the ASEAN approach to the situation in Myanmar. We also support the Five-point Consensus. At the same time, we believe that it is important to maintain humanitarian assistance,” PM Modi said.</p>

<p>He called for appropriate steps for the restoration of democracy there.</p>

<p>“We believe that, for this, Myanmar should be engaged, not isolated,” he said.</p>

<p>As a neighbouring country, India will continue to fulfil its responsibility, he added.</p>

<p>The East Asia Summit is an important pillar of India's Act East Policy, he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man, clinging to a cooler in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, was saved by a Coast Guard helicopter crew on October 10, around 48 kilometres off Longboat Key. The <a href="https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3933279/coast-guard-rescues-man-off-longboat-key-following-hurricane-milton/">rescue operation</a> took place around 1:30 pm and the man was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital for medical evaluation. He was found wearing a life jacket, which played a big role in his survival during the storm.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard's Air Station Miami launched the search mission on Thursday morning after receiving reports of a missing captain. The aircrew, alongside support from Air Station Clearwater, was positioned at the Aviation Training Center Mobile for storm avoidance during Hurricane Milton.</p>

<p>The captain, aboard the fishing vessel Capt. Dave initially contacted Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg on the afternoon of October 7. He reported that he and a crew member were stranded about 32 kilometres&nbsp;off John's Pass. The Coast Guard promptly dispatched a rescue boat and a helicopter, bringing the pair to safety and then to Air Station Clearwater without injury. Capt. Dave was left adrift while salvage arrangements were made.</p>

<p>On October 9, the vessel's owner notified the Coast Guard that the captain went out to the boat for repairs in the early hours and had not been heard since. However, after a connection was re-established with the captain, he reported that his vessel's rudder had become fouled with a line, rendering the boat inoperable.</p>

<p>At the time, sea conditions were challenging, with 6 to 8-foot waves and winds of about 48 kmph. However, the weather rapidly worsened as Hurricane Milton approached. The Coast Guard instructed the captain to wear a life jacket and remain near the vessel's emergency position indicating a radio beacon. Unfortunately, communication was lost on the evening of October 9.</p>

<p>“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” said Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, chief of the command centre at Sector St. Petersburg. “To understand the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot seas, for an extended period of time to include overnight. He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler.”</p>

<p>Hurricane Milton made landfall on October 9 near Siesta Key, a barrier island located just south of Sarasota on Florida's central west coast. Initially, the storm struck as a formidable Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds reaching approximately 193 kmph. However, as it moved inland, it weakened to a Category 2 storm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk on Thursday unveiled what he said was a robotaxi capable of self-driving, predicting it would be available by 2027 -- about a decade after he first promised an autonomous vehicle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Thursday unveiled what he said was a robotaxi capable of self-driving, predicting it would be available by 2027 -- about a decade after he first promised an autonomous vehicle.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO said the fully electric car -- which has no steering wheel or pedals -- would be priced under $30,000, would be charged wirelessly with inductive technology and would be "10 to 20 times safer" than human-driven cars.</p>

<p>"You can think of the car in an autonomous world as being like just a little lounge," he told a crowd at the Warner Brothers Studio lot near Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"You're just sitting in a comfortable little lounge, and you can do whatever you want while you're in this comfortable little lounge, and when you get out, you will be at your destination."</p>

<p>Few details were given about the vehicle, whose gullwing doors are reminiscent of the Delorean made famous by the "Back to the Future" films, but Musk said Tesla already had 50 of them.</p>

<p>He said the company was expecting to begin "fully autonomous, unsupervised" driving in Texas and California next year with existing models, and then move on to production of what he called the "cybercab".</p>

<p>"I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames, but in 2026, so yeah, before 2027. Let me put it that way."</p>

<p><strong>Robovan and Optimus robot</strong></p>

<p>The evening, which started almost an hour late, was heavy on sunny visions of the future, but light on specifics.</p>

<p>But it also showcased a mass passenger vehicle that Musk called "The Robovan."</p>

<p>The vehicle, which looks like an enormous moving toaster, has no steering wheel, pedals or driver.</p>

<p>It can seat up to 20 people or could be converted to carry goods, Musk said.</p>

<p>He gave no details about production or any timeline.</p>

<p>Musk also brought out dancing humanoid robots called Optimus that he said would one day be able to do menial tasks, as well as offer friendship.</p>

<p>"I think this will be the biggest product ever of any kind," he said, adding that he expected the robot to retail for $20,000 to $30,000.</p>

<p>He gave no timeline on this, either, and it was not clear from the livestream what the robot's capabilities were, although it was shown walking amongst audience members, handing out plaques and serving drinks.</p>

<p><strong>Trump</strong></p>

<p>Musk's bullish pronouncements and dedicated fanbase have helped build Tesla into one of the world's most valuable companies.</p>

<p>While he was once the darling of the political left for his environmentalist moves towards electrifying transport, he has become increasingly controversial.</p>

<p>Since buying Twitter -- which he renamed X -- the free speech absolutist cut staffing on the platform, leading many long-time users and advertisers to abandon the forum.</p>

<p>And he's currently spending time and money promoting Republican Donald Trump, echoing the billionaire presidential candidate's dire warnings about migrants and a crumbling America, including during an exuberant appearance at a weekend Trump rally that was widely mocked.</p>

<p>Thursday night's robotaxi reveal was a long time coming.</p>

<p>Musk first said in 2016 a fully automated car was two years away; a year later he was touting a vehicle by 2019 so clever that customers would be able to sleep while it drove them around.</p>

<p>But as many automakers have found, self-driving is tricky.</p>

<p>While lots of cars nowadays have limited automation, theoretically allowing the driver to cede some of the boring bits of driving to an onboard computer, the person behind the wheel still has to pay attention and jump in if the car does something unpredictable.</p>

<p>That's because computers, unlike people, are not very good at reacting to unexpected events or situations they have never seen before.</p>

<p>Other companies, such as Google's Waymo and General Motors' Cruise, have operated heavily regulated and limited pilot robotaxi programs for a few years already.</p>

<p>Anything Tesla tries to put on the road will face the same kind of regulatory hurdles, as well as skepticism from the general public, many of whom have never seen a car without a driver.</p>

<p>Immediate reaction to the reveals was mixed.</p>

<p>"Delusional nonsense from a liar who has been promising a robotaxi every year for a decade," wrote user @goodandnormal on X.</p>

<p>Others on the platform were more enthusiastic, with some predicting that Tesla's share price will soar when US markets open.</p>

<p>"Tesla self-driving 'Robovan.' The future looks promising," wrote @CollinsEbot1.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Barack Obama's ascent to the White House, Diana Vahabzadeh was a registered Independent who had never voted for a Democrat in her life.</p>

<p>But the first Black president of the United States won the now 63-year-old over during his initial 2008 campaign and she's leaned left ever since.</p>

<p>He was back on the trail Thursday and so was she, along with thousands of people at a rally in Pittsburgh backing Kamala Harris, which kicks off Obama's stumping blitz across swing states vital to winning November's neck-and-neck election.</p>

<p>Vahabzadeh has "loved him for years," she said: "This is a great opportunity to be able to see him and also support the ticket."</p>

<p>A playlist of pop classics and TikTok hits spun in the university gym where the marquee speaker's "Yes We Can" slogan from 2008 was repurposed as "Yes She Can," a message emblazoned on both homemade posters and an electric scoreboard in the field house.</p>

<p>"We love you Barack!" shouted one rallygoer as he appeared, soundtracked by U2's "City of Blinding Lights," a frequent track during his own presidential bids.</p>

<p>Flashing his megawatt smile, Obama cast the Republican nominee <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/has-donald-trump-ever-changed-a-diaper-barack-obama-at-kamala-harris-rally-6764162">Donald Trump as a selfish businessman</a> concerned only with his own accumulation of wealth and power, in contrast with Harris, who he said "is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president as ever been."</p>

<p>"That's who Kamala is."</p>

<p>In closing, he tapped the crowd-rousing vigor that propelled him to the top of the Democratic party decades ago, his voice rapidly amplifying as he dropped his demands: "Do not just sit back and hope for the best -- get off your couch and vote."</p>

<p>"Put down your phone, and vote!" he shouted to cheers. "Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States."</p>

<p><strong>'Powerful'</strong></p>

<p>The energy hit for Tia Douglas, a 20-year-old college student who was on the cusp of primary-school age when Obama first won office.</p>

<p>"It felt so powerful to be able to hear him speak," she told AFP with bright eyes and a wide smile following the rally.</p>

<p>"Listening to him made me even more excited to get out there in the next 26 days."</p>

<p>The Harris campaign is hoping the 63-year-old former president -- who led the US from 2009 to 2017 -- can imbue their White House bid with star power and help fend off Trump's potential return.</p>

<p>Obama walked out to ardent applause at the Pittsburgh field house, which was packed with a crowd diverse in background and age.</p>

<p>"I love seeing and hearing his articulate self," said Valerie Brown, a 66-year-old retired public schoolteacher.</p>

<p>She told AFP she hopes his words "might stimulate some others who are reluctant" to vote Harris.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris enjoyed a honeymoon surge in the polls when she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee over the summer, capturing the social media zeitgeist and raking in a reported billion dollars in fundraising.</p>

<p>But whether she ultimately can bat back Republican Trump, who is seeking a second term and still maintains a fervent base of support, remains anyone's guess, with key battleground states like Pennsylvania still vacillating between the candidates in the polls.</p>

<p>"I get it, why people are looking to shake things up," Obama said onstage, before drawing chuckles after riffing on his own former platform: "I mean, I'm the hopey-changey guy."</p>

<p>"I understand people feeling frustrated and people feeling we can do better," he continued. "What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania."</p>

<p><strong>'Lifetime icon'</strong></p>

<p>In the lead-up to the evening rally supporters snaked around the block of the University of Pittsburgh field house hoping for a spot inside.</p>

<p>To see Harris and Obama "join forces for the greater good," Douglas said, "I think is really amazing."</p>

<p>Douglas's friend Julia Palchikoff, a 20-year-old journalism major, said maturing in the Trump era made her appreciate Obama even more.</p>

<p>"Being in a swing state in an election like this, it's just a historical moment, and I feel like I have to do my part," said the Alaska native who moved to Pennsylvania for school.</p>

<p>"When I heard Obama was coming here, I was, like, I loved him as a kid -- and Kamala, honestly, it just feels like we're on the precipice of something really great."</p>

<p>Was it the Obama she expected?</p>

<p>"It totally was," she said, before lavishing a little more praise on the former leader: "Lifetime icon."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Serbian artist Marina Abramovic and German artist Ulay started from opposite ends of the Great Wall to meet and marry, but their trek, titled The Lovers, ended as a symbol of their separation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two renowned performance artists embarked on a unique journey along the Great Wall of China in 1988. Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic and German artist Frank Uwe Laysiepen, known as Ulay, started from opposite ends, to meet in the middle and marry in what would be a symbol of their enduring love and artistic collaboration. However, their ambitious trek, titled <em>The Lovers</em>, became a metaphor for their separation.<br />
<br />
Abramovic and Ulay met in Amsterdam in 1976 on their shared birthday, November 30, and there was an instant connection. Ulay described Abramovic&nbsp;as “witchy and otherworldly,” while she found him “wild and exciting.” They became inseparable, referring to themselves as a “two-headed body.”<br />
<br />
They spent years performing together, often in physically demanding and extreme situations, the Guardian reported. One of their famous performances, <em>Rest Energy</em>, involved Ulay holding a drawn bow aimed at Abramovic's heart. Meanwhile, the tension in their performances mirrored the tension in their relationship.<br />
<br />
For years, the couple lived a nomadic life, travelling in a van and performing in small towns and villages. As their relationship deepened, they envisioned<em> The Lovers</em> as their ultimate artistic expression – a journey of emotional and physical endurance, culminating in a symbolic wedding at the centre of the Great Wall. But that didn't go as planned.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, the project was fraught with challenges from the start. Chinese bureaucracy slowed the process as the couple faced years of delays. They were forced to repeatedly apply for permissions, deal with visa rejections and convince the Chinese authorities that walking the Great Wall as an art project was indeed a legitimate endeavour. By the time the walk was finally approved in 1988, five years had passed. Both Abramovic and Ulay had changed.<br />
<br />
When the walk began on March 30, 1988, Abramovic started her trek from the Bohai Sea, known as the “dragon's head,” while Ulay began from the Gobi Desert at the “dragon's tail”. Abramovic's journey was arduous, with treacherous terrain, steep mountains, and occasional near-death experiences. She walked through remote villages, seeking out local legends from the elders, many of which revolved around dragons. Ulay walked through desert landscapes. His journey was also not without its own challenges.<br />
<br />
When the two finally met after 90 days and roughly 2,000 km each, it was not for a wedding, but for a breakup. On a stone bridge in Shenmu, Shaanxi province, they embraced but the affection was bittersweet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Both changed during the long wait for the journey to begin. They both had affairs, communication broke down and the pressures of fame affected them in different ways. Abramovic embraced the success and recognition their work was getting, while Ulay, a self-described anarchist, shunned the commercialisation of their art.<br />
<br />
Their reunion came years later, in 2010, during Abramovic's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, titled <em>The Artist Is Present.</em> In the performance, Abramovic sat silently for 750 hours, inviting visitors to sit across from her and share a moment of silent connection.<br />
<br />
On the opening night, Ulay made a surprise appearance and sat across from each other for the first time in over two decades. They locked eyes, smiled and started crying. In a break from the rules of the performance, Marina Abramovic reached out and took Ulay's hands.&nbsp;<br />

After 22 years apart, their silent interaction, filled with emotion, touched millions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person died and a dozen people remain trapped deep in a disused Colorado gold mine after the shaft's elevator system malfunctioned during a tour Thursday, local police said.</p>

<p>The incident occurred during the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine Tour, which takes visitors 1,000 feet (300 meters) underground in the western US state.</p>

<p>A group of visitors were on board the elevator trolley system when the mechanical failure occurred, killing one person and injuring four.</p>

<p>Officials did not release further details about what went wrong, citing an active investigation.</p>

<p>"We did have one fatality that occurred during this issue at 500 feet," Teller County sheriff Jason Mikesell told a press conference.</p>

<p>The other 11 people on board the elevator at the time, including two children, were brought safely to the surface with the assistance of the mine operators and fire department officials.</p>

<p>Aside from the fatality, the four people hurt in the incident suffered only minor injuries, said Mikesell.</p>

<p>A further 12 people remain in a tunnel at the bottom of the mine.</p>

<p>They are safe and are accompanied by a mine employee, but cannot be moved until the elevator system is cleared as safe to be used again, said Mikesell.</p>

<p>Emergency officials with ropes are standing by in case they are required.</p>

<p>Chairs, blankets, and water have been provided to those in the mine.</p>

<p>"The atmospherics are good inside the tunnel," said Mikesell.</p>

<p>Those still inside the mine have not been informed of the fatality.</p>

<p>"We're just trying to keep down the worry of what's going on, so that nobody gets excited," added Mikesell.</p>

<p>The mine outside the small city of Cripple Creek, around 100 miles south of Denver, offers a chance to "Experience the 'Old West' as it was for hard rock gold miners of 'The World's Greatest Gold Camp,'" according to its official website.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As gushing water from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hurricane-milton-destroys-homes-leaves-2-million-without-power-in-florida-6758554">Hurricane Milton</a> flooded their Florida apartment, Lidier Rodriguez and Sandra Escalona rushed upstairs to safety -- a scene of danger and drama in a normally staid senior living facility.</p>

<p>Hours later, after the powerful storm hit Wednesday evening, they watched as the same emergency crews who rescued them at their residence -- a series of two-story apartment buildings -- helped other older people get out.</p>

<p>The complex is on a low-lying and now flooded street near Tampa Bay on Florida's west coast. Police and firefighters went from building to building in boats on Thursday, helping people get to dry land.</p>

<p>"We lost everything," said Rodriguez, a 54-year-old Cuban man who has been living in Florida for 20 years. "But at least we are alive. That is all we have left."</p>

<p>Outside their homes, dozens of residents look confused and shellshocked -- like they did not know what to do next.</p>

<p>They carried bags with the few belongings they were able to salvage, and in some cases their pet dogs and cats.</p>

<p>No one expected so much flooding in a neighborhood that was not part of the many mandatory evacuation zones that Florida officials declared in the second major hurricane in as many weeks.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was not damaged at all when Hurricane Helene hit late last month.</p>

<p>Milton killed at least 11 people as it churned across the state and then out to the Atlantic. But Floridians heaved a sigh of relief because the storm surge, catastrophic damage and loss of life that many people feared did not materialize in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Now, what?</strong></p>

<p>When Escalona saw a few inches of water on the floor of her home, she first thought a neighbor had left the water running, but soon realized something was very wrong.</p>

<p>"It all happened very quickly. The water rushed in suddenly, it was strong, with a lot of current," Escalona recalled.</p>

<p>"We grabbed some papers and the dog and left. We spent the night outside the door of the neighbors upstairs," she said.</p>

<p>Now she and her husband are wondering what to do and where to go.</p>

<p>"It is not easy to think you have everything and suddenly you have nothing," said Rodriguez.</p>

<p>"We dont know where to go. We have been in this country for nearly 20 years and have no family. It's her, me, and the dog," he said, pointing to their chihuahua Tito.</p>

<p><strong>Relief replaces fear</strong></p>

<p>Even though Milton was a powerful Category 3 hurricane on a five-level scale, in the end Florida was not hit nearly as hard as officials had feared.</p>

<p>In fact, most of the 11 fatalities from the storm happened on the east coast, away from where the storm made landfall, due to tornados that spun off from the storm.</p>

<p>In Sarasota, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Clearwater and near where the hurricane made landfall, streets were gradually getting back to normal.</p>

<p>Emergency crews cleared many streets before dawn, but there were still downed trees in some places, along with broken glass and other damage.</p>

<p>Near the marina in Sarasota, dozens of people walked around taking pictures of the storm damage with their cell phones.</p>

<p>They looked at a speedboat that had rammed into a boat rental office because of Milton's powerful winds.</p>

<p>Many people expressed relief that the city was not as badly damaged as they had expected.</p>

<p>"I think it could have been a lot worse," said retiree Donna Pickup.</p>

<p>That feeling of relief is shared in Punta Gorda, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Sarasota.</p>

<p>In that town, hit hard by Hurricane Ian in 2022, the storm surge that rushed in Wednesday night flooded seaside areas and left several yachts stranded on the oceanfront promenade.</p>

<p>But here, too, the damage was not as bad as many had feared.</p>

<p>"Thank God," said David Cardoso, "a lot of houses are in pretty good tack".</p>

<p>He added: "It was supposed to hit us worse."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 miners were killed and eight others were injured early Friday when unidentified armed men attacked their coal mines in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province.</p>

<p>The incident occurred in the Dukki area of the province, Dunya News reported.</p>

<p>The attack is the latest in a string of violence in Pakistan. It comes less ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's summit to be held in the national capital.</p>

<p>According to District Chairman Dukki Haji Khair Ullah Nasir, the attackers used hand grenades and rocket launchers in the attack. He said that there are ten coal mines located in the area.</p>

<p>Nasir said that the attackers also set ablaze mining machinery before fleeing the scene.</p>

<p>At least 20 miners were killed and eight others were wounded.</p>

<p>Police, paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and rescue teams rushed to the spot after the attack.</p>

<p>Police sources said that the death toll may rise as some injured minors were in critical condition.</p>

<p>SHO Dukki Hamanyan Khan said the armed men first gathered the miners in different groups and then sprayed bullets on them.</p>

<p>Heavy contingents of police and FC have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest the culprits.</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed a worrying surge in terrorist attacks in the ongoing year with fatalities in the first three quarters surpassing the numbers recorded in all of 2023.</p>

<p>As per the third Quarterly Report (Q3) issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), the number of fatalities rose to at least 1,534 in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to 1,523 in 2023.</p>

<p>Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting CPEC projects.</p>

<p>The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) accuses China and Islamabad of exploitation of the resource-rich province, a charge rejected by the authorities. It has fought a long-running insurgency for a separate homeland.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, two Chinese nationals were killed and 17 people injured in a suicide attack by a Baloch insurgent group that targeted a convoy of Chinese workers near Pakistan's busiest airport in Karachi. PTI SH NSA NSA</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army said Friday it had killed Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad's top commander for the Nur Shams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>The military said Mohammad Abdullah was "eliminated" on Thursday after Israeli aircraft struck the camp in Tulkarem.</p>

<p>An additional "terrorist" was killed in the operation, which recovered M-16 rifles and vests, it added.</p>

<p>Abdullah was the successor of Muhammad Jabber, also known as Abu Shujaa, who was killed in an Israeli strike in late August. Islamic Jihad is an ally of Hamas, with both groups battling Israeli forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Violence has soared in the West Bank since Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on Israel in October last year.</p>

<p>Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 705 Palestinians in the West Bank since, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry. Israeli officials say at least 24 Israelis, civilians or members of the security forces, have been killed in attacks carried out by Palestinian militants or in Israeli military operations over the same period in the West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 11 people died as Hurricane Milton sent tornadoes spinning across Florida, officials said Thursday as the state grappled with flooding, power outages and other issues from a milder than expected storm that many had feared would be catastrophic.</p>

<p>The hurricane blasted across the state late Wednesday before roaring into the Atlantic, leaving behind roads blocked by downed trees and power lines. It shredded the roof of a baseball stadium. Some three million homes and businesses were without power.</p>

<p>So far, though, it appeared that tornadoes, rather than floodwaters, have been responsible for the storm's deaths.</p>

<p>"It was pretty scary," said Susan Stepp, a 70-year-old resident of Fort Pierce, a city on Florida's east coast where four people in a senior living community died after a tornado spawned by Milton struck Wednesday.</p>

<p>"They did find some people just outside dead, in a tree," she told AFP. "I wish they would have evacuated."</p>

<p>The deaths are five in St. Lucie County, three in Volusia County two in the city of St. Petersburg and one in the city of Tampa, local authorities said. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters the deaths were caused by the tornadoes.</p>

<p>In Tampa, police found a woman in her early 70s trapped under a large tree branch and pronounced her dead, saying her death "is believed to be related to restoration efforts post Hurricane Milton."</p>

<p>In Polk County, a member of a road crew was struck and killed by a colleague's vehicle as he removed a downed tree.</p>

<p>Stepp's husband Bill said a tornado "picked up my 22-ton motor home and threw it across the yard."</p>

<p>"Scary and heartbreaking at the same time, to see much damage and all things you really love just gone, but it's only things and we're still here," the 72-year-old said.</p>

<p>The southeastern US state was able to avoid the level of catastrophic devastation that officials had feared.</p>

<p>"The storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told a news conference.</p>

<p>Milton made landfall on the Florida Gulf Coast as a major Category 3 storm, with powerful winds smashing communities still reeling from Hurricane Helene which hit only two weeks ago, killing 237 people in Florida and other southeast states.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service issued 126 tornado warnings across the state Wednesday, the most ever issued for a single calendar day for the state in records dating back to 1986, wrote hurricane expert Michael Lowry.</p>

<p>In Sarasota Bay, Kristin Joyce, a 72-year-old interior designer who did not evacuate either, took photos of tree branches snapped by the wind.</p>

<p>"There is no question it needs to be a serious wake-up call for everyone in terms of climate change," she told AFP, surveying the damage.</p>

<p>Scientists say extreme rainfall and destructive storms are occurring with greater severity and frequency as temperatures rise due to climate change. As warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, they provide more energy for storms as they form.</p>

<p><strong>Biden fury at Trump</strong></p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who said he spoke with DeSantis Thursday, urged people to stay inside in the aftermath of the storm, with downed power lines and debris creating dangerous conditions.</p>

<p>In a video posted on social media, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he and his wife Melania were praying for Florida residents affected by the storm and urged them to vote for him.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, on January 20th you're going to have somebody that's really going to help you and help you like never before," the former president said, referring to the presidential inauguration date.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene struck Florida late last month, and the back-to-back storms have become election fodder as Trump spreads conspiracy theories claiming Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris are abandoning victims.</p>

<p>That prompted a furious response from Biden who on Wednesday called Trump "reckless, irresponsible."</p>

<p><strong>'Lucky'</strong></p>

<p>In Cocoa Beach, on Florida's east coast, one tornado swept in from the ocean, blowing out almost all the windows of a hair salon and tearing a chunk of roof off a bank.</p>

<p>Katherine and Larry Hingle said they were on their porch, watching water from a nearby river rise, when the tornado came through Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>"I said 'it sounds like a train's coming,'" Katherine, 53, told AFP while out to walk their dog and survey the damage.</p>

<p>In Sarasota, resident Carrie Elizabeth expressed the feelings of many -- that despite the violent night, Milton was not quite as bad as had been feared.</p>

<p>"I feel that we're very lucky," she said. "It'll take a long time to clean up, but it could have been much worse."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Israeli soldiers were killed on Wednesday in the northern Gaza Strip, even as the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) stepped up air and ground operations in Jabaliya.</p>

<p>The deceased soldiers were identified as&nbsp;37-year-old Major Nathaniel Hershkowitz, 32-year-old&nbsp;Major Zvi Mattiyo Marantz and 32-year-old&nbsp;Major Uri Moshe Bornstein. Their funeral will be held at the&nbsp;Mount Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem on Friday.</p>

<p>The Israeli military amplified its offensive in Gaza's north, with troops encircling the key city of Jabaliya and some surrounding areas since Sunday with the goal to&nbsp;destroy the operational capabilities Hamas is trying to rebuild there.</p>

<p>Residents have been asked to evacuate, as the IDF aims to impose a&nbsp;total siege on Jabaliya until Hamas fighters surrender, according to news agency AFP. Further,&nbsp;Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee urged residents of the northern towns of Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya, Beit Lahia and other neighbourhoods to evacuate to southern Gaza.</p>

<p>The military said it has killed at least "20 terrorists".</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said the north has been pounded with air strikes in recent days, with dozens killed. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Hamas has said its fighters are targeting Israeli soldiers and tanks.</p>

<p>As the exchange of fire continues, Gaza's health ministry issued an appeal to the international community to bring in fuel to enable hospitals to continue providing services.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pacific Island nations are at risk of becoming bases for global criminal gangs, a report by the United Nations drug authority said on Friday, as criminal activity surges across the isolated and economically vulnerable region.</p>

<p>The report by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said the "threat environment" in the region from drug and people trafficking, illegal fishing and wildlife theft, money laundering and cybercrime is rising faster than at any other point in history.</p>

<p>The region is now home to drug cartels from the Americas, outlaw motorcycle gangs from Australia and New Zealand as well as Asian crime groups, it said.</p>

<p>"The thriving criminal ecosystem in the Pacific has attracted powerful transnational criminal networks from different corners of the world," the report said.</p>

<p>"There are growing concerns that parts of the region may mature into key nodes and footholds targeted by criminal groups engaged in a range of illicit activities."</p>

<p>Spread across thousands of kilometres (miles) of ocean, Pacific Island countries and territories are particularly vulnerable because of their isolation and economic vulnerability as well as high levels of corruption and limited state capacity, it said.</p>

<p>Many Pacific Islands have historically relied on foreign countries like Australia to help with policing, an issue that's become geopolitically charged since China deployed police to the Solomon Islands in 2022. It also has officers in Kiribati.</p>

<p>Australia said earlier this year China should have no role policing the region and has committed A$400 million ($270 million) to help train and deploy police in the region.</p>

<p>Its ally the United States, also concerned about China's influence in the region, said in August it would work with the region to police drug trafficking by criminal groups in China and Southeast Asia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A terrifying video has surfaced showing the moment a tree fell on a moving car in Florida, just before Hurricane Milton made landfall. The driver survived the incident, which took place in DeLand as 120-mph winds from the hurricane pummeled Florida's west coast. As of Thursday, the fatalities from the hurricane rose to at least 15, according to CNN. The powerful tropical storm has left over 3 million residents without power and has caused widespread devastation across the state.</p>

<p>Urban Search and Rescue Teams, along with the Florida National Guard, have been working around the clock to assist those affected. According to Governor Ron DeSantis, nearly 1,000 people have been rescued so far. There are 23 rescue teams, comprising over 1,600 personnel, currently deployed across Florida, with additional support expected from other states.</p>

<p>In St Lucie County, one of the hardest-hit areas, residents recalled the terrifying moments when tornadoes ripped through the region ahead of the storm's landfall. Susan Carlos, a resident of Sunnier Palms Park, described the experience as "the most frightening thing I've ever lived through," noting that the damage from the tornadoes was unlike anything she had ever seen since moving to Florida in 1989.</p>

<p>"I've lived in Florida since 1989. Never have I experienced damage or the amount of tornadoes that came through this area. It was the most frightening thing I've ever lived through," Carlos told CNN.</p>

<p>As recovery efforts continue, the Biden administration is closely monitoring the situation, with officials focusing on coordinating national efforts to ensure a smooth recovery process for the storm-ravaged state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has branded Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu the "butcher of Gaza" and compared him to Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed his attacks on Israel as he arrived in Tirana Thursday, the first stop of a Balkans tour that will also take him to Serbia.</p>

<p>Repeating his claim that Israel's actions in Gaza constituted "genocide", he branded it the "shame of humanity", at a joint press conference with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama.</p>

<p>"The international community, we must do our best to urgently guarantee a permanent ceasefire and exert the necessary pressure on Israel," he added.</p>

<p>"The genocide that has been going on in Gaza for the past year is the common shame of all humanity," he added.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>According to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, 42,065 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, mostly civilians. The UN has said the figures are reliable.</p>

<p>Erdogan has branded Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the "butcher of Gaza" and compared him to Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>"The aggression led by the Netanyahu government now threatens the world order beyond the region," Erdogan said.</p>

<p><strong>Great Mosque of Tirana</strong></p>

<p>Later Thursday Erdogan, accompanied by Prime Minister Edi Rama, inaugurated the Great Mosque of Tirana.</p>

<p>The largest Muslim place of worship in the Balkans, it has a capacity of up to 10,000 people. The project, funded by Turkey, cost 30 million euros.</p>

<p>Turkey is also a major employer in Albania. As Erdogan said in February, over 600 Turkish companies operate in the country, providing jobs to more than 15,000 workers.</p>

<p>It is also one of the five biggest foreign investors in Albania, he said, with $3.5 billion (3.2 billion euros) committed.</p>

<p>The two NATO member countries also have close military ties, with Turkey supplying Tirana with its Bayraktar TB2 drones.</p>

<p><strong>Serbia visit</strong></p>

<p>For the second stage of his tour Erdogan travelled from Albania to Serbia, where he was greeted at Belgrade airport by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.</p>

<p>Turkey made a diplomatic comeback here in 2017 when Erdogan made a landmark visit to Belgrade.</p>

<p>The five century Ottoman presence in Serbia has traditionally weighed heavily on Belgrade-Ankara relations.</p>

<p>Another source of tension has been Turkey's historic ties with Serbia's former breakaway province of Kosovo. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, a move Belgrade still refuses to recognise.</p>

<p>Erdogan's 2017 visit repaired the relationship with Serbia, Belgrade analyst Vuk Vuksanovic told AFP.</p>

<p>But Belgrade was furious last year when Turkey sold drones to Kosovo, something Serbia said was "unacceptable".</p>

<p>The row could however still be patched up, Vuksanovic insisted.</p>

<p>"I would not be surprised if we see a military deal at the end of this visit," he said.</p>

<p>He expected talks in Belgrade on Friday to focus on "military cooperation, the position of Turkish companies -- and attempts by Belgrade to persuade Ankara to tone down support for Kosovo".</p>

<p>While the rapprochement is relatively new, economic ties between the two countries are already significant.</p>

<p>Turkish investment in Serbia has rocketed from $1 million to $400 million over the past decade, the Turkey-Serbia business council told Turkey's Anadolu news agency.</p>

<p>Turkish exports to Serbia hit $2.13 billion in 2022, up from $1.14 billion in 2020, according to official Serbian figures.</p>

<p>Turkish tourists are also important for Serbia, second only to visitor numbers from Bosnia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vowing to introduce a reciprocal tax if elected to power, former US president Donald Trump on Thursday alleged that India, among all major countries, imposes the highest tariffs on foreign products.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most important element of my plan to make America extraordinarily wealthy again&nbsp;is reciprocity. It's a word that's very important in my plan because we generally don't charge tariffs. I started that process, it was so great, with the vans and the small trucks, etc. We really don't charge. China will charge us a 200 per cent tariff. Brazil is a big charger. The biggest charger of all is India,” Trump said in a major economic policy speech in Detroit.</p>

<p>“India is a very big charger. We have a great relationship with India. I did. And especially the leader, Modi. He's a great leader. Great man. Really is a great man. He's brought it together. He's done a great job. But they probably charge as much,” he said.</p>

<p>“I mean, I think they probably charge more than, in many ways, China. But they do it with a smile. They do it... Sort of a nicer charge. They said, thank you so much for purchasing from India. Harley Davidson came to the White House a long time ago during my third year or second year. I met with them. They were based in Wisconsin. I said, how's business? Good, good. What are the bad countries? Well, India is very tough. And they gave me some others. Why? Tariffs. I said, what are they? And they said like 150 per cent, some massive amount,” Trump told the members of the Detroit Economic Club.</p>

<p>“I said so do you sell many motorcycles because you think people want to buy a Harley. No, we sell very few in India, but they want us to go there. They said, if you go there and build your plant there, we're not going to charge you anything. I mean, you can do whatever you want. I said I don't like that. And I see they went, they built the plant, and now they do their business with India. They probably do it outside of India too. They built a very big plant in many countries, they do that. Then all of a sudden, you hear that they're leaving Milwaukee or they're leaving wherever they may be located,” he said.</p>

<p>Thursday's remarks by Trump come following his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-praises-pm-modi-says-hes-the-nicest-6754565">praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> earlier this week.</p>

<p>Trump described Modi as “the nicest human being”, saying the Indian leader is “a friend of mine”.</p>

<p>“Modi, India. He's a friend of mine. He's great. Before him, they were replacing them every year. It's very unstable. He came over. He's a friend of mine. But on the outside, he looks like he's your father. He's the nicest, but he's a total killer,” he said.</p>

<p>Trump recalled Modi's visit to Houston in 2019 to attend the ‘Howdy Modi' event during his tenure and said: “It was beautiful. It's like 80,000 people going crazy. We were walking around.” The Republican candidate said he shared a “very good relationship” with Modi.</p>

<p>Recalling that there were a couple of occasions where somebody was threatening India, Trump said: "I told Modi, let me help as I am very good with those people. To which he aggressively responded, ‘I will do it. I will do it. And I would do anything necessary. We have defeated them for hundreds of years.' I said 'Whoa, what just happened there',” he added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The winner of the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Oslo. Here is a look at how the award works:</p>

<p><strong>Who can win?</strong></p>

<p>According to the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, the prize should go to the person "who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses".</p>

<p>Thousands of people can propose names: members of governments and parliaments; current heads of state; university professors of history, social sciences, law and philosophy; and former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.</p>

<p>This year there are 286 nominees, although the full list will be locked in a vault for 50 years.</p>

<p>Among the oddsmakers' favourites this year is late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, who died in detention in February. But that is not possible as he cannot receive the prize posthumously.</p>

<p>Another favourite at the bookmakers is Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but he is also unlikely because he is a wartime leader.</p>

<p><strong>Who decides?</strong></p>

<p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which consists of five individuals appointed by the Norwegian parliament, is the arbiter. Members are often retired politicians, but not always. The current committee is led by the head of the Norwegian branch of PEN International, a group defending freedom of expression.</p>

<p>They are all put forward by Norwegian political parties and their appointments reflect the balance of power in Norway's parliament.</p>

<p><strong>How do they decide?</strong></p>

<p>Nominations close on Jan. 31. Members of the committee can make their own nominations no later than at the first meeting of the committee in February.</p>

<p>They discuss all the nominations, then establish a shortlist. Each nominee is then assessed and examined by a group of permanent advisers and other experts.</p>

<p>The committee meets roughly once a month to discuss the nominations. They usually make their decision at the final committee meeting, which tends to be at the beginning of October.</p>

<p>The committee seeks a consensus on its selection. If it cannot, the decision is reached by majority vote.</p>

<p>The last time a member quit in protest was in 1994, when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the prize with Israel's Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin.</p>

<p><strong>Who is nominated?</strong></p>

<p>While the full list of nominations is kept secret, nominators are free to disclose them.</p>

<p>Among the names that have been disclosed this year are the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, Pope Francis and British naturalist David Attenborough.</p>

<p>Experts who follow the award say this year's prize may highlight the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), the International Court of Justice and U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.</p>

<p><strong>What does the laureate get?</strong></p>

<p>A medal, a diploma, 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million) and immediate global attention.</p>

<p>South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 winner, said becoming a Nobel laureate was a double-edged sword. "One day no one was listening. The next, I was an oracle," he is quoted as saying in his authorised biography.</p>

<p><strong>When are the announcement and the ceremony?</strong></p>

<p>The announcement will be made at 1100 CET (0900 GMT) on Friday, Oct. 11 at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo by the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Joergen Watne Frydnes.</p>

<p>The ceremony will take place at the Oslo City Hall on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Barack Obama lashed out at "crazy" Donald Trump Thursday and urged voters to back Kamala Harris as he brought his star power to the 2024 election campaign trail for the first time.</p>

<p>As he hit the stump in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, Obama also chided Black male voters for hesitancy in supporting Democrat Harris because they "just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president."</p>

<p>Obama trained his fire on Trump during a pumped-up rally in Pittsburgh, comparing the Republican's long speeches to late Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro's and calling the billionaire out of touch with ordinary people.</p>

<p>America's first Black president admitted that "this election's going to be tight" as many voters were still struggling with high prices.</p>

<p>But he told the crowd that "what I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up", adding: "You think Donald Trump ever changed a diaper?'</p>

<p>The popular Democrat called Trump's schemes to sell bibles as "crazy" and used the same word to describe the 78-year-old former president's embrace of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>As the crowd booed Trump, his successor in the White House, Obama added: "Don't boo -- vote."</p>

<p>"Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Got a problem'</strong></p>

<p>Vice president Harris's campaign said Obama's appearance, the first in a series in battleground states before the November 5 election, was designed to get people out to vote in crucial Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Obama took aim at male voters who might be attracted by the Republican's appeals towards machismo.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry gentlemen, I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down, is a sign of strength," he said.</p>

<p>"And I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is."</p>

<p>Earlier, in a surprise stop before the rally at a campaign field office in Pittsburgh, Obama made an unusually direct appeal to Black men, whose support polls show Harris has struggled to mobilize.</p>

<p>Saying he had some "truths" that he wanted the Black community to hear, Obama said that "you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that."</p>

<p>"Because part of it makes me think -- and I'm speaking to men directly -- part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”</p>

<p>Harris was in battleground Nevada for a town hall hosted by the Spanish language network Univision Thursday before heading to Arizona for a rally to reach out to Latino voters.</p>

<p>When a woman asked Harris at the town hall to name three of Trump's virtues, she replied: "I think Donald Trump loves his family, and I think that's very important.... But I don't really know him, to be honest with you. I don't have much more to offer you."</p>

<p>The White House said Harris had also taken part in a virtual briefing on deadly Hurricane Milton hitting Florida, which has sparked a political storm between Republicans and Democrats.</p>

<p><strong>'Dumber than hell'</strong></p>

<p>Trump was in the hotly contested state of Michigan on Thursday, unveiling new details of his protectionist plans for the US auto industry, including sweeping tariffs on vehicles not made in America.</p>

<p>Trump also ramped up his personal attacks on Harris, branding her "dumber than hell," and assailed the auto industry capital Detroit itself as run down as he was speaking to the city's economic club.</p>

<p>"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president," he said.</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile said she had accepted an offer for a CNN town hall on October 23 in Pennsylvania, after Trump turned down a final televised debate with her.</p>

<p>Democrats are hoping Obama could give Harris a boost in a race that has been locked with Trump for weeks, after her initial boost in the polls after she took over from President Joe Biden as the party's nominee in July.</p>

<p>Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama delivered rapturously received speeches backing Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

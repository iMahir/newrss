       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The upcoming Quad Summit in Delaware will show that the four-nation grouping is more strategically aligned and relevant than ever before, the White House has said.</p>

<p>QUAD, comprising Australia, Japan, India and the US, is an initiative of President Joe Biden. In the first 100 days of his presidency, Biden convened a virtual leadership summit of the QUAD countries in 2020.</p>

<p>Since then QUAD leaders have been holding an annual summit on a rotation basis.</p>

<p>"We believe you'll see... that the Quad is more strategically aligned and more relevant than ever before," John Kirby, White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Director told reporters at a news conference here on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Kriby's comments came ahead of President Biden's hosting of the other three QUAD leaders from Australia, India, and Japan in Wilmington, Delaware on Saturday.</p>

<p>It was India's turn to host the Quad Summit. But following a request from Washington, India agreed to host the Summit next year.</p>

<p>Biden will host the fourth ‘Quad Leaders Summit' in Wilmington, Delaware, on September 21.</p>

<p>Kirby said the current Quad Summit will be the first time that the US has hosted foreign leaders in Wilmington, the president's hometown.</p>

<p>"And he's very excited about that, about showing them a place and a community that shapes so much of the public servant and the leader that he became. It's also a reflection of his belief that like politics, foreign policy is also personal," he said.</p>

<p>Kirby said Biden will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese individually, and later in a plenary.</p>

<p>Kirby said over the last more than three years, Biden has made it a priority to invest in rebuilding America's network of alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>"So think about AUKUS, for instance, or the trilateral Camp David summit with Japan and South Korea or the first ever US-Japan-Philippines Leaders' Summit in April," he said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi will pay a three-day visit to the US beginning September 21 to attend the annual Quad Summit and address the ‘Summit of the Future' at the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>He will also address a gathering of the Indian community in New York on September 22 during his three-day visit.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since Hezbollah has reduced the use of mobile phones by its forces because Israel can easily detect and target them, pagers have increasingly become the preferred messaging device within the group.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The alleged Israeli attack on members of Hezbollah via their pagers is another ominous development propelling the Middle East towards a full-scale regional war. It leaves Hezbollah with little option but to retaliate with the full support of the Iran-led “axis of resistance”. The sophistication and impact of targeting the pagers is unprecedented. The attack resulted in at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html">11 deaths</a>, including some of Hezbollah's fighters, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/hundreds-of-hezbollah-members-hurt-in-lebanon-after-pagers-explode">up to 3,000 people</a> wounded.</p>

<p>The main aim of the attack, which US officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html">have reportedly said</a> was carried out by Israel, was intended to disrupt Hezbollah's means of communication and its command and control system in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Since Hezbollah has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/">reduced the use of mobile phones</a> by its forces because Israel can easily detect and target them, pagers have increasingly become the preferred messaging device within the group.</p>

<p>The attack may have also been designed to cause panic within the group and among the Lebanese public, many of whom <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/support-hezbollah-growing-lebanon">do not support Hezbollah</a>, given the political divisions in the country.</p>

<p>Since Hamas' October 7 attacks on southern Israel, the Israeli leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said it is <a href="https://www.afr.com/world/middle-east/israel-approves-battle-plans-for-hezbollah-edging-closer-to-war-20240619-p5jn3v">determined</a> to remove the threat of Hezbollah, which has operated in solidarity with Hamas.</p>

<p>Hours before the pager attack, Netanyahu's government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/israel-war-goals-netanyahu-hamas-gaza-palestine">clarified</a> that Israel's war goals would expand to include a return of the tens of thousands of residents to their homes in northern Israel, which they have fled due to constant rocket fire from Hezbollah. Israel's defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said the only way to do this was through military action.</p>

<p>The simultaneous pager explosions on Tuesday, then, may be a prelude to an all-out Israeli offensive against Hezbollah.</p>

<h2><strong>The consequences of war with Hezbollah</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah has already declared it will retaliate. What form this will take remains to be seen. The group has a massive military capability to not only pound northern Israel with drones and missiles but also attack other parts of the Jewish state, including heavily populated cities such as Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Hezbollah showed this capability in its 2006 war with Israel. The war lasted 34 days, during which <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-to-air-new-footage-on-raid-that-sparked-2006-lebanon-war/">165 Israelis were killed</a> (121 IDF soldiers and 44 civilians) and Israel's economy and tourist industry were markedly damaged. Hezbollah and Lebanese losses were far greater, with at least 1,100 deaths. However, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/opinion/15iht-edsaikal.2491556.html">failed to destroy or incapacitate</a> the group.</p>

<p>Any successful retaliatory attack on Israel's cities could result in serious civilian casualties, giving Israel a further pretext to pursue its long-held aim of destroying Hezbollah and punishing its main backer, the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

<p>In a wider conflict, the United States is committed to defending Israel, while Iran would support Hezbollah in whatever way necessary. If Israeli and US leaders think Iran will continue to refrain from any action that could propel it into war with Israel and the US, they are mistaken.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is a central piece in the regime's national and regional security paradigm. Tehran has invested heavily in the group, along with other regional affiliates – Iraqi militias, the Yemeni Houthis and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, in particular. The aim of this “axis of resistance” has been to build a strong deterrent against Israel and the US.</p>

<p>Ever since its foundation 45 years ago, the Iranian regime has viewed Israel and its main backer, the US, as an existential threat, just as Israel has regarded Iran in the same way. For this, the regime has reoriented its foreign relations towards America's major adversaries, especially Russia and China. <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/02/united-against-america-russia-iran-military-cooperation-is-a-looming-threat?lang=en">Russo-Iranian military cooperation</a> has grown so strong, in fact, that Moscow will have little hesitation in backing Iran and its affiliates in any war.</p>

<p>Tehran is fully cognisant of Israel's nuclear prowess. To guard against it, Iran has developed its own nuclear program to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/iran-president-nuclear-bomb.html">threshold level</a> of developing a weapon. Iranian leaders may have also gained Russia's assurances it would help defend Iran should Israel resort to the use of its nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is important to remember that after nearly a year of demolishing Gaza and devastating its inhabitants, Israel has not been able to wipe out Hamas.</p>

<p>Its own actions speak to this. It has constantly forced Gazans to relocate so IDF soldiers can operate in areas they had previously declared to be cleared of fighters.</p>

<p>The task of defeating Hezbollah and its backers would be a far greater objective to achieve. It carries the serious risk of a war that all parties have been saying that they do not want, yet all are preparing for.</p>

<p>The pager attack is just the latest in a string of operations that keeps imperilling any chances of a permanent Gaza ceasefire that could stabilise the region and contribute to the causes of peace rather than war.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Meta has announced third-party augmented reality (AR) filters will no longer be available on its apps as of January 2025. This means more than two million user-made filters offered across WhatsApp, Facebook and, most notably, Instagram will disappear]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Meta <a href="https://spark.meta.com/blog/meta-spark-announcement">has announced</a> third-party augmented reality (AR) filters will no longer be available on its apps as of January 2025. This means more than <a href="https://spark.meta.com/blog/introducing-spark-ar-creator-awards">two million</a> user-made filters offered across WhatsApp, Facebook and, most notably, Instagram will disappear.</p>

<p>Filters have become a mainstay feature on Instagram. The most viral of these – which often involve beautifying the user's appearance – are created by users themselves via the <a href="https://spark.meta.com/">Meta Spark Studio</a>.</p>

<p>But the use of beautifying AR filters has long been connected to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01296612.2021.2013065">worsened mental health and body image problems</a> in young women.</p>

<p>In theory, the removal of the vast majority of Instagram filters should signal a turning point for unrealistic beauty standards. However, the removal comes far too late, and the move is more likely to instead push filter use underground.</p>

<p>Much like the newly announced <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-teen-accounts-on-instagram-are-a-welcome-step-but-real-peace-of-mind-requires-more-239290">teen accounts</a> for Instagram, retracting and altering technologies years after the use has been encouraged offers little more than a band-aid approach.</p>

<h2>Filters are popular – so why remove them?</h2>

<p>Meta rarely volunteers information about technologies and business practises beyond what is absolutely necessary. This case is no different. Meta has previously demonstrated it is unmotivated by user harm, even when its own leaked <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">internal research indicates</a> the use of Instagram and filters contributes to worse mental health for young women.</p>

<p>So, why wait until now to remove a popular (but controversial) technology?</p>

<p>Officially, <a href="https://spark.meta.com/learn/FAQ/Meta-spark-update/">Meta states</a> it intends to “prioritise investments in other company priorities”.</p>

<p>Most likely, AR filters are yet another casualty of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In April, Meta pledged to invest between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/technology/meta-profit-stock-ai.html">US$35–40 billion</a> in the technology, and is pulling AR technology in-house.</p>

<p>Filters will not be going away altogether on Instagram. First-party filters created by Meta will continue to be available. The offering of filters available on Instagram's official account (140 at present) is insignificant compared to the library of millions of filters created by third-parties.</p>

<p>Instagram's official filters also offer less diverse types of AR experiences, and its account does not feature any beautifying filters.</p>

<h2>The end of beauty filters? Not quite</h2>

<p>Meta removed filters once before in 2019, though the <a href="https://www.mic.com/impact/instagram-plastic-surgery-filters-will-be-removed-says-spark-ar-statement-19255566">ban</a> only applied to “surgery” filters and was reversed at <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/29/mark_zuckerberg_filters_teens/">Mark Zuckerburg's request</a> after a fleeting implementation.</p>

<p>Informally named for their ability to mimic the effects of cosmetic surgery, surgery filters are the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/1472586X.2024.2341296">most popular type</a> of Instagram filter.</p>

<p>They are also the most controversial, with users seeking surgery and “<a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JSM-12-2020-0506/full/html">tweakments</a>” to mimic their filtered image. In my research, I found when analysing the design of the beautifying Instagram filters, 87% of the filters sampled shrank the user's nose and 90% made the user's lips larger.</p>

<p>The removal of third party filters will see these types of sophisticated and realistic beautifying filters gone from Meta platforms.</p>

<p>However, this is hardly cause for celebration. When <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2022.2129414">analysing the media coverage</a> of the first filter ban, we found users were upset with surgery filters being removed and intended to find ways to access them regardless.</p>

<p>Now, after having access to AR filters on Instagram for seven years, users are even more habituated to their presence. They also have many more alternatives to access a version of the technology inside another app. This is of concern for a few reasons.</p>

<h2>Watermarking and photo literacy</h2>

<p>When posting with a filter on Instagram, a watermark that links to the filter and its creator appears on the image.</p>

<p>This watermark is important to assist users in determining whether someone's appearance is altered or not. Some users get around the watermarking by downloading their filtered photo, and re-uploading it so their filtered appearance is more difficult to detect.</p>

<p>By removing popular beauty filters from Instagram, this “covert” practice will become the default way for users to post with these filters on the platform.</p>

<p>Forcing users into covert filter use adds another thorn to the already prickly case of visual literacy.</p>

<p>Young women and girls feel inadequate compared to edited and filtered images online (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305120965155">including their own</a>).</p>

<p>Some newer TikTok filters, such as the viral “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/13/1069649/hyper-realistic-beauty-filters-bold-glamour/">Bold Glamour</a>” filter, use AI technology (AI-AR) which merges the user's face with the beauty filter, trained on a database of “ideal” images.</p>

<p>By contrast, standard AR filters overlay a set design (akin to a mask) and contort the user's features to match. The result of these new AI-AR filters is a hyper-realistic, and yet totally unachievable beauty standard.</p>

<p>The removal of beauty filters on Instagram will not stop their use. Instead, it will drive users to other platforms to access filters. Like Bold Glamour, these filters will be more sophisticated and harder to detect when they are re-posted cross platform, without the benefit of having the watermark indicator.</p>

<p>Only 34% of Australian adults feel confident in their <a href="https://apo.org.au/node/327239">media literacy skills</a>. Those with less developed digital <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1051144X.2021.1902041">visual literacies</a> increasingly find it difficult to ascertain the difference between edited and unedited images. Add to this the rapid increase in generative AI images, and we are entering <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1051144X.2022.2053819">unprecedented territory</a>.</p>

<p>While the removal of beautifying filters at a more pivotal time may have been meaningful, the genie is out of the bottle. By Instagram removing its already hugely popular beautifying filters now (and the watermarking that goes along with it), the problems associated with filter use on Instagram will not go away, but simply become harder to manage.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Within ten minutes of receiving the vaccines, Alexis Lorenze experienced symptoms, including temporary blindness, a locked jaw and vomiting.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 23-year-old Florida woman is facing a critical health crisis after a severe reaction to vaccines administered at UCI Medical Centre in Orange, California. Alexis Lorenze, who was diagnosed with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (<a href="https://givebutter.com/savealexis ">PNH</a>) in January, is currently fighting for her life.</p>

<p>According to reports from the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation (VSRF), Ms Lorenze received Tetanus, Pneumococcal, and Meningitis vaccines at the UCI Medical Centre as a condition for further care for her PNH. Within ten minutes of receiving the vaccines, her condition rapidly deteriorated. She experienced a series of alarming symptoms, including temporary blindness, a locked jaw and vomiting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Alexis Lorenze does not have health insurance in California. Now, she is being transferred to a private hospital in Los Angeles for specialised care, said a fundraiser raising money for her treatment.<br />
<br />
In response to the 23-year-old's deteriorating condition, VSRF has sent Registered Nurse Angela Wulbrecht and a team of trusted doctors to assist with her care.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Alexis Lorenze has been using the social media platform TikTok to detail her medical journey. Disturbing images and videos shared by Ms Lorenze reveal the severity of her alleged vaccine reaction. The visuals show her with swollen eyes and forehead, severe black-purplish bruising covering her face and body and red, inflamed skin.</p>

<p><br />
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="250" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3Dpfbid02E431Zu5U1ZNkkYVDayvAwGdUxsHpywKTpjwcgmmivBexQZSXoLi3SX2TFEjBHANUl%26id%3D100009204650503&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe><br />
<br />
According to Ms Lorenze, she first sought treatment at the hospital for a blood disorder and underwent a blood transfusion. While the transfusion provided some relief, she alleges it did not fully resolve her symptoms. While the transfusion initially showed promise, doctors allegedly advised her to update her vaccinations for the treatment to be fully effective.<br />
<br />
After receiving the vaccines, she claimed she experienced severe reactions. The family alleges that the hospital's actions led to the sudden deterioration of Ms Lorenze's health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The transfer of munitions to support Ukraine's defence against Russia has occurred for more than a year, according to the sources and the customs data. Indian arms export regulations limit the use of weaponry to the declared purchaser, who risks future sales being terminated if unauthorised transfers occur.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has raised the issue on at least two occasions, including during a July meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Indian counterpart, three Indian officials said.</p>

<p>Details of the ammunition transfers are reported by Reuters for the first time.</p>

<p>The foreign and defence ministries of Russia and India did not respond to questions. In January, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a news conference that India had not sent or sold artillery shells to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Two Indian government and two defence industry sources told Reuters that Delhi produced only a very small amount of the ammunition being used by Ukraine, with one official estimating that it was under 1% of the total arms imported by Kyiv since the war. The news agency couldn't determine if the munitions were resold or donated to Kyiv by the European customers.</p>

<p>Among the European countries sending Indian munitions to Ukraine are Italy and the Czech Republic, which is leading an initiative to supply Kyiv with artillery shells from outside the European Union, according to a Spanish and a senior Indian official, as well as a former top executive at Yantra India, a state-owned company whose munitions are being used by Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Indian official said that Delhi was monitoring the situation. But, along with a defence industry executive with direct knowledge of the transfers, he said India had not taken any action to throttle the supply to Europe. Like most of the 20 people interviewed by Reuters, they spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian, Italian, Spanish and Czech defence ministries did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Delhi and Washington, Ukraine's main security backer, have recently strengthened defence and diplomatic cooperation against the backdrop of a rising China, which both regard as their main rival.</p>

<p>India also has warm ties with Russia, its primary arms supplier for decades, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refused to join the Western-led sanctions regime against Moscow.</p>

<p>But Delhi, long the world's largest weapons importer, also sees the lengthy war in Europe as an opportunity to develop its nascent arms export sector, according to six Indian sources familiar with official thinking.</p>

<p>Ukraine, which is battling to contain a Russian offensive toward the eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk, has a dire shortage of artillery ammunition.</p>

<p>The White House declined to comment and the U.S. State Department referred questions on Delhi's arms exports to the Indian government.</p>

<p>India exported just over $3 billion of arms between 2018 and 2023, according to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute think-tank.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said at an Aug. 30 conference that defence exports surpassed $2.5 billion in the last fiscal year and that Delhi wanted to increase that to about $6 billion by 2029.</p>

<p>Commercially available customs records show that in the two years before the February 2022 invasion, three major Indian ammunition makers - Yantra, Munitions India and Kalyani Strategic Systems - exported just $2.8 million in munitions components to Italy and the Czech Republic, as well as Spain and Slovenia, where defence contractors have invested heavily in supply chains for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Between February 2022 and July 2024, the figure had increased to $135.25 million, the data show, including completed munitions, which India began exporting to the four nations.</p>

<p>Arzan Tarapore, an India defence expert at Stanford University, said that Delhi's push to expand its arms exports was a major factor in the transfer of its arms to Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Probably in the sudden recent expansion, some instances of end-user violations have occurred."</p>

<p><strong>Discreet Deliveries</strong></p>

<p>Unlisted Italian defence contractor Meccanica per l'Elettronica e Servomeccanismi (MES) was among the companies sending Indian-made shells to Ukraine, said the former top Yantra official.</p>

<p>MES is Yantra's biggest foreign client. The executive said the Rome-based company buys empty shells from India and fills them with explosives.</p>

<p>Several Western firms had explosive filling capabilities but lack the manufacturing capacity to mass produce artillery shells, the executive said.</p>

<p>Yantra said in its 2022-23 annual report that it had agreed a deal with an unnamed Italian client to set up a manufacturing line for L15A1 shells, which the former Yantra executive identified as MES.</p>

<p>MES and Yantra India did not respond to emails seeking comment.</p>

<p>Customs data indicate that Yantra shipped $35 million worth of empty 155mm L15A1 shells to MES between February 2022 and July 2024.</p>

<p>Customs records also show that in February 2024, U.K.-based arms company Dince Hill - whose board includes a top MES executive - exported $6.7 million in ammunition from Italy to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Among the exports were 155mm L15A1 shells, which the customs declaration said were manufactured by MES for Ukraine's Defence Ministry and supplied for "promoting the defense capability and mobilization readiness of Ukraine."</p>

<p>Dince Hill did not respond to an email seeking comment. Its new owner, Rome-based Effequattro Consulting, could not be reached.</p>

<p>In another instance, Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente shared on social media in May an end user agreement signed by a Czech defence official that authorised the transfer of 120mm and 125mm ammunition shells from Munitions India to arms dealer Czech Defence Systems.</p>

<p>Pro-Palestinian activists had alleged that the Borkum, a vessel carrying Indian-made arms which had stopped in a Spanish port, was carrying the weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported in May the final destination was actually Ukraine. A Spanish official and another source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that Kyiv was the end user. Munitions India and CDS did not respond to questions.</p>

<p>Customs records dated March 27 show Munitions India had shipped 10,000 rounds of 120mm and 125mm mortar shells, worth more than $9 million, from Chennai to CDS.</p>

<p><strong>Friendly Fire</strong></p>

<p>Russia, which supplies more than 60% of Delhi's arms imports, is a valued partner for India. In July, PM Modi chose Moscow for his first bilateral international trip since being elected to a third term.</p>

<p>At another meeting that month in Kazakhstan between top Indian diplomat Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Lavrov, the Russian minister pressed his counterpart about Indian munitions being used by Ukrainians and complained that some were made by state-owned Indian companies, according to an Indian official with direct knowledge of the encounter.</p>

<p>The official did not share Jaishankar's response.</p>

<p>Walter Ladwig, a South Asia security expert at King's College London, said the diversion of a relatively small amount of ammunition was geopolitically useful for Delhi.</p>

<p>"It allows India to show partners in the West that it is not 'on Russia's side' in the Russia-Ukraine conflict," he said, adding that Moscow held little leverage over Delhi's decisions.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese firm Icom said Thursday that it had stopped producing the model of radios reportedly used in recent blasts in Lebanon around 10 years ago.</p>

<p>"The IC-V82 is a handheld radio that was produced and exported, including to the Middle East, from 2004 to October 2014. It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company," Icom said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The production of the batteries needed to operate the main unit has also been discontinued, and a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company," it said.</p>

<p>It added that products for overseas markets are sold exclusively through its authorized distributors, and that its export programme is based on Japanese security trade control regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of our radios are manufactured at our production subsidiary, Wakayama Icom Inc., in Wakayama Prefecture, under a strict management system... so no parts other than those specified by our company are used in a product. In addition, all of our radios are manufactured at the same factory, and we do not manufacture them overseas," the statement said.</p>

<p>In the second wave of device explosions in as many days, 20 people died and more than 450 were wounded on Wednesday in Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, officials said.</p>

<p>A source close to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-israel-war-soon-32-killed-as-walkie-talkies-pagers-explode-across-lebanon-6598300#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Hezbollah said walkie-talkies used by its members blew up</a> in its Beirut stronghold, with state media reporting similar blasts in south and east Lebanon.</p>

<p>They came a day after the simultaneous explosion of hundreds of paging devices used by Hezbollah killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded up to 2,800 others across Lebanon, in an unprecedented attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>There was no comment from Israel. The White House warned all sides against "an escalation of any kind".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK man accidentally fatally stabbed himself while trying to separate two frozen burgers with a knife, in a freak accident that initially puzzled police, a court heard. Barry Griffiths, 57, died after accidentally plunging the blade into his abdomen at his home in Powys, Wales, in July last year, according to the report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/24591665.powys-man-stabbed-death-separating-frozen-burgers/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Western Telegraph</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Griffiths, who lived alone and was described as "very private", had been dead for several days before a welfare check led police to discover his body, with blood splattered throughout his kitchen and bedroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His phone, wallet, and computer were left untouched, and there were no signs of a struggle in his apartment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police found Mr Griffiths fully clothed on his bed with no evidence of an assault. It was only after discovering uncooked burger patties that detectives pieced together what had occurred, the court was told.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The bottom drawer of the freezer had been left open and pulled forward in a position to access food items," Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Rees said.</p>

<p>"On the work surface in the kitchen adjacent to the fridge freezer were two uncooked burgers, a knife and a tea towel," he continued.</p>

<p>"The wound to the abdomen would have been approximately the height of the work surface. My hypothesis at that stage was that Mr Griffiths was attempting to separate frozen burgers using a knife."</p>

<p>A medical examiner concluded that Mr Griffiths- who had limited use of one arm due to a stroke- most likely died from an accident injury rather than suicide.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The attack targeted Hezbollah operatives by planting explosive devices inside hand-held pagers and walkie-talkies. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">At least 32 people were killed and more than 3,250 injured as walkie-talkies and pagers used by Hezbollah members blew up across Lebanon in the last two days. Walkie-talkies used by Iran-backed Hezbollah members blew up in its Beirut stronghold on Wednesday, killing at least 20 people and injuring more than 450 others. The explosions came a day after thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, killing 12 people, including two children, and injuring about 2,800.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The mass <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israels-unit-8200-in-spotlight-after-hezbollah-pager-attacks-in-lebanon-6596001 ">pager and walkie-talkie attack</a> against Hezbollah in Lebanon has now drawn attention to Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence arm, allegedly involved in planning the operation.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a Western security source, Unit 8200 played a role in the development stage of the operation, which was over a year in the making. The source revealed that the unit was responsible for testing how to insert explosive material within the manufacturing process.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Unit 8200: Israel's Elite Intelligence Unit</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Unit 8200 is a highly specialised military group that develops and operates intelligence-gathering tools, comparable to the US National Security Agency. The unit's activities range from cyber defence to “technological attacks and strikes.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unit 8200 develops and operates advanced surveillance tools and cyber defence systems and is credited with high-profile operations. It played a key role in the Stuxnet virus attack from 2005 to 2010, which damaged Iranian nuclear centrifuges. In 2017, it was allegedly behind a cyberattack on Lebanon's state telecom company, Ogero, disrupting communications. The unit also contributed to thwarting an ISIS plot in 2018, helping to prevent a planned attack on a civilian airliner travelling from Australia to the UAE.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Former military intelligence official Yossi Kuperwasser praised Unit 8200's expertise, saying its members are “the best and brightest personnel in the Israeli military,” as per Reuters.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unit 8200 is also a crucial feeder into Israel's booming tech industry, with many of its alumni going on to found successful cybersecurity and tech companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Avi Shua, a graduate of Unit 8200 iand co-founder of the unicorn Orca Security, praised the group's work culture, which promotes innovative problem-solving and independent thinking.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the unit has recently come under scrutiny for its inability to predict Hamas' attack on southern Israel in October. This failure led to the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chief-of-israels-elite-intelligence-group-unit-8200-quits-heres-why-6553802 ">resignation of its commander</a>, who admitted he had not fulfilled his mission.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite the recent Hezbollah bomb allegations, Israeli military officials have remained silent. Neither the IDF nor the Prime Minister's office, which oversees Mossad, has confirmed the involvement of Unit 8200.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 32 people and injuring thousands more.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/walkie-talkies-explode-in-hezbollahs-beirut-stronghold-day-after-pager-blasts-6595278">pagers and walkie-talkies</a> used by Hezbollah members detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 32 people and injuring thousands more. This attack has sparked multiple theories about how these devices were sabotaged. While the exact <a href="http:// https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pagers-then-walkie-talkies-how-devices-were-weaponised-against-hezbollah-6596167">mechanism behind the explosions</a> is still being investigated, a few theories have emerged.</p>

<p>Much of the debate centres around the idea that the pagers were tampered with, causing their batteries to overheat and explode. According to Lebanese Telecommunications Minister Johnny Corm, this overheating indicated "foul play". However, cybersecurity expert Robert Graham quickly dismissed this theory, arguing that making batteries do more than burn is implausible. Instead, he suggested the far more likely explanation that someone bribed the factories involved to insert explosives into the devices, Bloomberg reported.</p>

<h2><strong>What happened?</strong></h2>

<p>The first wave of explosions occurred on Tuesday when pagers used by the Iran-backed terror group detonated across Lebanon. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with casualties, leading to the establishment of a field hospital in Tyre. These explosions came shortly after Israel announced a strategic expansion in its military actions against Hezbollah. On Wednesday, a second wave of explosions involving Hezbollah walkie-talkies caused further chaos.</p>

<h2><strong>Theory 1: Explosives planted in devices</strong></h2>

<p>According to Lebanese security sources and reports by Reuters, a new batch of 5,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah from Taiwan-based manufacturer Gold Apollo had been compromised. Israeli spy intelligence agency Mossad is suspected of embedding small explosive devices within these devices. The explosives, reportedly as small as 3 grams, were hidden in such a way that they went undetected by Hezbollah for months. The detonation mechanism is believed to be activated remotely via a coded message sent to the pagers. These explosives, experts say, were impossible to detect through regular scanners.</p>

<p>The attack on the walkie-talkies, believed to have been purchased around the same time, has been linked to a similar sabotage operation. These devices, labelled as ICOM and reportedly made in Japan, are thought to have been tampered with at the production level, possibly by Mossad. The walkie-talkie explosions are less well-documented, but it is suggested that the same coded message method could have been used to activate the embedded explosives.</p>

<h2><strong>Theory 2: Supply chain compromised</strong></h2>

<p>Another theory is the tampering of the supply chain. Security experts suggest that Israeli intelligence may have gained access to the devices long before they reached Hezbollah. The pagers were identified as Gold Apollo AR-924 models, but further investigation revealed they were manufactured by BAC Consulting in Hungary, a company with licensing rights to use the Gold Apollo brand. This raises the possibility that the sabotage took place during the manufacturing or distribution stages, providing Israel an opportunity to install explosive materials without detection.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has since stated that the devices were part of a shipment recently imported, implying the tampering occurred before the pagers arrived in Lebanon.</p>

<h2><strong>Theory 3: Remote activation via message</strong></h2>

<p>Another central theory is that the pagers and walkie-talkies were remotely detonated using an electronic signal or radio frequency, rather than physical tampering. Mark Montgomery, a retired admiral and executive director of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, suggested that the explosions may have been triggered by a radio frequency or electronic signal. "I suspect it was an intentional physical defect enabled by cyber or a radio frequency signal," he told Bloomberg.</p>

<p>The detonation appears to have been triggered by a coded message, according to a report from the New York Times. The pagers simultaneously received what appeared to be an internal communication from Hezbollah leadership, which, upon opening, activated the explosives hidden within the devices. Videos circulating on social media supposedly show individuals looking at their pagers moments before the explosions occurred.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is responsible?</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack and has vowed retaliation. The timing of the explosions, which followed Israel's announcement of extended military operations along the Lebanon border, has fuelled speculation that this was a deliberate move by Mossad. However, Israel has not commented on the matter officially. Further investigation is ongoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US court has summoned the Indian government after Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun filed a civil lawsuit, alleging a plot to murder him. The summons by the US District Court for Southern District of New York names Government of India, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, R&amp;AW agent Vikram Yadav, and Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta. The summons asks New Delhi and those named to file a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>The Centre is yet to respond to the summons. Pannu's X handle, on which he shared a copy of the summons, has been withheld.</p>

<p>In November, the UK newspaper Financial Times reported that the US had thwarted a plot to kill Pannun, who heads the radical outfit, Sikhs for Justice, and holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. Officials in the Joe Biden administration later confirmed this.</p>

<p>In its first response, the External Affairs Ministry said it is a "matter of concern" and stressed that India has launched a high-level probe.</p>

<p>"As regards the case against an individual that has been filed in a US court, allegedly linking him to an Indian official, this is a matter of concern. We have said that this is also contrary to government policy," then MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.</p>

<p>In May this year, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said India is investigating the matter, but stressed that it would not impact the "upward trajectory" of India-US ties.</p>

<p>"The United States brought to our attention certain information in good faith because we also believe some of it has implications for our own system," he said in an interview to news agency PTI.</p>

<p>"We are investigating it. But I do not think the fundamental course of the upward trajectory of India-US is impacted by this at all," he said.</p>

<p>US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti has told NDTV that this matter will not affect India-US ties.</p>

<p>Pannun is known to put out incendiary speeches and threats against Indian leaders and institutions. New Delhi designated him a terrorist in 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon has blamed Israel for the sabotage of thousands of pagers that caused them to explode, killing several people and wounding thousands, in an apparent bid to weaken the Islamist militant group Hezbollah. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack, which came after almost a year of cross-border rocket fire between the two sides in a second front to the war in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>United Nations, government and tech-industry officials were left scratching their heads over how the co-ordinated series of blasts had been carried out, though veterans of Israel's intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet have opened up about assassinations in the past - some of which required high levels of technical or operational ingenuity.</p>

<h3><strong>Deadly Phone Call</strong></h3>

<p>Shin Bet used a mobile phone secretly fitted with explosives to kill Yahya Ayyash, a master bombmaker from Hamas nicknamed "the Engineer," in Gaza in 1996. A Palestinian go-between gave Ayyash the phone to receive a call from his father. When Israeli eavesdroppers verified it was Ayyash's voice on the line, the phone was remotely detonated, causing a lethal head injury.</p>

<h3><strong>Neck Poison</strong></h3>

<p>In retaliation for a series of Hamas suicide bombings in 1997, then first-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the killing of the Palestinian Islamist group's politburo chief, Khaled Mashaal, in the Jordanian capital of Amman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two undercover Mossad officers sprayed poison onto Meshaal's nape as he left his car for an appointment, with one of them opening a pre-shaken can of Coca-Cola to provide an innocent explanation for the rogue liquid. The plan failed because Meshaal's daughter ran after him, prompting an aide to turn around and notice the would-be assassins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were captured by Jordanian police, and repatriated only after Israel provided an antidote to save Meshaal's life.</p>

<h3><strong>Fake Tourists</strong></h3>

<p>Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, an international arms procurer for Hamas, was found dead in his Dubai hotel room in 2010. Emirati authorities initially deemed it death by natural causes but re-opened the case after the Gaza-based Palestinian group accused Israel of killing him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subsequent investigation uncovered CCTV footage of a Mossad hit team, using cloned European passports and posing as tennis-playing tourists, businesspeople, or hotel staff, surveilling Mabhouh and converging on his hotel room. An autopsy determined that Mabhouh had been sedated and smothered.</p>

<h3><strong>Traffic Blasts</strong></h3>

<p>Between 2010 and 2020, about half a dozen Iranian nuclear scientists were killed or wounded in gun attacks or explosions that authorities blamed on Israel. Most of them were caused by magnetized bombs that had been attached to vehicles by passing motorcyclists, according to Iranian state media reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel hasn't confirmed it was behind any of the strikes, though its officials acknowledged being locked in a shadow war with Iran. A former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would later claim responsibility for a similar assassination in the Iranian capital in 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>Satellite Sniper</strong></h3>

<p>Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's chief nuclear scientist, was shot dead while driving in a convoy on the outskirts of Tehran in 2020. Some Iranian media reports said Israel used a satellite-controlled sniper rifle mounted on the back of a pick-up truck and equipped with AI face recognition. Israel didn't confirm the killing, though Netanyahu had previously identified Fakhrizadeh as head of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program, saying: "Remember his name."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bank said that these scams are highly effective, with millions of people potentially at risk.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK bank, Starling Bank, has issued a warning about a new wave of scams that use artificial intelligence to replicate people's voices. Fraudsters can create convincing voice clones from just a few seconds of audio, often found in online videos, the bank said in a press release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The online-only lender said that these scams are highly effective, with millions of people potentially at risk. The bank's survey found that over a quarter of respondents had been targeted by such scams in the past year, and many were unaware of the threat, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/tech/ai-voice-cloning-scam-warning/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>"People regularly post content online which has recordings of their voice, without ever imagining it's making them more vulnerable to fraudsters," Lisa Grahame, chief information security officer at Starling Bank, said in the press release.</p>

<p>According to the survey, 46% of respondents weren't aware that such scams existed, and that 8% would send over as much money as requested by a friend or family member, even if they thought the call seemed strange.</p>

<p>To protect themselves, people are advised to establish a "safe phrase" with their loved ones. This unique phrase can be used to verify identity during phone calls. The bank advised against sharing the safe phrase over text, which could make it easier for scammers to find out, but, if shared in this day, the message should be deleted once the other person has seen it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As AI technology continues to advance, concerns about its potential for misuse are growing. The creators of ChatGPT, and OpenAI, have even acknowledged the risks associated with voice replication tools.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to bring down the number of temporary residents in the country, Canada on Wednesday announced to further reduce the number of study permits it will grant to foreign students and also tightened its foreign worker rules, a move that will impact many Indians.</p>

<p>"We're granting 35% fewer international student permits this year. And next year, that number's going down by another 10%," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X.</p>

<p>"Immigration is an advantage for our economy - but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down," he added.</p>

<br />
Immigration is an advantage for our economy — but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down.</p>
— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1836505915568136239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to immigration department data, Canada approved 5,09,390 in 2023 and 1,75,920 in the first seven months of 2024 and the new move would reduce the number of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-canadas-2-year-cap-on-foreign-students-and-who-will-be-impacted-4969561" target="_blank">international study permits</a> issued to 4,37,000 in 2025.</p>

<p>The changes would also limit work permit eligibility for spouses of some students and temporary foreign workers.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as Trudeau's Liberal government, trailing in the public opinion polls ahead of the federal elections next year, seeks to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/watch-hundreds-of-indian-foreign-students-queue-up-for-a-job-at-tim-hortons-in-canada-5949995" target="_blank">reduce the number of temporary residents</a>, including international students and foreign workers.</p>

<p>In January, Canada had also placed a two-year cap on international students.</p>

<p>According to Statistics Canada, the biggest jump in immigration numbers comes from temporary residents, especially students and workers, whose ranks have doubled in just two years from 1.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 to 2.8 million in the second quarter of 2024.</p>

<p>Canada has already pledged to reduce the number of temporary residents to 5% of the total population, which was 6.8% in April.</p>

<p>Migrants have been blamed for societal problems including a lack of affordable housing and a ramped-up cost of living in Canada.</p>

<h3><strong>How Canada's New Rules Will Impact Indians</strong></h3>

<p>Canada is among the favourite destinations for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-students-in-canada-face-deportation-after-policy-change-6429289" target="_blank">Indian students</a>. According to the Indian government's data released last month, about 13.35 lakh Indian students are studying abroad, with about 4.27 lakh in&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/over-13-lakh-indian-students-studying-abroad-highest-enrolled-in-canada-government-6273737" target="_blank">Canada</a>.</p>

<p>Between 2013 and 2022, the number of Indian students moving to Canada to study has seen a massive rise of 260 per cent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a Reuters report earlier this year, about 40 per cent of overseas students in Canada were from India.</p>

<p>The Canadian government's move to cut international student permits will now make Indian students choose other options such as the US, UK, or Australia.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The decision follows Namibia's recent move to cull elephants and other wildlife to address food insecurity worsened by a prolonged drought.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Zimbabwe have given the go-ahead for the slaughtering of 200 elephants to feed hungry citizens left hungry by its worst drought in decades. Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/16/climate/zimbabwe-cull-elephants-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>that with nearly half of the country's population facing the risk of acute hunger, "we are targeting to cull 200 elephants."</p>

<p>The decision follows Namibia's recent move to cull elephants and other wildlife to address food insecurity worsened by a prolonged drought. These culls have faced criticism from animal rights advocates and conservationists.</p>

<p>According to Farawo, Zimbabwe's elephant population is over 84,000, nearly double its estimated capacity of 45,000. It is the second largest globally after Botswana.</p>

<p>Last week, Environment Minister Sithembiso Nyoni informed parliament that Zimbabwe has more elephants than needed and more than the forests can sustain. She noted that elephant overpopulation leads to resource shortages, intensifying human-wildlife conflict.</p>

<p>Nyoni added that the government is considering strategies similar to Namibia's, including counting the elephants and organizing communities, especially women, to preserve and distribute the meat to protein-deficient regions.</p>

<p>"When wildlife overpopulates a park, they venture beyond it in search of resources like water or vegetation. This brings them into contact with humans, sparking conflicts," Nyoni explained.</p>

<p>In Namibia, the government authorized the culling of 700 wild animals, including elephants, to distribute to people facing food shortages. So far, 150 animals have been culled, and over 125,000 pounds of meat distributed, according to Namibia's Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Tourism.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe and Namibia are among the southern African countries enduring a severe drought exacerbated by El Nino and climate change.</p>

<p>Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe's parks authority, stated that the culling will begin once the required documentation is finalized. The slaughter will target regions with dense elephant populations.</p>

<p>However, these proposed elephant culls have faced strong opposition.</p>

<p>Farai Maguwu, head of the Zimbabwe-based Center for Natural Resource Governance, condemned the practice on X, stating, "Culling of elephants must be stopped. Elephants have a right to exist," adding that future generations deserve to see elephants in their natural habitat.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Culling of elephants must be stopped. Some are eying an opportunity to sell ivory, illicitly - what with these private jets flying out week in, week out. With the way minerals are being looted, soon we wont have any elephant to talk about. Hands off our wildlife!</p>
— Farai Maguwu (@FMaguwu) <a href="https://twitter.com/FMaguwu/status/1835366038843589062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and natural resources consultant, also expressed concern that using wildlife to address food insecurity could lead to unsustainable demand for bushmeat.</p>

<p>Farawo defended the cull, Zimbabwe's first since 1988, as part of broader efforts to reduce human-elephant conflicts, following a string of fatal elephant attacks.</p>

<p>"The animals are causing significant problems in communities, killing people. Just last week, a woman in the northern part of the country was killed by an elephant. The same happened the week before. So, culling is also a method of control," he said.</p>

<p>Local media reported that at least 31 people have died in Zimbabwe this year due to conflicts between humans and wildlife.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former CIA officer was sentenced to 30 years in prison on Wednesday for drugging and sexually abusing more than two dozen women in several countries. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ex-cia-officer-admits-drugging-sexually-abusing-multiple-women-4561666">Brian Jeffrey Raymond</a>, 48, of La Mesa, California, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to one count of abusive sexual contact and other charges.</p>

<p>"When this predator was a government employee, he lured unsuspecting women to his government-leased housing and drugged them," Matthew Graves, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, said.</p>

<p>"After drugging these women, he stripped, sexually abused, and photographed them," Graves said in a statement.</p>

<p>Nicole Argentieri, a senior Justice Department official, said Raymond "sexually exploited dozens of women over the course of 14 years."</p>

<p>According to court documents, Raymond's last posting was in Mexico City, where he drugged and sexually assaulted several women.</p>

<p>The FBI, in an October 2021 appeal to the public for information, said the investigation into Raymond began on May 31, 2020, when a naked woman was seen screaming for help from the balcony of his residence in Mexico City.</p>

<p>It said hundreds of photographs and videos were recovered from Raymond's electronic devices depicting at least 24 unconscious and nude or partially nude women.</p>

<p>Raymond worked for many years at the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI said, had lived in numerous countries, including Peru, and was fluent in Spanish and Mandarin.</p>

<p>He worked at the US embassy in Mexico from August 2018 until May 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

At least one of Wednesday's blasts took place near a funeral organised by Hezbollah for those killed the previous day.</li>
	<li>The explosions came a day after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pagers-then-walkie-talkies-how-devices-were-weaponised-against-hezbollah-6596167" target="_blank">thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah</a> exploded across Lebanon, killing 12 people, including two children, and injuring about 2,800.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Hezbollah said Israel was "fully responsible for this criminal aggression" and vowed revenge. Israel has so far not officially said anything about the explosions.</li>
	<li>In Tuesday's explosions, sources said Israeli spies remotely detonated explosives they planted in a Hezbollah order of 5,000 pagers before they entered the country.</li>

	<li>Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said on Wednesday it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets. The Israeli military, however, said there were no reports of any damage or casualties.</li>
	<li>The US warned all sides against "escalation" in the Middle East after two days of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-warns-against-further-middle-east-escalation-after-lebanon-blasts-6596480" target="_blank">blasts in Lebanon</a>. "We still don't want to see an escalation of any kind. We don't believe that the way to solve where we're at in this crisis is by additional military operations at all," US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday.</li>
	<li>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned that the pager blasts targeting Hezbollah indicate "a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon and everything must be done to avoid that escalation."</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rap mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs will remain imprisoned pending trial on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, after a judge denied his appeal Wednesday.</p>

<p>Judge Andrew Carter upheld the previous day's ruling that the bail package proposed by his defense team -- which included a $50 million bond secured by his Miami home -- was insufficient given his history of violence and substance abuse, and the possibility of witness tampering.</p>

<p>"It did not go our way," Combs's lawyer Marc Agnifilo told journalists outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan following the ruling.</p>

<p>He vowed to keep pushing for Combs's release on bail and also said he would urge the trial to move forward "as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"Wherever he is, his resolve is the same. He believes he's innocent," Agnifilo said, adding that the prison conditions Combs is being held in are "inhumane."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 54-year-old Combs was indicted on three criminal counts that allege he sexually abused women and coerced them into drug-fueled sex parties using threats and violence.</p>

<p>Along with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, Combs is charged with one count of transporting victims across state lines to engage in prostitution.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say Combs was the don of a criminal enterprise that ensnared women and forced them to commit sex acts under the threat of violence, financial insecurity and reputational ruin.</p>

<p>Combs has pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>Prosecutors are likening his crimes to those of the late Jeffrey Epstein, convicted sex cult leader Keith Raniere, and fellow musician R. Kelly, who received more than three decades in prison for racketeering, sex trafficking and child sex crimes.</p>

<p>It's a remarkable fall from grace for the artist credited with playing a key role in the commercialization of hip-hop, who produced a constellation of famous proteges including The Notorious B.I.G.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking at a military airbase in northern Israel on Wednesday, Gallant said that Israel is "shifting northward by reallocating resources, energy, and forces", Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"We are at the beginning of a new phase in the war -- this requires boldness, determination, and perseverance," Gallant said. He added that the goal is "to return the residents of the northern communities to their homes safely."</p>

<p>The announcement came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Security Cabinet decided to expand the conflict's objectives, aiming to enable displaced Israelis to return to border areas affected by cross-border fighting with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Gallant praised the military's progress but did not comment on Israel's alleged role in recent attacks in Lebanon. "The IDF is achieving excellent results, along with the Shin Bet, the Mossad, and all other relevant bodies," he said.</p>

<p>Lebanese officials reported that thousands of pagers and handheld radios exploded over two days, killing at least 21 people, including children, and injuring more than 3,000 others. Israel has not claimed responsibility for these incidents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming they're not just playing politics," Trump said in televised comments from a bitcoin bar in New York. "The economy would be very bad or they're playing politics, one or the other. But it was a big cut."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian supreme court judge ordered Monday the immediate imprisonment of four people convicted for their role in a nightclub fire that killed 242 people more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>The ruling overturned decisions by two lower courts in 2022 and 2023 that annulled the jail sentences, which ranged from 18 to 22 years, over apparent irregularities in the trial.</p>

<p>The four defendants will have one further chance to appeal at Brazil's supreme court, which could ratify or deny Judge Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli's decision, a judiciary representative told AFP.</p>

<p>The 2013 fire at the nightclub in the southern town of Santa Maria started when members of a band playing that night lit flares that set fire to the ceiling.</p>

<p>A police investigation concluded the fire started when sparks from a flare ignited insulating material, releasing lethal fumes.</p>

<p>While some burned to death, many of the mostly young victims died from asphyxiation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A probe found the venue had no functioning fire extinguishers, only two doors for evacuating people from an overcrowded dance floor, and poor emergency signage.</p>

<p>Two owners of the Kiss nightclub and two members of the Gurizada Fandangueira band were found guilty in December 2021 of murder and attempted murder of the victims, mostly young university students.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's famous kimchi is falling victim to climate change, with scientists, farmers and manufacturers saying the quality and quantity of the napa cabbage that is pickled to make the ubiquitous dish is suffering due to rising temperatures.</p>

<p>Napa cabbage thrives in cooler climates and is usually planted in mountainous regions where temperatures during the key growing summer season once rarely rose above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Studies show that warmer weather brought about by climate change is now threatening these crops, so much so that South Korea might not be able to grow napa cabbage one day due to the intensifying heat.</p>

<p>"We hope these predictions don't come to pass," plant pathologist and virologist Lee Young-gyu said.</p>

<p>"Cabbage likes to grow in cool climates and adapts to a very narrow band of temperatures," Lee said. "The optimal temperatures are between 18 and 21 Celsius."</p>

<p>In the fields and in kitchens - both commercial and domestic - farmers and kimchi makers are already feeling the change.</p>

<p>Spicy, fermented kimchi is made from other vegetables such as radish, cucumber and green onion, but the most popular dish remains cabbage-based.</p>

<p>Describing the effect of higher temperatures on the vegetable, Lee Ha-yeon, who holds the designation of Kimchi Master from the Agriculture Ministry, said the heart of the cabbage "goes bad, and the root becomes mushy."</p>

<p>"If this continues, then in the summer time we might have to give up cabbage kimchi," said Lee, whose title reflects her contribution to food culture.</p>

<p>Data from the government statistics agency shows the area of highland cabbage farmed last year was less than half of what it was 20 years ago: 3,995 hectares compared to 8,796 hectares.</p>

<p>According to the Rural Development Administration, a state farming think tank, climate change scenarios project the farmed area to shrink dramatically in the next 25 years to just 44 hectares, with no cabbage grown in the highlands by 2090.</p>

<p>Researchers cite higher temperatures, unpredictable heavy rains and pests that become more difficult to control in the warmer and longer summers as the cause for the crop shrinkage.</p>

<p>A fungal infection that wilts the plant has also been particularly troublesome for farmers because it only becomes apparent very close to harvest.</p>

<p>Climate change adds to the challenges facing South Korea's kimchi industry, which is already battling lower-priced imports from China, which are mostly served in restaurants.</p>

<p>Customs data released on Monday showed kimchi imports through the end of July were up 6.9% at $98.5 million this year, almost all of it from China and the highest ever for the period.</p>

<p>So far, the government has relied on massive climate-controlled storage to prevent price spikes and shortages. Scientists are also racing to develop crop varieties that can grow in warmer climates and that are more resilient to large fluctuations in rainfall and infections.</p>

<p>But farmers like Kim Si-gap, 71, who has worked in the cabbage fields of the eastern region of Gangneung all his life, fear these varieties will be more expensive to grow in addition to not tasting quite right.</p>

<p>"When we see the reports that there will come a time in Korea when we can no longer grow cabbage, it was shocking on the one hand and also sad at the same time," Kim said.</p>

<p>"Kimchi is something we cannot not have on the table. What are we going to do if this happens?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA has responded to reports claiming "strange noises" being heard by astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The issue was first noted when Mr Wilmore reported hearing pulsating sounds through the speakers of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spacecraft is currently docked at the ISS and scheduled to return on September 7. NASA has since clarified that the sounds were the result of an audio configuration issue between the space station and Starliner.</p>

<p>In a statement, NASA explained that the ISS audio system is a complex network designed to interconnect multiple spacecraft and modules, making occasional noise and feedback not uncommon. The agency reassured that the feedback reported had no technical impact on the crew, the Starliner spacecraft, or station operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A pulsing sound from a speaker in Boeing's Starliner spacecraft heard by NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore aboard the International Space Station has stopped. The feedback from the speaker was the result of an audio configuration between the space station and Starliner. The space station audio system is complex, allowing multiple spacecraft and modules to be interconnected, and it is common to experience noise and feedback," NASA said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following its undocking, the Starliner will perform an autonomous landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, approximately six hours after departure. Astronauts Wilmore and Williams, who arrived at the ISS on June 5 as part of Boeing's Crew Flight Test mission, will return to Earth in a SpaceX Dragon capsule in February 2025.<br />

<p>It's not a thaw yet, but there are certainly signs of some warming in the India-China relationship. Of late, there has been an uptick in dialogue to resolve outstanding issues along two friction points in Eastern Ladakh. At the same time, there is a fresh debate underway within India on economic engagement with China.</p>

<p>&nbsp;July witnessed two meetings between the Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and China's top diplomat Wang Yi. The first of these had indicated a<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jaishankar-wang-yi-meeting-india-china-ties-normalcy-elusive-9440768/" id="OWAe5bd9ac0-1046-ccf2-7a62-cba2281cbac6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="1" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jaishankar-wang-yi-meeting-india-china-ties-normalcy-elusive-9440768/" id="OWAe5bd9ac0-1046-ccf2-7a62-cba2281cbac6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">softening</a></u>&nbsp;of tone from Beijing. While eschewing remarks about putting the border issue in the "appropriate position", Wang<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="2" href="http://in.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zgxw/202407/t20240705_11448615.htm" id="OWA523ba187-6308-709c-85fc-a7dcde57db8c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="3" href="http://in.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zgxw/202407/t20240705_11448615.htm" id="OWA523ba187-6308-709c-85fc-a7dcde57db8c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a></u>&nbsp;for "properly handling and controlling the situation in the border areas, while actively resuming normal exchanges". Following the second one, the Chinese<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="4" href="http://in.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/gdxw/202407/t20240726_11460593.htm" id="OWA4dc0a96b-c0ac-a680-b773-3b67aab02a14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="5" href="http://in.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/gdxw/202407/t20240726_11460593.htm" id="OWA4dc0a96b-c0ac-a680-b773-3b67aab02a14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a></u>&nbsp;talked about the need to "work for new progress in consultations on borderaffairs." Since then, within a month, there have been two meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation &amp; Coordination on India-China Border Affairs. The most recent of these took place last week.</p>

<h2><strong>"Agreed To Turn Over A New Leaf"</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;The<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="6" href="https://english.news.cn/20240829/35e4b97fe0b2452d93f2241fd2de8554/c.html" id="OWA345b7cee-4eef-a6c3-83da-739bf76f7dd0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="7" href="https://english.news.cn/20240829/35e4b97fe0b2452d93f2241fd2de8554/c.html" id="OWA345b7cee-4eef-a6c3-83da-739bf76f7dd0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chinese readout</a></u>&nbsp;following the conversation was rather positive. It said that both sides had "agreed to work together to turn over a new leaf in the border situation at an early date". It further added: "The two sides exchanged in-depth views on relevant issues in border areas, further narrowed differences, expanded consensus, and agreed to strengthen dialogue and consultation, accommodate each other's legitimate concerns, and reach a mutually acceptable solution at an early date."</p>

<p>The Indian<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="8" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38241/31st+Meeting+of+the+Working+Mechanism+for+Consultation++Coordination+on+IndiaChina+Border+Affairs" id="OWA90199968-e71a-2a2c-a898-c24efd3db0f9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="9" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38241/31st+Meeting+of+the+Working+Mechanism+for+Consultation++Coordination+on+IndiaChina+Border+Affairs" id="OWA90199968-e71a-2a2c-a898-c24efd3db0f9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">readout</a></u>&nbsp;was much more contained. It said that "the two sides had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to narrow down the differences and find early resolution of the outstanding issues". The impact of these meetings on actual resolution of the issues in Depsang and Demchok remains to be seen.</p>

<h2><strong>The Question Of Chinese Investments</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the Economic Survey released before the new NDA government's budget in July indicated that India could be more open to Chinese investments in the future. Investments from China have had to face government scrutiny since the issuance of Press Note 3 in April 2020. The notification was seen as an effort by the government to direct Chinese capital in desirable domains. However, the standoff in Ladakh and the subsequent killing of Indian soldiers during the clashes in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 extinguished any appetite for Chinese investments. That situation seems to be changing now.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="10" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/investment-proposals-from-border-nations-201-denied-124-approved/articleshow/109443275.cms" id="OWA584d0861-d3f4-3561-260f-8a4e21cc9d99" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="11" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/investment-proposals-from-border-nations-201-denied-124-approved/articleshow/109443275.cms" id="OWA584d0861-d3f4-3561-260f-8a4e21cc9d99" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a></u>&nbsp;that since April 2020, the Indian government has approved 124 investment proposals from bordering countries and rejected 201. Around 200 proposals are said to be pending with the government. A large number of these proposals were from China. While the scrutiny under Press Note 3 remains active, there has been some easing.</p>

<h2><strong>The MG Motor-JSW Deal</strong></h2>

<p>For instance, in March, the long-discussed joint venture between MG Motor India and JSW Group was finally sealed. It entailed Chinese auto giant SAIC Motor divesting a 51% stake.</p>

<p>Subsequently, in May,<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="12" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-may-permit-chinese-electronic-firms-to-invest-on-a-select-basis-124050200186_1.html" id="OWA6528e4a8-7a34-45a5-a8eb-c28b769eafcd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="13" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-may-permit-chinese-electronic-firms-to-invest-on-a-select-basis-124050200186_1.html" id="OWA6528e4a8-7a34-45a5-a8eb-c28b769eafcd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a></u>&nbsp;emerged that the government had begun moving on approving Chinese investment proposals with Indian firms on a case-by-case basis. In July, it was<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="14" href="https://www.outlookbusiness.com/news/indian-government-to-fast-track-approvals-for-chinese-investments-in-electronics-automobiles" id="OWAdba9dc58-47be-d924-d52f-bbc84bfd6ab4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="15" href="https://www.outlookbusiness.com/news/indian-government-to-fast-track-approvals-for-chinese-investments-in-electronics-automobiles" id="OWAdba9dc58-47be-d924-d52f-bbc84bfd6ab4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a></u>&nbsp;that the government had notified electronics and automobile manufacturers about plans to establish an inter-ministerial panel to accelerate the approval process for investment proposals from Chinese firms in Indian companies. The assessment would require the proposals to meet certain conditions, such as the significance of investment and technology for enhancing the local manufacturing supply chain, exclusion of Chinese nationals from the management and board of the investee firm and the Indian entity holding a majority stake in any joint venture.</p>

<p>At the same time,<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="16" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-to-fast-track-china-visas-after-businesses-complain-of-delays-124071700088_1.html" id="OWA43fe70ac-1a05-8a10-90db-79263d0bf9fc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="17" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-to-fast-track-china-visas-after-businesses-complain-of-delays-124071700088_1.html" id="OWA43fe70ac-1a05-8a10-90db-79263d0bf9fc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a></u>&nbsp;indicated that the Indian government was looking to fast-track visas for Chinese technicians and engineers, given that delays were hurting Indian industry. Then in late August, the&nbsp;<i>Economic Times</i><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="18" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/forbidden-no-more-india-begins-oking-chinese-proposals/articleshow/112691334.cms" id="OWAe45a4f37-1eea-97b6-a351-200ec76aae59" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="19" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/forbidden-no-more-india-begins-oking-chinese-proposals/articleshow/112691334.cms" id="OWAe45a4f37-1eea-97b6-a351-200ec76aae59" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a></u>&nbsp;that the inter-ministerial panel had approved five to six investment proposals involving Chinese entities in the electronics manufacturing sector.</p>

<h2><strong>A Good Approach, But Not Without Perils</strong></h2>

<p>Being open to Chinese capital and talent, particularly those that aid the development of India's manufacturing sector and deepen linkages with global value chains, is a pragmatic and prudent approach. It is, in fact, in India's larger strategic interest to do so. This is not to argue that there isn't any need for scrutiny. The External Affairs Minister is<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="20" href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2024/Aug/31/jaishankar-says-chinese-investments-should-come-under-thorough-scrutiny-2" id="OWAc7e54619-15da-ad89-12f4-3cb1a86ca563" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="21" href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2024/Aug/31/jaishankar-says-chinese-investments-should-come-under-thorough-scrutiny-2" id="OWAc7e54619-15da-ad89-12f4-3cb1a86ca563" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">right to argue</a></u>, as he did at a public forum last week, that given the current geopolitical scenario and India's peculiar challenges with China, it is "common sense that investments from China should be scrutinised". However, this should not be an ad hoc process. It is imperative to establish a new investment review mechanism with clear guidelines, conditions and timelines. This will engender greater predictability for industry, and ensure adequate democratic oversight. Such a process should also entail delineating a narrow set of sub-sectors as critical from a national security perspective and therefore walled off from Chinese entities. This list can evolve dynamically following periodic reviews.</p>

<p>That said, from the perspective of Indian industry, working with Chinese entities and being reliant on Chinese capital is likely to always remain a perilous endeavour. Politics and security have always come first in the India-China dynamic. Events over the past seven years since the Doklam stand-off have only further entrenched this trend. In addition, given the structural fault lines between the two sides, volatility is likely to remain a feature of the India-China relationship. The risks for industry, therefore, are always likely to remain high.</p>

<h2><strong>India Must Know What It Wants</strong></h2>

<p>Finally, while we are in a moment of policy churn, it is imperative for India's political elite and strategic affairs community to deliberate on what it is that we desire in our relationship with China. Many have talked about the need for a new&nbsp;<i>modus vivendi</i>. But what are the contours of this new, desirable state of affairs that we wish to arrive at? And what does India need to do to get there? These are questions that need deeper yet urgent reflection, for policy to proceed with purpose and pragmatism rather than being reactive.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today's world, when many youngsters aim to create billion-dollar unicorns - and some become successful - mental health and physical well-being have taken a backseat. Psychiatrists and leading voices from the industry blame "hustle culture", the mantra for ambition, as the reason behind it and warn youngsters against following it. Hustle culture is again in focus after Kritarth Mittal, who tasted success at the age of 25 with Soshals app, landed in hospital for a health scare. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/abhagsain/status/1830545635956949453">In a post on X</a>, the 25-year-old blamed poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy diet and urged his followers and other social media users to take care of their health.</p>

<h3><strong>Tech Leaders Who Challenge Hustle Culture</strong></h3>

<p>Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is often celebrated as the embodiment of hustle culture. However, his own experiences have served as a cautionary tale. In a candid interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/elon-musk-interview-tesla.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Mr Musk revealed the toll that overwork has taken on his health and well-being. He admitted to working 120-hour weeks and relying on Ambien to sleep, a practice he described as "not wise". His admission sparked discussions on whether the relentless pursuit of success is sustainable or worth the cost to personal health.</p>

<p>David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founder of Basecamp and creator of Ruby on Rails, is a vocal critic of hustle culture. Mr Hansson has spoken out against the glorification of overwork in the tech industry, arguing that it leads to burnout and diminishes creativity. In his book, It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work, co-authored with Jason Fried, he advocates for a calmer, more sustainable work environment. Hansson has repeatedly emphasized the importance of work-life balance, stating in The Guardian that "work should not be your life".</p>

<p>Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has also been vocal about the dangers of hustle culture. After stepping down from his role at Reddit, Mr Ohanian has focused on promoting mental health awareness and work-life balance, particularly in the tech industry. He has spoken at length about how hustle culture can lead to burnout and has encouraged entrepreneurs to prioritise their well-being. Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/always-on-work-culture-creating-broken-people-says-reddit-co-founder-11558464608"><em>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ)</em></a>, Mr Ohanian said the so-called "hustle porn" online perpetuates an unhealthy culture of posturing in the tech industry.</p>

<h3><strong>The Hidden Costs of Hustle Culture</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Mental health strain:</strong> Hustle culture glorifies relentless work, often at the expense of mental well-being. The constant pressure to be productive can lead to burnout, anxiety, and depression. According to Forbes, the obsession with work can create a toxic environment where employees feel guilty for resting.</p>

<p><strong>Impact on relationships:</strong> <em>The Guardian</em> said in an article that hustle culture can strain personal relationships, as time with loved ones is sacrificed for work. The pursuit of success often leads to isolation, eroding social connections and increasing stress.</p>

<p><strong>Long-term consequences:</strong> While short-term gains may be celebrated, the long-term effects of overworking include chronic health issues and diminished life satisfaction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis arrived in Muslim-majority Indonesia on Tuesday to kick off a four-nation tour of the Asia-Pacific that will be the longest and farthest of the 87-year-old's papacy.</p>

<p>The head of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics touched down in Jakarta for a three-day visit devoted to inter-religious ties, and will then travel to Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.</p>

<p>The 12-day tour will test the pontiff's increasingly fragile health, but he is often energised by being among his flock and he emerged from the 13-hour flight smiling and waving.</p>

<p>"I thank you for coming on this journey, thank you for the company. I think it is the longest one (flight) I have done," he told reporters aboard his chartered plane after landing, according to an AFP journalist.</p>

<p>He disembarked in Jakarta in a wheelchair to an honour guard, greetings by Indonesian officials, including the religious affairs minister, and a traditional bouquet from two children.</p>

<p>The pontiff was then picked up from the red carpet by a civilian Toyota car, choosing a modest vehicle over one of the luxury typically used by world leaders. He smiled and waved as he left for the Vatican's diplomatic mission in Jakarta.</p>

<p>The pope was due to have a relaxing day in Jakarta on Tuesday following the long flight from Rome, then meet President Joko Widodo on Wednesday in the first major set piece of his visit to the world's most populous Muslim-majority country.</p>

<p>Catholics currently represent fewer than three per cent of the population of Indonesia -- about eight million people, compared with the 87 per cent, or 242 million, who are Muslim.</p>

<p>But they are one of six officially recognised religions or denominations in the secular nation, including Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Francis will meet representatives of all six at Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia and a symbol of religious co-existence.</p>

<p>It is linked via a "tunnel of friendship" to the cathedral across the road, where Christians in recent days have been taking selfies with a life-sized cutout of the pope.</p>

<p>He will then host a mass and deliver a sermon at Indonesia's 80,000-seater national football stadium.</p>

<h3><strong>Joint declaration&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Despite Indonesia's official recognition of different faiths, there are concerns about growing discrimination, including against Christians, with local Catholics hoping the pope will speak out.</p>

<p>But Michel Chambon, a theologian and anthropologist at the National University of Singapore, said the pope would press a wider message he had already delivered in other Muslim-majority countries, from Iraq to Bahrain, Turkey and Morocco.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The visit "is not really aimed at Catholics in Indonesia" but is intended to highlight the global importance of Islamic-Christian dialogue, he told AFP.</p>

<p>That message was already being felt by some in Jakarta.</p>

<p>"When there's an event like this, we enjoy it because when it's our religious events, they (Catholics) also show tolerance to us," said Ranggi Prathita, a 34-year-old Muslim who has been selling customised Pope t-shirts.</p>

<p>"We all respect each other."</p>

<p>The country's religious affairs ministry has also hailed the visit as a symbol of Indonesia's religious diversity.</p>

<p>At the Istiqlal Mosque, Pope Francis will sign a joint declaration with its grand imam that will focus on "dehumanisation", notably the spread of violence and conflict, as well as environmental degradation, according to the Indonesian bishops' Conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Francis has repeatedly urged the world to do more to combat climate change and mitigate its effects -- including rising sea levels, which threaten Jakarta.</p>

<p>Indonesia has experienced terrorist attacks over recent decades, including bombings on the resort island of Bali by Islamist militants in 2002 that left 202 people dead.</p>

<p>Security has been stepped up for the pope's visit, with roads around key sites where he is scheduled to visit being re-routed or closed.</p>

<h3><strong>Fragile health</strong></h3>

<p>His trip to Indonesia is the third ever by a pope and the first since John Paul II in 1989.</p>

<p>Originally planned for 2020 but postponed due to the Covid pandemic, the visit takes place just three months before his 88th birthday.</p>

<p>The Argentine now routinely uses a wheelchair to move around, underwent hernia surgery last year and has been plagued by respiratory issues.</p>

<p>He has not travelled abroad since visiting Marseille in France in September last year, having cancelled a planned address at United Nations climate talks in Dubai two months later.</p>

<p>He will be travelling to Indonesia with his personal doctor and two nurses, but Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said this is normal, saying no extra precautions were in place.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death of a junior doctor in Indonesia has reignited debate over the issue of bullying prevalent in medical schools across the country. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, 30-year-old Aulia Risma Lestari, resident in the anaesthesia specialist programme at Diponegoro University in Semarang, was found dead in her living quarters on August 12. It is reported that she may have injected herself with a lethal dose of an anaesthetic. Police are still investigating her death as a possible suicide, and are looking into whether bullying documented in her diary may have contributed to her depression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following her death, several WhatsApp conversations between the 31-year-old and several senior residents at Kardinah Hospital in Tegal revealed troubling claims. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3276739/indonesia-junior-doctors-death-exposes-bullying-scourge-medical-schools" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>, they suggested that the junior doctor faced pressures from senior doctors to cover expenses beyond her tuition and living costs, including demands for food, entertainment and even car rentals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reacting to the incident, Indonesia's Health Ministry suspended the hospital's anesthesiology residency programme until a police investigation is concluded. Separately, Indonesia's Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin called bullying an "open secret" in the country's medical institutions and labelled it a "huge phenomenon".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I will push for legal action to ensure maximum punishment for the perpetrators and to create a deterrent effect," Mr Sadikin said, vowing to implement better monitoring and reporting measures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Diponegoro University's rector, Professor Suharnomo, has refuted allegations of bullying. He asserted that the junior doctor faced health issues that affected her studies. The professor also stated that the university would cooperate with the police in their investigations. He added that the school has already implemented a zero-bullying policy, actively monitored by the Bullying and Sexual Violence Prevention and Management Team since August 2023.</p>

<p>However, in the wake of the tragic incident, other junior doctors across the country have opened up about their ordeals. &nbsp;Agung Purnama, a 29-year-old medical student specialising in oncology surgery during his residency at a hospital in Bandung, West Java, said that he had experienced pressure from senior doctors to work long hours.</p>

<p>"Or else they would say we will not get a good grade, or we are not worthy of becoming doctors," the medical student said. "You feel like (you) have no choice but to do as they say ... I spent so much time and money to get to this point (in my studies) so it feels like you don't want to do anything to risk that," he added.</p>

<p>"I think there is a tendency to normalise and see bullying as being natural because of the high amounts of pressure and demands of specialised medical education ... but this shouldn't be normalised or tolerated," founder and chief executive of advocacy group Centre for Indonesia's Strategic Development Initiatives, Diah Satyani Saminarsih, said, reported SCMP.</p>

<p>"The more junior you are, the higher the risk is that you will be exposed to bullying," she added.<br />
Meanwhile, citing the health ministry, the outlet reported that it had received 356 formal complaints related to bullying between July 2023 and August this year. Out of these, authorities investigated 156 cases, resulting in suspension or dismissal. The complaints by the victims contained details of physical abuse, financial coercion, verbal abuse, and even intimidation.</p>

<p>"The Health Ministry will always take stern action against the bullies. Their names will also be flagged in the system as perpetrators," health ministry's spokesman Mohammad Syahril told the outlet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A school bus ploughed into a crowd of people outside a middle school in eastern China on Tuesday, killing 11 parents and students, state media reported.</p>

<p>State broadcaster CCTV said the driver "lost control" of the vehicle as it approached the school in Shandong province's Tai'an city at 7:27 am (2327 GMT Monday).</p>

<p>The bus ran into a group of parents and children on the side of the road, according to CCTV.</p>

<p>"As of now, (the incident) has caused the deaths of 11 people, of whom six were parents and five were students," the broadcaster reported in an update just after 11:30 am.</p>

<p>It said one other person was in a "critical" condition, while the vital signs of another 12 people were "stable".</p>

<p>Photos and videos circulating on social media showed people in blood-soaked clothes lying in the road near a hulking grey bus.</p>

<p>Several adults knelt over children sprawled unmoving on the ground, while other people could be heard screaming in the background.</p>

<p>"They're all dead, it's so heartbreaking," a woman's voice could be heard saying off-camera in one clip of the aftermath of the crash.</p>

<p>"I'd have been killed too if I'd stood there, but luckily I ran away fast," she said.</p>

<p>AFP was able to geolocate several of the social media photos and videos to the school in Shandong where the crash took place.</p>

<p>The driver was being held by local police and the cause of the incident was "under investigation", CCTV said.</p>

<p>Many public schools in China reopened for the new academic year this week.</p>

<p>Deadly traffic accidents occur frequently in the country due to lax safety standards and widespread disorderly driving.</p>

<p>In July, police said a vehicle crashed into pedestrians in the central city of Changsha, killing eight people and injuring five.</p>

<p>A 55-year-old suspect living in the area was detained pending an investigation, but it was not clear if the incident was intentional or not.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Venezuela's newest news anchors sits on a stool, dressed in a flannel shirt and chinos as he delivers the day's headlines.</p>

<p>He goes by "El Pana," Venezuelan slang for "friend."</p>

<p>Only, he's not real.</p>

<p>El Pana, and his colleague "La Chama," or "The Girl," are generated using artificial intelligence, though they look, sound and move realistically.</p>

<p>They were created as part of an initiative dubbed "Operation Retweet" by Colombia-based organization Connectas, led by director Carlos Huertas, to publish news from a dozen independent media outlets in Venezuela and in the process protect reporters as the government has launched a crackdown on journalists and protesters.</p>

<p>"We decided to use artificial intelligence to be the 'face' of the information we're publishing," Huertas said in an interview, "because our colleagues who are still out doing their jobs are facing much more risk."</p>

<p>At least 10 journalists have been arrested since mid-June and eight remain imprisoned on charges including terrorism, according to Reporters Without Borders.</p>

<p>"Here, using artificial intelligence is... almost like a mix between technology and journalism," Huertas said, explaining the project looked to "circumvent the persecution and increasing repression" from the government as there would be no one who could face arrest.</p>

<p>The country's opposition and human rights groups have said recent arrests of protesters, opposition figures and journalists are part of a government crackdown meant to quiet a sometimes violent, month-long election dispute.</p>

<p>Venezuela's communications ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the AI journalism initiative. No official has responded to repeated requests for comment by Reuters about the arrests of journalists in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Both the opposition and President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 election.</p>

<p>Maduro, in power since 2013, is backed by the Supreme Court and the electoral authority, which has not published full vote tallies because of what it says was a cyber-attack.</p>

<p>The opposition has shared what it says are more than 80% of vote tallies, showing a resounding win for its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. Some international observers and many Western countries have said election conditions were unfair and demanded full tallies.</p>

<p>Protests since the vote have led to at least 27 deaths and 2,400 arrests, and detentions of opposition figures and protesters have continued as part of the government's "Operation Knock Knock."</p>

<p>Maduro and his administration have called protesters fascists and said they are inciting hate at the behest of countries like the United States, which Washington denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas' armed wing said on Monday that since June the group has been operating under new instructions on how to handle hostages should Israeli forces approach their locations in Gaza.</p>

<p>The announcement comes days after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying they had been shot dead by their captors as Israeli forces got close.</p>

<p>Abu Ubaida, spokesperson for Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades, did not provide details on what the instructions were. He said his group holds Israel responsible for the hostages' deaths.</p>

<p>The new instructions, Ubaida said, were given to guards of hostages after a rescue operation by Israel in June. At that time, Israeli forces freed four hostages in a raid in which dozens of Palestinians, including women and children, were killed.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu's insistence to free prisoners through military pressure, instead of sealing a deal, means they will be returned to their families in shrouds. Their families must choose whether they want them dead or alive," he said.</p>

<p>Later on Monday, the Hamas armed wing published a pre-recorded video of one of the six dead hostages. It was unclear when the video was made.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said in a press conference on Monday that the hostages had been shot in the back of the head, and promised that Hamas would pay a heavy price.</p>

<p>Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Netanyahu's accusations against Hamas were an attempt to escape responsibility for their deaths.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu killed the six prisoners and he is determined to kill the remaining ones. The Israelis should choose between Netanyahu or the deal," Abu Zuhri said.</p>

<p>Similarly, Ezzat El Rashq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said in a statement published by the group on Monday: "The resistance's hostages can immediately return to their families, the [one] stalling their return and responsible for their lives is Netanyahu."</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas have failed to reach a deal that would end the war and see the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for many Palestinians jailed by Israel.</p>

<p>Hamas wants an agreement to end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza while Netanyahu says the war can only end once Hamas is defeated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Governor Walz escaped unharmed, as he was in a front vehicle, while the rear press vans with members of the media who travelled with him were impacted in the crash. At least one person, a pool reporter, reportedly suffered a broken arm and required medical attention.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to arrive in Brunei today, marking the first-ever visit by an Indian PM to the Southeast Asian nation. The two-day visit aims to strengthen India's ties with Brunei and commemorates 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modis-historic-visit-to-brunei-to-bolster-cooperation-in-space-defence-6476547 ">PM Modi is in Brunei at the invitation of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah</a>, the second-longest reigning monarch in the world, following the UK's Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>Hassanal Bolkiah is known for his impressive wealth and extravagant lifestyle and boasts the world's largest private car collection, valued at an estimated $5 billion.<br />
<br />
With a net worth of $30 billion, largely derived from Brunei's oil and gas reserves, the Sultan has over 7,000 luxurious vehicles in his collection. Among these, he owns approximately 600 Rolls-Royce cars, a feat that has earned him an official Guinness World Record.<br />
<br />
The collection also includes around 450 Ferraris and 380 Bentleys, according to The Sun. He also owns Porsches, Lamborghinis, Maybachs, Jaguars, BMWs, and McLarens, according to automotive sources, including CarBuzz and The South China Morning Post.<br />
<br />
Among the most notable vehicles in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sultan-of-brunei-marks-golden-jubilee-in-style-1758967" target="_blank">Hassanal Bolkiah's collection</a> are a Bentley Dominator SUV valued at approximately $80 million, a Porsche 911 with Horizon Blue paint and an X88 power package, and a 24-carat gold-plated Rolls-Royce Silver Spur II. One of his prized possessions is a custom-designed Rolls-Royce with an open roof and an umbrella, lavishly designed with gold.<br />
<br />
The Sultan also acquired a custom gold-coated Rolls-Royce for his daughter Princess Majededah's wedding in 2007.<br />
<br />
However, his car collection is just the tip of the iceberg. The Sultan resides in the Istana Nurul Iman Palace, which holds the Guinness World Record for being the largest residential palace in the world. It spans over two million square feet and is adorned with 22-carat gold. The palace has five swimming pools, 1,700 bedrooms, 257 baths and 110 garages. The Sultan also owns a private zoo, housing 30 Bengal tigers and various bird species. He owns a Boeing 747 aircraft as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian High Commissioner to Brunei, Alok Amitabh Dimri termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the nation "historic" and said the two nations have been civilizational neighbours.</p>

<p>PM Modi embarked on the visit to Brunei on Tuesday. Notably, this is the first visit by an Indian PM to the nation.</p>

<p>He is expected to hold high-level engagements with Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and other members of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, the Indian envoy said, "Honourable Prime Minister is on a two-day official tour to Brunei Darussalam on 3rd and 4th September. In our four decades of diplomatic relationship, this is the first bilateral official visit by the Prime Minister of India to Brunei Darussalam. It is a historic moment in our bilateral relationship and also for the Indian community in Brunei Darussalam that high-level bilateral engagement between Prime Minister Shri Modi and His Majesty the King is going to take place."</p>

<p>He further opened up on the influence of Indian culture in Brunei and said India shares deep historical roots and bonds with Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>"This visit is historic in many ways that Brunei and India have been civilizational neighbours as you know that India shares deep historical roots and bonds with Southeast Asia. The Malayan tradition of this geography which is located in the Borneo Island of Southeast Asian Seas derives deep linkages be it, linguistic, anthropological, ethnic, architectural, religious motives, customs and traditions, norms from India, South India, including words say for example 'deerghayu', 'anugrahhariguru'," he said.</p>

<p>"There are co-traditions where the Indian manner of greeting the namaskar and pranam is the official manner of greeting the His Majesty," Mr Dimri added.</p>

<p>Speaking on the outcomes of the Prime Minister's visit, the High Commissioner said a joint statement and the signing of MoUs are expected.</p>

<p>"We are expecting a joint statement, which would take stock of the bilateral relations and between both countries. The statement is also expected to cover the key areas of interest between both countries. India also has a space station in Brunei, which helps ISRO with some key launches," he said.</p>

<p>Elaborating on the bilateral ties between the two nations, the Indian envoy said the two countries share warm and friendly relations, adding that "exchanges have been deep."</p>

<p>He said that the Indian diaspora is deeply entrenched in Brunei, despite the country's small size and economy. He further noted that there are many different communities in Brunei, including Tamilians, Malyalis, Sindhis, Punjabis, Marathas, and Gujaratis.</p>

<p>"Our exchanges have been deep. Despite the small economy and geography, the Indian diaspora has been deeply entrenched here...Indians have made deep inroads here...There is a prominent Tamilian community, Malyali community, Sindhis and Punjabis and we also see Marathas and Gujaratis."</p>

<p>Mr Dimri highlighted the unique aspects of Brunei, including its small population and geography, but emphasized that the country's Indian community has made significant contributions.</p>

<p>"We have to understand the geographies first. This is a very small geography with a population of 4,00,000 people... We call it a subcontinent, but we are a continent-sized country... So there are those imbalances. But then relations never come with the conditions, as I shared with you, that our exchanges have been deep. And despite the small geography and the economy, the Indian traders, exports and Indian diaspora have been deeply entrenched here," the High Commissioner said.</p>

<p>During the visit, Prime Minister Modi will engage in bilateral discussions on all aspects of bilateral relations and cooperation with Brunei and explore new areas of collaboration.</p>

<p>Brunei is an important partner in India's 'Act East' Policy and its vision for the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>Following the first leg of his visit, PM Modi will travel to Singapore for the second leg of his visit from September 4-5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Iran's former national security chief, has emerged as a major player in the global oil market, a Bloomberg report says.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Iran's former national security chief, has emerged as a major player in the global oil market, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-08-30/iran-oil-secretive-trader-called-hector-seen-as-global-kingpin">Bloomberg report</a> says. Despite stringent US sanctions targeting Iranian and Russian oil, Shamkhani has managed to run international oil trading operations from the heart of Dubai.</p>

<p>Shamkhani's rise to prominence is inextricably linked to his father, Ali Shamkhani, a key figure in Iran's defence and security apparatus. Ali Shamkhani, who served as the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) for nearly a decade, continues to hold sway as an advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the elder Shamkhani has maintained a formidable presence in Iran's political landscape, his son has quietly built a business empire that now commands significant influence in global energy markets.</p>

<h2><strong>The Dubai Connection</strong></h2>

<p>According to Bloomberg, two years ago, a relatively unknown company, Milavous Group Ltd, leased a premium office space in a Dubai corporate tower. Within months, the firm had carved out a substantial role in the global oil market. According to sources familiar with the company's operations, Hossein Shamkhani, who operates under the pseudonym "Hector" in trading circles, is the driving force behind Milavous, the report stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From its strategic base in Dubai, Milavous has reportedly generated billions in revenue by selling commodities sourced from Iran, Russia, and other nations. The firm reportedly operates by blending and rebranding crude oil, often obscuring the origin of the products and complicating efforts to enforce international sanctions.</p>

<h2><strong>Influence and Evasion</strong></h2>

<p>Shamkhani's network, described by insiders as one of the largest oil trading entities in Iran, has managed to evade US sanctions through a combination of legal loopholes, strategic partnerships, and a global network of shell companies. While Shamkhani himself is not subject to US sanctions, several vessels believed to be under his control have been targeted by the US Treasury Department. However, the sheer scale of his operations, involving over 60 ships, has made it difficult for US authorities to completely dismantle his network.</p>

<p>Milavous, under Shamkhani's guidance, has also expanded its reach into major international markets, reportedly supplying oil to global energy giants like China's Sinopec, Chevron, and BP, the report says. These companies, however, maintain that they comply with all relevant laws and sanctions.</p>

<p>The US government's efforts to clamp down on Shamkhani's activities have been complicated by the potential economic repercussions. With Iran's oil exports estimated to generate $35 billion annually, any significant disruption could have ripple effects across global energy markets, particularly during an election year in the US when fuel prices are under scrutiny.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A single bottlenose dolphin, who might have been separated from its pod, is being considered responsible for a troubling series of attacks on swimmers in Tsurga, a seaside town in Fukui Prefecture in Japan.</p>

<p>The latest incident occurred on August 20, when a man in his 50s was bitten on both hands as he was trying to drive off the dolphin. This attack marks the 18th reported case since July 21 and the second within a span of two days.</p>

<p>According to NBC News, the region has seen over 48 dolphin bite incidents in the last 3 years with some victims suffering major injuries including broken bones. Most of the bites however were minor -- some little more than scratches -- but in one recent incident, an elementary school child wound up requiring 20 to 30 stitches, coastguard official Shoichi Takeuchi told AFP. The recent biting incident required beach staff to coax a dolphin away from a swimming area using water skis.</p>

<p>A Coast Guard notice warned of the potential dangers of the rising number of dolphin bites, stating, "Last year, there were many incidents in which swimmers were bitten by dolphins, with some requiring more than 10 stitches."</p>

<p>Researchers suspect a lonely male dolphin behind these attacks as injuries on the dorsal fin of the dolphin involved in the last incident match those of a dolphin off the coast spotted last year, provided dorsal fins are unique to each dolphin, similar to fingerprints in the case of human beings.</p>

<p>Tadamichi Morisaka, a researcher at the Cetacean Research Center at Japan's Mie University, who has seen photographs, told NHK, Japan, "It's reasonable to assume that they're the same individual." He also said that this particular dolphin appears to have been accustomed to human interaction over the years leading to his behaviour as it is unusual for bottlenose dolphins to approach, interact or bite with humans.</p>

<p>In a mail to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/dolphin-attacks-swimmers-lonely-japan-rcna168349" rel="No Follow, No Index ">NBC News</a>, Morisaka also said the dolphin mainly wants to merely "interact with humans", possibly owing to its loneliness rather than harm them.</p>

<p>Chief executive and founding director of Dolphin Research Australia, Elizabeth Hawkins, further said, that the animal may be a "sociable solitary dolphin" that has somehow got isolated. And, when socially isolated, Hawkins said, they "can be quite pushy, they can be quite aggressive, they can bite." Hence, she emphasized the necessity of ensuring the creature is given space.</p>

<p>As the situation develops, local officials continue to monitor the dolphin's behaviour and advise caution for those entering water.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fabrizio Longo, a 62-year-old Audi executive and passionate mountain climber, fell to his death from a height of 10,000 feet while ascending Cima Payer in the Adamello mountains, near the Italian-Swiss border.&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/business/audi-boss-fabrizio-longo-62-killed-in-fall-while-climbing-mountain-in-italy/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post,</a></em> Mr Longo, who headed Audi's Italy-based operations, was nearing the summit when the accident occurred</span>. A fellow climber witnessed the incident and alerted rescue teams, who promptly responded to the scene.</p>

<p>They located his body 700 feet down a gorge, where he was pronounced dead. A helicopter retrieval team then transported his body to a hospital in Carisolo for further examination.&nbsp;At the time of the incident, he was well-equipped with various safety aids, including steel cables and ladders, which he had brought to assist him on his route.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently underway. Once the autopsy and other formalities are complete, Mr Longo's family will announce a date for his funeral, following the release of his body.</p>

<p>Mr Longo was born in Rimini, Italy in 1962 and graduated with a degree in political science. He began his journey at Fiat in 1987, where he honed his marketing skills before taking the helm of the Lancia brand in 2002. He joined Audi in 2012, and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the director of Italian operations in 2013.</p>

<p>An Audi spokesperson told <em>The Post:</em> "Fabrizio Longo has been leading the Audi brand in Italy with enormous success since 2013, confirming the brand's leadership in the premium segment for 11 consecutive years. He was the source of unwavering support. His strong values and genuine care for each one created a workplace filled with warmth and respect. His infectious enthusiasm and positive energy touched and inspired Audi Italia and its stakeholders daily."</p>

<p>The Audi executive, who frequently visited the Adamello mountains, was also a passionate advocate for environmental conservation, strongly supporting efforts to protect the area from the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The International Ski and Snowboard Federation also released a statement mourning his death.</p>

<p>Flavio Roda, the head of the federation, called Mr Longo's death ''a terrible loss for the federation that has collaborated fruitfully with Longo for years.''</p>

<p>''We join the family in this moment of great pain, and with the staff of Audi Italia,'' he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A daughter of South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma was among hundreds of women and girls who danced for the king of Eswatini in a traditional ceremony Monday, confirming her engagement to the monarch.</p>

<p>Nomceba Zuma, 21, was among 5,000 people from around the small kingdom at the annual Reed Dance at the Ludzidzini Royal Village at Lobamba, 23 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of the capital Mbabane.</p>

<p>While the days-long ceremony is a traditional rite of womanhood, it is also been the occasion when King Mswati, 56, makes clear his choice of a new wife. He already has at least 14, some of whom he married when they were minors, and at least 25 children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mswati's brother said last week that Nomceba Zuma would attend the Reed Dance as the "liphovela", which means the royal fiancee or concubine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Monday's evening ceremony, she was among hundreds of young women and girls in colourful traditional dress, some holding imitation swords and shields, who danced before Mswati and an entourage of men in traditional skins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her father Jacob Zuma, 82, is also polygamous by tradition and has at least 20 children. He was forced to resign as president of South Africa in 2018 under a cloud of corruption.</p>

<p>Mswati, who has ruled by decree since 1986, has been criticised for his lavish lifestyle while nearly 60 percent of the population of the small kingdom of Eswatini lives on less than Rupees 169 ($1.90) a day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French pensioner went on trial Monday on charges of allowing scores of strangers to rape his wife after he drugged her, in a case that has horrified the country.</p>

<p>Fifty men, recruited online, are also being tried in the southern city of Avignon alongside the main suspect, a 71-year-old former employee at France's state-owned power utility company EDF.</p>

<p>Police counted a total of 92 rapes committed by 72 men, 51 of whom were identified.</p>

<p>The men, aged between 26 and 74, are accused of raping the 72-year-old woman who, her lawyers say, was so heavily sedated she was not aware of the abuse that went on for a decade.</p>

<p>Presiding judge Roger Arata announced that all hearings would be public, granting the woman her wish for "complete publicity until the end" of the court case, according to one of her lawyers, Stephane Babonneau.</p>

<p>"She wants to raise awareness, as widely as possible, of what happened to her so that events like these never happen again," Babonneau said.</p>

<p>Another of her attorneys, Antoine Camus, said the trial would nonetheless be "a horrible ordeal" for her.</p>

<p>"For the first time, she will have to live through the rapes that she endured over 10 years," he told AFP, adding that his client had "no recollection" of the abuse that she discovered only in 2020.</p>

<p>The woman, who arrived at the court supported by her three children, did not want a trial behind closed doors because "that's what her attackers would have wanted", Camus said.</p>

<h3><strong>Some came back six times&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Police began to investigate the defendant, Dominique P., in September 2020 when he was caught by a security guard secretly filming under the skirts of three women in a shopping centre.</p>

<p>Police said they found hundreds of pictures and videos of his wife on his computer, visibly unconscious and mostly in the foetal position.</p>

<p>The images are alleged to show dozens of rapes in the couple's home in Mazan, a village of 6,000 people around 33 kilometres (21 miles) from Avignon in Provence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investigators also found chats on a site called coco.fr, since shut down by police, in which he recruited strangers to come to their home and have intercourse with his wife.</p>

<p>Dominique P. admitted to investigators that he gave his wife powerful tranquilisers, especially Temesta, an anxiety-reducing drug.</p>

<p>The abuse started in 2011, when the couple was living near Paris, and continued after they moved to Mazan two years later.</p>

<p>The husband took part in the rapes, filmed them and encouraged the other men using degrading language, according to prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No money changed hands.</p>

<p>The accused rapists include a forklift driver, a fire brigade officer, a company boss and a journalist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some were single, others married or divorced, and some were family men. Most participated just once, but some took part up to six times.</p>

<h3><strong>Murder probe&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Many have said they thought they were simply helping a libertine couple live out its fantasies, but Dominique P. told investigators that all were aware that his wife had been drugged without her knowledge.</p>

<p>An expert said her state "was closer to a coma than to sleep".</p>

<p>Her husband told prosecutors that only three men left the house quickly after arriving, while all others proceeded to have intercourse with his wife.</p>

<p>Dominique P., who said he was raped by a male nurse when he was nine, was ready to face "his family and his wife", his lawyer Beatrice Zavarro told AFP on Monday morning.</p>

<p>"He is ashamed of what he did, it's unforgivable," she said, adding the case was one of a "sort of addiction".</p>

<p>This trial may not be his last.</p>

<p>He has also been charged with a 1991 murder and rape, which he denies, and an attempted rape in 1999, to which he admitted after DNA testing.</p>

<p>Experts said the man does not appear to be mentally ill, but in documents seen by AFP, they said he had a need to feel "all-powerful" over the female body.</p>

<p>More than a dozen feminists dressed in black protested outside the courthouse.</p>

<p>The trial is to last until December 20.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said on Monday he was close to presenting a final proposal for a deal to release hostages held by Hamas in Gaza but said he did not think Israeli Prime Benjamin Netanyahu was doing enough to secure such an agreement.</p>

<p>Biden was speaking to reporters at the White House after Israeli forces over the weekend recovered the bodies of six hostages, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old American-Israeli, from a tunnel in Gaza where it said they were recently killed by Palestinian Hamas militants.</p>

<p>That has sparked criticism of the Biden administration's Gaza ceasefire strategy and ratcheted up pressure on Netanyahu from Israelis to bring the remaining hostages home.</p>

<p>Asked whether he thought Netanyahu was doing enough to secure a hostage deal, Biden said "No." He did not elaborate.</p>

<p>Asked if he was planning to present a final hostage deal to both sides this week, Biden said: "We're very close to that."</p>

<p>"Hope springs eternal," he added when asked whether a deal would be successful.</p>

<p>Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were due on Monday to meet with the US hostage deal negotiating team to discuss efforts toward an agreement for the release of the remaining captives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Princess Diana wanted to re-do her royal wedding just so she could "get the hair right," her former hairdresser told <em>People</em>. Princess Diana and King Charles tied the knot in July 1981 in St. Paul's Cathedral, England. Her former dresser Richard Dalton had been responsible for styling her hair leading up to the grand event, although he wasn't the one who styled her hair on the big day. The task was handled by his colleague, Kevin Shanley. Now, in his book, Mr Dalton called Princess Diana's wedding day hair a "disaster" and the bride agreed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/princess-diana-didnt-like-her-wedding-day-hair-richard-dalton-exclusive-8704644#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDiana%20did%20express%20to%20me,day%20on%20July%2029%2C%201981." rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>People</em></a>, Mr Dalton said that Princess Diana expressed to him that she wanted a re-do of her royal wedding to "get the hair right". "Diana did express to me that she wished she could do the wedding over again to 'get the hair right,'" he said. "However, she never mentioned any other regrets while I did her hair," he continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Dalton worked with Princess Diana for a decade. He left his job in 1991. Now, with the encouragement of his friend Renae Plant, curator of The Princess Diana Museum, Mr Dalton has shared memories in his new book with Mr Plant, <em>'It's All About the Hair - My Decade with Diana'</em>, offering never-before-told stories about the beloved royal.</p>

<p>"As a loyal subject to the royal family, I never shared anything publicly until now to protect her," Mr Dalton told the outlet. "I am 76 years old, (the) same age as (King) Charles, and I wanted to document my real story. (It's) not a hairdresser's job to kiss and tell. Now I feel comfortable - 27 years have passed, and nothing in my book is detrimental to Diana's character. Just wonderful memories," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Dalton shared that even though he would sometimes only get 15 minutes to style Princess Diana's hair, he never felt the pressure" working under her. "I loved taking risks with Diana's hair by trying new things like the orchards in Thailand," he recalled, referring to his favourite hair moment he ever did for the princess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, the 76-year-old said that during their decade together, he saw Princess Diana at her best - her witty sense of humour, her dedication to motherhood, and her commitment to royal work. He also saw the princess at her worst, including moments of intensely low self-esteem during her marriage with the future King Charles, which ultimately ended in 1992 - the year after Mr Dalton stopped working for the royal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Some days she would be happy, some days quiet, some days talkative and some days sad. I experienced all of these with Diana," Mr Dalton shared in the book. He added that, on her lower days, "sparks would be flying off the hair dryer," he quipped in the book. "I got used to the stress."</p>

<p>Mr Dalton revealed that it was only after he stopped working for Princess Diana that he realised how much stress he was under as the man responsible for the hair of the most photographed woman in the world. When he did her hair for the last time, Mr Dalton said she "was going through a really rough stage of her life with Charles and wanted a fresh staff and could tell I wanted my life back," he told the outlet. "She said, 'I think [you want] your freedom back' - and it was mutual. I didn't realize how much pressure I was under until I left," he added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

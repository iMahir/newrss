       <description><![CDATA[Two men accused of killing Ripudaman Singh Malik, a Sikh man acquitted in the tragic 1985 Air India Kanishka terrorist bombing case, have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a Canadian court, according to media reports.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men accused of killing Ripudaman Singh Malik, a Sikh man acquitted in the tragic 1985 Air India Kanishka terrorist bombing case, have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a Canadian court, according to media reports. Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez entered the pleas in the British Columbia (BC) Supreme Court on Monday on the eve of their trial for the killing of 75-year-old Malik, who was shot several times outside his family business on the morning of July 14, 2022.</p>

<p>Malik was shot dead in Surrey, British Columbia in 2022. He and co-accused Ajaib Singh Bagri were acquitted in 2005 of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings in 1985 that killed 331 people.</p>

<p>In the court in New Westminster on Monday, both Fox and Lopez pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of second-degree murder, the Global News reported.</p>

<p>The court heard an agreed statement of facts that revealed the two men had been hired to kill Malik, the report added.</p>

<p>"What we know from the agreed statement of facts is that there was some type of financial incentive that was involved in the commission of this crime, but in terms of any other specifics, it is another one of those situations where unfortunately it is just something that we as people on the outside will probably never know," Lopez' lawyer Gloria Ng told Global News.</p>

<p>"One of the things we certainly have in the forefront of our minds is the youth of our client - Lopez is a very young man and we are certainly hopeful with prospects for rehabilitation." In a statement, Malik's family described him as a "father, brother, husband and grandfather as well as a tireless community leader," the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Monday.</p>

<p>"While we are grateful that the shooters are being brought to justice, we know that nothing will erase the pain that we have gone through losing a family member in this way," the family said.</p>

<p>"However, the work is not complete. Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez were hired to commit this murder. Until the parties responsible for hiring them and directing this assassination are brought to justice, the work remains incomplete." The family called on the killers to "co-operate with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in bringing those that hired you to justice." Crown and defence lawyers have agreed that Fox and Lopez should not be eligible for parole for 20 years. And they will next appear in court on October 31 for sentencing.</p>

<p>The 1985 Air India bombing is among the worst terrorist attacks in Canadian history and in the history of the airline.</p>

<p>On June 23, 1985, Air India flight 182, carrying 329 people, including 268 Canadian citizens and 24 Indian citizens, flew from Toronto and stopped in Montreal from where it was en route to London and then onwards to its final destination Bombay.</p>

<p>The plane was flying 31,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean when a suitcase bomb exploded in the front cargo, killing all on board.</p>

<p>Another bomb was meant to be planted in an Air India flight scheduled to take off from Japan but it exploded at Tokyo's Narita airport killing two baggage handlers.</p>

<p>Inderjit Singh Reyat was convicted on various charges and spent 30 years in prison for helping to make the bombs, and for lying during trials, including Malik's. He was released in 2016 after serving two-thirds of his perjury sentence.</p>

<p>Reyat was the only person convicted for the Kanishka bombing.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a significant diplomatic breakthrough four years after the Galwan Valley clash, India and China have reached a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a significant breakthrough four years after the Galwan Valley clash, India and China have reached a patrolling arrangement along the Line of Actual Control.&nbsp;Shortly after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri announced this, adding that it can lower the tension between the neighbors, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said at NDTV World Summit that Indian and Chinese soldiers would be able to patrol the border area in the way they did before the May 2020 face-off.</p>

<p>Here's what this agreement means and why it's important</p>

<p><strong>De-escalation: </strong>The agreement signals a move towards de-escalation in a region where both countries have stationed tens of thousands of troops. Reversion to the patrolling norms of 2020 reduces the chances of skirmishes or escalation due to close military encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Stabilisation: </strong>This agreement helps stabilise the situation along the LAC by potentially reducing confrontations at friction points such as Depsang Plains and Demchok. Stability along LAC could foster a better environment for broader negotiations on boundary issues.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence-building</strong>: The resumption of patrolling as per pre-2020 terms is a confidence-building measure. It indicates a mutual willingness on both sides to return to a status quo that they found acceptable before the recent tensions. This also paves the way for further dialogue.</p>

<p><strong>Political Implications: </strong>The agreement might facilitate higher-level diplomatic interactions, like possible meetings between leaders at international forums, and enhance bilateral relations outside military confrontations. For India, this could mean better management of its border infrastructure development without an immediate threat of conflict. As for China, it may reflect a strategic choice to stabilise its border with India amid other global tensions.</p>

<p><strong>The Galwan Clash Backdrop</strong></p>

<p>In a major escalation along the Line of Control, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020. This incident was the first deadly confrontation in the region since 1975 and resulted in casualties on both sides. While 20 Indian soldiers died in the clash, there are varying claims regarding the number of Chinese casualties. Border infrastructure developments and differing perceptions of the LAC had triggered the clash.&nbsp;Following the clash, both sides engaged in de-escalation talks amid heightened tensions in bilateral ties.</p>

<p><strong>The Other Friction Points</strong></p>

<p>Besides Galwan, there are at least four other friction points along the Line of Actual Control. These are all disputed areas where Indian and Chinese soldiers fought in the 1962 war.</p>

<p><strong>Demchok: </strong>Demchok is split by the LAC. India controls the western part. The eastern side is under the control of China, which also claims the western part. The dispute hinges on historical treaties and the precise alignment of the LAC along the Charding Nullah. Recent talks aim at disengagement.</p>

<p><strong>Pangong: </strong>About 50 per cent of Pangong Lake area is in Tibet (under Chinese control), 40 per cent in Ladakh and 10 per cent is disputed. Discrepancies in LAC perceptions lead to military standoffs and buffer zones, with ongoing construction and strategic positioning reflecting the tensions and claims by both nations.</p>

<p><strong>Hot Springs: </strong>Located near Gogra Post, the Hot Springs area is significant for India due to its strategic location which facilitates surveillance over LAC. India's control over this region enhances its defence posture, providing vantage points for monitoring movements in Aksai Chin, thus playing a crucial role in border security dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Depsang: </strong>Depsang plains are critical for India due to their strategic access to the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) airstrip and the Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road. Control over Depsang prevents Chinese forces from threatening these vital logistics lines, making it essential for India's northern border defence and military mobility.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin couple's heartfelt interaction with former US President Donald Trump is going viral on social media. The Republican presidential candidate on Sunday visited a McDonald's and served french fries while he was campaigning in Pennsylvania. He wore a black-and-yellow apron over his white shirt and red tie as he served fries and interacted with customers. It was while working at the takeout counter that he was greeted with a cheerful "namaste" by an energised Indian-origin couple. As the former president handed the Indian national his order, the excited customer exclaimed, "Thank you, Mr. President!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You made it possible for ordinary people like us to be here," the Indian-origin man told Mr Trump. He continued to express gratitude and repeatedly called Mr Trump "Mr President". At the end, the lady sitting next to the man also quipped, "Thank you for taking the bullet for us".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing the video on X, user Hodge Twins wrote, "Listen to this Indian dude that pulls up. All Americans love Trump."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video surfaced on social media on Sunday. Since then, the clip has accumulated nearly 8 million views.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reacting to the video, one user wrote, "That man and his wife are so genuine; they will remember this forever." "This is so sweet and so precious, It just makes me tear up," expressed another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love this so much. I'm sure it was obvious when they got in the drive through something was going on. But can you even imagine pulling up to see Trump giving you your food. Really brings a smile even to me on the other end of this screen," commented a third.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump's McDonald's stunt was intended as a jibe at Kamala Harris, who has often talked about working at the fast-food chain in her youth. Taking a swipe at Ms Harris, who turned 60 on Sunday, he said he is running against somebody who said she worked at Mcdonald's, but it turned out to be a "phoney story". "I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala" at McDonald's, he said.</p>

<p>In response, Kamala Harris's spokesperson,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-tries-troll-harris-serving-french-fries-mcdonalds-rcna176294"> Joseph Costello</a>, remarked that Mr Trump's trip to the fast-food restaurant highlighted what a second term under him would entail: "taking advantage of workers for his own benefit."</p>

<p>"When Trump feels desperate, all he knows how to do is lie. He can't understand what it's like to have a summer job because he was handed millions on a silver platter, only to blow it," said Ian Sam, spokesperson for Ms Harris' campaign.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Washington state have taken a 15-year-old boy into custody in connection with a fatal shooting that claimed the lives of five people at a home near Seattle.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred early Monday morning in Fall City, located east of Seattle after multiple 911 calls were made reporting the incident, according to a police spokesperson.</p>

<p>King County Sheriff's Office spokesperson, Mike Mellis, said during a media briefing on Monday afternoon that officers discovered five bodies upon entering the residence. The victims included two adults and three teenagers, though their identities have not yet been released.</p>

<p>The police swiftly arrested one teenage suspect, while another person who was injured was transported to a hospital for medical treatment. The department noted that a neighbour had administered first aid before emergency responders arrived.</p>

<p>"Once we recovered the bodies, we knew this was a hugely significant crime scene," Mellis said.</p>

<p>The police also revealed that the victims were members of the same family, though it remains unconfirmed whether all of them were directly related. The Sheriff's Office is continuing its investigation to determine a motive for the attack.</p>

<p>The teenage suspect is currently being held at King County's juvenile detention facility. According to Mellis, the teen is expected to appear in court for an initial hearing on Tuesday or Wednesday, as confirmed by the county Prosecuting Attorney's Office.</p>

<p>Incidents of teen shootings have been on the rise in the US. Recently, a 14-year-old boy was charged with murder for fatally shooting four people, including two students and two teachers, at Apalachee High School in Georgia.</p>

<p>While polls indicate that a majority of Americans support stricter regulations on firearm purchases and usage, efforts to impose additional restrictions continue to face strong opposition from powerful gun ownership lobby groups, and legislative action has repeatedly stalled.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein has been diagnosed with a form of bone marrow cancer, US media reported Monday, a month after he was indicted on a new sex crime charge. Weinstein, 72, has chronic myeloid leukemia and is undergoing treatment in a New York prison, according to NBC News and ABC News, citing sources.</p>

<p>His diagnosis comes after a string of health issues for the once powerful entertainment mogul, who appeared pale and visibly frail during a brief court appearance in September.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He underwent emergency heart surgery last month, after which his representative said he was "out of danger at the moment."</p>

<p>Weinstein is serving a 16-year prison sentence after being convicted on rape charges in California.</p>

<p>He was also convicted in New York in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of an actress and of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to 23 years in prison in that case.</p>

<p>However, a New York appeals court overturned the verdict in April, ruling that the trial judge had allowed testimony in error from accusers who were not directly involved with the charges facing Weinstein.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A retrial in the case had been aimed for November, though prosecutors had deemed that "unrealistic."</p>

<p>Allegations against Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement in 2017, a watershed moment for women fighting sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>More than 80 women accused him of harassment, sexual assault or rape, including prominent actors Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd.</p>

<p>Weinstein has claimed any sexual relations in question were consensual.</p>

<p>In 1979, Weinstein and his brother Bob co-founded prominent Hollywood film studio Miramax Films.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their hits included 1994's "Pulp Fiction" and 1998's "Shakespeare in Love," for which Weinstein shared a best picture Oscar.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India values close cooperation within BRICS which has emerged as an important platform for dialogue and discussion on a range of key issues concerning global developmental agenda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>PM Modi made comments in a statement before embarking on a two-day visit to the Russian city of Kazan to attend the 16th summit of the BRICS grouping.</p>

<p>"The expansion of BRICS with the addition of new members last year has added to its inclusivity and agenda for the global good," he said.</p>

<p>Being hosted by Russia, the summit is being seen as an attempt by non-Western powers to project their clout amid the conflict in Ukraine and the escalating situation in West Asia.</p>

<p>PM Modi is set hold a series of bilateral meetings including with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the margins of the BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa).</p>

<p>It will be the first summit of the grouping after it was expanded at its summit in Johannesburg last year.</p>

<p>"India values the close cooperation within BRICS which has emerged as an important platform for dialogue and discussion on issues concerning the global developmental agenda, reformed multilateralism, climate change, economic cooperation, building resilient supply chains, promoting cultural and people to people connect, among others," PM Modi said in his departure statement.</p>

<p>PM Modi said his visit to Kazan will further reinforce the 'Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership' between India and Russia.</p>

<p>The prime minister visited Moscow in July during which he held summit talks with President Putin.</p>

<p>"Building upon the annual summit held in July 2024 in Moscow, my visit to Kazan will further reinforce the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>"I look forward to meeting other leaders from BRICS as well," he said.</p>

<p>In a post on 'X', PM Modi said he was looking forward to extensive discussions on a wide range of subjects at the summit.</p>

<p>The BRIC, as a formal grouping, started after the meeting of the leaders of Russia, India and China in St. Petersburg in 2006. It was agreed to expand BRIC into BRICS with the inclusion of South Africa in 2010.</p>

<p>Last year's expansion was the first such exercise since 2010. The new members included Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>36-year-old Italian surfer Giulia Manfrini has died after being fatally impaled by a swordfish during a freak incident in Indonesia. According to <em>ABC Australia</em>, Ms Manfrini was surfing at a popular surf break off the West Coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, when the accident occurred. She was fatally injured after a swordfish speared her in the chest while she surfed in the waters off Ombak Bengbeng, near Masokut Island. She reportedly had a 5cm deep stab wound on the left side of her chest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Manfrini, a surf coach and founder of the surf travel agency AWAVE, was well-known in the local surfing community, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-21/surfer-killed-by-swordfish-off-sumatra-indonesia/104498760">outlet </a>reported. Lahmudin Siregar, acting head of the Mentawai Islands' Disaster Management Agency, said the swordfish "unexpectedly jumped towards Manfrini and pierced her chest".</p>

<p>Separately, James Colston, Co-Founder of AWAVE Travel said Ms Manfrini "touched countless people within the surf world" both in Europe and worldwide. "Her kindness, care and positivity were remembered by all that met her and she will be dearly missed," he said.</p>

<p>Frankie Smithurst, from surf charter operator Naga Laut Mentawai Blue, said she would be remembered for her "overflowing excitement for life". "Giulia will be forever known by her huge heart which matched her huge smile, an extremely selfless person who truly loved life," he told the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of the incident, two of Ms Manfrini's friends were nearby. They provided first aid and rushed her to a nearby health care centre, but she could not be saved despite their efforts.

<p>Following the news of her demise, Fabio Giulivi, the mayor of Venaria Reale, Ms Manfrini's hometown, expressed the community's sorrow over her tragic death in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/fabiogiulivisindaco/posts/pfbid037c1RhyaJDYwNXT1Grw53YdeufyhJgkcZDaUTcr7L9w5tqb172wjaYZM5yeSUndfdl">Facebook post</a>, noting the support for her grieving family.</p>

<p>"Giulia, just 36 years old and from Venaria, had long pursued her twin dreams: her love of surfing and opening a travel agency for sports holidays," he wrote. "The news of her death has left us all in shock and makes us feel powerless in the face of such a devastating tragedy that took her life far too soon," he added.&nbsp;</p>

We can only say how much she got out of her short life, and she filled it completely," her former volleyball coach wrote.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the election draws closer, Kamala Harris has been sharpening her attacks on Donald Trump's fitness for office, often calling him "unstable" or "unhinged".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, delivered radically different messages on the US campaign trail on Monday as they sought to win over undecided voters in the two weeks before Election Day.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris, campaigning alongside Republican former lawmaker Liz Cheney, attempted to convince conservative, suburban women in three Midwestern battleground states that former President Trump was a threat to abortion rights, national security and democracy.</p>

<p>As the election draws closer, Harris has been sharpening her attacks on Trump's fitness for office, often calling him "unstable" or "unhinged" and questioning his temperament.</p>

<p>"In many, many ways Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious," Harris, 60, said at an event in Malvern, Pennsylvania, one of seven battleground states expected to decide the winner of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, frequently rejects any notion that he is a threat to democracy, arguing it is Democrats who are the real threat because of the criminal investigations he and his allies have faced for their attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss.</p>

<p>While Harris was suggesting Trump was unfit for office, the former president was questioning the Biden administration's competence.</p>

<p>During one of several stops on Monday in ultra-competitive North Carolina, Trump urged supporters in the hurricane-battered mountains to go to the polls despite the hardships they were facing.</p>

<p>He also renewed his criticisms of the emergency management agency FEMA and sought to relate to working-class supporters by praising his nonstop efforts on his own behalf.</p>

<p>"I've done 52 days without a day off, which a lot of these people would respect," Trump said at a lectern backed by rubble from massive floods that hit the area last month.</p>

<p>With opinion polls showing a close race, the two candidates are picking up the pace, their frenzied campaign schedules underlining the importance of small pockets of voters that could put either candidate over the top.</p>

<h3><strong>God and Conscience</strong></h3>

<p>Trump ended his day at an evangelical Christian event in Concord, North Carolina, telling a crowd he likes to think that during the failed assassination attempt against him on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, he was saved by being "knocked to the ground by a supernatural hand."</p>

<p>In his remarks, he avoided using some of the off-color rhetoric he has been using in recent speeches. He said as he looks back on his life, "I now recognize that it's been the hand of God leading me to where I am today."</p>

<p>Evangelical leader Franklin Graham offered a prayer that Trump be elected.</p>

<p>"Rallies and positive poll numbers are not going to win this election," Graham said. "It's going to be God."</p>

<p>Trump's visit to North Carolina coincided with concerns among his Republican allies that crippling damage from storm Helene will depress turnout in the battleground state's conservative mountain regions.</p>

<p>The area hit hardest by Helene is deeply Republican. Trump won about 62% of the vote in 2020 in the 25 counties declared to be a disaster area after Helene, while Biden won about 51% in the remainder of the state, according to a Reuters analysis.</p>

<p>"Obviously, we want them to vote but we want them to live and survive and be happy and healthy, because this is really a tragedy," Trump said at a campaign stop in Swannanoa, population 5,300, after touring areas destroyed by the storm.</p>

<p>At an event with Harris in Royal Oak, Michigan, Cheney sought to give Republicans who are on the fence permission to support the Democrat without worry of reprisal.</p>

<p>"I certainly have many Republicans who will say to me, 'I can't be public.' They do worry about a whole range of things, including violence, but they'll do the right thing," Cheney said. "And I would just remind people, if you're at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody."</p>

<p>Later, in Brookfield, Wisconsin, Cheney described herself as "pro-life" but said she was troubled by state abortion restrictions that had prevented women from getting the care they needed.</p>

<p>Cheney and her father Dick Cheney, who was vice president under President George W. Bush and is still vilified by many Democrats for his defense of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, are staunch conservatives and two of the most prominent Republicans to have endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday, Trump called Liz Cheney "dumb as a rock" and a "war hawk." He accused her of wanting to go to war with "every Muslim country known to mankind" just like her father, who he called "the man that ridiculously pushed Bush to go to war in the Middle East."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said Monday that the latest commander responsible for funding the Lebanese Hezbollah group was "eliminated" in Syria. The man, whose name was not released, headed the Iran-backed Hezbollah's Unit 4400 that is "responsible for the transfers and the amount of funds" to the group through Tehran's oil sales, army spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement.</p>

<p>The commander was "eliminated" in Syria "a few hours ago", he added.</p>

<p>The unit was previously led by Mohammed Jafar Ksir, also known as Sheikh Salah, Hagari said.</p>

<p>"He managed the terrorist organisation's main source of income for years, until we eliminated him in a targeted attack on the capital (Beirut) in early October," he said.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday, Syria's defence ministry announced the death of two people in a strike attributed to Israel and targeting a car in Damascus.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that a strike targeted a non-Syrian man who was driving his car in a neighbourhood where a memorial was being held for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israel last week in Gaza.</p>

<p>Unit 4400 is charged with transporting Iranian oil to Syria, which is then sold in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Its value "is about tens of millions of dollars", Hagari said.</p>

<p>Hamas ally Hezbollah has been firing rockets daily into northern Israel in support of the Palestinian Islamist movement since the war was triggered by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Israel, which has been conducting a ground offensive for nearly a month to push Hezbollah from its northern border, has in recent days ramped up its drive to hit the Iranian-backed group's finances.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past week, an alarming extortion scam has targeted 59 Hong Kong residents, including four women, resulting in losses exceeding HK$1.9 million (US$244,430), <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3282979/naked-chat-blackmail-4-women-among-59-hongkongers-duped-undressing-during-video-chats">South China Morning Post</a></em> reported. According to the police, who revealed the figures on their CyberDefender Facebook page, the scam typically involves extortionists - often women - luring male victims into undressing during video chats and then secretly recording the acts.</p>

<p>The scammers then use the footage to coerce victims into payment by threatening to share the videos online or with their relatives and friends. In some cases, scammers also pose as charming, high-income, educated men to target women on social media. They use flattery and sweet talk to gain trust, manipulating victims by learning about their personal interests and lives.</p>

<p>''They use sweet talk to learn about the victims' personal lives and interests to manipulate them. In the past week, police received 59 cases of naked-chat blackmail, with scammers extorting more than HK$1.9 million. Four cases involved female victims,'' the force said.</p>

<p>In the first half of this year, students comprised 20% of the 1,102 victims, with fraudsters pocketing over HK$31 million. Comparing year-over-year data, reports of "naked-chat blackmail" surged 50% from 1,402 in 2022 to 2,117 in 2023, while losses doubled from HK$22 million to HK$44 million.</p>

<p>Moreover, deception cases in Hong Kong have increased by 12% from 21,798 to 24,407 between January and July this year. Losses skyrocketed 50% to HK$5.14 billion during the same period. Law enforcement responded by arresting over 6,000 suspects linked to scams and related activities this year.</p>

<p>The police are now cautioning citizens to exercise vigilance when meeting people online. They emphasise the importance of verifying identities and profiles, avoiding intimate activities on video chats, and reporting suspicious activities immediately.</p>

<p>Recently, a few Hong Kong men fell prey to a romance scam that used deepfake artificial intelligence to lure its victims into parting with more than $46 million. As per CNN, the suspects aged 21 to 34, were mostly well-educated, with many of them digital media and technology graduates allegedly recruited by the gang after attending local universities.&nbsp;The suspects allegedly worked with IT specialists overseas to build a fake cryptocurrency platform, where the victims were coerced to make investments, police said.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British pop star and former One Direction member Liam Payne had a toxic mixture of drugs in his system at the time of his death in Argentina last week, <em>ABC News </em>reported, citing a toxicology report. The 31-year-old died on October 16 following a fall from the third-floor balcony of his hotel room at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina. &nbsp;Now, a toxicology report revealed that he had "multiple substances in his system" at the time of his death, including a drug known as "pink cocaine".&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to pink cocaine - a recreational drug that contains a combination of methamphetamine, ketamine and ecstasy - the drugs detected in Payne's bloodstream included benzodiazepine, crack, and cocaine. The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/liam-payne-partial-autopsy-report-multiple-substances/story?id=114985701" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet </a>said that a makeshift aluminium pipe for ingesting the substances was also found nearby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to witnesses, Payne was acting erratically in the hours before his death. Emergency services were called to the hotel after staff frantically described him as "an aggressive man overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol." Upon entering his hotel room, authorities discovered a chaotic scene, &nbsp;with broken items and various drugs scattered throughout.</p>

<p>Forensic teams also recovered a whiskey bottle, lighter, and cell phone from the courtyard where his body was located. Investigators noted that the absence of defensive injuries suggested he may have been in a state of semi-consciousness or complete unconsciousness when he fell.</p>

<p>Notably, Payne had previously entered rehab multiple times and also had expressed suicidal thoughts during his career. He was reportedly also battling significant drug addiction leading up to his death. The investigation into the circumstances surrounding his passing is ongoing.</p>

<p>Payne's girlfriend, Kate Cassidy, had reportedly been with him for a couple's respite in Argentina, however, she returned to Florida two days before his tragic death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a joint statement, Payne's former bandmates expressed their devastation over his passing, emphasising their cherished memories of him and calling for privacy as they grieve. "In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly," they said. They also stated that their thoughts were with the English singer's family, friends and fans.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli woman who survived Hamas' attack on the Supernova music festival on October 7 last year has died by suicide after suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, reports said.</p>

<p>Shirel Golan, the youngest of five siblings, took her life in her apartment on her 22nd birthday on Sunday.</p>

<p>Her family blamed Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hits-hezbollah-intelligence-hq-hamas-in-gaza-after-drone-launched-at-benjamin-netanyahu-home-6831469" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government</a> for turning a blind eye to Hamas attack survivors.</p>

<p>"I saw that she had symptoms of post-traumatic stress, such as withdrawing and distancing herself from her friends. I asked her to take care of herself. She said that she doesn't get any help from the state," her brother, Eyal, was quoted as saying by Hebrew media, the Times of Israel reported.</p>

<p>"She said that she doesn't get any help from the state. She said that she only gets aid from the [Tribe of Nova Community Association]," he said.</p>

<p>"If the state had taken care of her, none of this would have happened," he added.</p>

<p>After the Hamas attack, she was also hospitalized twice, but was never recognized as a PTSD sufferer, her family said.</p>

<h3><strong>How She Escaped Hamas Attack</strong></h3>

<p>Shirel Golan and her partner, Adi, were among the thousands of people who managed to flee the music festival as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-israeli-woman-may-hayat-survived-hamas-attack-by-smearing-blood-on-face-playing-dead-4556108" target="_blank">Hamas attacked attendees</a> on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>According to reports, the couple initially made it to a vehicle and tried to drive out of the area, but abandoned the car once they thought they could not escape.</p>

<p>They then hid under a bush for hours until they were eventually found by a police officer.</p>

<p>While hiding, the pair reportedly narrowly avoided getting in another car whose occupants were all killed or kidnapped by Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed more than 44,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>Israel believes that 63 hostages, including two children, are still alive, while 34 are confirmed dead but remain in Gaza.</p>

<p>For Hamas, which rules Gaza, the hostages are key bargaining chips in negotiations with Israel aiming to secure a truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners.</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's Foreign Ministry blasted UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday for what it said was his acceptance of an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin to a BRICS summit, while staying away from a "peace summit" on the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The UN Secretary-General declined Ukraine's invitation to the first Global Peace Summit in Switzerland," the ministry said in a post on the X social media platform.</p>

<p>"He did, however, accept the invitation to Kazan from war criminal Putin. This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace. It only damages the UN's reputation."</p>

<p>Putin hosts a summit of BRICS nations in the central Russian city of Kazan from Tuesday, aimed at showcasing the clout of non-Western countries. Leaders attending include Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman earlier this month said Guterres had told Minister Sergei Lavrov at the UN General Assembly last month that he intended to go to Kazan.</p>

<p>But deputy UN spokesperson Farham Haq, when asked on Monday if Guterres would attend, said: "Announcements on his future travels will be later on down the line."</p>

<p>The peace summit in a Swiss mountain resort in June, which brought together more than 90 countries, denounced Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sought a way to end the conflict, though Russia was not invited and dismissed it as meaningless.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Voldoymyr Zelenskiy says he wants to stage a second summit by the end of the year, but Russia has said it has no intention of attending.</p>

<p>Guterres said at the time he would not attend the Swiiss-organised meeting, though the U.N. was represented.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Monday said it has declassified intelligence which claims the presence of a secret Hezbollah financial hub beneath a Beirut hospital. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the bunker contained hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold, allegedly used to fund the group's operations.</p>

<p>This disclosure followed a series of targeted airstrikes conducted by the Israeli Air Force on Sunday night, aimed at Hezbollah's financial assets. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari provided detailed information during a televised briefing, stating, "Tonight, I am going to declassify intelligence on a site that we did not strike-where Hezbollah has millions of dollars in gold and cash in Hassan Nasrallah's bunker. The bunker is located directly under Al-Sahel Hospital in the heart of Beirut."</p>

— Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1848436265143677104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Hagari said that the site had not been struck yet, despite the alleged presence of significant financial resources. "According to estimates, there is at least half a billion dollars in dollar bills and gold stored in this bunker. This money could and still can be used to rebuild the state of Lebanon," he said.</p>

<p>Sunday night's airstrikes targeted nearly 30 Hezbollah-linked locations, including sites operated by Al-Qard Al-Hassan (AQAH), a financial firm linked to Hezbollah. AQAH, though registered as a charity, has been accused by both Israel and the United States of serving as a critical financial arm of Hezbollah, facilitating its access to cash and gold reserves for military purposes.</p>

<p>Hagari claimed that one of the key targets was an underground vault containing tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold, resources that were allegedly being used to fund attacks on Israel. While Hagari did not clarify whether all the funds were destroyed in the strike, he said that further airstrikes could be expected, particularly targeting additional financial hubs.</p>

<p>The strikes followed an intensified Israeli effort to disrupt Hezbollah's finances. According to IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, the campaign involved over 300 strikes on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon over a 24-hour period, including critical financial and logistical hubs.</p>

<p>Al-Qard Al-Hassan has operated in Lebanon since the 1980s, providing credit to Lebanese citizens in exchange for gold deposits. While officially classified as a charity, Israeli and US officials argue that the firm is a critical asset in Hezbollah's financial network, enabling the group to launder money and finance its activities under the guise of civilian banking.</p>

<p>The Lebanese people and the Iranian regime are Hezbollah's two main sources of income, Hagari claimed. He alleged that the financial mechanisms used by the group, which include cash transfers through Syria and gold smuggled into Lebanon via Iran. Factories operated by Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Turkey are allegedly used to generate substantial income to support the group's terror activities, according to IDF intelligence.</p>

<p>In a related development, Israel carried out an airstrike on Monday in Syria, targeting the head of Hezbollah's financial unit, known as Unit 4400. The unit is responsible for the flow of Iranian funds to Hezbollah, primarily through proceeds from Tehran's oil sales. The unnamed commander, who had only been in the role for a few weeks, was killed in the strike, according to Hagari.</p>

<p>This marks the second significant assassination of a Hezbollah financial figure in recent weeks. In early October, Israeli forces killed Mohammed Jafar Ksir, also known as Sheikh Salah, the previous head of Hezbollah's financial operations. Ksir had long overseen the group's revenue streams, which have been integral to its military and political influence in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The latest Israeli operations came amid an escalation in hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, which have been ongoing since Hezbollah launched a series of attacks in solidarity with Hamas following the October 7 attacks in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israeli officials estimate that approximately 2,000 Hezbollah fighters have been killed since the conflict widened in late September 2023. Hezbollah has retaliated with rocket attacks on Israeli towns and military positions, including a recent barrage aimed at an intelligence base near Tel Aviv.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who is currently in federal custody following multiple charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, has now been accused of raping a 13-year-old girl with the help of two other celebrities at a 2000 MTV Video Music Awards afterparty. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, a 37-year-old woman filed a lawsuit in New York federal court on Sunday in which she claimed that the incident occurred after she went to an empty bedroom to lie down for a moment because she felt "woozy and lightheaded" from a drink she had during the bash on September 7, 2000. She said that at the party she was raped by an unnamed male celebrity, while an unnamed female celebrity watched before Combs raped her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Combs aggressively approached Plaintiff with a crazed look in his eyes, grabbed her and said, 'You are ready to party!'" the lawsuit states, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/21/celebrity-news/sean-diddy-combs-accused-of-raping-teen-with-celebs-at-vmas/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Post</em></a>. He then allegedly "threw" the girl, identified as Jane Doe in the court documents, toward another male celebrity, referred to as Celebrity A, who proceeded to remove the teen's clothing as she became "more and more disoriented".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Plaintiff was held down by Celebrity A who vaginally raped her while Combs and Celebrity B, a female, watched," the lawsuit claims. "After the male celebrity finished, Combs then vaginally raped Plaintiff while Celebrity A and Celebrity B watched," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit also alleged that the music mogul attempted to force the victim to perform oral sex on him, but she resisted by hitting him in the neck, so he stopped. She then escaped the room and had her father pick her up from the party. "After the assault, Plaintiff fell into a deep depression which continues to affect every facet of her life," the lawsuit states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plaintiffs are not named in the court papers, but they are described as two men and three women, including the one who was 13 at the time of the alleged VMAs rape. One of the men and three women also accused Combs of drugging them. While one of the male accusers claimed he was drugged and sexually assaulted by both Combs and an unnamed celebrity, the other male accuser said Combs groped him at a Ciroc Vodka party in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Notably, Combs has denied all the charges against him. He is currently being held behind bars at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center after being denied bail.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran on Monday warned the United States would bear "full responsibility" in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US President Joe Biden indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so.</p>

<p>Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden's remarks "profoundly alarming and provocative" in a letter addressed to United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and the Swiss presidency of the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>The US president responded "yes and yes" when asked Friday by a reporter if he had "a good understanding right now" of how and when Israel would respond to Iran's missile barrage on October 1.</p>

<p>Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders belonging to Hamas and Hezbollah, and an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general.</p>

<p>US ally Israel, at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, vowed revenge against Iran for the strikes.</p>

<p>"This inflammatory statement (of Biden) is deeply concerning, as it indicates the United States' tacit approval and explicit support for Israel's unlawful military aggression against Iran," Iravani wrote in the letter.</p>

<p>"Therefore, the United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter," he said.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Biden that he intends to strike Iran's military sites, and not to target nuclear or oil infrastructure.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken left for the Middle East Monday on a new push for an elusive Gaza ceasefire two weeks before US elections, seeing a new opportunity from Israel's killing of Hamas's leader.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken left for the Middle East Monday on a new push for an elusive Gaza ceasefire two weeks before US elections, seeing a new opportunity from Israel's killing of Hamas's leader.</p>

<p>It will be the 11th trip to the Middle East by the top US diplomat since war broke out a year ago, with Blinken on his last visit to Israel in August warning it may have been the "last chance" for a US-led ceasefire plan.</p>

<p>That push did not succeed, and the conflict has escalated and expanded since then, with Israel pounding Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and warning of a new strike directly on Iran, whose clerical leaders back both Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, who personally laid out the ceasefire plan on May 31 that would also free hostages from Gaza, has seen new hope since Israel last week killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar.</p>

<p>Biden, speaking to reporters on a visit to Germany, said he called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him and tell him that Blinken would head to the region.</p>

<p>"I told him that we were really pleased with his actions and, further, that now is the time to move on -- move on, move towards a ceasefire," Biden said Thursday.</p>

<p>The Gaza war was sparked by the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel last year that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza has killed 42,603 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, figures the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>Last month, Israel expanded its military operations to Lebanon, where at least 1,470 people have been killed since then, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Blinken's trip comes days after he and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that the United States could withhold some of its billions of dollars in military aid unless more humanitarian assistance is allowed into Gaza, where the UN warns more than 1.8 million people are facing extreme hunger.</p>

<p>- US election implications -</p>

<p>A breakthrough could be a major boost for US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running in a razor-tight November 5 race for the White House against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The war has been a political albatross for Biden and to an extent Harris, his political heir, with Netanyahu repeatedly brushing aside US entreaties to do more to spare civilians.</p>

<p>Trump also spoke to Netanyahu about Sinwar's killing, with the Republican saying that the Israeli leader was proven right in ignoring Biden's pressure to dial back military operations.</p>

<p>Trump suggested he would give freer rein to Netanyahu, telling reporters that Biden was "trying to hold him back and he probably should be doing the opposite."</p>

<p>Trump staunchly backed Israel in his first term. He has a complicated relationship with Netanyahu but Republican voters, unlike Democrats, are overwhelmingly supportive of Israel and Netanyahu.</p>

<p><strong>- Seeing ways forward -</strong></p>

<p>Blinken flies first to Israel and then will tour other countries in the Middle East through Friday.</p>

<p>An official on the plane with him said Blinken will visit Jordan on Wednesday and discuss humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The State Department did not list his other stops but on previous trips Blinken has visited a number of Arab countries, especially Qatar and Egypt, the key intermediaries in ceasefire negotiations.</p>

<p>Blinken "will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people," a State Department statement said.</p>

<p>It said Blinken would also discuss post-war arrangements critical for a peace deal and seek a "diplomatic resolution" in Lebanon, where the United States has stopped short of urging an immediate ceasefire.</p>

<p>Blinken has also sought to coax Netanyahu into compromise by dangling the prospect of normalization with Saudi Arabia -- which would be a historic game-changer in Israel's quest for acceptance, as the kingdom is the guardian of Islam's two holiest sites.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, leading the most right-wing coalition in Israeli history, has called Sinwar's death "the beginning of the end" of the Gaza war but faces calls from his base to keep up military operations in Gaza, which has already largely been reduced to rubble.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eighty-five Indian nationals have been discharged from the Russian military so far and efforts are on to secure the release of 20 more Indians, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on Monday.</p>

<p>The Indian side is expected to take up the issue of discharge of the remaining Indians when Prime Minister Narendra Modi holds a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday on the margins of the BRICS Summit in the Russian city of Kazan, people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>PM Modi had strongly raised the issue of early discharge of the Indian nationals working in the Russian Army during his talks with Putin in Moscow in July.</p>

<p>The Indian side is in "very close touch" with interlocutors in the foreign and defence ministries of Russia on the issue of Indians "who were, illegally or otherwise, contracted into fighting in the Russian Army", Mr Misri said at a media briefing on PM Modi's visit to Russia for the BRICS Summit.</p>

<p>The prime minister will leave for Kazan on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>"Our understanding, at the present moment, as per present information, is that about 85 people have returned from Russia. Unfortunately, we have also had the return of some mortal remains of people who lost their lives during the conflict," Mr Misri said.</p>

<p>"Our understanding is that nearly 20 people still remain (in the Russian Army) and we are pressing our interlocutors for an early discharge of all remaining Indians in the armed forces there," he said.</p>

<p>Nine Indians have died while serving in the Russian Army, according to official data.</p>

<p>In August, the Russian embassy said Moscow and New Delhi are working in close coordination for an early "identification and discharge" of the Indian nationals who voluntarily joined contractual work in the military service and now want to return home.</p>

<p>Since April, the ministry of defence of the Russian Federation has stopped recruiting citizens of a number of foreign countries, including India, into the military service, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon said four people including a child were killed Monday in Israeli air strikes near the country's biggest public hospital close to south Beirut, with state media reporting over a dozen raids.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy strike near the Hariri Hospital killed, in a preliminary toll, four people, including a child, and injured 24," the health ministry said, adding it had caused "significant damage to the hospital".</p>

<p>In a separate statement, the ministry said the strike hit the entrance to the hospital, "which is still operating and receives a large number of patients".</p>

<p>It denied claims by the Israeli army that Hezbollah had stored half a billion dollars under the Sahel hospital in south Beirut.</p>

<p>Lebanon's National News Agency reported at least three Israeli strikes on the Ouzai district of south Beirut.</p>

<p>While most districts of Beirut's southern suburbs had been emptied for almost a month, the densely-packed residential area of Ouzai was still filled with people because it had never been targeted before.</p>

<p><strong>- 'No room for escape' -</strong></p>

<p>The NNA reported more than a dozen strikes on various south Beirut districts including Haret Hreik, just south of Ouzai, and Hadath.</p>

<p>Hezbollah-affiliated rescuers told AFP they were looking for survivors amid the devastation in Ouzai, adding that the evacuation order, then the strike, caused "panic among residents" who "started to run in the streets".</p>

<p>"They did not leave any room for people to escape. The strike came closely after the warning," one said.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security official told AFP that the country's national airline had to switch landing strips after Israeli strikes near Beirut's only international airport hit close to the main runway.</p>

<p>"Middle East Airlines switched the runway it was using because the main runway is close to the site of the Ouzai strike," the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed plumes of smoke rising from Beirut's southern suburbs, with AFP correspondents also hearing several loud bangs before the strikes.</p>

<p>The footage also showed two strikes that caused a huge fire, with black smoke surrounding dissipating orange flames.</p>

<p>Just prior to the strikes, the Israeli military called on residents to leave parts of southern Beirut, in their latest such appeal.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Avichay Adraee posted the new call on social media indicating several locations to be evacuated, including an area close to Beirut airport.</p>

<p>"You are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah that the IDF will work against in the near future," he wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

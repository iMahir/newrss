       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's presidential election victory has brought a cultural reset it seems. US Men's National Team (USMNT) forward Christian Pulisic was seen celebrating his goal against Jamaica on Monday (Nov 18) by doing the 'Trump Dance' - a signature move popularised by the Republican leader during the election campaigning trail. Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighter Jon Jones performed a similar move last week after defeating Stipe Miocic by technical knockout, with President-elect Trump present ringside at the Madison Square Garden, alongside his coterie of soon-to-be-inaugurated cabinet leaders.</p>

<p>Netizens have been celebrating the dance move, claiming that it was a significant moment in US history, which had been dominated by identity politics and a rampant cancel culture.</p>

<p>"We have officially taken back the culture. Everyone is doing the Trump dance now," said one user, while another added: "Trump started a movement with YMCA dance as people love just having fun, except liberals! Lol."</p>

<h3><strong>What is the 'Trump Dance'?</strong></h3>

<p>The trendy move stems from an awkward mishmash of steps performed by Trump during the election to the tune of YMCA song, produced by the American disco group, Village People.</p>

<p>The influence of Trump Dance has not been limited to the USA. England's Charley Hull was recently seen performing the move during her final showdown with Nelly Korda at the Annika tournament held at Pelican Golf Club.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday signed a decree broadening the scope of when Moscow can use nuclear weapons in a clear message to the West and Ukraine.</p>

<p>The move comes on the 1,000th day of Russia's offensive on Ukraine and after the United States gave Kyiv permission to use long-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia.</p>

<p>The new doctrine outlines that Russia will consider using nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state if they are supported by nuclear powers.</p>

<p>"Aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state is considered as a joint attack," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday -- a clear reference to Ukraine and its Western backers.</p>

<p>"It was necessary to bring our principles in line with the current situation," Peskov added, calling the update a "very important" document that should be "studied" abroad.</p>

<p>Russia "has always viewed nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence," he said, adding that they would only be deployed if Russia felt "forced" to respond.</p>

<p>Putin has issued a string of nuclear threats throughout the almost three-year campaign against Ukraine, triggering concern in the West over rhetoric it has slammed as reckless.</p>

<p>The new doctrine also allows Moscow to unleash a nuclear response in the event of a "massive" air attack, even if it only uses conventional weapons.</p>

<p>When the Kremlin first unveiled the proposed changes in September, Peskov called it a "warning" against anybody who was thinking about participating "in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear".</p>

<p>Moscow's nuclear umbrella will also be extended to its close ally Belarus under the new doctrine.</p>

<p>Speaking on the 1,000th day of the conflict, Peskov said the "collective West" had unleashed a "war" against Russia, pledging that Moscow would see what it calls its "special military operation" through to the end.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A devastating incident occurred in southern Gaza on Saturday, where nearly 100 aid trucks were "violently looted", with 97 out of 109 trucks carrying food supplies for UNRWA and the World Food Programme being "lost" in the looting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been described by UNRWA as "one of the worst" incidents of its kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The drivers were forced to unload the trucks at gunpoint, aid workers were injured, and vehicles were extensively damaged.</p>

<p>The perpetrators of the looting remain unidentified, but UNRWA blames the "collapse of law and order" and the "approach of the Israeli authorities" for creating a perilous environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Well, we have been warning for a long time about the total breakdown of civil order; (until) four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoys. This has completely gone," Lazzarini told a press conference in Geneva on Monday.</p>

<p>This incident comes amid warnings from the UN that severe food and aid shortages in Gaza will worsen without immediate intervention. Civilians fleeing northern Gaza report chronic food scarcity and hunger-related deaths, with aid agencies warning of an impending famine.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-aid-convoy-looted-unrwa-israel.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">NYT</a>, Louise Wateridge, an UNRWA spokeswoman currently in Gaza, said that, "People at the moment are absolutely desperate for anything. We're back at a stage where we're seeing people literally fighting over a bag of flour."</p>

<p>Israel's parliament recently voted to ban UNRWA, restricting its operations in territories Israel occupies, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israel claims UNRWA has ties to Hamas and promotes hate against Israel, allegations UNRWA denies.</p>

<p>UNRWA is not allowed to use their own trucks and drivers and have to resort to Israel authorities to provide the vehicles and the aid workers are not even allowed to have armed guards. Wateridge said, "It looks like something out of a sci-fi movie. They try and armour the vehicles as best as possible and protect themselves. And they drive very, very fast and just try and try and not stop and just keep going. That's the only protection they have."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes in Gaza continue to take a heavy toll on civilians. On Monday, airstrikes killed at least 50 people, including 17 members of a single family. The local health ministry reported that the victims included children and a weeks-old newborn.</p>

<p>The director of the Kamal Adwan hospital, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, described the scene as "very violent targeting, with shells from tanks." Patients are filled with fear and horror, pleading for the world to stop the killing machine and bombing.</p>

<p>The situation in Gaza remains dire, with the risk of famine persisting. The World Food Programme warns that one million people are at risk of starvation.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A veterinarian in the UK has died by suicide by consuming drugs used to euthanise pets after becoming distressed at rich customers asking him to put down their animals, according to a report in The Independent. The vet, identified as Dr John Ellis, 35, was a resident at the Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists at the time of his death. He had become resentful of clients with "brand-new" cars, parked outside his clinic, refusing to pay to help the poor animals.</p>

<p>Dr Ellis reportedly confided to her mother, Tine Ellis that he had been having sleeping troubles due to the workplace issue. During an inquest into her son's death, Ms Ellis, a Conservative councilor in Fareham, called her son's death 'destroying'.</p>

<p>"Owners are leaving it too late to come in, they weren't seeking help early enough for things that could have been quite simple," said Ms Ellis.</p>

<p>Ms Ellis also revealed what her son had told her before taking his life: "When I've got somebody saying they won't pay to help their animal and they're sitting there with a brand new car outside, and other people who were really struggling [financially] would do anything to save their animals, but there was nothing they could do because it was already too late."</p>

<h3><strong>Dr Ellis tricked nurse</strong></h3>

<p>According to the findings of the hearing, Dr Ellis had tricked a veterinary nurse into giving him the deadly medication by claiming that he needed it to put down a friend's large dog. However, he used the drug to take his own life.</p>

<p>Winchester Coroner's Court, in Hampshire, said Dr Ellis had been experiencing considerable stress in both his professional and private life at the time of the death. Meanwhile, Simon Burge, the assistant coroner for Hampshire said Dr Ellis's death was "a huge waste of a talented life".</p>

<p>"It's a matter of great regret to the family and all his friends that he should have rashly, unnecessarily made the decision that he did," said Mr Burge.</p>

<p>The family also released a statement, stating they were devastated by the loss of their loved one, adding that people "will remember him not only for his professional expertise but also for his warmth, generosity and genuine love for animals".</p>

<p>"We continue to grapple with the heartbreak and shock that come with the death of someone so young and full of potential. We want to take this opportunity to encourage anyone who may be struggling with mental health challenges to seek support and not suffer in silence," the family added.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Apple Inc. has increased its offer to invest in Indonesia by almost tenfold, according to people familiar with the matter, in the US tech giant's latest bid to persuade the government to lift its sales ban on the iPhone 16.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple Inc. has increased its offer to invest in Indonesia by almost tenfold, according to people familiar with the matter, in the US tech giant's latest bid to persuade the government to lift its sales ban on the iPhone 16.</p>

<p>The proposal would see Cupertino-based Apple invest almost $100 million in Southeast Asia's largest economy over two years, the people said, asking not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak publicly. Apple's previous investment plan of close to $10 million would have involved the company investing in a factory making accessories and components in the city of Bandung, located southeast of Jakarta, Bloomberg News reported earlier.</p>

<p>After Apple submitted its increased offer, Indonesia's Ministry of Industry, which last month blocked a permit allowing the sale of the iPhone 16, is now demanding that the technology behemoth alter its investment plans to focus more on research and development for its smartphones in the country, the people said. The Ministry of Industry hasn't made a final decision on Apple's newest proposal, they added.</p>

<p>Following Apple's initial proposal, the ministry called for senior company executives to meet Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita. But after flying into Jakarta, Apple's senior executives were told that the minister wasn't available and so they had to meet with the ministry's director-general instead.</p>

<p>Apple and the Ministry of Industry didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Apple's new investment proposal came after the Ministry of Industry last month blocked sales of the iPhone 16 on the grounds the US company's local unit hasn't met a 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones and tablets.</p>

<p>According to the Indonesian government, Apple has only invested 1.5 trillion rupiah ($95 million) in the nation via developer academies, falling short of a commitment of 1.7 trillion rupiah. The Southeast Asian nation has also banned the sale of Alphabet Inc.'s Google Pixel phones because of a similar lack of investment.</p>

<p>Indonesia's hardball tactics appear to be working, with the iPhone 16 ban becoming an example of the pressure new President Prabowo Subianto's government is putting on international firms to increase local manufacturing as it seeks to boost domestic industries.</p>

<p>Indonesia also resorted to such tactics under the administration of former President Joko Widodo, who blocked ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok last year to shield its retail sector from cheap Chinese-made goods. This prompted the hugely popular video app to ultimately invest $1.5 billion in a joint venture with Tokopedia, the e-commerce arm of Indonesia's GoTo Group.</p>

<p>By offering to invest in the country, Apple is seeking to get unfettered access to Indonesia's 278 million consumers, more than half of which are under the age of 44 and tech savvy.</p>

<p>But such strong-arm tactics by Indonesia risk frightening off other firms from scaling up their presence or establishing a footprint in the first place, particularly ones that are looking to decouple from China. It may also jeopardize Prabowo's aim of attracting overseas investments to grow the economy and fund policy spending.</p>

<p>It's unclear as to which companies Apple's proposed investment might go. Apple typically backs assembly or components partners such as Foxconn in various countries, which in turn help produce or supply vital parts for its iPhones and iPads.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese man studying in Australia has captured the internet's attention with his extraordinary dedication to love. For three months, 28-year-old Xu Guangli commuted weekly between his home in Shandong province, China, and RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, where he is completing a master's degree in arts management.</p>

<p>From August to October, Xu made the 11-week journey to attend a single weekly class while also spending time with his girlfriend, who had returned to China after completing her studies in Australia.</p>

<p>Each round trip took him three days. Xu's journey began at 7 a.m. in his hometown of Dezhou, where he travelled to Jinan to catch a flight. After a layover, he arrived in Melbourne the next day for class and returned home on the third day.</p>

<p>"It was my last semester, and I only needed one class to meet the graduation requirements," Xu explained to Dazhong Daily. "More importantly, my girlfriend had returned to China, and life in Melbourne on my own was lonely."</p>

<p>Xu, who has been studying in Australia for eight years, told the South China Morning Post that his decision also allowed him to observe China's domestic work environment, which could benefit his future career.</p>

<p>He documented his travels online, gaining nearly 10,000 followers on social media. In one video, he broke down the cost of each trip, totalling 6,700 yuan, including a 4,700 yuan return flight ticket, taxi fares, and meals. During his one night in Melbourne each week, he stayed on a friend's couch to save money.</p>

<p>Despite the expenses exceeding the 10,000 yuan ($1,350) monthly rent he previously paid in Melbourne, Xu said the time and money were worthwhile "for love" and the "good food at home."</p>

<p>He revealed that he booked connecting flights on various airlines, taking the chance to explore several Chinese cities and even visiting Vietnam on one occasion.</p>

<p>Xu completed his studies at the end of October and no longer needs to travel to Australia. His story has stunned social media users, who praised his dedication and stamina.</p>

<p>"I have never seen anyone so devoted to love before," said one online observer.</p>

<p>"I would not travel such a long distance every week for anything. It is simply too tiring," another said.</p>

<p>"I would not commute between school and my home every week even if they are in neighbouring cities," said a third.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A dance move inspired by Donald Trump's stilted on-stage boogieing has rapidly become the celebration of choice across the US sporting world.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As sporting celebrations go, it doesn't quite have the charm of Roger Milla's hip-wiggling shimmy with a corner flag at the 1990 World Cup or the imperious swagger of Usain Bolt's iconic lightning pose.</p>

<p>But a dance move inspired by Donald Trump's stilted on-stage boogieing has rapidly become the celebration of choice across the US sporting world.</p>

<p>From the blood-soaked Ultimate Fighting Championship to the hard-hitting National Football League and the reliably decorous world of the LPGA Tour golf, athletes across North America have succumbed to the viral Trump dance craze in the past week.</p>

<p>On Monday, United States soccer star Christian Pulisic became the latest exponent of what might be called 'the Donald', rushing to the sideline with several team-mates to mimic the US President-elect's signature, fist-pumping shuffle after scoring his team's opening goal in a 4-2 win over Jamaica.</p>

<p>Another prominent example came at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, when mixed martial arts fighter Jon Jones knocked out Stipe Miocic.</p>

<p>With Trump just a few feet away at ringside, Jones quickly broke out an unmistakeable hip-swinging rendition of the Republican leader's dance before presenting Trump with his heavyweight belt.</p>

<p>There have been countless other examples across the NFL and collegiate gridiron.</p>

<p>The San Francisco 49ers' Nick Bosa -- who drew criticism for crashing a postgame interview wearing a "Make America Great Again" baseball cap shortly before the US election on November 5 -- was one of the first NFL players to do the dance after sacking an opponent on November 10.</p>

<p>"All the guys wanted me to do it," Bosa told the San Francisco Chronicle. "I wasn't even going to do it, but the boys reminded me. And it was fun."</p>

<p>Bosa was coy however when asked who his dance had been inspired by. "I think you know the answer to that question," he told the paper.</p>

<p>On the most recent NFL Sunday, several players adopted the celebration.</p>

<p>Among them was Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers, who busted out the Trump moves after scoring a touchdown in his team's defeat to the Miami Dolphins.</p>

<p>Bowers said the move was prompted by UFC fighter Jones' celebration on Saturday night.</p>

<p>"I've seen everyone do it," Bowers said. "I watched the UFC fight last night and Jon Jones did it. I like watching UFC so I saw it and thought it was cool."</p>

<p>US media reports said Raiders team officials abruptly shut down Bowers' availability following the comments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Florida on Sunday, the Trump dance had even reached women's golf.</p>

<p>England's Charley Hull jokingly performed the move as she walked down the fairway in her final round duel with Nelly Korda at the Annika tournament at Pelican Golf Club.</p>

<p>Former US international soccer player and television pundit Alexi Lalas couldn't hide his delight after Pulisic got in on the act.</p>

<p>"Pulisic scores. Pulisic does the Trump dance. We're winning the World Cup...bigly," he wrote on X.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday said he would not "get into operational details" after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles against Russia.</p>

<p>Speaking to broadcasters at the G20 in Brazil, Starmer refused to be drawn "because the only winner, if we were to do that, is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin".</p>

<p>Kyiv has long sought authorisation from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, to hit military installations inside Russia as its troops face growing pressure.</p>

<p>A US official said Washington's major policy shift on the missiles was in response to Russia's deployment of thousands of North Korean troops in its war effort.</p>

<p>Britain, which has provided Ukraine with Storm Shadow long-range missiles, has consistently pushed to ease restrictions on Kyiv's use of the weapons.</p>

<p>Putin had previously warned that letting Ukraine use long-range weapons would mean NATO was "at war" with Moscow.</p>

<p>In parliament in London, lawmaker Roger Gale asked if Britain planned to "align with the United States" in granting Kyiv permission to use the UK-supplied missiles "as it sees fit in its own defence".</p>

<p>Junior defence minister Maria Eagle said the government intended to "align with our allies" on how Ukraine "can make use of the capabilities that's been offered" by its backers.</p>

<p>Starmer added: "I've been really clear for a long time now we need to double down.</p>

<p>"We need to make sure Ukraine has what is necessary for as long as necessary, because we cannot allow Putin to win this war," he said.</p>

<p>Asked if he had spoken to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the G20, he said: "I haven't spoken to Russia and I've got no plans to do so."</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy, speaking to reporters after a UN Security Council meeting in New York, also refused to discuss the use of British missiles, because it "risks operational security".</p>

<p>Asked how concerned he was about the implications of Donald Trump's presidency on the war in Ukraine, he said: "One president at a time."</p>

<p>"We're dealing with President (Joe) Biden and we are committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“All we have to have is just a human form to be a victim.” This statement from attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specialises in online abuse and sex crimes, captures the heightened risks posed by deepfake pornography in the era of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The alarming rise of AI-generated deepfake pornography poses a massive threat to anyone, whether or not they've shared explicit images online. From high-profile individuals to everyday people, including minors, the psychological toll on victims is immense.</p>

<p><strong>The technology behind deepfakes</strong></p>

<p>Unlike revenge porn, which involves the non-consensual sharing of actual images, deepfake technology allows perpetrators to create entirely fabricated content by superimposing someone's face onto explicit photos or manipulating existing images to appear compromising. Even those who have never taken private photos can fall prey to this technology.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/tech/ai-deepfake-porn-advice-terms-of-service-wellness/index.html">CNN</a>, high-profile cases in the past have included celebrities like Taylor Swift and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But young individuals are also finding themselves targeted.</p>

<p><strong>Protect yourself: Preserve evidence</strong></p>

<p>For those who discover their image has been weaponised this way, the immediate instinct is often to try to get it removed. But Goldberg stresses the importance of first preserving evidence by taking screenshots. “The knee-jerk reaction is to get this off the internet as soon as possible. But if you want to be able to have the option of reporting it criminally, you need the evidence,” Goldberg was quoted as saying by CNN.</p>

<p>After documenting the content, victims can use tools provided by tech companies such as Google, Meta and Snapchat to request the removal of explicit images. Organisations like StopNCII.org and Take It Down also assist in facilitating the removal of harmful content across multiple platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Legal progress</strong></p>

<p>The fight against deepfake pornography has drawn rare bipartisan attention. In August 2024, US senators called on major tech companies like X (formerly Twitter) and Discord to participate in programmes aimed at curbing nonconsensual explicit content. A hearing on Capitol Hill featured testimonies from teenagers and parents affected by AI-generated pornography. Following this, a bill was introduced in the US to criminalise the publication of deepfake pornography. The proposed legislation would also require social media platforms to remove such content upon notification from victims.</p>

<p>Goldberg emphasises that while victims can take steps to respond, the onus is also on society to act responsibly. “My proactive advice is really to the would-be offenders which is just, like, don't be a total scum of the earth and try to steal a person's image and use it for humiliation. There's not much that victims can do to prevent this. We can never be fully safe in a digital society, but it's kind of up to one another to not be total a**holes,” Goldberg told CNN.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US aviation giant Boeing sent out its first redundancy notifications on Monday as part of a previously announced plan to cut 10 percent of its global workforce.</p>

<p>Boeing intends to cut almost 2,200 jobs in the US state of Washington, which is home to many of its oldest factories, according to a statement made public on Monday.</p>

<p>Companies in the United States are required by law to submit a "WARN" notice (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) to local authorities sixty days before any layoffs.</p>

<p>In its notice, Boeing said it expects to start laying people off permanently starting December 20. 2,199 people will be affected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The group has been plagued by production quality problems, and has just suffered a strike lasting more than 50 days that paralyzed two crucial factories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 12, it unveiled plans to reduce its global workforce by 10 percent over the coming months, without giving any further details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boeing's employees numbered some 170,000 people at the end of last year, with close to 67,000 of them in Washington state, where the company was founded and where it produces its best-selling 737 line of aircraft, along with the 777, 767 and several military planes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its plants in Renton and Everett, located near Seattle, were recently blocked by a strike involving more than 33,000 members of the local branch of the International Association of Machinists (IAM), who were negotiating over pay and work conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As previously announced, we are adjusting our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and a more focused set of priorities," a company spokesperson told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Boeing, most of the employees receiving redundancy notices this week will leave the company in mid-January. Benefits and health insurance will continue to be paid for up to three months after that.</p>

<p>The engineers' union SPEEA (Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace) was notified on Thursday evening that 438 of its members were to be laid off, according to a spokesman.</p>

<p>It has more than 19,000 members across the United States, around 16,500 of whom work for Boeing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[But as the Amazon battles the effects of climate change, a historic drought is making travel more difficult than ever.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Amazon, the world's largest river by volume and one of its busiest transportation networks is facing a serious challenge. In a region where roads are virtually nonexistent, people rely on ferries, boats, and canoes to navigate the river. But as the Amazon battles the effects of climate change, a historic drought is making travel more difficult than ever.</p>

<p>Cilene Santos, a Brazilian tourist guide, shared her concerns with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/17/world/video/amazon-rainforest-drought-pozzebon-dnt-digvid" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>, saying, "There are sandbanks everywhere, and the boat could hit one and break its propeller."</p>

<p>This month, UNICEF reported that over 400,000 children are being affected by the drought. More than 1,700 schools in the Brazilian portion of the Amazon have been closed or are inaccessible due to the low water levels.</p>

<p>The dramatic effects of climate change are hard to ignore, especially as former US President Joe Biden flew over the Amazon on Sunday. From the sky, the once lush landscape now features vast sand dunes, an unsettling sight that looks more like a desert than a rainforest.</p>

<p>Bram Ebus, an Amazon analyst, emphasized the significance of the moment, telling CNN, "It is a very important time for the Amazon because for the first time, there are two progressive presidents in the largest Amazonian economies - Colombia and Brazil. There is a small window of opportunity for both leaders to come up with concrete proposals to conserve biodiversity."</p>

<p>As the Amazon faces one of the toughest challenges in its history, the world watches, hoping that efforts to protect this vital ecosystem will be met with swift and meaningful action.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk has been an ever-present sidekick for President-elect Donald Trump since the US election at the start of the month. But can the bromance between world's wealthiest man and the soon-to-be US president survive some major policy differences?]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has been an ever-present sidekick for President-elect Donald Trump since the US election at the start of the month.</p>

<p>"I can't get him out of here," Trump joked about Musk at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last Thursday. "I like having him here as well. He's done a fantastic job, an incredible mind."</p>

<p>But can the bromance between the world's wealthiest man and the soon-to-be US president survive some major policy differences and their own combustible personalities?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>AFP looks at six possible areas of friction:</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Who's the boss?</strong></h3>

<p>Musk is famed for his manic working habits and self-described "hardcore" style, running his companies as personal fiefdoms in which his authority is rarely challenged.</p>

<p>From factory production lines to the boardroom, he is used to getting his way with an abrasive style that sees him fire people on the spot and sometimes insult their intelligence in public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump, also a tycoon fond of firing and humiliating people publicly, demands total loyalty and has chafed against sharing the limelight with others in the past.</p>

<p>He also likes to play his advisors and cabinet members against each other, former aides say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk reportedly had a first public row with Trump transition official Boris Epshteyn last week, according to the Axios news site.</p>

<p>And he openly endorsed brokerage billionaire Howard Lutnick for US Treasury secretary on Saturday, setting up an early test of his influence.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Climate change</strong></h3>

<p>Musk invested in Tesla in 2004 partly out of concern about global warming.</p>

<p>In 2017, he resigned from Trump's business advisory councils to protest the then-president's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate change accord.</p>

<p>"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk wrote on Twitter at the time.</p>

<p>Trump, who has called climate change a "hoax," is widely expected to abandon US commitments again after President Joe Biden re-joined the Paris Accord in 2020.</p>

<p>Musk has shifted his views recently, telling Trump during a live conversation on X in August that "if 50-100 years from now we're mostly sustainable I think that will probably be OK."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world's top climate scientific body, the UN's IPCC, says average global temperatures are on track to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial times in the early 2030s, a key level with major consequences for ecosystems.</p>

<h3><strong>Energy transition</strong></h3>

<p>Musk has bet big on the energy transition, making his fortune from Tesla electric cars, but also developing domestic battery technology and solar-powered roof tiles.</p>

<p>Trump ran pledging to "drill, baby, drill" and is expected to approve new fossil fuel infrastructure and permits, even opening up protected federal land to oil and gas companies.</p>

<p>Musk used to deride the "mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy" that Trump openly champions.</p>

<p>The president-elect has nominated a fracking magnate as his energy secretary. Chris Wright publicly dismissed climate change and the energy transition last year.</p>

<h3><strong>China</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's aggressive stance on China and the risk of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies could be another major thorn in the relationship between the billionaires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is a major market for Tesla, where the company has one of its so-called "Gigafactories" and is trying to compete with fast-growing home-grown manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk never says a negative word about the ruling Communist Party, putting him at odds with the China hawks like US Senator Marco Rubio who have been tapped to join Trump's cabinet.</p>

<h3><strong>'DOGE' on a leash</strong></h3>

<p>An unsparing cost-cutter in his own companies, Musk has been tasked by Trump with leading the "Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)," which will take an ax to government spending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plans to gut programs will almost certainly, however, face severe political pushback, even from Republicans.</p>

<p>As mid-term elections approach, whether it's rescuing Medicaid checks for the poor or handing out defense contracts to benefactors, Trump's political priorities could waver from Musk's.</p>

<h3><strong>Big Tech</strong></h3>

<p>Musk's complicated relationships and personal rivalries with Silicon Valley's biggest tech companies go back decades, and he is expected to face myriad conflicts of interest as part of the administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Would Musk, who owns his own AI company, sit by quietly if Trump champions OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed startup that Musk played a key role in starting a decade ago?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Amazon founder Jeff Bezos gets Trump's ear, would Musk tolerate that a rival to SpaceX got closer to the White House inner sanctum?&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan federal authorities have outlawed all sorts of public gatherings in the capital region for two months ahead of a planned protest by jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's party.</p>

<p>Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) last week announced to protest in Islamabad on November 24 to force the government to release its jailed founding leader, incarcerated for more than a year.</p>

<p>The federal government retaliated by imposing Section 144 in Islamabad, a colonial era law that prohibits public assemblies.</p>

<p>According to different notifications issued by the office of Islamabad District Magistrate Usman Ashraf on Monday, Section 144 has been implemented due to "certain segments of society" planning "unlawful assemblies ... which can disrupt public peace and tranquillity."</p>

<p>Public gatherings of five or more people were banned, as they might "threaten public peace and tranquillity, cause public annoyance or injury, endanger human life and safety, pose a threat to public property, and ... lead to a riot or an affray including sectarian riot within the revenue/territorial limits of district Islamabad."</p>

<p>The notifications banned sound systems to play "all kinds of objectionable/sectarian related speeches and sermons" and has also been prohibited under the order. Similarly, the use of loudspeakers to antagonise "political/social groups/religious sects."</p>

<p>The district magistrate also banned firecrackers, the display of firearms as well as the distribution of hand-bills, pamphlets and affixing of posters.</p>

<p>The ban would be in place for two months, "unless revoked or extended," the order said.</p>

<p>However, the banning of rallies may hardly have any impact on the PTI which in the past flouted Section 144 several times, political observers said, adding, the protesters usually invoke a constitutional provision that provides the right of peaceful assembly and protest to all citizens.</p>

<p>Earlier Khan's sister Aleema Khan, after meeting him in the Adiala Jail at Rawalpindi on November 13, told the journalists that everyone from the PTI, including workers, members of parliament, and party supporters should join the protest on November 24.</p>

<p>Khan, 72, has been incarcerated in multiple cases since August last year. He has been convicted in a few and got bail in some but continues to be in jail on account of other cases.</p>

<p>"This is the moment when you will have to decide (whether) you want to live under martial law or live with freedom," she quoted Khan as saying.</p>

<p>"You used your right (to vote) on February 8.... but the next day, the foundation you had laid for democracy was stolen," she further quoted her jailed brother as saying.</p>

<p>She further said that Khan has addressed his call to four categories of people -farmers, lawyers, civil society and students- who should come out to protest for their rights.</p>

<p>Talking about the 26th Amendment being enacted as law, she quoted Khan as saying, "All of your rights have been taken away; the Supreme Court has been occupied, and the current conditions are even worse than previous martial laws."</p>

<p>The 26th amendment has granted legislators more power in appointing the top judge.</p>

<p>Separately, the PTI in a statement had said a long march would begin towards Islamabad on Nov 24 to force the government to accept three demands: "Restoration of judiciary, as 26th amendment is a blatant attempt to clip judicial powers; release of party leadership &amp; workers and return of stolen mandate, 2024 election by far, the most controversial and farce election."</p>

<p>The so-called final call for protest comes after a series of protests by the PTI supporters since September. The last protest call towards capital Islamabad on October 4 failed to achieve its objective.</p>

<p>By giving a go ahead for the final protest, Khan and his party has apparently exhausted all channels to secure his release from jail where he has been kept for more than year.<br />

<p>The recent U.S. presidential election defied expectations, delivering results that will shape American politics in unpredictable ways. For only the second time in US history, a president won non-consecutive terms in office. Despite widespread predictions of a contentious transition, the handover from President Biden to President Trump was remarkably smooth.</p>

<p>This election did more than simply return Trump to office; it also gave the Republican Party control over both chambers of Congress, completing a “trifecta” of control across the executive and legislative branches. With this majority, Trump has moved quickly to form his cabinet, signalling his commitment to an assertive, and in some ways, radical policy direction. His cabinet picks have both reassured his base and stirred fresh controversy among Democrats and even some Republicans.</p>

<h2><strong>A Complex Blend</strong></h2>

<p>Trump's cabinet nominations have surprised many, reflecting his intent to shake up the status quo with a blend of political loyalty and unconventional figures. His picks for Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Michael Waltz, respectively, have been met with cautious optimism. However, other nominations have sparked bipartisan concern. Trump's choice of Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, for instance, has been seen as a signal of a conservative re-evaluation of the military's role, funding, and structure. Known for his hawkish views, Hegseth is expected to push for a downsized but more targeted military approach, potentially bringing resources from long-standing international deployments to home.</p>

<p>Another controversial decision is Trump's decision to appoint Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence. Gabbard, a former Democratic Congresswoman known for her anti-interventionist stance, has drawn scrutiny due to her critiques of US military actions abroad and her relatively diplomatic tone toward adversaries like Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Her stance on foreign interventions may face significant resistance from both sides of the aisle.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Some Names Have Raised Eyebrows</strong></h2>

<p>Trump's choices for domestic policy roles have provoked an even stronger backlash. His selection of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services has ignited concerns across the political spectrum. Gaetz, a controversial figure with ongoing legal issues, is perceived by critics as an overly polarising choice to lead the Justice Department. Similarly, Kennedy, known for his outspoken opposition to vaccines, raises questions about his suitability to lead a department overseeing national health policy.</p>

<p>Trump's establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by high-profile entrepreneurs Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, has been met with a mix of enthusiasm and scepticism. While the concept of streamlining government operations and reducing bureaucracy is appealing to many, the feasibility of such an initiative remains uncertain. DOGE's role is intended to be primarily domestic, targeting inefficiencies in agencies like the Department of State and the Pentagon, which are often criticised for sluggish operations. Yet, some fear that drastic cuts or restructuring could disrupt government functions, creating bottlenecks rather than improvements.</p>

<p>Amidst these appointments, there is growing speculation that Trump is prioritising loyalty over qualifications. Some Republicans have privately expressed concerns that certain nominees may struggle to pass Senate confirmation, even with the party's majority. This scenario would put Trump in a delicate position.</p>

<h2><strong>The Fringe Rules?</strong></h2>

<p>Democrats, for their part, have criticised Trump's cabinet selections, suggesting that his administration risks becoming insular, filled with figures from the political fringe. They warn that governing with a small, ideologically close circle could be the worst sounding board.</p>

<p>Despite the controversies, Trump's nominations for Rubio, Waltz, and Hegseth indicate a clear intent to strengthen America's role abroad through a resolute foreign policy. His administration appears focused on standing firm against rivals like China, reinforcing traditional alliances, and avoiding new military conflicts. At the same time, Trump's administration seems inclined to reduce military entanglements in ongoing wars, in line with his campaign promises to prioritise American interests.</p>

<p>For India, Trump's return to the presidency could mark a new chapter in US-India relations. Rubio and Waltz are both strong proponents of closer US-India ties, viewing the partnership as crucial for countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Above all, Trump's personal rapport with Prime Minister Modi adds guardrails of certainty to the bilateral relationship.</p>

<p>While Trump's choices reflect his desire for a loyal team, they also signal his intention to challenge traditional governance structures and pursue a different vision for America's future.</p>

<h3><strong>The Vijay Mallya Bank Fraud Case</strong></h3>

<p>The Indian government has been trying to extradite <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/non-bailable-warrant-issued-against-vijay-mallya-in-180-crore-loan-default-case-6014290" target="_blank">Vijay Mallya</a> to face charges of fraud resulting from the collapse of his defunct company Kingfisher Airlines.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares in Donald Trump's social media company soared on Monday after a Financial Times report that it was in talks to buy a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, was up more than 16.5 percent at the close of trading after the newspaper reported it was in advanced talks to buy crypto platform Bakkt.</p>

<p>Many in the crypto sector are expecting the US president-elect to enact reforms that will benefit the industry once he is in office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purchase, if it goes through, would give Trump further personal exposure to any favorable regulations his administration enacts.</p>

<p>Bakkt shares shot up more than 160 percent after the financial daily's report, which cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Bakkt's parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Bakkt has previously entered into business partnerships with Starbucks and Mastercard in moves intended to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to consumers.</p>

<p>The company, which went public in 2021, has not yet turned a profit although its losses have narrowed in recent years.</p>

<p>TMTG posted revenue of just $2.6 million in the first three quarters of this year while reporting a loss of $363 million.</p>

<p>Trump has a 53 percent stake in the company.</p>

<p>He also has ties to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial.</p>

<p>Groups affiliated with the crypto industry spent millions supporting candidates across both US political parties in the November election, including Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there was any doubt that Joe Biden is no longer in the picture for many world leaders, his final G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro provided a sure sign. Biden has been making a last pitch for global support on issues from Ukraine and Gaza to climate change before Donald Trump returns to the White House. But as his counterparts gathered for an official G20 photo beside the Brazilian city's stunning bayside, there was a problem -- the 81-year-old Biden was a no-show.</p>

<p>Instead of the US president, it was China's Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who joked and chatted in the front row before posing together.</p>

<p>Frustrated American officials blamed it on "logistical issues" and said the picture was taken too soon, as Biden was still making his way to the area from talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>

<p>"They took the photo early before all the leaders had arrived. So a number of the leaders weren't actually there," a US official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Trudeau and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also missed out.</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Twilight</strong></h2>

<p>But while the issue did not appear to have been a deliberate snub, it reflected the increasingly sidelined status of the lame-duck US leader as Trump's comeback looms.</p>

<p>The fact that it was the leaders of three BRICS countries in the front row that see themselves as a counterpart to a Western-dominated world did not help.</p>

<p>In another incident, US officials played down footage of the leader of the world's biggest economy and most powerful military apparently straying from the red carpet on the way into the summit.</p>

<p>The US officials said that "several" leaders from "countries that face high threats" took a different route like Biden did, even if Brazilian media said they did not see any others.</p>

<p>However, the missteps come in the twilight of a presidency whose achievements are set to meet a Trump-shaped wrecking ball come January 20th.</p>

<p>Biden dropped out of the US presidential election against Trump after a disastrous debate raised concerns about his age, but he still saw his Democratic replacement, Kamala Harris, lose heavily to the Republican.</p>

<p>Now his six-day tour of South America has turned into a desperate frenzy to reassure world leaders amid uncertainty about what Trump will bring, from trade wars to threats to upending old alliances.</p>

<h2><strong>Final Pitch</strong></h2>

<p>At the G20 on Monday, Biden had urged the other leaders to back Ukraine's "sovereignty," in his first comments since it emerged on Sunday that he had approved Kyiv's use of long-range missiles against Russia.</p>

<p>Yet Trump could reverse not only that decision, but also Biden's huge US military aid for Ukraine, with signs that the president-elect may push through a peace deal that could force Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow.</p>

<p>Biden also pushed G20 leaders to pressure Hamas on a ceasefire deal with Israel -- and while Trump has appointed some key Israel hawks, he may also try to push for a historic deal there too.</p>

<p>Time and again, Biden has used his valedictory appearance on the world stage to try to keep his policies out of Trump's shadow.</p>

<p>At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima last week, Biden met with Xi, who promised to work with Trump on a "smooth" transition even as both leaders warned of turbulence ahead.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden visited the Amazon rainforest in Brazil to promote his record on climate change -- despite Trump threatening to pull the United States back out of the Paris climate agreement.</p>

<p>At the G20 he announced what the White House called a "historic" $4 billion pledge for a World Bank fund that helps the world's poorest countries.</p>

<p>But US officials admitted that there was no way they could "Trump-proof" the money if Trump -- who has appointed tech tycoon Elon Musk to head a commission on cutting government "waste" -- scraps the plan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Archegos Capital Management founder Bill Hwang, whose family office's soaring portfolio briefly made him worth more than $30 billion, said he now only has around $55 million.</p>

<p>Hwang, who faces sentencing Wednesday in New York for fraud and market manipulation tied to Archegos' spectacular 2021 collapse, estimated his current wealth in a Monday court filing. His lawyers are pushing back against prosecutors' request that Hwang be forced to pay $10 billion to compensate his victims, on top of spending 21 years in prison.</p>

<p>The proposed restitution order is "unsupported, unnecessary and unjustified," Hwang's lawyers said. They also suggested that it was pointless, saying Hwang's net worth is less than 0.6% of the amount sought by the government and includes a number of jointly held assets.</p>

<p>Hwang was convicted in July of misleading Wall Street banks into helping him inflate the value of Archegos' highly concentrated portfolio to as high as $36 billion before the bubble burst. Its counterparties lost some $10 billion, and the scandal was a major factor in the later demise of Credit Suisse Group AG.</p>

<p>Though the government is asking US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein to sentence Hwang to more than two decades behind bars, his lawyers are asking for no prison time at all.</p>

<p>In Monday's filing, Hwang's lawyers made a similar argument against restitution as they did against prison. They said prosecutors haven't shown that the losses suffered by the banks were directly caused by Hwang's conduct.</p>

<p>The case is US v. Hwang, 22-cr-240, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

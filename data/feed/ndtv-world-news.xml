       <description><![CDATA[Unaware that he was being filmed, he competed in challenges for basic survival. His story of loneliness and struggle is now featured in a documentary.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomoaki Hamatsu, better known as Nasubi, a comedian who appeared on the extreme Japanese game show <em>'A Life In Prizes'</em>, has given very painful details of his 15-month ordeal, which included being videotaped eating dog food, being held in total seclusion, and having to compete in tasks to survive. The show, which debuted in 1998, attracted up to 30 million people at its height and became an international hit.</p>

<p>Nasubi, who stayed naked during the broadcast, was locked in an empty apartment and had to win prizes to meet basic needs like food. He was unaware that his actions were being broadcast to millions across Japan. His story is now featured in a Hulu documentary titled <em>The Contestant.</em></p>

<p>"I came across his story when I was working on a different project and got lost down one of those internet rabbit holes," Clair Titley, director of The Contestant, told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz99yr6dq41o"><em> BBC.</em></a></p>

<p>"But I found that a lot of what I had come across was almost derogatory. Nothing had really talked about Nasubi's story in depth. [I had] all these questions, such as, Why did he stay in there, and what effect it had on him. So I contacted him with that premise, that I wanted to make a film about his experience."</p>

<p>Nasubi, who is now 48, claimed that he was left feeling nervous and confused by the lack of information provided by the producers. Only a phone for emergencies was provided to him, and he had to write 300 sweepstakes entries every day to win necessities like crackers, which prevented him from going hungry. It took him three weeks to earn his first reward.</p>

<p>Nasubi admitted that, while initially excited, he soon became overwhelmed by the loneliness and isolation. "The hardest part was definitely the loneliness," he said, adding that he struggled to overcome it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk, tasked by President-elect Donald Trump to rein in the excessive US spending, has warned that America could be nearing the verge of bankruptcy. The world's richest man and a close adviser of Mr Trump, Elon Musk has been tasked to spearhead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the upcoming Republican administration, to find ways of saving taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p>"America is currently headed for bankruptcy super fast," Mr Musk posted to X (formally Twitter), the social media platform he bought in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Musk wrote this in response to a post on the Department of Government Efficiency's X handle that noted "the US Government spent USD 6.16. trillion while only bringing in USD 4.47 trillion" in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">America is currently headed for bankruptcy super fast <a href="https://t.co/Tm6JFJ6mef">https://t.co/Tm6JFJ6mef</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1860212805439488130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"This trend must be reversed, and we must balance the budget," the DOGE account added.</p>

<p>During his election campaign, one of the promises made by President-Elect Trump was the formation of DOGE to dismantle the government bureaucracy and cut wasteful spending.&nbsp;Earlier this year, while talking about skyrocketing US debts, Mr Trump had floated the idea of using Bitcoin to “pay off" "USD 35 trillion".</p>

<p>The President-elect is relying on two successful businessmen -- Mr Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy -- to dig into the details and give recommendations to his administration to restrict spending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report by Forbes, the national debt of the US crossed the USD 34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiralling and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip.</p>

<p>Mr Trump said, "..hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our USD 35 trillion,” according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/11/20/trumps-department-of-government-efficiency-is-poised-to-cut-waste/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Forbes </a>report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the Republicans won 'Trifacta' of victories in the US, Mr Musk in a post on X said, “Excess government spending is driving America into bankruptcy,” adding, “This debt growth is unsustainable.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The name of the DOGE department is a nod to the 2013 famous Shiba Inu dog meme, which is also linked to the dogecoin cryptocurrency. According to Mr Musk, Dogecoin is his "favourite" cryptocurrency and is accepted as payment by his Tesla car company.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that operates without a financial system or government authorities. According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-bitcoin-works/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Investopedia</a>, bitcoin can be used as an alternative to fiat currencies through crypto exchanges, utilizing peer-to-peer transfers on a digital network that records all transactions. This network is powered by a blockchain, an open-source program that chains transaction histories to prevent manipulation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin's price today is USD 97,455.70, which represents a change of +4.31% in the last 24 hours.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A judge in the United States has rejected the request of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sanction tech billionaire Elon Musk for skipping a meeting with the regulator, to watch one of his rockets launch.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge in the United States has rejected the request of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sanction tech billionaire Elon Musk for skipping a meeting with the regulator, to watch one of his rockets launch. Mr Musk was ordered by a court to meet the SEC officials in September to provide testimony for the regulator's probe into his USD 44 billion takeover of X (Twitter at the time).</p>

<p>On Friday, US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley said there was no need to sanction the billionaire for his absence, as he agreed to reimburse the SEC to cover the airfare of three agency lawyers he stood up in Los Angeles on September 10.</p>

<p>Mr Musk finally complied with the order and met with the SEC lawyers to give testimony on October 3.</p>

<p>"Because the present circumstances forestall any occasion for meaningful relief that the court could grant, the SEC's request is moot," Corley wrote in the order.</p>

<p>The order said that having only to repay travel costs would not deter many other people from ignoring court orders, "much less someone of Mr Musk's extraordinary means."</p>

<p>The SEC urged the federal judge to impose sanctions on Mr Musk to remind him that flouting her order was not a "trivial matte," according to a report by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>However, the report said that Mr Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, contested the claim and argued that the billionaire's failure to show up for the deposition was justified because he had an urgent obligation as the head of SpaceX, and had to travel to Florida for the Cape Canaveral launch of a rocket on a commercial spacewalk mission.</p>

<p>Mr Spiro contended that his client's voluntary offer to reimburse the agency for USD 2,923 was sufficient. Mr Musk is worth USD 321.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine.</p>

<p>Any statement from Mr Musk's Lawyers or the SEC was not available at the time of filing this story.</p>

<h2><strong>Market Regulator's Probe</strong></h2>

<p>The SEC is investigating whether Musk -- whose businesses include electric car maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX and who is the world's richest person-- violated securities laws in early 2022 by waiting at least 10 days too long to disclose he had begun accumulating Twitter stock.</p>

<p>Critics and some investors have said this let him buy shares cheaply before he eventually disclosed a 9.2 per cent Twitter stake, and shortly thereafter offered to buy the whole company.</p>

<p>In July, Mr Musk said he misunderstood SEC disclosure rules and that "all indications" suggested he made a "mistake."</p>

<p>The SEC also sued Mr Musk in 2018 over his Twitter posts about taking Tesla private. He settled that lawsuit by paying a USD 20 million fine, agreeing to let Tesla lawyers review some posts in advance and stepping down as Tesla's chairman.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a chilling Mafia-style warning, a severed horse's head was discovered on the property of a construction contractor in Altofonte, Sicily.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a typical Italian mafia intimidation practice, a horse's copped off head was found on the property of a businessman in Sicily. The grim discovery, which resembles a scene straight out of a mafia blockbuster <em>The Godfather</em> was made in Altofonte, a village on the outskirts of Palermo. The animal's head, completely soaked in blood, was left on the seat of a digger machine that belonged to the Italian businessman. The businessman is a construction contractor who works near Sicily's regional capital, Palermo. The body of a pregnant cow and its calf were also left on the site.</p>

<p>Angela De Luca, the mayor of Altofonte, said her community had been deeply disturbed. "I was petrified; I can't comprehend such barbarity," she said. "This act seems to take us back to the Middle Ages, with its unacceptable methods."</p>

<p>Marlon Brando played Don Vito Corleone in the iconic 1972 movie, which ends with a horse's head in the bed of cruel film director Jack Woltz after Woltz denies Corleone's godson a part.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/severed-horse-head-found-at-sicilian-property-in-echo-of-godfather-scene"><em>The Guardian,</em></a> the news sparked a row on the island, where more than 20 mafia bosses have been released from prison in recent months after serving their sentences. Delivering severed animal heads or dismembered animal bodies is among the most common intimidation tactics employed by the mafia in Sicily, predating<em>&nbsp;The Godfather.</em></p>

<p>According to investigators, the tactic serves the dual purpose of terrorising its victims and striking at their most cherished bonds: animals to which they are often deeply attached. Last May, the head of a goat was found in front of the home of a construction entrepreneur in Palermo, and in 2023, a pig's head was hung at the gate of a police station in the province of Messina.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G7 ministers meeting in Italy next week will discuss the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Friday, saying the issue required further analysis.</p>

<p>Israel and its allies denounced the ICC's decision on Thursday to issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli premier, even as Turkey -- and rights groups -- welcomed the move.</p>

<p>Meloni's hard-right coalition government appeared divided.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said Thursday that Italy would have to arrest Israel's premier if he visited, only for Meloni's deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, to say Netanyahu would be welcome in Italy.</p>

<p>"In the coming days I will delve deeper into the reasons that led to the ICC's decision. Reasons that should always be objective and not political in nature," Meloni said in a statement.</p>

<p>She said the issue would be put on the agenda of a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in Fiuggi, near Rome, on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>The ICC also issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu's former defence minister and for Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>"One point remains clear from this government -- there cannot be an equivalence between the responsibility of the state of Israel and the terrorist organisation Hamas," Meloni said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid heightened diplomatic tension with India, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called his own intelligence officials "criminals" for linking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar to violence on Canadian soil.</p>

<p>Addressing media in Brampton on Friday, Trudeau said, "We have seen, unfortunately, that criminals leaking top-secret information to the media have consistently gotten those stories wrong."</p>

<p>"That's why we had a national enquiry into foreign interference, which has highlighted that criminals leaking information to media outlets are unreliable on top of being criminals," he added.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The development came after Canada, on Thursday, fact-checked and denied a report linking top Indian leaders to criminal activities on Canadian soil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement posted on a government website, Nathalie Drouin, Mr Trudeau's intelligence adviser, said: "The Government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of the evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada. Any suggestion to the contrary is both speculative and inaccurate."</p>

<p>Canada's statement came after Globe and Mail newspaper published a report this week, alleging that Canadian security agencies believed PM Modi knew about the violent plots and said Mr Jaishankar and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval were also in the loop.</p>

<p>Last month, The Canadian foreign ministry alleged Union Home Minister Amit Shah was behind a campaign of intimidation in Canada. Ottawa says it has evidence linking Indian government agents to the 2023 murder of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who held a Canadian passport.</p>

<p>The ties between the two countries have come under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential involvement" of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who held a Canadian passport.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd". India has maintained that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>The row has escalated to a point where both countries have expelled each other's top diplomats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After the United Kingdom, Canada said it would "abide" by the arrest warrant issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court (ICC).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the United Kingdom, Canada said it would "abide" by the arrest warrant issued against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court (ICC).&nbsp;"We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is just who we are as Canadians," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli premier and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday for "crimes against humanity" committed since the Israel-Hamas war began more than a year ago, triggered by the militant Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued for Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>Earlier on Friday, the British government indicated that Netanyahu could be arrested on the ICC arrest warrant if he travelled to the UK.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman said: "The UK will always comply with its legal obligations as set out by domestic law and indeed international law."</p>

<p>However, he refused to be drawn specifically on whether UK police would detain Netanyahu, telling reporters he would not "get into hypotheticals in relation to individual cases".</p>

<p>Both the UK and Canada are part of the Five Eyes, an intelligence alliance also composed of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Other countries that agreed to follow through with the ICC's decision include-- Belgium, the European Union, France, Iran, Ireland, Jordan, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland, and Turkey among others.</p>

<p>Other key Five Eyes member US has, however, called the move 'outrageous'. "The ICC issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous," President Joe Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear once again: whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security," the statement added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the warrant was supported by&nbsp;US Senator Bernie Sanders, who took to X and said: “All launched indiscriminate attacks against civilians and caused unimaginable human suffering”.</p>

<p>“If the world does not uphold international law, we will descend into further barbarism,” he added.</p>

<p>Other countries to declare 'disagreement' with ICC decisions include-- Argentina, Austria, and Hungary, among others.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte held talks with US President-elect Donald Trump in Florida on the "global security issues facing the alliance", a spokeswoman said Saturday.</p>

<p>The meeting took place on Friday in Palm Beach, NATO's Farah Dakhlallah said in a statement.</p>

<p>In his first term Trump aggressively pushed Europe to step up defence spending and questioned the fairness of the NATO transatlantic alliance.</p>

<p>The former Dutch prime minister had said he wanted to meet Trump two days after Trump was elected on November 5, and discuss the threat of increasingly warming ties between North Korea and Russia.</p>

<p>Trump's thumping victory to return to the US presidency has set nerves jangling in Europe that he could pull the plug on vital Washington military aid for Ukraine.</p>

<p>NATO allies say keeping Kyiv in the fight against Moscow is key to both European and American security.</p>

<p>"What we see more and more is that North Korea, Iran, China and of course Russia are working together, working together against Ukraine," Rutte said recently at a European leaders' meeting in Budapest.</p>

<p>"At the same time, Russia has to pay for this, and one of the things they are doing is delivering technology to North Korea", which he warned was threatening to the "mainland of the US (and) continental Europe".</p>

<p>"I look forward to sitting down with Donald Trump to discuss how we can face these threats collectively," Rutte said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian researchers have discovered the oldest direct evidence of hot water activity on Mars, revealing that the planet may have once been habitable.</p>

<p>In a study published on Saturday, a team led by researchers from Curtin University in Western Australia analyzed a 4.45 billion-year-old zircon grain from the famous Martian meteorite NWA7034, also known as Black Beauty, that was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011.</p>

<p>The researchers found that the grain of zircon, a type of mineral, contained geochemical fingerprints of water-rich fluids, suggesting that water was present during early Martian magmatic activity.</p>

<p>Aaron Cavosie, a co-author of the study from Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said that the discovery would open up new avenues for understanding ancient Martian hydrothermal systems, as well as the planet's past capacity to support life.</p>

<p>"We used nano-scale geochemistry to detect elemental evidence of hot water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago," he said, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Hydrothermal systems were essential for the development of life on Earth and our findings suggest Mars also had water, a key ingredient for habitable environments, during the earliest history of crust formation."</p>

<p>He said that even though Mars' crust endured major meteorite impacts that caused surface upheaval, the research shows that water was present on the planet during the early Pre-Noachian period prior to about 4.1 billion years ago.</p>

<p>The study also involved researchers from the University of Adelaide and was led by Jack Gillespie, a former research associate at Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences now at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Laos government said Saturday it was "profoundly saddened" by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/four-tourists-die-after-suspected-laos-methanol-poisoning-7070694">deaths of foreign tourists in Vang Vieng</a>, with the toll from a suspected methanol poisoning incident now at six.</p>

<p>Two Danish citizens, an American, a Briton and two Australians have now died after being rushed to hospital following a night out in backpacker hot spot Vang Vieng.</p>

<p>They were among a group of about a dozen foreigners who fell ill and were rushed to hospital shortly after November 12.</p>

<p>In a statement on its website, Laos' Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday it expressed "sincere sympathy and deepest condolences to the families of the deceased", adding an investigation was underway.</p>

<p>Australian Holly Bowles, 19, became the incident's latest fatality on Friday when she died in a Bangkok hospital surrounded by family.</p>

<p>Canberra is pressing Laotian authorities for a full and transparent investigation into what happened.</p>

<p>Vang Vieng has been a fixture on the Southeast Asia backpacker trail since Laos' secretive communist rulers opened the country to tourism decades ago.</p>

<p>The town was once synonymous with backpackers behaving badly at jungle parties but has since re-branded as an eco-tourism destination.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese manager of the Nana Backpackers Hostel where the tourists were staying has been detained for questioning, the Laos tourist police told AFP.</p>

<p>No charges have been filed thus far.</p>

<p>Police in Laos could not be reached for comment on Saturday.</p>

<p>Alcohol tainted with methanol, a toxic alcohol usually used in industrial and household products like antifreeze, is suspected to be the cause of the deaths.</p>

<p>It can be added to liquor to increase its potency but can cause blindness, liver damage and death.</p>

<p>Danish, Australian and British officials released statements confirming the deaths of their nationals in the week following the incident.</p>

<p>On their travel advice websites, UK and Australian authorities have warned their citizens to beware of methanol poisoning while consuming alcohol in Laos.</p>

<p>But in Vang Vieng, business seemed to be going on as usual.</p>

<p>"I heard the news but everything is normal here," Michael, a manager at Vangvieng Rock Backpacker Rooftop Hostel told AFP on Friday, asking to use only one name.</p>

<p>"The high season is about to start, so we are welcoming more tourists every day."</p>

<p>"There are still many tourists in town, and they go partying," a receptionist at Vang Vieng Chill House Hostel told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after 24-year-old Harshita Brella - an Indian woman from Delhi living with her husband in the UK - was found dead with her body stashed away in the boot of a car, his family has pointed to a dowry angle in the case.</p>

<p>Harshita Brella married Pankaj Lamba - who has been missing since her murder - on March 22 this year. Now, Sonia Brella, the elder sister of Harshita, suspects that she was murdered for dowry even though they had given the Lamba family gold and money during the wedding.</p>

<p>"The family had given a lot of dowry to Pankaj but still he was not happy, he kept demanding dowry from us," she told ANI.</p>

<p>An investigation by the Northamptonshire Police suggests that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/harshita-brella-murder-family-claims-accused-husband-preplanned-killing-7082982">Harshita Brella</a> was murdered on November 10. On the same night, she was seen walking with her husband by a boating lake in Corby where she lived.</p>

<p>As per the police, Harshita Brella's body had been transported from Corby to east London - some 145 kilometers away - by car, which was found parked with her body on Brisbane Road, Ilford on November 14. The car allegedly belonged to her husband.</p>

<p>Earlier, her father, Sabir Brella, also alleged that Lamba and his family used to harass her for dowry. "Pankaj used to beat her and force her to get money. Due to the regular fights, she started living separately and working in a warehouse. Despite living separately, he would handle her bank accounts," he said.</p>

<p>However, she kept giving money to him "with a hope that some day things will become normal", her father said, adding, " She didn't know that this would be the end.</p>

<p>"On August 29, when Pankaj had beaten her she lodged a complaint against him. Subsequently, his family members had come at our house here and again started demanding dowry, due to which my father sold some property to fulfill their demand and by February we were able to fulfill the demand. We were about to fulfil their demands after we got the money in hand," Sonia Brella said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/family-of-indian-origin-woman-found-dead-in-car-boot-in-uk-call-for-justice-7059224">Harshita Brella</a> was the subject of a 28-day domestic violence order against Lamba, which had not been renewed at the time of her killing.</p>

<p>"She used to give us every moment's information. This case was closed on October 30 when Pankaj paid the fine, but Harshita was not informed about it," her sister claimed.</p>

<p>Recalling her last video call with Harshita, her sister said, "We had the last video call with Harshita on November 10 when she told us that she was preparing food for Pankaj who was coming over for dinner."</p>

<p>"From the next day her phone was not reachable. We had a feeling that Pankaj had killed her by then," she added.</p>

<p>Even as the police are looking for Pankaj Lamba and released a series of CCTV images of him, her family claimed that he fled to India a day after the brutal murder.</p>

<p>"We have proof of him coming back to India, which we have told to London police. Here no one is helping us. We have also approached our local police and filed a complaint of dowry harassment against Pankaj and her parents," Sonia Brella said.</p>

<p>Harshita Brella's body might reach India in a week or two, she added.</p>

<p>Her sister also alleged that Lamba's family knows his whereabouts and is aware of the murder: "When I called Pankaj's mother about the news, she coolly replied that at least my sister was returning back. She said her son's whereabouts are not known. But, on the other hand, they are not even trying to find his whereabouts and are calm. This behaviour raises suspicions."</p>

<p>Earlier this week, an inquest into Harshita Brella's killing was opened in Northampton and adjourned until May 21, 2025, while the murder investigation remains ongoing. The provisional cause of her death was noted as "manual strangulation pending toxicology and histology" at the inquest hearing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Saturday that his company will balance legal compliance and technological advances under the incoming administration of Donald Trump, and nothing will stop the global advancement of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The US chipmaking giant this week reported record high quarterly revenue on the back of strong AI chip demand, though investors are wary of US-China tensions reheating during a new Trump term.</p>

<p>The Taiwan-born entrepreneur was in Hong Kong to receive an honorary doctorate in engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens, we'll balance simultaneously compliance with laws and policies, continue to advance our technology, and support and serve customers all over the world," Huang told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We'll continue to do that and we'll be able to do that just fine."</p>

<p>The Biden administration has restricted Nvidia from selling some of its top AI chips to China, which it sees as a strategic competitor in the field of advanced semiconductors.</p>

<p>Huang said Saturday that "open science and open research in AI is absolutely global... nothing that I see in the future is going to stop that."</p>

<p>Huang said in a speech that the "age of AI has started" and lauded China's "significant contributions" to the scientific research that push forward AI technology.</p>

<p>"AI is certainly the most important technology of our time, and potentially at all times," he said.</p>

<p>Tech giants around the world have invested tens of billions of dollars into Nvidia's technology to train their generative AI models and support their heavy computing needs.</p>

<p>Nvidia surpassed Apple early this month to become the highest valued company in the world as the artificial intelligence boom continues to excite Wall Street.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States has convicted two, including an Indian national, of charges related to Human smuggling after an Indian migrant family froze to death while attempting to cross the Canada-US border during a blizzard in 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has convicted two, including an Indian national, of charges related to Human smuggling after an Indian migrant family froze to death while attempting to cross the Canada-US border during a blizzard in 2022. A Minnesota jury found that Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, an Indian national known by the alias “Dirty Harry,” and Florida resident Steve Shand, were part of a sophisticated illegal operation that has brought increasing numbers of Indians into the US, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Patel (29) and Shand (50) were each convicted on four counts related to human smuggling, including conspiracy to bring migrants into the country illegally. The most serious counts carry maximum sentences of up to 20 years in prison, The Associated Press reported quoting the US Attorney's Office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the guidelines for federal sentencing in the US rely on complicated formulas. according to Minnesota US Attorney Andy Luger, various factors will be considered to determine what sentences prosecutors will recommend for the convicted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Case</strong></h2>

<p>The victims—39-year-old Jagdish Patel, his wife Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s, their 11-year-old daughter Vihangi, and three-year-old son Dharmik—were found frozen to death near Emerson town of Manitoba province by Canadian authorities on January 19, 2022, while trying to cross the border into Minnesota in a scheme Patel and Shand organized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family was originally from Dingucha village in Gujarat's Gandhinagar district. Patel and his wife were reportedly schoolteachers and their family was fairly well off by local standards. Patels were part of an 11-member group of undocumented Indian migrants who had paid smugglers to navigate their illegal entry into the US.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>

<p>The verdict in the case came on Friday at the end of the five-day federal trial in Minnesota's Fergus Falls.</p>

<p>Condemning the operation, US Attorney Luger said, "This trial exposed the unthinkable cruelty of human smuggling and of those criminal organizations that value profit and greed over humanity."</p>

<p>“To earn a few thousand dollars, these traffickers put men, women and children in extraordinary peril leading to the horrific and tragic deaths of an entire family. Because of this unimaginable greed, a father, a mother and two children froze to death in sub-zero temperatures on the Minnesota-Canadian border,” he added.</p>

<p>During the trial, Defence attorneys from both accused were pitted against each other. Shand's team said that their client was unwittingly roped into Patel's smuggling scheme, while Patel's lawyers argued that he had been misidentified.</p>

<p>Patel's team said that “Dirty Hary,” the alleged nickname for their client found in Shand's phone, is a different person, according to The Canadian Press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the prosecutors argued that Patel was the coordinator of the smuggling operation while Shand was a driver. They said that Shand was to pick up 11 Indian migrants on the Minnesota side of the border, however, only seven survived the foot crossing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Patel family was found by Canadian authorities later that morning, dead from the cold.</p>

<p>During the trial, Yash Patel, a 29-year-old survivor who managed to cross over and reach the van driven by Shand on the fateful day, also testified. He told the court that the group had separated after stepping into the blizzard. The van was later caught by the Border Patrol Police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trial also included an inside account of an alleged participant in the smuggling ring. Rajinder Singh, 51, a survivor of the treacherous journey across the northern border, testified that he made over USD 400,000 smuggling over 500 people through the same network that included Patel and Shand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the AP report, Singh said most of the people he smuggled came from Gujarat state. He said the migrants would often pay smugglers about USD 100,000 to get them from India to the US, where they would work to pay off their debts at low-wage jobs in cities around the country. According to Singh, smugglers ran their finances through “hawala,” an informal money transfer system that relies on trust.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's massive sinkholes, particularly those in Guangxi province, have gained massive popularity among tourists, drawing visitors eager to explore their ancient ecosystems. But while these natural wonders offer a unique glimpse into Earth's past, experts warn the influx of tourists may threaten the fragile habitats hidden within these sinkholes.</p>

<p>Ranging from 100 to 300 metres in depth, these sinkholes — locally known as “tiankeng” or “heavenly pits” — have long been shrouded in myth. Ancient local beliefs held that the mist rising from the depths was caused by demons and ghosts, adding an air of mystery to the already dangerous terrain. But now, these sites have become increasingly accessible, with guided tours and even extreme sports activities like abseiling attracting tourists from across the country.</p>

<p>Rui, a tourist from Shanghai, expressed her excitement at exploring one such sinkhole. She told <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8697gqwyx6o" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">BBC</a>, “I've never done this kind of thing before. It's very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.”</p>

<p>Fei Ge, a tour guide in his 50s, who, according to the BBC report, was one of the first explorers of these sinkholes, recalls the legends surrounding the pits. “We thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog,” he said.</p>

<p>His curiosity led him to become one of the earliest explorers of these sites, eventually introducing scientists to the area. Their discoveries were groundbreaking, having identified rare and previously unknown species of plants and animals, including orchids, white cave fish and several types of spiders and snails.</p>

<p>China is home to around two-thirds of the world's more than 300 sinkholes, and Guangxi alone has over 30. These sinkholes are formed in limestone-rich regions where underground rivers gradually erode the rock, creating vast caverns that eventually collapse, leaving deep holes behind. These pits are isolated from the outside world, allowing ecosystems to thrive, largely untouched by human activity.</p>

<p>Dr Lina Shen, a sinkhole researcher, highlighted the importance of preserving these unique habitats. “We should better protect such habitats. Sinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species.” Dr Shen suggested that measures such as “hot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance” could help minimise human impact on these delicate sites while allowing people to “closely yet remotely view sinkholes.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Japanese make-up trend, involving the use of hot melted glue to create tear-like droplet shapes that are then placed on the face, is going viral among teenage schoolgirls, according to a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3287505/japan-new-make-trend-teen-girls-uses-hot-melted-glue-create-tear-droplets?module=hp_section_people-culture&amp;pgtype=homepage" rel="noindex, nofollow">South China Morning Post </a>(SCMP).&nbsp;</em>The trendy style, known as "3D teardrop make-up" gives the girls a delicate appearance that is intended to evoke sympathy -- making them look as if they are crying. The trend has spread rapidly across Japanese schools with a shortage of hot melt glue guns also reported in some areas.</p>

<p>As per experts, such bizarre trends routinely come up on social media in the country and last a few weeks. The make-up process involves squeezing super hot glue onto a smooth surface, such as a plastic sheet. Once the glue cools and solidifies, it can be removed and attached to the face using fake eyelash glue.</p>

<p>However, the trend has drawn criticism from netizens with many worried that some impressionable teenagers might harm themselves while using the hot glue. Many have labelled the entire trend as "ridiculous" and "bizarre" and called out those participating in it.</p>

<p>“Seriously? Are secondary school girls really into this kind of inappropriate trend now?” a user was quoted as saying by the outlet, while another commented: “Wait, doesn't this hot glue tear make-up look suspiciously like sperm?”</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the hot melted glue trend has taken off. Last year, TikTok beauty creator, Vanessa Funes, better known as @cutcreaser, posted a video where she used hot glue gun to create a space-age eyeliner look.</p>

<p>“The first design I made was inspired by the Mandalorian's Beskar armour but melted. So, I thought of melted metal and how that would look as an eyeliner design," said Ms Funes, whose video with the hashtag #hotgluemakeup, managed to garner 14.9 million views.</p>

<p>Experts suggest that the hot glue should not be directly placed on the face in any condition. It is recommended to use a stainless-steel surface or parchment paper as a base to draw the desired designs if one intends to go through with the trend.</p>

<h3><strong>Unconventional beauty trends</strong></h3>

<p>In September this year, a viral beauty trend in the US urged the netizens to eat dirt as a remedy for health issues. The peculiar practice, touted to improve gut health, skin problems, and even obesity, gained significant traction on TikTok.</p>

<p>Edible clay and soil products were being sold on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Etsy, ranging from powders to clay chunks, priced between Rs 900 to Rs 2,200.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US antitrust lawyers are calling on a judge to force the sale of Google's Chrome browser to limit the company's market clout in a move that would shake up the internet giant.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the US Department of Justice submitted its recommendation for the breakup to US District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who is set to impose steps next year to address Google's monopoly power in online search.</p>

<p><strong>Blow to Google?</strong></p>

<p>"This would be a huge gut punch to Google," said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.</p>

<p>Google provides free search, making money off targeting ads and features that promote online commerce.</p>

<p>"It would greatly alter (Google's) business model," said Syracuse University professor of advertising Beth Egan.</p>

<p>Selling Chrome would also deprive Google of a rich source of information used to train its algorithms and promote its other services like Maps.</p>

<p>Launched in 2008, Chrome dominates the browser market, dwarfing rivals Edge and Safari, developed by Microsoft and Apple, respectively.</p>

<p>Egan believed Google would find a way to recover if forced to sell Chrome.</p>

<p>"I don't think divesting the browser is going to kill Google as a company," Egan said.</p>

<p>She noted that it could be its users who wind up suffering, given the case Google is making in blog posts on the matter.</p>

<p><strong>What is Chrome worth?</strong></p>

<p>A Bloomberg analyst estimates that Chrome, which is used by more than three billion people around the world, would sell for at least $15 billion.</p>

<p>But given the lack of precedent, predicting how much Chrome would fetch on the market is tricky.</p>

<p>A Chinese investment group bought an internet browser from Opera Software ASA in Norway for $600 million in 2016, but it only claimed 350 million users at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Who might buy it?</strong></p>

<p>There are very few potential buyers for Chrome, according to Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.</p>

<p>"It's likely that any company with deep enough pockets to afford Chrome is already under antitrust scrutiny," Mitchell-Wolf said.</p>

<p>"If I had to speculate, my inclination is to look at US-based artificial intelligence players."</p>

<p>While Chrome being bought by the likes of OpenAI would certainly raise antitrust concerns, the US government could see it as a way for the nation to prioritize innovation on the global stage.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's AI startup could conceivably be a Chrome contender, bankrolled by his riches and having the deal cleared thanks to his close working relationship with incoming president Donald Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Win for rivals?</strong></p>

<p>Analysts agreed that people will keep using Chrome regardless of who owns it, provided the quality doesn't plummet.</p>

<p>"This assumes Chrome retains its most popular features and continues innovating," said analyst Mitchell-Wolf.</p>

<p>"Search behaviors are a function of convenience first, trust and experience second."</p>

<p>The justice department's argument that people use Chrome because it is a default search engine in devices is off the mark, the analyst added.</p>

<p><strong>Trump factor</strong></p>

<p>Many doubt that Judge Mehta will embrace all of the justice department's proposed remedies in the case.</p>

<p>CFRA analyst Angelo Zino considered the measures "extreme and unlikely to be imposed by the court."</p>

<p>The incoming Trump administration also "remains a wild card" regarding whether justice officials will back off the idea of breaking up Google.</p>

<p>Trump in October indicated he opposes dismantling Google, believing such a move would be against the interests of the US internationally.</p>

<p>"China is afraid of Google" and a breakup would hurt the company, Trump reasoned at the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump has also accused Google of being unfair to conservatives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos has reacted to Elon Musk's claim that the Amazon founder had advised people to sell their Tesla and SpaceX stocks because he expected Donald Trump to lose the US election. Musk, who is the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, posted on Thursday that he "just learned that at Mar-a-Lago Jeff Bezos was telling everyone Donald Trump would lose for sure, so they should sell their Tesla and SpaceX stock". Hours later, Mr Bezos responded to the tweet, refuting the claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nope. 100% not true," the billionaire, who also owns The Washington Post and aerospace giant Blue Origin, wrote. "Well, then, I stand corrected," Elon Musk replied with a laughing face emoji.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Well, then, I stand corrected ?</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1859644231394218321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Notably, Jeff Bezos' tweet is his first since November 6 when he broke his four-month silence on the microblogging platform to congratulate Donald Trump. "Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love," he tweeted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, before this, Mr Bezos made headlines after<em> The Washington Post</em> decided to stop making presidential endorsements. According to <em>Deadline</em>, the publication had planned to endorse Kamala Harris. Mr Bezos said that the action was necessary to help restore trust in the media.</p>

<p>However, after facing criticism over non-endorsement, the Amazon boss explained in an op-ed article that presidential endorsements created the "perception of bias" and did not "tip the scales" of an election.</p>

<p>"No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, 'I'm going with Newspaper A's endorsement'. None," Mr Bezos wrote. "What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it's the right one," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk, on the other hand, reportedly spent more than $100 million to boost Donald Trump's election bid. Now, Mr Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been appointed by the president-elect to lead an effort called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to remake the federal government and provide guidance for massive cuts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union, United States and other wealthy countries at the COP29 climate summit have agreed to raise their offer of a global finance target to $300 billion per year by 2035, sources told Reuters on Saturday.</p>

<p>The shift in position came after a $250 billion proposal for a deal, drafted by Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency on Friday, was panned by developing countries as insultingly low.</p>

<p>Five sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions said the EU had agreed they could accept the higher number. Two of the sources said the United States, Australia and Britain were also on board.</p>

<p>Delegates at the UN climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan were awaiting a new draft of a global deal on climate finance on Saturday morning, after negotiators worked through the night.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the wealthy countries' revised position had been communicated to developing countries at COP29.</p>

<p>A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations. The U.S. delegation at COP29 did not immediately respond to a request&nbsp;for&nbsp;comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A notorious Venezuelan prison gang has established a presence in at least 16 US states, covering nearly half the nation's population, according to a recent internal intelligence memo from Homeland Security.</p>

<p>The memo highlights the Tren de Aragua (TdA)'s growing foothold in various parts of the country, most recently in Washington, DC, Virginia, Montana, and Wyoming, The <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/19/us-news/tren-de-aragua-has-already-set-up-shop-in-these-16-states-homeland-security-warns/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Post</a> reported. The group is also reportedly active in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>As the gang spreads, its “violent tendencies” have reportedly escalated, causing growing concern among law enforcement agencies. Homeland Security's memo pointed to a correlation between the arrival of TdA members in new regions and the increase in local migrant populations, warning that “the potential for violent TdA migrants is highly probable.”</p>

<p>In August 2023, three people were detained for shoplifting in Fairfax County, Virginia, following a run-in with suspected TdA members. All three suspects had gang-related tattoos, and one had a fake Venezuelan ID.</p>

<p>The DC area is seen as a strategic base for the gang, which reportedly uses its proximity to Virginia's suburbs to engage in theft, robbery, and assault. Homeland Security also flagged an uptick in “lower-level fraud and theft schemes,” with stolen funds being wired back to South America to finance further criminal activities.</p>

<p>In one case, a suspected TdA member in Florida withdrew $1,18,000 from a bank account using fraudulent cheque deposits, transferring the funds to Venezuela before the fraud could be detected.</p>

<p>In Wyoming, where the gang's presence has been relatively limited, Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak revealed the arrest of a suspected TdA member.</p>

<p>Tren de Aragua members are believed to have infiltrated the US amid a massive wave of migrants crossing the southern border during the Joe Biden administration. A lack of information-sharing between the US and Venezuela has hindered the detection of gang members, enabling their release into the country, according to US Border Patrol sources, reported New York Post.</p>

<p>Efforts to deport Venezuelan nationals face significant roadblocks due to strained relations between Washington and the Venezuelan government, which has refused to accept deportation flights.</p>

<p>Reports of TdA's activities range from violent crimes to sophisticated trafficking networks. In New York, the gang has been linked to shootings, robberies, and gun smuggling in migrant shelters. Members are also reportedly involved in sex trafficking, particularly on Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.</p>

<p>Tennessee has also emerged as a hotspot for the gang's operations, with human trafficking rings and retail crime thefts reported in cities such as Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, and Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The expanding influence of Tren de Aragua has drawn attention from political leaders. US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to prioritise cracking down on the gang, promising a historic mass deportation effort involving both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the US military.</p>]]></content:encoded>

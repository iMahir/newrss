       <description><![CDATA[A UCSF study involving 20,880 people across 106 countries has found a possible connection between depression and elevated body temperatures.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent research from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has revealed a significant link between depression and body temperature, offering fresh perspectives on possible treatment approaches.</p>

<p>Over the course of seven months, data from 20,880 people in 106 countries was gathered and examined for the study. According to the research, some people may have greater body temperatures than others when they are depressed.</p>

<p>The study is among the biggest to investigate this field because earlier research was sometimes constrained by small sample sizes. The association found may pave the way for more research, even if the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/01/427051/are-body-temperature-and-depression-linked-science-says-yes">UCSF study</a> does not conclusively demonstrate that depression causes elevated body temperature or that depression causes elevated body temperature.</p>

<p>The findings shed light on how a novel depression treatment method might work, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/01/427051/are-body-temperature-and-depression-linked-science-says-yes">said Ashley Mason</a>, PhD, the study's lead author and associate professor of psychiatry at UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. A small body of existing, causal studies has found that using hot tubs or saunas can reduce depression, possibly by triggering the body to self-cool, for example, through sweating.</p>

<p>"Ironically, heating people up actually can lead to rebound body temperature lowering that lasts longer than simply cooling people down directly, as through an ice bath," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/01/427051/are-body-temperature-and-depression-linked-science-says-yes">said Mason</a>, who is also a clinical psychologist at the UCSF Osher Centre for Integrative Health. "What if we can track the body temperature of people with depression to time heat-based treatments well?"</p>

<p>"To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date to examine the association between body temperature-assessed using both self-report methods and wearable sensors-and depressive symptoms in a geographically broad sample," added Mason. "Given the climbing rates of depression in the United States, we're excited by the possibilities of a new avenue for treatment."</p>

<p>This new connection may result in easy ways to treat the symptoms of depression. The treatment of millions of people worldwide may change if more research confirms the notion that cooling therapy may help those suffering from depression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The streets of Paiporta, Spain, were blazing with rage and frustration on Sunday when King Felipe VI arrived to inspect the damage from the unprecedented flash floods that killed more than 200 people earlier in the week, according to <em>The Guardian.</em></p>

<p>As the king's entourage tried to manage the situation, a chaotic scene unfolded with crowds throwing mud and objects and shouting insults. Protesters yelled "Murderers!" and "Get out!" in response to the king's presence.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/us-man-wins-rs-25-crore-lottery-prize-thanks-to-forgotten-lunch-6936111#pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories"><strong>Also Read | US Man Wins ₹ 25 Crore Lottery Prize Thanks To Forgotten Lunch</strong></a></p>

<p>With calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Valencia regional head Carlos Mazon, a large portion of the fury appeared to be directed at elected leaders. Bodyguards used umbrellas to protect Sanchez and his group from the mud and debris as they swiftly departed the scene.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/residents-throw-mud-and-insults-at-spanish-king-on-visit-to-flood-hit-town"><em>The Guardian,</em></a> the public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help.</p>

<p>"We're very angry, and we're devastated," said Guillermo Lujan, the mayor of Aldaia. "We have a town in ruins. We need to start over, and I'm begging for help. Please help us."</p>

<p>The town's 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain's modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Swing states" - the elephant in the room is the major decider of the United States presidential election. Also known as battleground states, these states can make or break any candidate.</p>

<p>Historically speaking, in the United States, presidential elections are often shaped by three types of states: Red States, Blue States, and Swing States. Red States are those where Republicans have consistently won since 1980, while Blue States are where Democrats have dominated since 1992. These states are generally considered predictable in terms of their electoral outcomes.</p>

<p>However, Swing States are a different story altogether. Here, the battle between Republicans and Democrats is often extremely close, with winners prevailing by tiny margins. For instance, in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won Arizona by just 10,000 votes.</p>

<p>Around 10 states have been considered swing states, but for the 2024 election, the key swing states to watch are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Interestingly, candidates often focus their campaigns on these swing states, spending disproportionate amounts of time to win these states.</p>

<p>According to polls taken by YouGov till 31st October, Vice President Kamala Harris leads by small margins in Wisconsin (4 percentage points), Pennsylvania (+3), Michigan (+3), and Nevada (+1). Trump barely leads in North Carolina (+1) and Georgia (+1) and Arizona is tied.</p>

<p>Georgia</p>

<p>Biden's 2020 victory marked the first Democratic win in Georgia since 1992. The state's shifting demographics, particularly its growing diversity and expanding population of over 10 million, are expected to benefit Kamala Harris, who has actively courted minority voters. However, the 2024 election has revealed an unexpected trend: Vice President Kamala Harris is performing stronger in predominantly white states like Michigan and Wisconsin, while more diverse states are slightly favoring former President Donald Trump. This surprising dynamic is also evident in Georgia, highlighting a shift in traditional voting patterns.</p>

<p>Nevada</p>

<p>Nevada may hold the key to winning the presidential election, despite having only six electoral votes. Its diverse population, with 40% of eligible voters identifying as Latino, Black, or Asian American Pacific Islanders, could play a crucial role. Historically, these groups have shown stronger support for Kamala Harris than Donald Trump. However, economic concerns such as the rising cost of living, inflation, and immigration may shift the tide in Trump's favor.</p>

<p>Michigan</p>

<p>Michigan, a state with 15 electoral votes, has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold, but Donald Trump's 2016 win shook things up. His appeal to white working-class voters secured his victory, dealing a surprise blow to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Fast forward to 2024, and Michigan's diversity could give Kamala Harris an edge, particularly since it's more diverse than other contested "blue wall" states. However, there is work involved when it comes to the Arab-American side of the state as they have expressed dissatisfaction with the way the war in Gaza has been handled by the Biden administration.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, once a reliable Democratic stronghold, has become a fiercely contested battleground state. It has 19 electoral college votes and is the most coveted by both the parties. The state's transformation is rooted in its economic challenges, particularly the decline of its industrial manufacturing base in "Rust Belt" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. This decline has left many residents seeking change and opportunity. Both Trump and Harris have frequently campaigned in the state, addressing key issues like infrastructure and manufacturing.</p>

<p>Arizona</p>

<p>Arizona was a nail-biter in the 2020 presidential election, with Biden securing a narrow victory of just 10,457 votes. Now, Trump is banking on voter dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies to turn the state red again. As Arizona shares a border with Mexico, immigration is a hot-button issue, and Trump hopes to capitalise on frustrations with the current administration.</p>

<p>North Carolina</p>

<p>North Carolina, once a reliable Republican stronghold in presidential elections, is now a toss-up state due to its rapidly shifting demographics. Historically, the state voted Republican for most of the last half-century, with the notable exception of Barack Obama's win in 2008. However, the state's population growth, particularly in the Research Triangle, has brought an influx of white, college-educated voters, Latinos, Asian Americans, and a significant Black population, making up about 1 in 5 voters.</p>

<p>Wisconsin</p>

<p>Trump considers Wisconsin winnable and has taken steps to demonstrate his commitment to the state. The Republican Party even held its national convention there over the summer. Initially, Trump held a lead against Biden, but Kamala Harris has since closed the gap, making the state a nail-biting contest.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India, which is on the path of growth, wants to grow with the world, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Sunday, stressing that there is genuine goodwill and desire among nations to work with India.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaishankar arrived here earlier in the day on the first leg of his two-nation tour which will also take him to Singapore.</p>

<p>"Namaste Australia! Landed in Brisbane today. Look forward to productive engagements over the next few days to take forward the India-Australia Dosti," he posted on X.</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian community here, Mr. Jaishankar said: "India will grow. India is growing, but India wants to grow with the world."</p>

<p>When India looks at the world, it sees opportunities, he said.</p>

<p>"We are optimistic. There may be problems, but overall, we think the world has goodwill and a desire to work with India. We see a sentiment overall in the world for India to succeed and it's important we harness that sentiment," Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>He mentioned that there are numerous opportunities for global cooperation in the fields of education and research.</p>

<p>"The image today of Indians abroad, the image of being well educated, of being personally responsible, the work ethic, the family-centric nature of our lives. I think the combination of all of this today makes us very, very attractive in the global workplace," he said.</p>

<p>"And I think it's important that that brand is developed, that those skills are nurtured...And again, I emphasise that this era, you know, this era of AI, of electric mobility, of chips, this will require a global workforce," he added.</p>

<p>During his visit, Mr. Jaishankar will inaugurate India's fourth consulate in Australia in Brisbane.</p>

<p>He will also co-chair the 15th Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue (FMFD) with his Australian counterpart Penny Wong in Canberra.</p>

<p>He will deliver the keynote address at the inaugural session of the 2nd Raisina Down Under to be held in the Australian Parliament House.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to have interactions with Australian leadership, parliamentarians, the business community, media and think tanks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and China have made "some progress" in disengagement, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Sunday, describing the development as a "welcome" step.</p>

<p>His comment comes days after Indian and Chinese troops completed disengagement at two friction points at Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh. The Indian Army commenced verification patrolling at Depsang, while patrolling at Demchok had begun on Friday.</p>

<p>"In terms of India and China, we have made some progress. You know, our relations were very, very disturbed for reasons all of you know. We have made some progress in what we call disengagement," Mr. Jaishankar said while responding to a question during an interaction with the Indian diaspora here.</p>

<p>"There are very large numbers of Chinese troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control who were not there before 2020 and we, in turn, have counter-deployed. There are other aspects of the relationship which also got affected during during this period. So clearly, we have to see after the disengagement, what is the direction we go. But we do think the disengagement is a welcome step. It opens up the possibility that you know, other steps could happen," said the minister.</p>

<p>He said that the expectation after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia last month was that "both the national security advisor and myself, we would meet our counterpart. So that's really where things are".</p>

<p>On October 21, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in Delhi that an agreement had been finalised between India and China following negotiations over the past several weeks and that it would lead to a resolution of the issues that arose in 2020.</p>

<p>The agreement was firmed up on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff.</p>

<p>The ties between the two Asian giants nosedived following a fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaishankar arrived here earlier in the day on the first leg of his two-nation tour which will also take him to Singapore.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump began a frantic last push across US swing states Sunday, with less than 48 hours of campaigning left to secure a decisive edge in a bitterly fought and historically close presidential election.</p>

<p>Over 75 million people have cast early ballots ahead of Tuesday's climax and the race is down to the wire -- with more states functionally tied in polls at this point than in any comparable election.</p>

<p>The closeness of the race is all the more remarkable given its dramatic twists -- including an assassination bid and Harris's stunning late entrance -- and the fact that the candidates could hardly be further apart in their campaign styles and visions for the future.</p>

<p>A final New York Times/Siena poll on Sunday flagged some incremental changes in the key battleground states, but the results from all seven remained firmly within the margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris -- desperate to shore up the Great Lakes states seen as essential to any Democratic ticket -- was to spend the day in Michigan, beginning in Detroit before a stop in Pontiac and an evening rally at Michigan State University.</p>

<p>Trump's Sunday timetable centers on Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, the three biggest prizes in the "Electoral College" system that awards states influence according to their population.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old has been scrambling to distract from the now week-long scandal around his rally at New York's iconic Madison Square Garden in which warm-up speakers alienated Hispanics and women with racist and sexist language.</p>

<p>Trump surrogates winced at the unforced error, which looked especially unprofessional when contrasted with Harris's address to a massive, jubilant crowd in Washington, with the White House providing the backdrop.</p>

<p>None of Trump's Sunday events take place in areas with large Hispanic populations but Pennsylvania is the swing state with the most Puerto Ricans, a community particularly angered by the bigotry at Trump's rally.</p>

<p><strong>Final polls</strong></p>

<p>Michigan is one of the seven closely watched battlegrounds.</p>

<p>Trump flipped the state, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden returned it to the Democratic column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Pollsters have noted an erosion in Black support for the Democratic ticket and Harris's aides acknowledge that they still have work to do to turn out enough African American men to match Biden's winning coalition in 2020.</p>

<p>But with reproductive rights emerging as a top voter concern, her campaign has taken some comfort from the large proportion of women turning out among the early voters.</p>

<p>In a bid to reach out beyond her traditional support bases, Harris wrapped a day on the campaign trail Saturday with a surprise appearance on "Saturday Night Live," mocking her presidential election rival Donald Trump on the iconic sketch show.</p>

<p>"Keep Kamala and carry on-ala!" the vice president said in a well-received appearance alongside Maya Rudolph, the comedian who has been playing her as "America's fun aunt" on the show.</p>

<p>Keen on as much TV exposure as possible, the Harris campaign has booked a two-minute spot to air during Sunday's NFL football games, including the matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions, both from crucial swing states.</p>

<p>In the ad, Harris pledges to be "a president for all Americans" and promises to "build a brighter future for our nation."</p>

<p>Her campaign said its own research shows the "last week has proven decisive in cementing the choice in this election with both undecided and lower-propensity voters," particularly the contrast of two candidates' closing argument rallies.</p>

<p>Harris, 60, got a boost Saturday as the final Des Moines Register poll before Election Day -- seen as a highly credible test of wider public sentiment -- showed a stunning turnaround, with Harris ahead in a state won easily by Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>She leads by three points in a poll that showed her trailing Trump by four points in September.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance on "Saturday Night Live" just days before the election, playing herself alongside Maya Rudolph's impression of her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The audience erupted in cheers as Harris, dressed identically to Rudolph, said, "It is nice to see you, Kamala. And I'm just here to remind you, you got this."</p>

<p>The two then delivered a synchronised message, urging supporters to "Keep Kamala and carry-on-ala" and expressing their shared "belief in the promise of America." They wrapped up the sketch with the iconic "Live from New York, it's Saturday night!"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="tl">Kamala Harris talks to Kamala Harris <a href="https://t.co/AJuW7aO7VM">pic.twitter.com/AJuW7aO7VM</a></p>
— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1852921270159163900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The episode, hosted by John Mulaney and featuring musical guest Chappell Roan, shifted focus away from politics after Harris's opening segment. Harris left after the opening segment and told reporters, “It was fun!” as she boarded the plane to leave New York.</p>

<p>Mulaney talked about his personal life, while Roan performed her hit "Pink Pony Club". Some half expected her to discuss her political views as she had earlier declined to endorse Harris and was critical about the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Other notable appearances included Senator Tim Kaine in a game-show sketch, where contestants struggled to remember him as Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016. Maya Rudolph's impression of Harris has earned critical acclaim, including from Harris herself, who praised Rudolph's spot-on portrayal.</p>

<p>She first played Harris on SNL in 2019 and has brought it back to life this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice president, including calling herself “Momala” — a nod to the nickname her step-kids gave her.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time politicians have appeared on "SNL." Donald Trump hosted in 2015, Hillary Clinton appeared alongside Amy Poehler in 2008, and Barack Obama made a cameo in 2007. Harris's appearance, however, is notable for its proximity to Election Day.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Furious locals pelted Spain's royals and premier on Sunday with mud and cries of "murderers!", forcing officials to cut short their visit to the town worst hit by the floods which have killed more than 200.</p>

<p>The angry crowd in the town of Paiporta focused most of its wrath on Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the head of the Valencia region, both of whom were whisked away by security.</p>

<p>King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were hit in the face and clothes with mud as they tried to calm the angry crowd, AFP journalists saw.</p>

<p>Broadcast on Spanish television, the extraordinary scenes underscored the depth of the anger in the country over the response to the nation's worst such disaster in decades, with the toll ever rising and hopes for finding survivors ebbing five days on.</p>

<p>The king and queen arrived just after midday at a crisis centre in Paiporta, ground zero for a disaster Sanchez called the second deadliest flood in Europe this century.</p>

<p>But more security guards were soon called to stand between the royals and the rest of the delegation and the angry crowd, whose ire seemed most directed at Sanchez and Valencia region head Carlos Mazon, AFP journalists saw.</p>

<p>While Sanchez and the politicians quickly left, the king and queen spent an hour trying to calm tempers before leaving themselves.</p>

<p>Later public television said that their visit to the flood-hit region had been suspended.</p>

<p>Nearly all the flood deaths have been in the Valencia region, where Spain's meteorological agency on Sunday issued a fresh warning for heavy downpours in the region.</p>

<p>Up to 100 litres per square metre (22 gallons per square yard) of water could fall in places in the province of Castellon and the area surrounding the city of Valencia, the agency forecast.</p>

<p>It also sounded the alarm for torrential rain that may cause flooding in the southern province of Almeria, advising residents not to travel unless strictly necessary.</p>

<p><strong>'Towns buried by mud'</strong></p>

<p>Since Tuesday's torrent of rain and mud swept away vehicles and devastated towns and infrastructure, thousands of security and emergency services have frantically cleared debris and mud in the search for bodies.</p>

<p>Authorities have come under fire over the warning systems before the floods, and stricken residents have complained that the response to the disaster has been too slow.</p>

<p>Mazon himself has faced fierce criticism for waiting until Tuesday evening to issue a phone alert in Valencia, despite his region being under an extreme weather warning since that morning.</p>

<p>"I am aware the response is not enough, there are problems and severe shortages... towns buried by mud, desperate people searching for their relatives... we have to improve," Sanchez said.</p>

<p>With the torrents of muddy water having wrecked towns and swept away cars, restoring order and distributing aid to destroyed towns and villages -- some of which have been cut off from food, water and power since Tuesday -- is a priority.</p>

<p>With Spain deploying an extra 10,000 troops, police and civil guards to the Valencia region, the country was carrying out its largest deployment of military and security force personnel in peacetime, Sanchez said.</p>

<p>"Thank you to the people who have come to help us, to all of them, because from the authorities: nothing," a furious Estrella Caceres, 66, told AFP in the town of Sedavi.</p>

<p>In Chiva Danna Daniella said she had been cleaning her restaurant for three days straight.</p>

<p>She said she was still in shock, haunted by memories of the people trapped by the raging floodwaters "asking for help and there was nothing we could do".</p>

<p>"It drives you crazy. You look for answers and you don't find them."</p>

<p><strong>'Swiss cheese' motorways</strong></p>

<p>With telephone and transport networks severely damaged, establishing a precise figure of missing people is difficult.</p>

<p>Transport Minister Oscar Puente told El Pais daily that certain places would probably remain inaccessible by land for weeks.</p>

<p>Ordinary citizens carrying food, water and cleaning equipment have continued their grassroots initiative to assist the recovery, although authorities have urged people to stay at home to avoid congestion.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Valencian government limited the number of volunteers authorised to travel to the city's southern suburbs to 2,000 and restricted access to 12 localities.</p>

<p>Despite this thousands took to the streets of the city of Valencia's centre to make way to nearby communes on foot, carrying brooms and shovels to help those affected.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Pope Francis offered his prayers to those hit by the disaster "who are suffering so much these days".</p>

<p>The storm that sparked the floods on Tuesday formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for this time of year.</p>

<p>But scientists warn climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events.</p>

<p>Emergency services on Sunday updated the toll to 217 people confirmed killed.</p>

<p>It listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia, where the body of a woman in her 60s was discovered on Sunday.</p>

<p>Authorities have warned the toll could yet rise, as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces stepped up bombardment of the Gaza Strip on Sunday killing at least 23 people, Palestinian medics said, with over half the deaths in northern areas where the army has waged a month-long campaign it says is to prevent Hamas from regrouping.</p>

<p>Palestinians said the new aerial and ground offensives and forced evacuations were "ethnic cleansing" aimed at emptying two north Gaza towns and a camp of their populations to create buffer zones. Israel denies this, saying it is fighting Hamas militants who launch attacks from there.</p>

<p>Medics said at least 13 Palestinians were killed in separate attacks on houses in Beit Lahiya town and Jabalia, the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps and the focus of the army's new military offensive. The rest were killed in separate Israeli air strikes in Gaza City and the southern areas.</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on its military actions on Sunday in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Israeli military sent a new army division to Jabalia to join two other operating battalions, a statement said. It said that hundreds of Palestinian militants have so far been killed in the "battles" since the raid began on October 5.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, COGAT, the Israeli army's Palestinian civilian affairs agency, said it facilitated the launch of the second round of a polio vaccination campaign in northern Gaza on Saturday and that 58,604 children have received a dose.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said Israel's military offensive in northern Gaza was stopping them from vaccinating thousands of children in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun.</p>

<p>It said one clinic came under Israeli fire while parents brought their children for the anti-polio dose on Saturday, where four children were injured.</p>

<p>The head World Health Organization said in a statement the incident took place despite a humanitarian pause agreed upon by the two warring parties, Israel and Hamas, to allow the vaccination campaign.</p>

<p>"A @WHO team was at the site just before. This attack, during humanitarian pause, jeopardises the sanctity of health protection for children and may deter parents from bringing their children for vaccination," Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X on Saturday.</p>

<p>"These vital humanitarian-area-specific pauses must be absolutely respected. Ceasefire!," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has not commented on Tedros' remarks.</p>

<p>A larger ceasefire that would end the war and see the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held captive in Gaza as well as Palestinians jailed by Israel remains remote due to disagreements between Hamas and Israel.</p>

<p>Hamas wants an agreement to end the war permanently, refusing recent offers for temporary truces, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says war can only end when Hamas is eradicated.</p>

<p>The war erupted after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensives have killed more than 43,000 Palestinians and reduced most of Gaza to rubble.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar emphasised the transformation in India-Australia relations, attributing the progress to four key factors while reflecting on the evolution of the bilateral partnership between the two nations while addressing the Indian community at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, on Sunday.</p>

<p>During his address, S Jaishankar stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Australian government, the global dynamics, and the contributions of the Indian community were the key factors for the evolution of the India-Australia relationship.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the growth in ties between the two nations, S Jaishankar remarked that Australia would have featured among India's crucial partners a decade ago but that has changed significantly.</p>

<p>"This is my fifth visit to Australia in the last three years... I first came to Australia when I was Foreign Secretary. Yesterday, before I boarded the flight, I launched a book in which they highlighted seven crucial friendships of India, Australia was one of them. And I told the author; that if he had written the book 10 years ago, I am not sure it would have been. I am saying this because I am trying to stress how much this relationship has in the last decade and why has it changed... There are four reasons. One PM Modi, two Australia, three the world and fourth is all of you. That is the reason why the relationship has come a long way," the EAM said.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi posed a question back in 2014, when he became the Prime Minister, on the development of the India-Australia relationship. He stated that this inquiry initiated a reevaluation of the relationship, recognising the potential that had previously gone untapped.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar acknowledged the inherent connections between the two countries, citing shared language, culture, and tradition as foundational elements.</p>

<p>He reiterated that the transformation in the relationship between the two nations was not done on "autopilot" but was done by efforts, leadership, and ambition from both sides.</p>

<p>"I mentioned PM Modi for a particular reason. After he had become Prime Minister, he posed a question to me in 2014. He asked, Why hasn't our relationship with Australia developed? Despite having such a natural faith, there is language bonding, shared culture and tradition. I had no answer that day because I hadn't reflected on it myself and maybe even if I had, I would not have probably realised that at the end of the day, things do not happen automatically; they need effort, leadership, and ambition. They need people, governments, and leaders at both ends. So when I present to you today a picture of such transformation, this did not happen when the India-Australia vehicle was on autopilot. It happened when people have worked at it; at both ends, there was a realisation of the value of these ties and the great efforts of building it," the EAM added.</p>

<p>EAM S Jaishankar is on his five-day visit to Australia from November 3 to November 7, during which he will inaugurate the fourth Indian consulate in Australia in Brisbane on November 4.</p>

<p>Earlier today, EAM landed in Brisbane for his five-day visit to the QUAD partner nation.</p>

<p>"Namaste Australia! Landed in Brisbane today. Look forward to productive engagements over the next few days to take forward the India-Australia Dosti," the EAM said on social media platform X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An American Airlines flight from Buenos Aires to New York was forced to return after a strange "banging noise" at 30,000 feet, sparking fears of a possible person trapped in the cargo hold.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Armed police boarded an American Airlines flight after a strange "banging noise" was heard at 30,000 feet, forcing an unexpected return to Buenos Aires, according to <em>AviationSource News.</em> Flight 954 had taken off from Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires at 9:15 pm Thursday, headed to New York with an estimated arrival of 6:50 am Friday. But while flying over Cordoba, the plane suddenly turned back to Buenos Aires for an emergency landing.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://avsn.co.uk/police-swarm-american-airlines-flight-after-noises-reported-from-cargo-hold/"><em>news reports,</em></a> passengers and crew heard sounds that resembled someone knocking from inside the cargo hold, raising concerns that someone might be trapped there. Initially, the pilot told passengers the plane was returning due to a technical issue but later suggested it was possible a person was in the cargo area, which is typically sealed and not meant for live cargo.</p>

<p>Footage on social media showed intense scenes as authorities prepared to inspect the cargo hold. Argentina's major newspaper, Clarin, reported that specialized teams, including the Special Tactical Assault Group (GEAT), Explosives and Special Weapons Control Group (GEDEX), and specially trained dogs, were deployed to investigate. The operation also involved personnel from the National Civil Aviation Administration, PFA firefighters, and medical support teams.</p>

The captain referred to a security problem due to hearing noises."</p>

<p>Heavily armed cops and sniffer dogs were on standby when the flight returned.When police got inside the hold found nobody there.</p>

<p>They reported: "The hold was opened and the unloading of the luggage containers began, without anything outside the normal parameters being seen at the time."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Muslim American voters in New York, like their counterparts nationwide, are increasingly prioritising the Gaza crisis in their voting decisions for the upcoming presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the Islamic Cultural Centre located on Riverside Drive in New York City, hundreds of Muslims from in and around the neighbourhood join the Friday prayers. One of the main 'dua' made after the prayer is for the people of Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ali, a corporate professional, is a regular worshipper here, particularly on Fridays. He says the international issues are overshadowing the domestic concerns of the community in the November 5 presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are plenty of issues, but I don't think anything comes close to what we are seeing in Gaza. There is a large part of the Muslim community that isn't feeling comfortable with the words and the actions of the candidates," he said.</p>

<p>"The mainstream position in the Democratic Party seems to be words and actions that are in fear of upsetting the pro-Israel side. That lack of compassion and empathy is very disheartening, I must say," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this presidential election, Muslims in New York grapple with a complex political landscape. The community seems to be weighing their concerns on both domestic and international issues.</p>

<p>The situation in Gaza is among the top issues that the members of this influential voting bloc have been concerned with. Several of them clearly voice their disappointment on how the democratic government has dealt with the West Asia situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For us, the Gaza situation is very important. The war must end, and we don't see the current dispensation doing much around it. There are other issues like abortion rights and even LGBTQ that concern, but Gaza is right now the most concerning," says Waqas, a resident of Long Island in New York.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent survey conducted in three swing states (Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan) by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) found that the war on Gaza is a top policy concern for the majority of Muslim voters (61 per cent). It also noted this to be the top issue for Muslims across all genders, ages, races, and partisan lines.</p>

<p>Muslim American voters in New York, like their counterparts nationwide, are increasingly prioritising the Gaza crisis in their voting decisions for the upcoming presidential election. It would not be very far-fetched to say the devastating conflict has become a defining issue and has the potential to reshape traditional voting patterns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a recent post on X that American Muslims will make a "substantial impact" on the elections. "Our community is engaged. Now is the time to show the strength of American Muslim voices in this crucial election," the post said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Biden slammed Harris' rival, former Republican President Donald Trump, and his supporters on policy issues during a speech in Scranton.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden returned to his birthplace in Pennsylvania, making a final campaign stop Saturday for Vice President Kamala Harris and again let loose - offering the kind of unfiltered political sentiments that have become fairly common in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Biden slammed Harris' rival, former Republican President Donald Trump, and his supporters on policy issues during a speech in Scranton, but then suggested that he'd hit back - literally - on faux "macho guys."</p>

<p>"There's one more thing Trump and his Republican friends want to do. They want to have a giant tax cut for the wealthy," Biden told the local chapter of the carpenters union. Then, apparently referencing people backing Trump, he added, "Now, I know some of you guys are tempted to think it's macho guys."</p>

<p>"I tell you what, man, when I was in Scranton, we used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while," Biden continued. "These are the kind of guys you'd like to smack in the ass."</p>

<p>During a rally later Saturday night in North Carolina, Trump poked fun at Biden, asking the crowd, "I don't even know, is he still around?"</p>

<p>Biden's comment in Scranton drew laughs from the crowd. But it was another moment of his veering off political script, something that's now happening frequently with the president - even though he has played a decidedly limited role in promoting Harris, making few campaign stops for his onetime running mate.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Biden sparked an uproar by responding to racist comments at a recent Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage."</p>

<p>"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters," Biden said in response.</p>

<p>White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden's remarks, drawing objections from federal workers who transcribe what the president says for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained by The Associated Press.</p>

<p>And the reference to "garbage" followed Biden - during a recent stop at a campaign office in New Hampshire - saying of Trump, "We've got to lock him up" before quickly amending his comments to note he meant that Democrats need to "politically lock him up."</p>

<p>Biden's Saturday remarks come at a moment when gender issues and diverging partisan loyalties between men and women have emerged as a top feature of the campaign.</p>

<p>Trump has pushed masculine tropes in a bid to garner more male voters throughout his campaign. He's supported a return to traditional gender roles and leaned into themes like " protecting women " whether they "like it or not" in the campaign's closing days.</p>

<p>Harris has taken a far different approach, pledging to protect access to abortion and increase government spending to help families cover the costs of housing and childcare.</p>

<p>Though he spent decades as a senator from Delaware, Biden spent his early childhood in Scranton and Saturday's event was a homecoming for the sidelined president in several ways. He spoke at the same union hall he visited on Election Day in 2020</p>

<p>"Let them know how important this election is," Biden told the crowd of about 200 enthusiastic supporters. When he noted, "I'm nothing special," one audience member shouted back, "Sure you are," sparking chants of "Thank you, Joe."</p>

<p>The president exhorted attendees to vote "for yourself and your families, people you grew up with, the people you come from."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan said it detected 37 Chinese fighter jets, drones and other aircraft near the self-ruled island on Sunday as Beijing carried out "long-distance" training flights.</p>

<p>China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent years as Beijing pressures Taipei to accept its claims of sovereignty over the island.</p>

<p>The Chinese aircraft were spotted from 9:00 am (0100 GMT) and 35 of them crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which separates mainland China and Taiwan, and entered Taiwanese airspace on their way to the Western Pacific Ocean, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Taiwan's military responded by deploying aircraft, naval vessels and shore-based missile systems, the ministry said.</p>

<p>The exercise came a day after Taiwan said it had detected a Chinese military "joint combat readiness patrol" around the island involving fighter jets and warships.</p>

<p>Taiwan spotted 27 Chinese aircraft and six warships in the 24 hours to 6:00 am on Sunday, the ministry said earlier.</p>

<p>China considers Taiwan part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing held large-scale military drills around Taiwan last month, which were condemned by Taipei and its key backer the United States.</p>

<p>The Chinese military conducted long-distance training flights in late September, the ministry said previously, when Beijing also fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Makhija said it is very important that the next US president understands that India is a very crucial partner for the US in many ways.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The India-US partnership is the most important engagement globally and the cooperation will flourish further if Kamala Harris becomes the US president as she recognises the significance of the relationship, prominent Indian-origin Democratic leader Neil Makhija has said.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with PTI, the young leader, considered to be close to Harris, also came down very hard on former president Donald Trump for his immigration policy that has triggered some concerns among immigrant communities in the US, including Indian-Americans.</p>

<p>On the India-US partnership, Makhija said it is the most important relationship for the future.</p>

<p>"When you think about the competition the US has been having with China, when you think about the actions that Russia is taking which are at odds with the interests of the US and its allies, India is really the most important country for the US to continue to build the relationship in terms of its sheer size, economic activities," he said.</p>

<p>Makhija said it is very important that the next US president understands that India is a very crucial partner for the US in many ways.</p>

<p>"When it comes to global priorities like our defence, tackling global issues like climate change. The US and India can lead the way if they work together. So we need a president who recognises that and Kamala Harris is that person," he said.</p>

<p>Makhija called Trump a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>"He is engaging in the same kind of behaviour we have seen in some of the darkest moments in world history where leaders have scapegoated those individuals and communities that do not even have the right to vote," he said.</p>

<p>Makhija is presently serving as Montgomery County Commissioner and Chair of the Board of Elections. He is the first Indian American Commissioner elected in the history of Pennsylvania and many Democrats believe that the young leader could be in Harris' cabinet if she wins the election.</p>

<p>"You can see that he (Trump) is blaming all of the country's problems on immigrants and it is not real, it is not realistic, it is simply aimed at inflaming tensions and driving divisions among people who live here in the US," he said.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately history does repeat itself. Hopefully, the people of our country recognise what happened in the past and we avoid a similar fate in the future," he added.</p>

<p>In his campaign speeches, Trump promised a radical shift to tighten Washington's immigration policy and vowed to stage the "largest deportation operation in American history" if he is reelected.</p>

<p>The Republican leader has even resolved to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants living in the US illegally, triggering concerns among various diaspora communities including from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Makhija also appeared to hold the Republican Party responsible for not increasing the cap on H1B visas for Indians.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris was the sponsor of a bill to fix that issue of H1B backlog when she was the senator. The problem was that the Republicans did not support it and they used to say that they were in favour of legal immigration," he said.</p>

<p>"But now it is clear that they do not want any immigration and they do not support immigration reform. They do not support any of the bills that would give people who live here, work here and pay taxes a real pathway to citizenship," Makhija added.</p>

<p>Describing the November 5 presidential election as very significant for the US, he said the country is at the crossroads.</p>

<p>"On the one hand, we have a candidate who is protecting democracy and fundamental freedoms. Then we have a candidate who represents the past and wants to turn back the clock to a time before anyone from our community was here in the US. Who wants to turn back the clock on fundamental rights," he said.</p>

<p>"Their (Trump camp's) belief is that the country is supposed to be a specific demographic region. We think America is an idea, we think America is an idea that anyone can succeed no matter who you are," Makhija said.</p>

<p>"This is the decision that we are making which is -- do we have a country which is pluralistic, that is welcoming, that is inclusive or do we think it should be exclusive and really meant to serve a particular demography?" he said.</p>

<p>"I think Kamala Harris represents the future that is more inclusive, that will be welcoming and lives up to the ideals that our country truly was founded on," Makhija added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/justin-trudeau" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau </a>has shared clips of his Diwali celebrations on Sunday amid ongoing diplomatic tensions between India and the North American nation.</p>

<p>“Happy Diwali! So many special moments shared celebrating with the community this week,” Trudeau wrote in a post on X. In a video shared online, Trudeau is seen getting religious threads tied on his wrist, gifted from three Hindu temples in Canada.</p>

<p>“I got these bracelets when I was in three different Hindu temples over the past few months. They are good luck,” he remarked, adding that the threads would provide him with “protection.”</p>

<p>“I'm not taking them off till they fall off,” the Canadian Prime Minister wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was also offered a plate of jalebis, which he joked saying he would “save for the team.”&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<br />
So many special moments shared celebrating with the community this week. <a href="https://t.co/rCTrJx6OMc">pic.twitter.com/rCTrJx6OMc</a></p>
— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1852781109634908323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Earlier, on October 31, Trudeau had extended Diwali greetings to Canadians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Today, we join millions of people in Canada and around the world to celebrate Diwali,” he said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2024/10/31/statement-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-diwali " rel="nofollow,noindex">statement</a>. He acknowledged the contributions of the Indo-Canadian community, saying, “Diwali in Canada would not be possible without our incredible Indo-Canadian community. Indo-Canadians represent the best of Canada – as artists and entrepreneurs, as doctors and teachers, as leaders in business, community, and culture. On Diwali, we celebrate them and the light they carry across Canada's communities.” Trudeau further noted the significance of Diwali to Hindu Canadians, highlighting that it is one of Canada's largest and most diverse diasporas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid these festive sentiments, the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wanted-canada-to-extradite-bishnoi-gang-members-india-on-diplomatic-row-6810487 ">diplomatic tensions between India and Canada</a> continue to escalate. Since September 2023, relations have deteriorated following Prime Minister Trudeau's public accusation that India was involved in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing, a claim India has vehemently denied. Indian officials have reiterated that there is “no shred of evidence” linking the Indian government to the incident. In light of these ongoing tensions, India withdrew six of its diplomats from Canada due to safety concerns, leading to Canada responding in kind.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli naval commandos have seized a trainee mariner a military official described as a "senior operative" of Hezbollah in a raid in Lebanon and brought him to Israel for questioning.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati instructed the foreign ministry to submit a complaint to the UN Security Council over the raid on the coastal town of Batroun, his office said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL are both conducting investigations into the raid, Mikati's office said, adding that he had called for "expedited" results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First reported by Lebanese sources before an Israeli military official confirmed the military's involvement, the raid was the first of its kind since the Israel-Hezbollah war erupted in September.</p>

<p>"A senior operative of Hezbollah, who serves as an expert in his field, was apprehended," the Israeli military official said. "The operative has been transferred to Israeli territory and is currently being investigated."</p>

<p>Lebanon's state-run National News agency said an "unidentified military force" carried out a "sea landing" on the shore of Batroun, south of Tripoli, at dawn on Friday.</p>

<p>The force "went with all its weapons and equipment to a chalet near the beach, kidnapping a Lebanese man... and sailing away into the open sea on a speedboat".</p>

<p>An acquaintance of the abductee identified him as a student at the state-run Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute (MARSATI) in Batroun, Lebanon's primary training college for the shipping industry.</p>

<p>He was taken from student housing near the institute, but was a resident of the Shiite-majority town of Qmatiyeh further south, said the acquaintance, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security concerns.</p>

<p>He was completing courses to become a sea captain, the source told AFP, adding that the man was in his 30s and was well known by the teaching staff at the institute.</p>

<p>The Christian-majority town of Batroun has been relatively sheltered from the Israel-Hezbollah war that has pummelled south Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley.</p>

<p>The war has killed more than 1,900 people in Lebanon, since it began on September 23, according to an AFP tally of health ministry figures, though the real number is likely higher due to data gaps.</p>

<p>Israel's military says 38 soldiers have been killed in the Lebanon campaign since it began ground operations on September 30.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celebrity squirrel Peanut, who had been a beloved companion to owner Mark Longo for seven years, was recently euthanised along with a raccoon found in Mr Longo's care. The decision by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) was made after a government worker was bitten by Peanut, leading to concerns over potential rabies exposure. As we remember Peanut, it's a fitting time to celebrate other beloved celebrity animals that have captured our hearts over the years, from Kabosu, the bitcoin dog, to Moo Deng the Hippo.</p>

<p><strong>Kabosu, the Doge</strong></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean state media released a white paper on Sunday accusing South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol of exposing his country to the danger of nuclear war through his policies toward the North.</p>

<p>The document, compiled by North Korea's Institute of Enemy State Studies and released by state news agency KCNA, criticized Yoon's "reckless remarks" about war, abandoning elements of an inter-Korean agreement, engaging in nuclear war planning with the United States, and seeking closer ties with Japan and NATO.</p>

<p>"Its ever-worsening military moves resulted only in the paradoxical consequences of pushing (North Korea) to stockpile its nuclear weapons at an exponential rate and further develop its nuclear attack capability," the paper said.</p>

<p>Yoon, a conservative, has taken a hard line on North Korea, which has forged ahead with developing its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>

<p>His administration blames North Korea for raising tensions with weapons tests and providing military aid and troops to aid Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has been taking steps to sever inter-Korean ties, redefining the South as a separate, hostile enemy state, since Kim Jong Un declared it a "primary foe" early this year and said unification was no longer possible.</p>

<p>North Korea blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas last month, and satellite imagery shows it has since built large trenches across the former crossings.</p>

<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>

<p>The two Koreas have also clashed over balloons of trash floated since May from North Korea. Pyongyang has said the launches are a response to balloons sent by anti-regime activists in the South.</p>

<p>Sunday's white paper also listed Yoon's domestic political woes, including scandals involving his wife, which have driven his approval ratings to record lows.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistan-based company has issued an apology after mistakenly advertising a non-existent Halloween parade in Dublin, Ireland. According to <em>The Guardian</em>, the error, attributed to a "human mistake", led to thousands of people turning up on the Irish capital's main street on Thursday, awaiting the event. A viral video showed throngs of people lining both sides of O'Connell Street for a supposed procession of giant Halloween puppets made by one of Ireland's best-known theatre groups, the Galway performance company Macnas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing the video on X, filmmaker Bertie Brosnan said, "The SCAM Halloween Parade in Dublin City Centre (everyone was ghosted ) Definitely thousands, potentially into 10's of thousands, showed up. This happened on the 31st of October from 7pm at the top of O'Connell Street in Dublin City."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/pakistan-firm-apologises-for-directing-dubliners-to-nonexistent-halloween-event#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20highly%20embarrassed%20and,to%20be%20based%20in%20Pakistan." rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, the crowds had turned up to see the event which was listed on the My Spirit Halloween website. It falsely advertised that the Macnas parade would take place between 7pm and 9pm on Thursday. However, when the crowds reached the location, Dublin police started to disperse then saying that no such event was taking place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company behind the website later clarified that it was a simple human error. It explained that a member of their team had mistakenly copied the notice for last year's event and inserted it into this year's calendar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The website aggregates content all over the world. The misleading information had gone viral on social media and even ranked highly in Google searches ahead of Halloween.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The Guardian</em> reported that the Pakistan-based man behind the site has since apologised saying he was "depressed" and "embarrassed". "We are highly embarrassed and highly depressed, and very sorry," Nazir Ali said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was our mistake and we should have doubled checked it to make sure it was happening. But newspapers are reporting that we posted it intentionally and this is very, very wrong," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The error, however, has sparked a discussion about the dangers of misinformation and AI deepfakes. On social media, one user said that she laughed at the "ake parade story, however, she added that it showed "how easy it is to spread misinformation".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is just halloween, now think of how many people are fed with misinformation online on other issues," said another user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That was quite funny, but all of a sudden when that becomes something a little bit more serious and people are putting out AI images of me, for example, saying something that I would never say contrary to my own values, that's something that's not too far off the horizon," said Gary Gannon, who is a member of parliament.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

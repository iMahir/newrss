       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump capped off his rally in Georgia by dancing to the classic hit 'YMCA'.</p>

<p>As he rallied support just ahead of the US Presidential Elections, Trump declared his "commitment to restoring the American Dream," criticising Democratic rival and US Vice President Kamala Harris for allegedly "undermining that dream". He vowed, "I will bring back the American dream, and we'll bring it back stronger than ever before," while promising to address pressing issues like inflation and immigration.</p>

<p>Trump said his leadership would usher in a new era of prosperity, asserting, "America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before." His campaign rhetoric contrasted what he termed the "incompetence and failure" of the current administration with the transformative success he claims would follow his return to office.</p>

<p>In a pointed critique of President Joe Biden, Trump expressed scepticism about Biden's visibility leading up to the elections, asking, "Where the hell is he?" He further suggested that Harris had undermined the electoral process, accusing her of stealing the election from Biden. In a provocative statement, Trump called for Biden to "fire Kamala," saying, "You're the worst ever. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kamala Harris will continue her rallies on November 5 breezing through Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, and Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>"In this election, we need to remind our neighbours and friends that their vote is their voice, and their voice is their power. Don't let anybody take your power from you. When you love something, you fight for it--and I love this country with all my heart, " Harris said in her posts on X.</p>

<p>As the November 5 elections draw near, recent polling data indicates a competitive race, with a New York Times and Siena College survey showing Trump and Harris tied at 48 per cent in the popular vote. With both candidates vying for a historic moment in US politics, the upcoming election promises to be a pivotal event in the nation's future.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days back, a young Iranian woman took the Internet by storm when she stripped to her underwear on a Tehran university campus, apparently to protest against the country's strict dress code for women. Visuals showed her roaming on the campus of Islamic Azad University as others gaped in surprise. Soon after, security guards detained her and took her away. Her current location is not known.</p>

<p><strong>Who Is She?</strong></p>

<p>The identity of the woman, who has emerged as a feminist icon since the visuals went viral, is not known yet. While most posts on social media stress that her move to undress was a form of protest against the dress code, a university spokesperson has claimed that the police have found that she is suffering from a "mental disorder" and was under "severe mental pressure". The spokesperson, Amir Mahjob, said the woman had separated from her partner and was mother to two children.</p>

<p><strong>Claims, Counter Claims</strong></p>

<p>An Iranian student social media channel, Amir Kabir newsletter, reported that the woman stripped to her underwear after members of Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force, harassed her for not following the dress code properly. Amnesty said she was "violently arrested" after she protested the "abusive enforcement" of the dress code. Iran's Fars news agency said two security personnel had "calmly spoken" to her and asked her to follow the dress code. The university spokesperson said there was no face-off between the student and security guards. He claimed that the woman was filming her classmates without their consent and they had objected to this. The security was alerted because of the "violation of the privacy of the students and professors", he said.</p>

<p><strong>Where is she now?</strong></p>

<p>Visuals on social media show a group of people grabbing the woman and putting her into a car. The university spokesperson's remarks suggest she was taken to a police station. He insisted that her health condition was fine. With no clear answers regarding the woman's whereabouts, apprehensions have surfaced over her well-being. The Amir Kabir newsletter has alleged that she was beaten during the arrest, AFP reported. Amnesty International demanded her immediate release and said authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment. The London-based rights group also demanded an independent probe into allegations of violence against her.</p>

<p><strong>The Mahsa Amini Backdrop</strong></p>

<p>The Iranian woman's move and her subsequent detention have played out against the growing resistance in Iran to the strict dress code for women. Earlier, in 2022, nationwide protests had erupted in the country after an Iranian-Kurdish woman, Mahsa Hamini, died after she was arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests saw women remove their headscarves and burn them. Thousands were arrested and over 500 protesters were killed as the authorities cracked down hard on the agitation.</p>

<p>Hossein Ronaghi, a prominent Iranian activist who was jailed during the protests, has now praised the "bravery" of the student seen in the video. "The symbolic and protest movement of the research science student is a revolt against government repression; A cry from the bottom of the heart against the oppression that has taken life from people, especially women," he said in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[No motive for the attack has yet been identified, Gallatin County Sheriff said in a statement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old suspect, Daren Christopher Abbey, has been arrested in connection with the death of a Montana man, initially believed to have been killed by a bear, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c629xz8z15go" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

<p>On October 30, the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office confirmed they had "identified a suspect" after the body of 35-year-old Dustin Kjersem was discovered in a tent approximately 2.5 miles up Moose Creek Road, near Big Sky, Montana, on October 12.</p>

<p>Sheriff Dan Springer reported that Abbey had been invited by Kjersem to share his campsite, located about 35 miles south of Bozeman. Prosecutors allege that Abbey later attacked Kjersem, hitting him with a piece of wood, stabbing him with a screwdriver, and assaulting him with an axe.</p>

<p>Abbey reportedly returned to the scene to remove items he thought might incriminate him but overlooked a beer can that remained. Authorities say Abbey has confessed to the killing, stating that he attacked Kjersem after finding him at a campsite he had intended to use.</p>

<p>Police indicated that Abbey led them to several items he allegedly took from the campsite, including an axe, firearms, and a cooler.</p>

<p>"This appears to be a heinous crime committed by an individual with no regard for the life of Dustin Kjersem," Sheriff Springer said, adding, "We have part of his story, but we don't fully understand the whole truth."</p>

<p>Abbey was ordered to be held on $1.5 million bail during a court appearance on Friday.</p>

<p>The Sheriff's Office also reassured the community that they could safely resume outdoor activities, adding that additional details and charges are forthcoming. Further comments on the case will be withheld until charges are filed.</p>

<p>Sheriff Springer expressed gratitude to the detectives for their "unrelenting pursuit of justice," highlighting their tireless dedication over nearly three weeks with little rest. He praised the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office and all involved agencies for their commitment to the community's safety.</p>

<p>Kjersem, a resident of Belgrade, Mont., was last seen on Thursday, October 10, and his body was discovered around 10:07 a.m. local time two days later.</p>

<p>In his concluding statement, Springer offered condolences to Kjersem's family: "Our thoughts and prayers remain with the family of Dustin Kjersem. We hope our efforts bring them some peace during this difficult time, as our entire community mourns with them."</p>

<p>Earlier, on Oct. 24, the Sheriff's Office issued a release seeking information on several items "believed to have been removed from the scene of the crime," including a camp axe, shotgun, revolver, and cooler.</p>

<p>The individual who found Kjersem's body initially suspected a bear attack. However, a state Fish, Wildlife, and Parks agent found no evidence of bear activity in the area, leading investigators to treat the case as a homicide. An autopsy later confirmed that Kjersem's death resulted from a "vicious attack," according to prior statements from the Sheriff's Office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Monday said it "condemns acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists", referring to an incident at a Hindu temple in Brampton, in the Canadian province of Ontario, last week, and called on Canada to ensure that all places of worship are adequately protected.</p>

<p>"We also expect that those indulging in such violence will be prosecuted," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement issued Monday.</p>

<p>The Indian government, Mr Jaiswal, said, remains "deeply concerned" about the safety and security of its citizens in that country, and said efforts to provide consular services to Indian and Canadian citizens - a camp was being held inside the temple - "will not be deterred".</p>

<p>India's response comes after both the incident at the temple and a clash between those protesting the attack and the police cops. A video showed a cop charging at a protester and hitting him several times.</p>

<p>The journalist who shared the video - Daniel Bordman, a senior reporter with The National Telegraph - claimed cops went after the protesters to protect "Khalistanis who came to harass temple-goers..."</p>

<p>Earlier, the Indian High Commission said the "violent disruption" to the consular camp came despite an advance request for strong security measures, and that it feared for Indian citizens' safety.</p>

<p>The violence at Brampton's Hindu Sabha temple - blamed by Indo-Canadian MP Chandra Arya on Khalistani extremists - saw men breach the gates and assault people inside. Mr Arya said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-hindu-temple-attacked-canadian-mp-chandra-arya-condemns-attack-says-red-line-has-been-crossed-6938832" target="_blank">a "red line" had been crossed</a> and that the attack "shows how brazen Khalistani extremism has become..."</p>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - whose relationship with India is in the doldrums following repeated, and unsubstantiated, allegations about "agents" of Delhi being involved in the killing of Khalistani leader Hardeep Nijjar, branded a terrorist by India - called the violence "unacceptable".</p>

<p>Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, meanwhile, called for punishment to the "greatest extent of law" for those who participated in the violence. "Religious freedom is a foundational value in Canada. Everyone should feel safe in their place of worship," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for local police has said no arrests have been made, as yet.</p>

<p>The violence comes amid ongoing diplomatic back-and-forth between India and Canada, including two rounds of expulsion of diplomats. On Saturday, Ottawa named Delhi as a cyberthreat adversary, suggesting state-sponsored actors could be spying against it. India firmly dismissed the claim.</p>

<p>On that topic Mr Jaiswal said today, "This appears to be another example of a Canadian strategy to attack India. As I mentioned earlier, their senior officials have confessed they are seeking to manipulate global opinion against India. As on other occasions, imputations are made without evidence."</p>

<p>All of this comes after Canada accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing, in Vancouver, of 45-year-old naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistan activist.</p>

<p>Last year, a Hindu temple in Windsor, also in Ontario, was defaced, sparking widespread calls for action from both Canadian and Indian officials. Similar earlier incidents in Brampton saw temples targeted as well, drawing strong reactions from the Indian community in Canada.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Votes in the US state of Pennsylvania hold the power to make or break the chances of entering the White House for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Pennsylvania holds 19 electoral votes. It was pivotal for the Democrats win in the 2020 election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Formally called the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Democrats (blues) have enjoyed good strength in Pennsylvania since 1992, except in 2016 when the Republican (reds) leader Donald Trump was elected President.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Not getting big numbers in Pennsylvania could worsen Kamala Harris' chances as no Democrat has entered the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">There are six lakh Asian-Americans in Pennsylvania, with Indian-Americans comprising the largest group. The Trump and Harris campaigns have acknowledged they face the toughest challenge in this state.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The major concerns in Pennsylvania include rising inflation and pressure on cost of living. For some time grocery prices have been rising the fastest in Pennsylvania.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Though Pennsylvania is considered a swing state with 19 electoral votes, it is no longer what it used to be a century ago when it had 38 electoral votes, double of what it has now. Many industrial states in the northern parts of the US have seen people migrate to other areas. Pennsylvania was no exception.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">To win the US elections, a candidate needs 270 of the electoral college votes. The results in seven battleground states of Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia will decide who will be the next President.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Along with Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia have an inordinate influence on deciding the winner because unlike the other states which are firmly with either party, these states can go either way - with the reds or the blues.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Donald Trump has been talking about illegal migration, crime, bringing back manufacturing and jobs, and inflation while also going off the teleprompter to add impromptu comments. In Pennsylvania, he mostly dumped the machines and went extempore.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">A day before the election, the presidential race appears to be hurtling toward a photo finish, with the final set of polls by The New York Times and Siena College finding Kamala Harris gaining new strength in North Carolina and Georgia.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Pennsylvania is also known as a "keystone state", to mean a central, wedge-shaped stone which holds all the other stones of a structure in place to form an arch. In early America, Pennsylvania played a vital geographic and strategic role in holding together the states of the newly formed Union.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Air Quality Index in Pakistan's Lahore stood at 1,900 on Sunday, its highest ever, prompting the country to write a letter to the Indian government to open a dialogue on the issue.</p>

<p>Even as the AQI in the city of 14 million people stood at least six times more than the limit defined by the World Health Organisation, the government imposed emergency measures like closing schools and issuing work-from-home mandates.</p>

<p>The level of deadly PM2.5 pollutants -- fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health -- peaked at 610 -- more than 40 times the limit of 15 in a 24-hour period considered healthy by the WHO.</p>

<p>Citizens have been urged to stay indoors, keep doors and windows shut, and avoid unnecessary travel, while smog counters have been set up at hospitals, Senior Minister of Punjab Marriyum Aurangzeb said. The government has also imposed a ban on three-wheelers known as rickshaws and halted construction in certain areas to reduce the pollution levels.</p>

<p>Pakistan said the situation has arisen due to winds carrying pollution from neighbouring India.&nbsp;Secretary for Environment and Climate Change Raja Jahangir Anwar told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/04/asia/pakistan-punjab-climate-diplomacy-india-smog-intl-hnk/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>, "We need climate diplomacy, as a regional and global issue."</p>

<p>"We are suffering in Lahore in a way due to the eastern wind corridor coming from India. We are not blaming anyone, it's a natural phenomenon," he said.</p>

<p>Like in northern India, pollution spikes during the winters in Pakistan, leading to health complications among residents, including breathing difficulties, coughing and burning eyes. Smog is particularly pronounced in winter, when cold, denser air traps emissions from poor-quality fuels used to power the city's vehicles and factories at ground level.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the AQI in Delhi stood at 276 on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>AQI as high as 151-200 is considered unhealthy, while an AQI rating between 201 to 300 is more harmful and AQI over 300 has been extremely hazardous.</p>

<p>Pollution in excess of levels deemed safe by the WHO shortens the life expectancy of Lahore residents by an average of 7.5 years, according to the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute.</p>

<p>According to UNICEF, nearly 600 million children in South Asia are exposed to high levels of air pollution and half of childhood pneumonia deaths are associated with air pollution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

An autopsy reportedly found strangulation marks on her neck, sparking speculations about her death. This has led to questions about a possible equipment malfunction or interference, according to the Dutch newspaper de <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/kijkverder/v/2024/the-secrets-that-were-kept-regarding-the-death-of-a-64-year-old-woman-in-the-suicide-capsule-sarco~v1200398/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" rel="nofollow,noindex">Volkskrant</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The 64-year-old American woman died on September 23 in a secluded forest area near a cabin in Merishausen, a sparsely populated region of Switzerland close to the German border, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8144v9pveo" rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Sarco pod, designed by Dr Philip Nitschke, founder of Exit International, is intended to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives. Operated by the Swiss assisted-dying group The Last Resort, the pod requires the user to press an internal button, which releases nitrogen gas, causing them to fall asleep and then die peacefully within minutes due to oxygen deprivation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Swiss police were notified and later found the woman's body inside the pod. Dr Florian Willet, president of The Last Resort, was reportedly the only person present at the time of her death and remains in custody.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Swiss Chief Prosecutor Peter Sticher, leading the investigation, has suggested that the woman's death may not have been as intended, indicating the possibility of “intentional homicide,” according to de Volkskrant. The report highlights that strangulation could be a factor, raising questions about the circumstances of her death.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The report notes that the pod was opened and closed several times before the procedure began to verify its seal.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">A forensic expert testified in court that the woman had severe injuries to her neck, which has further fuelled suspicion.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The incident was reportedly recorded by two surveillance cameras – one inside the pod, focused on the control button, and another mounted on a nearby tree. These cameras were motion-activated and not set to record continuously. De Volkskrant, who reviewed the footage, observed that the internal camera activated twice in quick succession around two minutes after the woman pressed the button, although the camera angle did not clearly show what occurred.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the report, Dr Willet later informed police that about two and a half minutes into the procedure, the woman's body appeared to cramp strongly – a reaction he described as typical in deaths involving nitrogen. Six and a half minutes after the woman initiated the process, the pod's iPad reportedly emitted a loud alarm, prompting Dr Willet, who was on a call with Dr Philip Nitschke, to say, “She's still alive, Philip.” The alarm ceased after some time, and roughly 30 minutes after pressing the button, Dr Willet reportedly confirmed, “She really looks dead.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Swiss authorities have yet to confirm these findings publicly, and the prosecutor's office has refrained from making an official statement on the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Swiss law prohibits assisted suicide if external assistance is involved or if those assisting have any “self-serving motive.”</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old man lost his life due to electrocution while charging his mobile phone on a bus in Malaysia. The incident took place on November 1 at the Penang Sentral bus terminal in Butterworth, shortly after he boarded an express bus heading to Kuala Lumpur. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/malaysia-teen-electrocuted-phone-charger-bus-death-b2640786.html">Independent</a></em>, the teen plugged his phone into a bus socket to charge it.&nbsp;About ten minutes later, passengers heard him scream and noticed him foaming at the mouth. Witnessing the horrific scene, fellow passengers swiftly called emergency services.&nbsp;Emergency responders arrived at the scene around 6:20 pm local time. Tragically, paramedics pronounced the 18-year-old victim dead shortly after arrival.</p>

<p>An autopsy later confirmed electrocution as the official cause of death.&nbsp;According to the bus driver, the victim appeared to have suffered a severe electric shock, with burn marks visible on the fingers of his left hand. The charging cable had melted, and the phone had overheated, pointing to a critical failure of the electrical system.</p>

<p>''An initial investigation revealed burn marks on the victim's left fingers, suspected to be from an electric shock while he was charging his phone. The special task force will investigate the cause of the incident to ensure it does not recur and that the safety of passengers will be guaranteed,'' Mr Abdul Rahman, assistant commissioner of police, said in a statement, according to&nbsp;<em>The Straits Times.</em></p>

<p>Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke said the department would form a special task force to investigate the incident.</p>

<p>''The transport ministry treats this electric shock incident, which tragically resulted in the death of a teenager while he was charging his phone on the express bus, with utmost seriousness,'' he said.&nbsp;He added that the task force has been given a deadline of two weeks to provide a full report on the incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World leaders kick off UN climate talks next week, days after a knife edge US election that could send shockwaves through global efforts to limit dangerous warming.</p>

<p>The stakes are high for the COP29 conference in Azerbaijan where nations must agree a new target to fund climate action across huge swathes of the world.</p>

<p>It comes in a year likely to be the hottest in human history that has already witnessed a barrage of devastating floods, heatwaves and storms in all corners of the globe.</p>

<p>Nations are falling far short of what is needed to keep warming from hitting even more dangerous highs in the future.</p>

<p>But leaders arriving in Baku are wrestling with a host of challenges, including trade spats, economic uncertainty and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.</p>

<p>Adding to the uncertainty, the US vote and potential return of Donald Trump, who pulled out of the Paris Agreement and has called climate change a "hoax", could ripple through the negotiations and beyond.</p>

<p>"You can imagine that if Trump is elected, and if the election outcome is clear by the time that we get to Baku, then there will be sort of a crisis moment," said Li Shuo, a Washington-based expert on climate diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>

<p>He said that countries, likely including China, are preparing to send a "clear message" in support of global climate cooperation if Trump beats his rival Kamala Harris to the White House.</p>

<p>The UN talks are seen as critical to laying the groundwork for a major new round of climate commitments due early next year.</p>

<p>Current pledges would see the world blast past the internationally agreed limit of a 1.5 degrees Celsius rise in temperatures since the pre-industrial era.</p>

<p>"Decisions in Baku could profoundly shape the climate trajectory and whether 1.5 degrees remains within reach," said Cosima Cassel, of think tank E3G.</p>

<p><strong>Clash over cash</strong></p>

<p>Azerbaijan hosting the 11-22 November talks has drawn concerns over its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and its human rights record.</p>

<p>Countries last year committed to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewables usage by 2030.</p>

<p>This year, negotiators must increase a $100 billion-a-year target to help poorer nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean off coal, oil and gas.</p>

<p>The overall amount of this new goal, where it comes from, and who has access are major points of contention.</p>

<p>Experts commissioned by the UN estimate that developing countries, excluding China, will need to spend $2.4 trillion per year by 2030 on climate priorities.</p>

<p>From that, $1 trillion must come from international public and private finance.</p>

<p>Wealthy existing donors, including the EU and US, have said new sources of money will have to be found, including from China and oil-rich Gulf states.</p>

<p>China –- today the world's largest polluter and second-largest economy –- does pay climate finance but on its own terms.</p>

<p>Between 2013 and 2022, China paid on average $4.5 billion a year to other developing countries, the World Resources Institute said in a September paper.</p>

<p>Money could also be raised by pollution tariffs, a wealth tax or ending fossil fuel subsidies, among other ideas.</p>

<p>Rachel Cleetus, policy director of the Climate and Energy programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said negotiators in Azerbaijan should aim for a $1 trillion deal.</p>

<p>This money "is not charity", Cleetus told AFP, adding that it should mostly come as aid or very low interest loans to avoid adding to developing nations' debt.</p>

<p>"Finance might sound like a technical issue, but we all know money talks," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"Nations either make those investments up front, or we'll be paying dearly for it after the fact, in disaster costs, in pollution costs. So this is a fork in the road. We have a choice."</p>

<p><strong>Green power</strong></p>

<p>Current climate pledges, even if implemented in full, would see the world lurch towards 2.6C warming by the end of the century -- threatening catastrophe for human societies and ecosystems, the UN Environment Programme has said.</p>

<p>A deal in Baku is seen as crucial to underpinning a set of more ambitious national pledges in the coming months.</p>

<p>Li said those future pledges could be impacted by the US vote, with countries, including China, waiting to see the outcome before finalising longer-term targets.</p>

<p>Beyond Baku, there is also an "increasing interconnection between climate and the economic agenda", he said, including trade tussles between clean energy powerhouse China and the US and Europe.</p>

<p>He said progress is more visible in "the green economy, who is winning the race when it comes to solar, wind, electric vehicles and energy storage".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For much of its history, the political landscape of the United States has seen two dominant forces: the Democrats and Republicans and it has continued since the mid-1800s. As the election approaches, the voters once again have two choices: Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>When the US Constitution was established in 1789, it made no mention of political parties. Many of the founders, including George Washington, were wary of factions, fearing it might lead to tyranny. Despite this, political groups quickly formed, primarily around two opposing views on federal power - the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the Anti-Federalists, led by Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>The election of 1800, in which Jefferson defeated John Adams, was a turning point. The event led to the decline of Federalism and the rise of the Democratic-Republican Party. Over time, this party evolved, and by the 1820s, new coalitions formed, leading to the creation of the modern Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the mid-19th century.</p>

<p><strong>Implications Of The Electoral System</strong></p>

<p>One of the major reasons American voters face limited choices at the ballot box is the winner-take-all electoral system, particularly evident in single-member districts. In this setup, the candidate who receives the most votes wins, while all other votes effectively count for nothing. This system creates significant barriers for third parties, as voters often feel compelled to support one of the two major parties to avoid "wasting" their votes. Consequently, potential voters for third-party candidates may choose to align with Democrats or Republicans.</p>

<p>The structure of the Electoral College also reinforces this phenomenon during presidential elections. To win the presidency, candidates must secure a majority of electoral votes, which are awarded on a winner-take-all basis in most states. This further diminishes the chances for third-party candidates to gain traction, as they typically lack the resources and support necessary to compete on the national scale.</p>

<p><strong>Political Socialisation</strong></p>

<p>Political socialisation also plays a significant role in maintaining the two-party system. From a young age, Americans are often taught to identify with one of the two main parties through family, education and media. This creates a mindset that emphasises a binary choice in politics - that one must either be a Democrat or a Republican. The major parties have also built extensive fundraising networks and grassroots organisations, giving them an advantage in campaigning and outreach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump doubled down Sunday on his baseless predictions of voter fraud in battleground states as he and rival Kamala Harris launched their frantic final 48 hours of campaigning to court the last holdouts in a bitterly contested US election.</p>

<p>The presidential race is going down to the wire, with more states functionally tied in polls at this point than in any comparable election.</p>

<p>Over 77.3 million people have now voted ahead of Election Day on Tuesday, just over half of the total ballots cast in 2020.</p>

<p>With the hours ticking away, 78-year-old Trump again indicated he may not accept a defeat and he added to his increasingly dark rhetoric by musing to supporters that he wouldn't mind if journalists were shot.</p>

<p>Democrats are "demonic," he told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, also telling his own supporters they would be "stupid" if they don't vote.</p>

<p>The Republican often sprinkles speeches with colorful insults, but the tone has become increasingly apocalyptic and tinged with violence.</p>

<p>Despite no evidence of any meaningful election cheating in the United States, he claimed that Democrats in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania "are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing."</p>

<p>And during his often unfocused 90-minute address, he recalled the near-miss assassination attempt against him in July, adding that for him to be shot again the bullet would have to pass through the crowd of media.</p>

<p>"To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news -- and I don't mind that so much. I don't mind that," he said to laughter.</p>

<p>Around the same time, Harris was quoting scripture in a majority-Black church in Detroit, Michigan and urging Americans to look beyond Trump.</p>

<p>"Let us turn the page and write the next chapter of our history," the US vice president said.</p>

<p>"While we know there are those who seek to deepen divisions, sow hate, spread fear and cause chaos, this moment in our nation has to be about so much more than partisan politics."</p>

<p>Harris called Trump's accusations of election fraud an attempt to make people feel "their vote won't matter."</p>

<p>"The systems that are in place for this election in 2024 have integrity," she said. "The people will determine the outcome of this election."</p>

<p>Harris also said she has mailed in her absentee ballot to California, and was "feeling great" about the 48-hour sprint.</p>

<p>A final New York Times/Siena poll Sunday flagged incremental changes in swing states, but the results from all seven remained within the margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris -- desperate to shore up the Great Lakes states known as the "blue wall" seen as essential to any Democratic victory -- was spending the day in Michigan, where she also heads to Pontiac and an evening rally at Michigan State University.</p>

<p>Trump's Sunday timetable centered on Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, the three biggest swing-state prizes in the Electoral College system that awards states influence according to their population.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Trump made a rare admission to ABC News that "I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right?"</p>

<p>But at his Pennsylvania rally he said that in 2020, when he lost his reelection effort to Joe Biden and then tried to overturn the results, he "shouldn't have left" the White House.</p>

<p><strong>Final polls</strong></p>

<p>Like Pennsylvania, Michigan is among the closely watched battlegrounds.</p>

<p>Trump flipped the former Democratic stronghold on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden returned it to the Democratic column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and Black voters.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Pollsters have noted an erosion in Black support for the Democratic ticket and Harris's aides acknowledge they still have work to do to turn out enough African-American men to match Biden's winning 2020 coalition.</p>

<p>But with abortion rights a top voter concern, her campaign has taken some comfort from the large proportion of women turning out among early voters.</p>

<p>Harris got a boost Saturday as the final Des Moines Register poll for Iowa -- seen as a highly credible test of wider public sentiment -- showed a stunning turnaround, with Harris ahead in a state won easily by Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>Trump dismissed the findings as a "fake poll."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Furious locals hurled mud and insults at Spain's king, queen and prime minister on Sunday in a startling show of anger in the worst hit town in the flood disaster that has killed more than 210 people.</p>

<p>More heavy rain fell on the Valencia region after King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were forced to leave Paiporta where more than 70 people died in floods last Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mud hit the monarchs in the face and clothes as they tried to calm the angry crowd in scenes that underscored the fury over the response to the disaster that has now killed at least 217 people with many more still missing.</p>

<p>The king and queen went to a crisis centre in Paiporta. But extra security guards soon had to keep the angry crowd, shouting "murders", away from the royals and prime minister. They put up umbrellas to stop mud hitting the royal couple.</p>

<p>The king said later that Spain had to "understand the anger and frustration" of people affected by the devastation to towns where cars have been left in muddy heaps in streets.</p>

<p>In a social media video, the king called on the public to give the victims "hope and their guarantee that the state in its entirety is present".</p>

<p>Most of the fury seemed directed at Prime Minister Sanchez and Valencia regional government head Carlos Mazon.</p>

<p>"I understand the social anger and of course, I'm here to receive it. This is my political and moral obligation," Mazon said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The rear window of Sanchez's car was broken before he and the local politicians quickly left. The socialist leader said that while he empathised with the "anguish and suffering" of the victims, he condemned "all forms of violence".</p>

<p>Spanish media later reported of the possible involvement of far-right groups during the incident. Sanchez's deputy Maria Jesus Montero reacted to the allegations on X, saying "We will not allow radical groups to profit from people's pain."</p>

<p>Spain's meteorological agency issued a "red alert" for new storms in the Valencia region on Sunday and heavy rain started falling in the night.</p>

<p>Police using megaphones urged Valencia residents to stay in their homes. While the alert was later downgraded, schools in Valencia were to remain closed Monday.</p>

<p><strong>'Towns buried by mud'</strong></p>

<p>Authorities have come under fire over the lack of warnings before the floods and the slow reaction after.</p>

<p>"I am aware the response is not enough, there are problems and severe shortages ... towns buried by mud, desperate people searching for their relatives ... we have to improve," Sanchez said.</p>

<p>With an extra 10,000 troops, police and civil guards sent to the Valencia region, Spain has now ordered its largest peacetime military and security force deployment, Sanchez said.</p>

<p>"Thank you to the people who have come to help us, to all of them, because from the authorities: nothing," a furious Estrella Caceres, 66, told AFP in the town of Sedavi.</p>

<p>In Chiva, restaurant owner Danna Daniella said she was still in shock, haunted by memories of people trapped by the raging floods "asking for help and there was nothing we could do".</p>

<p>"It drives you crazy. You look for answers and you don't find them."</p>

<p><strong>Volunteers out in droves</strong></p>

<p>Transport Minister Oscar Puente told El Pais daily that certain places would probably remain inaccessible by land for weeks.</p>

<p>An army of volunteers with food, water and cleaning equipment have played a key role in the recovery, though authorities have urged people to stay home to avoid congestion.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Valencia government limited the number of volunteers authorised to travel to the city's southern suburbs to 2,000 and restricted access to 12 localities.</p>

<p>Despite this thousands made their way to stricken communes on foot, carrying brooms and shovels.</p>

<p>Storms coming off the Mediterranean are common this time of year. But scientists have warned that climate change is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of extreme weather events.</p>

<p>Emergency services on Sunday listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia.</p>

<p>Authorities have warned the toll could rise as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mohamad Hamad purchased and tested explosive materials to cause harm, according to the criminal complaint.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two residents of Pittsburg in Pennsylvania have been arrested on hate crime charges related to the vandalism of Jewish buildings in July. Mohamad Hamad, one of the two arrested, identified himself as a “Hamas operative.” The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69326681/united-states-v-hamad/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">criminal complaint</a> details that Hamad, a dual US-Lebanese citizen and a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, purchased and tested explosive materials with the intention of causing harm.</p>

<p>Hamad, who showed support for extremist groups, allegedly donated to progressive Democrats known for their anti-Israel positions. He reportedly said he desired to die a martyr for Islam, sharing this with a known FBI informant through the encrypted messaging app Signal. In one message, he shared a photo of himself wearing a green headband with the Hamas logo and a sweatshirt that read, “Respect existence or expect resistance,” the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/pittsburgh-hamas-operative-allegedly-bought-explosives-vandalized-jewish-buildings-and-donated-to-squad-democrats/" rel="nofollow,noindex">NY Post</a>&nbsp;reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talya Lubit, Hamad's alleged accomplice, is accused of spray-painting pro-Hamas graffiti on a synagogue and a Jewish community centre. In her communications, she referred to Jews as “enemies” and asked for her county council to pass a resolution calling for a cease-fire against Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jeremy Kazzaz, executive director of the Beacon Coalition, pointed out the troubling trend of anti-Israel sentiment infiltrating the Democratic Party. He told the NY Post, “In Pittsburgh, we've seen an infiltration of the Democratic Party by anti-Israel extremists who frequently target the Jewish community.” This particularly follows incidents of violence against Jewish students at the University of Pittsburgh this semester.</p>

<p>The complaint reveals that Hamad planned to conduct a practice run for an explosion and was excited about detonating explosive devices. Messages indicate he purchased 0.91 kg of aluminum powder and 0.91 kg of potassium perchlorate, materials commonly used in explosives.</p>

<p>Mr Kazzaz stressed the potential danger posed by the anti-Israel rhetoric from certain Democratic officials, suggesting that such rhetoric could embolden extremists. He said, “The way that Summer Lee views the world and has used her bully pulpit has legitimised these extremists.”</p>

<p>Both Hamad and Lubit have connections to the broader anti-Israel movement. Hamad reportedly donated to members of Congress who have publicly called for cease-fires.</p>

<p>“Jewish hatred can actually morph into dangerous situations and violence,” Mr Kazzaz said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On election eve in the United States, the presidential race is deadlocked. The polls are exceptionally close across the country and in all the swing states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin in the industrial midwest; Nevada and Arizona in the west; and Georgia and North Carolina in the south.</p>

<p>The final&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">New York Times/Siena poll</a>&nbsp;shows Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris leading by a very small margin or tied with Republican former President Donald Trump in all the swing states. The exception is Arizona, where Trump leads by a few percentage points.</p>

<p>While there is no clear favourite to win, there are several critical factors that will driving voters' decisions on Election Day. This is what to watch.</p>

<h2>Republicans turning against Trump</h2>

<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">Trump's favourability</a>&nbsp;is stuck around 43% in nationwide polling. In the past two presidential elections, he fell short of taking 50% of the national popular vote. As president, he never achieved over 50% favourability. And he has never topped 50% since leaving office.</p>

<p>This means he has hit a ceiling in his support and is highly unlikely to win the national popular vote on Tuesday.</p>

<p>This also reflects what happened to Trump in the Republican primaries to win the nomination. He dominated the field, defeating Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and several others. But in most of those primaries, 15-20% of Republican voters did not vote for Trump.</p>

<p>Where will these Republican voters ultimately land on Tuesday? Probably half want to vote Republican and will go with Trump. Others will not being able to bring themselves to vote for Harris and will simply not vote for president.</p>

<p>Others will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/01/shy-kamala-harris-voters-polling-00186653?nname=politico-toplines&amp;nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f10e-dd93-ad7f-f90fc4bd0001&amp;nlid=2758340">switch their support to Harris</a>. Indeed, there has never been such a swelling of support from members of one party to support the other party's presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Harris needs those “Republicans for Harris” votes. In addition, she'll need to replicate the coalition of young voters, voters of colour and women who backed current President Joe Biden against Trump in 2020 in those same swing states and nationally.</p>

<p>Her&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris/">favourability ratings are higher</a>&nbsp;than Trump, at around 46%. The closer a presidential candidate is to 50% approval ratings, the better their chance of winning the election.</p>

<h2>It's the economy, stupid</h2>

<p>At the same time, the country is in a bad mood. There is a classic polling question asked at elections: is the country on the right track, or moving in the wrong direction? Between 60–70% of Americans believe the country is on the&nbsp;<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/direction-of-the-united-states">wrong track</a>.</p>

<p>That is a signal this election is about change. Historically, that sentiment has not favoured the incumbent in the White House. As Biden's vice president, Harris is directly facing this headwind.</p>

<p>There are four key issues in this election. The most important is the hip pocket issue: household budgets, cost of living pressures and voters' concerns about their future economic security.</p>

<p>Since Biden and Harris took office nearly four years ago, the cost of groceries, household items, utilities and services such as insurance have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/31/economy-election-inflation-voters/?utm_campaign=wp_evening_edition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;carta-url=https://s2.washingtonpost.com/car-ln-tr/3f7c234/6723efd22153e40ab67f980e/596bc4da9bbc0f403f965aab/12/50/6723efd22153e40ab67f980e">risen</a>&nbsp;between 10–40%. Petrol&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/why-gas-prices-so-high/?itid=lk_inline_manual_41">prices</a>&nbsp;have&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/gas-prices-climbed-14-year/story?id=108652610">gone up</a>&nbsp;even more.</p>

<p>Though interest rates&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/31/us-inflation-report">have fallen</a>, American households are hurting. When asked who is best to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/harris-trump-post-schar-school-poll/">manage the economy</a>, voters in swing states say Trump by a 15-point margin.</p>

<p>The next-biggest issue is immigration. Since Trump first became a presidential candidate in 2015, he has relentlessly pushed the immigration button, declaring the border with Mexico is out of control, with crime and pillage rising in its wake.</p>

<p>The first three years of Biden's term were also marked by big surges of immigrants crossing the border, though&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/07/illegal-crossings-border-migrants-drops/75553327007/#:%7E:text=The%20decline%20puts%20U.S.%20Border,2%20million%20in%20fiscal%202023.">rates have fallen</a>&nbsp;dramatically in 2024.</p>

<p>Voters view Trump as best placed to manage this issue, too, by&nbsp;<a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50846-donald-trump-leads-on-immigration-and-inflation-kamala-harris-on-abortion-and-health-care">nearly 15 points</a>.</p>

<p>So, Trump is seen as a more effective leader on the&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/652970/economy-immigration-abortion-democracy-driving-voters.aspx">two most important policy issues</a>&nbsp;in this election.</p>

<h2>A surge in support from women</h2>

<p>Abortion rights and reproductive health services are the third major issue. Many women across America are repelled by the Supreme Court's decision to take away their long-held constitutional right to an abortion. Now, this policy is decided at the state level. And several conservative Republican states – including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/17/ohio-abortion-rights-republicans-overturn">Ohio</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/2022-live-primary-election-race-results/2022/08/02/1115317596/kansas-voters-abortion-legal-reject-constitutional-amendment">Kansas</a>&nbsp;– have voted to restore abortion rights.</p>

<p>Harris is seen as the champion of these issues. Multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/harris-trump-post-schar-school-poll/">polls</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50846-donald-trump-leads-on-immigration-and-inflation-kamala-harris-on-abortion-and-health-care">show voters</a>&nbsp;trust her more than Trump on reproductive rights, by wide margins.</p>

<p>As a result, polling shows&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380132/gender-gap-election-harris-trump">Harris is leading Trump with women voters</a>&nbsp;in the swing states, by 15 points or more.</p>

<p>Abortion rights are also on the ballot in two swing states,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-abortion-laws-ballot-2024/">Nevada and Arizona</a>, which should help Harris in both.</p>

<p>The future of American democracy is the fourth major issue facing voters. According to a new poll,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-fascist-concerns-poll/story?id=115083795">half the country</a>&nbsp;sees Trump as a profound threat to America's democracy who will wield authoritarian power to enforce his policies and programs.</p>

<p>Harris has pledged to turn the page, heal divisions and get Republicans and Democrats working together again.</p>

<p>In these closing days, Trump continues to make provocative statements with violent imagery. At a rally in Arizona last week, for instance, he again&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/trump-liz-cheney-tucker-carlson.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">attacked</a>&nbsp;Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/liz-cheney-urges-doj-to-prosecute-trump-if-it-finds-evidence-of-crimes-.html">advocated</a>&nbsp;for the prosecution of Trump over the January 6 insurrection:</p>

<p>This may have provided Harris with a final cut-through moment on Trump's fitness for office in the final days of the campaign. She&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/harris-calls-out-trump-00186804">said</a>&nbsp;in response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president. […] Trump is increasingly, however, someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge and is increasingly unstable and unhinged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So, who is going to win?</h2>

<p>Trump's team sees victory in all the polls. His chief pollster&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/31/trump-2024-election-polls-memo">wrote</a>&nbsp;late last week:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Trump's position nationally and in every single battleground state is significantly better than it was four years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The polls may also be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/23/polls-undercounting-trump-support">undercounting</a>&nbsp;the full measure of Trump's support, as was the case in 2016 and 2020. And the polls may not be reflecting the extent of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/26/republican-kamala-harris-racist-sexist-attacks">antipathy</a>&nbsp;towards Harris as a Black and south Asian woman.</p>

<p>Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign director, and who headed the 2020 Biden campaign that defeated Trump, has&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1851278124782141626">told her troops</a>, meanwhile, that undecided voters are “gettable”, adding:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have multiple pathways to victory […] Our folks are voting at levels we need them to vote in order for us to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harris has built a US$1 billion (A$1.5 billion) machine designed to reach voters in the swing states – through personal contact. This machine made&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/joeygarrison/status/1852904117619835175?s=58">three million phone calls and door knocks on homes</a>&nbsp;in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin alone on Saturday. If this machine delivers, it could be the boost Harris needs on election night.</p>

<p>Harris' campaign also signalled over the weekend that late-deciding voters, and especially women, are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/plouffes-message-00186821">breaking their way</a>&nbsp;by double digits. There is a sense among Democrats that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/02/harris-future-forward-election/">Harris is now peaking</a>&nbsp;as the campaign concludes.</p>

<h2>The final analysis</h2>

<p>If Harris wins, it will be because she has successfully&nbsp;<a href="https://theblackwallsttimes.com/2024/10/30/full-transcript-of-vice-president-kamala-harriss-ellipse-speech/">sealed the deal</a>&nbsp;with those voters and made the election a referendum on Trump – that on balance the country has had enough of him after eight years. It also means her ground game delivered the votes.</p>

<p>If Trump wins, it will mean voters trusted him to manage inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze on households, as well as what they see as out-of-control immigration and crime. These messages would also have been further embellished by unease about Harris, a Black and south Asian woman, as president.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Iranian Revolutionary Guards general and pilot were killed in a helicopter crash during an anti-terror operation in the country's restive southeast, state media reported on Monday.</p>

<p>The "ultra-light gyroplane" of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps "had an accident while conducting combat operations" in a border area, IRNA news agency said.</p>

<p>It said the crash happened in Sirkan, a city in Sistan-Baluchistan province, and identified the dead as General Hamid Mazandarani, the commander of the Nineveh Brigade of Golestan province, and Hamed Jandaghi, a pilot of the IRGC ground forces.</p>

<p>Iran's armed forces have been mounting an operation in the region since October 26, when 10 police officers were killed in an attack claimed by Sunni Muslim militants.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[More than 200 languages are spoken in New York, according to the Department of City Planning, backing the claim of it being the melting pot of America.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 200 languages are spoken in New York, according to the Department of City Planning, backing the claim of it being the melting pot of America. However, the ballot papers in the US presidential elections will have only four other languages apart from English.</p>

<p>And guess what? Bengali represents the Indian languages in this list.</p>

<p>The US will on Tuesday vote to elect its 47th President.</p>

<p>“We are required to service four other languages besides English. It is Chinese, Spanish, Korean and Bengali as the Asian languages," says Micheal J Ryan, Executive Director, Board of Elections, NYC.</p>

<p>Subhshesh, who works as a sales agent in a store in Times Square, has Bengali roots. He is happy that his father living in the Queens area will get linguistic assistance when he goes to cast his vote.</p>

<p>“People like me know English but there are many in our community who are comfortable in the native language. This helps them at the polling station. I am sure my father will like the idea of seeing a Bengali language ballot paper," says Subhshesh.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Bengali on ballot papers is not just a courtesy but a legal requirement.</p>

<p>By law, New York City is obligated to provide voting materials in Bengali at certain poll sites. This mandate extends beyond just ballot papers to include other essential voting materials, ensuring comprehensive language support for Bengali-speaking voters.</p>

<p>Ryan explains the reason why Bengali is among the list of languages the Board of Elections serves.</p>

<p>“There was a lawsuit about language access and as you know the country of India has a lot of different languages within it. The settlement of that lawsuit required within a certain population density to have an Asian Indian language. Then through some negotiations, they settled on Bengali. I understand the limitations of Bengali being the choice but it came out of a lawsuit. ” The first time the South Asian community in the Queen's locality of New York found ballots translated into Bengali was in 2013.</p>

<p>The addition of Bengali-language ballots came nearly two years after the federal government ordered the city to provide language assistance to South Asian minorities under a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>

<p>The Bengali-speaking population includes people coming from Asian countries like India and Bangladesh. While it does not represent the whole gamut of languages spoken in the region, the inclusion of this language is expected to have a significant impact on voter participation within the Bengali-speaking community.</p>

<p>Dr Avinash Gupta, President, of the Federation of Indian Association says it helps the Indian community.</p>

<p>“It will help the Indian population to go out and vote. That is how we can get our voices heard. We are a sizable population. It is heartening to see how Indians go out and vote and even contest elections”, says Dr Avinash Gupta.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Monday it had killed a top Hezbollah commander it accused of overseeing rocket and anti-tank missile attacks against Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Abu Ali Rida, the Hezbollah commander of the Baraachit area in southern Lebanon, was "eliminated" in an air strike, the military said, without specifying when he was killed.</p>

<p>Rida "was responsible for planning and executing rocket and anti-tank missile attacks on IDF (military) troops and oversaw the terrorist activities of Hezbollah operatives in the area", the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israel has continued to pound Hezbollah targets in Lebanon since the war between the two sides broke out in late September.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Israel has killed several of the movement's militant commanders and top leaders, including former chief Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>The war began after nearly a year of cross-border skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, with the Lebanese group firing rockets into northern Israel almost daily in support of its ally in Gaza, Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel is fighting its deadliest war in Gaza against Hamas after the Palestinian militant group launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US voters will either pick their first female, Black and Asian leader - or reappoint a chief executive seeking an unprecedented return to the White House he left in disgrace nearly four years ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the most turbulent presidential campaign in decades enters its final hours, Americans can be forgiven for wondering: What just happened?</p>

<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are separated by the narrowest of margins in polls – which show Tuesday's election is a coin flip – and by a chasm in their future vision for the world's premier economic and military power. US voters will either pick their first female, Black and Asian leader – or reappoint a chief executive seeking an unprecedented return to the White House he left in disgrace nearly four years ago.</p>

<p>That's the cast – and then consider the backdrop. The cycle began in a country still reeling from the once-in-a-century Covid-19 pandemic, when Americans elected Joe Biden as the oldest president in US history, and Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol to try and reverse his loss. It's since encompassed the outbreak of major wars in Europe and the Middle East, raising fears the US could get sucked in; a spike in inflation like no American aged under 40 had ever witnessed; and a rollback of federal abortion rights by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>And even that is just a sliver of the drama and chaos that Americans have experienced during the 2024 campaign itself.</p>

<p>Democrats ditched incumbent president Biden in favor of his deputy — Vice President Harris — without consulting their voters. GOP candidate Trump bulldozed his way through primaries, at times campaigning from the New York courtroom where he was ultimately convicted for paying hush money to an adult film star – and then was shot and injured at a rally.</p>

<p><strong>‘That Was the Craziest'</strong></p>

<p>No wonder so many Americans, from first-time voters to seasoned movers and shakers in the campaign-finance world, are still trying to gather their bearings.</p>

<p>Gideon Stein — an entrepreneur, philanthropist and major Democratic donor — is clear about the turning point. “The debate on June 27,” he says. “That to me was the craziest.”</p>

<p>Back then, Biden was still seeking re-election but struggling to ignite much enthusiasm. Dogged by questions about his fitness for another term, he proposed an early debate against Trump in June. To say the strategy backfired is an understatement. So halting and incoherent was the president's performance that he could no longer hold back the dam of angst around his age.</p>

<p>“That's why I got engaged and used my voice as a donor,” says Stein, who was among the group of key Democratic funders who made it clear to the party that they'd withhold donations until Biden was replaced on the ballot. “We were going to continue to invest down ballot, but weren't going to invest in the presidential because everything we were seeing was that he was going to lose.”</p>

<p>Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris as his successor. Looking back, Stein says it was the right move: Democrats have a much better shot at keeping the White House with the vice president atop the ticket. He made good on his promise to the party to donate $3.5 million, disbursing some of it over the past week.</p>

<p>Still, the incident left Democrats with a compressed calendar to introduce Harris to the nation — and a credibility gap to address. Before Biden's debate performance, party officials had mocked and disputed concerns about his age. “They were telling us he was bench-pressing 350 pounds, doing summersaults,” says Eric Levine, a Republican donor who voted for Trump and raised about $1.8 million for down ballot races.</p>

<p><strong>‘Coming After You'</strong></p>

<p>Levine agrees that the president's withdrawal is the most memorable moment of 2024 – “that, and the assassination attempt.”</p>

<p>The moment of maximum drama on the GOP side arrived on July 13, when a bullet grazed Trump's ear at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, killing an attendee. Photos showed a bloodstained ex-president defiantly pumping his fist.</p>

<p>For Eric Marks, a 57-year-old from Kalamazoo, Michigan, that was the most impactful incident of the election. “If the people coming after you know that you're standing up for the truth and they have something to hide, they're going to do whatever they can do to silence you,” he says. US officials have said the shooter was 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>In their truncated three-month-long contest, Trump and Harris have offered sharply different programs for the country that clarify the high stakes.</p>

<p>On the economy, Harris has focused on the so-called sandwich generation, those caught between raising kids and caring for elderly parents. She's promised to provide as much as $25,000 in down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and to expand the child tax credit.</p>

<p>Trump says he'll reduce the corporate tax rate and abolish taxes on Social Security and overtime pay, among other plans. He's also vowed to crack down on undocumented migrants by deporting millions of them.</p>

<p>These messages are getting amplified in advertising campaigns blitzing the country, and especially the handful of states that will likely be decisive: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia. A record $15.9 billion will be spent on federal elections, including House and Senate races, according to OpenSecrets.</p>

<p>Chris Martin, a 38-year-old Black man in Sandy Springs, Georgia — a northern suburb of Atlanta – admits to election fatigue. Every other commercial is political, voters are constantly hammered by text messages from the campaigns, and it's getting a bit much.</p>

<p>“It's this whole us versus them thing going on, and I'm sick of it,” says Martin, who highlighted Trump's unsubstantiated claims that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. “It's nasty stuff, and it's along the lines of race and nationality. The stuff they say about immigrants, it's just awful.”</p>

<p>Internationally, the Democratic candidate has espoused a similar position to Biden, endorsing the US role in NATO and support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. She's had to contend with a schism within the Democratic party driven by Israel's war in Gaza, which is pressuring Harris' support in Michigan, a swing state with a large Arab-American population. Opposition to the war consumed the headlines last spring as student protests erupted on college campuses across the US.</p>

<p>Trump, in a continuation of his first-term stance, has questioned America's global security commitments. He's vowed to resume his trade war with China, by ramping up tariffs on the US's closest economic competitor, and threatens a broad 10% duty on other countries too.</p>

<p><strong>‘Never as Dramatic'</strong></p>

<p>The global backdrop is contributing to election tensions on both sides, according to Rocky Raczkowski, a Republican and former member of the Michigan House of Representatives. “There is economic unease and world turmoil unease with what's happening with Ukraine, Israel and Iran,” he says. “There is also malaise among Democrats, especially progressives, that the system isn't working for them. And there is anger among Republican voters who think the system is selling us down the road to other countries.”</p>

<p>Whether it's driven by events at home or abroad, angst around the vote is widespread. An Oct. 31 AP-NORC Center poll found seven in ten Americans are either anxious or frustrated with the 2024 presidential campaign – an even higher share than in the pandemic-disrupted election of 2020.</p>

<p>Taryn Carthers is one of them. A 21-year-old retail worker who lives northwest of Atlanta, she hasn't followed many campaigns —- but says this one is the craziest.</p>

<p>“I remember being in elementary school when Obama and Romney were running for office,” she says. “It was never as dramatic as what we are dealing with now.” Carthers has gone from being demoralized when Biden led the Democratic ticket, to reinvigorated by the ascent of Harris – and now she says she's despondent again over all the stress. “I'm excited to vote, but also very excited for this election season to be over.”</p>

<p>In the campaign's last week, both sides have been trying to capitalize on missteps from their opponents in order to sway remaining undecided voters who could tilt the outcome.</p>

<p>Trump held a rally at New York City's Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27, where his allies made racist and misogynistic remarks — including calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” — that Democrats pounced on. But a presidential gaffe during a subsequent attempt to capitalize on the incident, in which Biden appeared to describe Trump's supporters as garbage, allowed Republicans an outrage cycle of their own. Even as Biden insisted he was only referring to the comedian who cast the original insult, Trump took to the campaign trail in a garbage truck.</p>

<p><strong>‘Alone With Our Thoughts'</strong></p>

<p>Trump has also sought to keep the embers of his 2020 revolt burning, maintaining without evidence that the vote that year was fraudulent – and potentially sowing distrust in the soon-to-be-revealed 2024 results. States have bolstered election protocols to guard against disruptions.</p>

<p>The GOP contender, ever superstitious, is scheduled to wrap up his campaign in Grand Rapids, Michigan for the third straight cycle – before heading to Florida to await the count. Harris will hold a rally on the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum, made famous by the movie “Rocky,” and then return to Washington. She'll spend election night at her alma mater Howard University.</p>

<p>In Madison, Wisconsin, Debra Zillmer has hit on her own election strategy: get out of town. The 70-year-old, a retired orthopedic surgeon who's voting for Harris, has taken to traveling with her husband in their recreational vehicle to escape from the swing state. Her motive will likely resonate with many Americans, in the final days of a disorienting campaign.</p>

<p>“We just have to get out of there, be alone with our thoughts, not be watching the news all the time,” Zillmer says. “I find it very unsettling.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ignored by both the Democrat and Republican campaigns ahead during the Presidential primaries, Iowa now seems to hold the potential to become a swing state in the electoral battle between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The latest poll by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/02/iowa-as-a-swing-state-iowa-poll-shows-harris-and-trump-in-tight-race/76020309007/">Des Moines Register</a> newspaper showed Ms Harris leading 47 percent to 44 percent over Mr Trump, buoyed by the support of women and independent voters. The latter was quick to reject the poll as "fake" and "skewed". "One of my enemies just puts out a poll -- I am 3 down. (Iowa Senator) Joni Ernst called me, everyone's called me, they said you are killing in Iowa. The farmers love me and I love them," he said at a rally in key battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Iowa, which was not a battleground state ahead of the November 5 US Presidential elections, was not on the itineraries of the two nominees, who made multiple campaign visits to the seven swing states ― Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>More than 75 million Americans have already cast their votes as of Sunday, according to the University of Florida's Election Lab that tracks early and mail-in voting across the US. The poll of 808 likely Iowa voters, which include those who have already voted as well as those who say they definitely plan to vote, was conducted from October 28 to 31, Des Moines Register said.</p>

<p>Women, especially those who are 65 and older and those who self-identify as independents, are spearheading the shift to Ms Harris, the poll shows. Senior women support the Democrat over the Republican nominee 63 percent to 28 percent, and women who are political independents favor Ms Harris by 57 percent to 29 percent. Mr Trump maintains large margins with groups that are core to his base: men, rural Iowans and those who describe themselves as evangelical.</p>

<p>Interestingly, though the state was clinched by Mr Trump by nearly 10 points in each of the last two elections. That, however, does not qualify it as a Republican stronghold as it was bagged by Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.</p>

<p>In the election campaign, Ms Harris has been projecting the election as the one to protect the country's fundamental freedoms, safeguard constitutional values and ensure women's rights. Mr Trump has been promising to rebuild the economy and rid the US from illegal migration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

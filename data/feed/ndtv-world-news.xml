       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mother of the teenager charged with fatally shooting two students and two teachers at a Georgia high school on Wednesday called the school that morning and warned a counselor about an "extreme emergency," the Washington Post reported.</p>

<p>Marcee Gray, the mother of the suspected shooter, 14-year-old Colt Gray, said she told the counselor to find her son immediately, the newspaper reported. Phone records provided by a relative to the Post show a 10-minute call to Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, at 9:50 a.m., about 30 minutes before the attack began.</p>

<p>Gray declined to detail what prompted her call but told the Post on Saturday she had shared that with law enforcement. She expressed remorse for the "pain and suffering" that the victims and their families are going through.</p>

<p>A school administrator went to her son's math class that morning, according to another student, the Post reported, but he was not in the room.</p>

<p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the lead investigative agency, referred questions to the Piedmont Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office, which is prosecuting the case. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</p>

<p>Colt Gray has been charged as an adult with four counts of murder. His father, Colin Gray, is also charged with murder, involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children, in an emerging legal strategy to hold parents responsible for allowing access to firearms to minors who carry out attacks.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say Colin Gray provided the weapon used in the shooting.</p>

<p>In May 2023, investigators from a neighboring county interviewed both Colin and Colt Gray about online threats to carry out a school shooting. Colt Gray said he had not made the threats, and his father said his son did not have free access to his hunting rifles.</p>

<p>The case was closed after investigators could not substantiate that either Gray was connected to the threats.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[He died from multiple organ failure due to a pneumococcal infection, often linked to a weakened immune system.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic incident that highlights the devastating effects of overwork, a 30-year-old Chinese man died from organ failure after a gruelling 104-day work stretch with only one day of rest. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3277316/china-man-30-worked-104-days-1-day-dies-organ-failure-court-orders-compensation" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em>,&nbsp;the man identified as A'bao, who worked as a painter, contracted a pneumococcal infection leading to his death in June 2023. Notably,&nbsp;A'bao had entered into a contractual agreement with a company&nbsp;in February last year, committing to work on a project until January of this year.</p>

<p>Following the signing of the contract, A'bao was assigned to a work project located in Zhoushan, a city in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang. He then&nbsp;embarked on an exhausting work schedule, working every day for 104 consecutive days from February to May last year, with only one day of rest on April 6. On May 25, he finally took a sick day, feeling unwell and spending the day resting in his dormitory. However, his condition rapidly deteriorated, and by May 28, he had to be rushed to the hospital by his colleagues. Doctors diagnosed him with a lung infection and respiratory failure. He died on June 1.</p>

<p>After his death, his family filed a lawsuit against his employer, alleging gross negligence. The legal action came after social security officials controversially ruled that A'bao's death could not be classified as a work-related injury, citing the timing of his death as the reason. However, his family argued that the prolonged period of excessive work and lack of rest contributed directly to A'bao's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the company also claimed that A'bao's workload was reasonable and that any additional hours worked were voluntary. Further, the company shifted the blame to A'bao's pre-existing health conditions and alleged that his failure to seek timely medical attention aggravated his situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, a Chinese court ruled in favour of the painter's family, holding A'bao's employer 20% liable for his death.&nbsp;The court found that A'bao died from multiple organ failure due to a pneumococcal infection, often linked to a weakened immune system. The court also determined&nbsp;that A'bao's prolonged work period of 104 consecutive days was a blatant violation of Chinese Labour Law, which explicitly stipulates a maximum of 8 working hours per day and an average of 44 hours per week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The court awarded A'bao's family a total of 400,000 yuan (approximately Rs 47,46,000) in compensation, comprising financial reparation and a separate sum of 10,000 yuan for emotional distress. Though the company appealed, the original verdict was upheld in August.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece plans to impose a 20-euro levy on cruise ship visitors to the islands of Santorini and Mykonos during the peak summer season, in a bid to avert overtourism, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Greece relies heavily on tourism, the main driver of the country's economy which is still recovering from a decade-long crisis that wiped out a fourth of its output.</p>

<p>But some of its most popular destinations, including Santorini, an idyllic island of quaint villages and pristine beaches with 20,000 permanent residents, risk being ruined by mass tourism.</p>

<p>Speaking at a press conference a day after outlining his main economic policies for 2025, Mitsotakis clarified that excessive tourism was only a problem in a few destinations.</p>

<p>"Greece does not have a structural overtourism problem... Some of its destinations have a significant issue during certain weeks or months of the year, which we need to deal with," he said.</p>

<p>"Cruise shipping has burdened Santorini and Mykonos and this is why we are proceeding with interventions," he added, announcing the levy.</p>

<p>Greek tourism revenues stood at about 20 billion euros in 2023 on the back of nearly 31 million tourist arrivals.</p>

<p>In Santorini, protesters have called for curbs on tourism, as in other popular holiday destinations in Europe, including Venice and Barcelona.</p>

<p>Part of the revenues from the cruise shipping tax will be returned to local communities to be invested in infrastructure, Mitsotakis said.</p>

<p>The government also plans to regulate the number of cruise ships that arrive simultaneously at certain destinations, while rules to protect the environment and tackle water shortages must also be imposed on islands, he said.</p>

<p>Greece also wants to increase a tax on short-term rentals and ban new licenses for such rentals in central Athens to increase the housing stock for permanent residents, Mitsotakis said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The government will detail some of the measures on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Egyptian archaeologist and former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass has launched a petition for the return to Egypt of the pharaonic bust of Queen Nefertiti from the Neues Museum in Berlin.</p>

<p>Nefertiti's famous painted limestone bust was uncovered at Tell el-Amarna, around 300 km (185 miles) south of Cairo, in 1912 by a German archaeological mission, which shipped it to Berlin the following year.</p>

<p>Amarna was the short-lived capital of Nefertiti's husband, the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten, who reigned until about 1335 BC.</p>

<p>Akhenaten, called the heretic king, was notorious for promoting the worship of the god Aten to the exclusion of Egypt's other gods. His reign also introduced a radical change in Egyptian art.</p>

<p>In his petition launched on Saturday, Hawass asked for the return of the bust, saying it was removed from Egypt illegally after its discovery.</p>

<p>"We announce today that Egypt - this is the national committee, it is not a government committee - asks for the return of the bust of Nefertiti," Hawass said.</p>

<p>"What I need from everyone here is to go to my website... hawasszahi.com, and you will sign, one signature, to show that you would love for this bust to come back."</p>

<p>Hawass said he is not calling for the repatriation of artefacts taken out of Egypt legally. His campaign is focused on repatriating "three main beautiful objects" including the bust of Nefertiti, the Rosetta Stone and the Dendera Zodiac.</p>

<p>Officials at Berlin's Neues Museum were not immediately available for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Michael Brodkorb, former deputy chair of Minnesota Republican Party, is part of a growing wave that could affect the outcome of the November election: lifelong Republicans who have broken with Donald Trump to support Vice President Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Brodkorb, former deputy chair of the Minnesota Republican Party, finds himself part of an unlikely yet growing wave that could affect the outcome of the November election: lifelong Republicans who have broken with Donald Trump to support Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The movement is without precedent in American presidential politics. Its ranks now include hundreds of staffers of former Republican presidents and nominees, retired senior military officers, White House lawyers going back to Ronald Reagan's administration and many others.</p>

<p>I've known Brodkorb for years. He was a hardcore party guy who delighted in finding dirt on the opposition, including launching an early blog he called "Minnesota Democrats Exposed."</p>

<p>But he and others in this breakaway group no longer recognize their party under Trump - a party without principles, without history, and built entirely around a cult of personality.</p>

<p>These are not people who have abandoned their conservative principles. Certainly not former Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson, who last month said in an opinion piece that "the Republican Party will continue its obedience to Trump and destroy our democracy." Nor Mesa, Arizona Mayor John Giles, who co-chairs Republicans for Harris. Nor Jim McCain, son of late Arizona Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee. Nor former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and vocal Trump critic, who on Wednesday announced that she will vote for Harris. Cheney, whose criticism of the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and vote to impeach him cost her her seat, said it wasn't enough to not vote for Trump.</p>

<p>"It is crucially important for people to recognize - not only is what I've just said about the danger that Trump poses something that should prevent people from voting for him, but I don't believe we have the luxury of writing in candidates' names, particularly in swing states," Cheney said during an appearance at Duke University.</p>

<p>Her father, who served two terms under President George W. Bush, said Friday that he also plans to vote for Harris.</p>

<p>"In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump," former Vice President Cheney said in a statement. "He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.</p>

<p>"As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris," he said.</p>

<p>These "normie" Republicans, as they often call themselves, have a daunting task. To succeed, they must build a structure that allows Republicans to adhere to their conservative beliefs yet gives them permission to act decisively to block the threat of a second Trump term.</p>

<p>The key won't be in forcing them to move left. They don't want to abandon a lifetime of GOP principles, including believing in small government, free trade, and a strong defense. Neither will it come from Harris lunging right. Doing so would risk too much of her progressive base.</p>

<p>Instead, it will take a skillful reframing of what's at stake in this election and the GOP's role. It centers around a simple message: Country before party, together with a recognition that the old Republican party is gone and that, in Giles' words, "We don't owe a damn thing to what's been left behind."</p>

<p>This will be a temporary truce, but one that could yield extraordinary benefits for the country and, ultimately, a new Republican Party finally free of Trump's toxic, decade-long hold.</p>

<p>The spirit of compromise needed to vote for the opposition's nominee could become the building block for a new, more principled and ultimately more successful Republican Party. In aligning with Harris, these Republicans display a level of discipline and maturity that will bode well for rebuilding their party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such an approach could have yielded the strong border policy crafted by a bipartisan group of senators and maliciously torpedoed by Trump. It could have tempered Democratic spending without resorting to gridlock. It could have shifted focus from the culture war nonsense to the harder but gratifying work of building a stronger economy.</p>

<p>A CBS opinion poll in August showed that 9% of likely voters who support Trump are prepared to at least consider voting for Harris. Tapping into that discontent, Republican Voters Against Trump launched an $11.5 million ad campaign in critical battleground states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The ads feature former Trump voters talking calmly about why they are voting for Harris.</p>

<p>One of those voters, Lars Svahoe, 66, calls himself a strong-on-defense fiscal conservative. Trump, he says in a YouTube video explaining his choice, "turned out to be a disappointment. A clown." Deporting 10 to 12 million undocumented immigrants "quite literally frightens me. That's not what we want in a Republican party."</p>

<p>That type of relatable persuasion, which meets voters where they are, can be remarkably effective. It was just such a campaign that made Minnesota the first state to defeat a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in 2012. Similar bans had already passed in each of the 30 states where they had been introduced.</p>

<p>Harris is wisely seizing on this new movement and making it easy for these disillusioned Republicans to join her. She is openly courting the disaffected, offering a sign-up to "reach out to other Republican, Independent and Trump-skeptical voters" about supporting her campaign. Republicans, including Giles, were given prominent speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention last month. Former Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, who along with Cheney served on the committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack and was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, was taken aback by the warm and thunderous reception he received from Democratic delegates.</p>

<p>Harris also has begun offering sensible, middle-of-the-road policies, such as her proposal on small business startups, that belie Trump's attempts to categorize her as "Komrade Kamala." She has promised to sign the bipartisan border bill, showing that compromise does not have to be a dirty word.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have held together as a nation this long because the ties that bind Americans together are far greater than what divides us: the rule of law, the enduring principles in the Constitution, freedom that does not forsake responsibility, and an acknowledgment that the world still looks to this country as a leader.</p>

<p>If there is a new Silent Majority today, it's the Republicans who yearn to break free of Trump's dystopian vision of America on the brink of ruin but have done nothing.</p>

<p>The Republicans who can look past tribal divisions and cross party lines to vote for Harris can also provide something else this country desperately needs: a win decisive enough to shatter Trump's fallback for challenging the election results.</p>

<p>Giles is actively stumping for Harris. Brodkorb says he is doing persuasion talks with Republicans, holding Zooms and creating lists. "I put my door-knocking shoes back on for the first time in a long time," he told me.</p>

<p>Giles and Brodkorb are right. It's not enough to stay home. It's not even enough to vote for Harris. Republicans who want to defeat Trump and reclaim their party will need to reach out to others and build that breakaway group until MAGA fades into obscurity.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, arrived in New Delhi on his first official visit to India at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Sunday.</p>

<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal received the visiting dignitary at the airport and accorded a ceremonial welcome.</p>

<p>This is Zayed Al Nahyan's first visit to India as the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and he is accompanied by several Ministers from the UAE government and a business delegation.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 9 and hold discussions on a wide range of areas of bilateral cooperation.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to call on President Droupadi Murmu and will visit Rajghat to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>On September 10, the visiting Crown Prince will visit Mumbai to participate in a business forum, in which business leaders from both countries will participate.</p>

<p>"India and UAE share historically close and friendly ties. In recent years, the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between India and UAE has deepened in a wide range of areas including political, trade, investment, connectivity, energy, technology, education, and culture. The Crown Prince's visit will further reinforce strong India-UAE bilateral relations and open avenues for partnership in new and emerging areas," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, earlier this week.</p>

<p>In January, UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited India and explored ways to further build upon the strategic partnership between the two countries during his discussions with PM Modi. He also attended the 10th edition of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit.</p>

<p>In July 2023, PM Modi visited the UAE - his fifth visit to the country since 2015 when he became the first Prime Minister of India to visit the UAE in 34 years.</p>

<p>The India-UAE relationship was formally elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership during the visit of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to India in 2017.</p>

<p>According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), India-UAE trade rose to USD 85 billion in 2022, making the UAE India's third-largest trading partner for the year 2022-23 and India's second-largest export destination. India is the UAE's second largest trading partner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[What exactly causes vitiligo is not clear, but experts say that environmental stress factors can contribute to its onset.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in China has claimed that her 11-year-old son, Liu, developed Vitiligo, a condition causing white patches on the skin, after being slapped by his teacher. The teacher's harsh punishment was for not completing his mathematics homework, the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3277077/china-mother-claims-son-suffers-loss-skin-pigmentation-after-being-slapped-teacher"> South China Morning Post</a></em> reported. Liu, a student at Yifu Primary School, told his mother that his teacher humiliated him by bringing him to the front of the classroom, and then slapped him three times on the right side of his face and once on the left.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Liu's mother surnamed Huang, noticed severe swelling on her son's face and took him to the hospital for medical attention.&nbsp;Three months after the incident, Liu began to exhibit a distressing physical symptom: the loss of pigmentation in certain areas of his skin. Although the exact causes of vitiligo are still not fully understood, research suggests that environmental stress factors, such as physical or emotional trauma, may play a role in triggering the onset of the condition.</p>

<p>The school is currently awaiting the outcome of a police investigation and a forensic injury assessment, which will inform their decision on disciplinary actions against the teacher responsible for the incident. The teacher's identity, including their gender, has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Liu's mother has expressed frustration at being unable to contact the teacher or receive reimbursement for her son's medical expenses, despite the hospital having sent the bill to the teacher.&nbsp;Research from the National Institutes of Health reveals that individuals with vitiligo are more likely to experience anxiety or depression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On social media, the incident has sparked outrage and many users demanded strict punishment against the teacher.&nbsp;One user wrote, ''How could a teacher hurt a student so badly without receiving any punishment for three months?'' Another said, ''Slapping a boy in the face is a step too far.''</p>

<p>Notably, China's law bans teachers from inflicting corporal punishments on students. However,&nbsp;incidents of teachers abusing students continue to be a massive problem.&nbsp;Last year, a nine-year-old girl underwent emergency surgery for a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinese-student-hospitalised-with-shattered-skull-after-teacher-beats-her-4400141" rel="nofollow, noindex">severely damaged skull,</a> after a teacher allegedly used a metal ruler to hit her on the head. The teacher, identified as Song Mouming, was employed at Bocai Meixihu Primary School in Hunan province, central China. He was arrested by the local police after the incident.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh will take necessary steps to extradite deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina from India to try her on charges of mass killings during the student-led mass movement against her government, the newly-appointed chief prosecutor of the country's International Crimes Tribunal said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Following unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India.</p>

<p>Necessary steps will be taken to bring former prime minister Hasina back under the extradition treaty with India to try her on charges of mass killings during the student-led protests in July and August, International Crimes Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Md Tajul Islam was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.</p>

<p>"We will file an application with the International Crimes Tribunal, when it resumes functions, to issue arrest warrants against all the accused including Sheikh Hasina in connection with the cases filed for mass killing and crimes against humanity," he said at a press briefing on the ICT premises in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Replying to a question, he said a decision would be taken after consulting with the government about amendments to the existing International Crimes Tribunal Act for holding trial of the new cases filed with IT.</p>

<p>"Information, documents and evidence against the accused persons will have to be collected from across the country and those will have to be compiled, examined and placed properly before the tribunal, which is very much challenging and huge task," Islam added.</p>

<p>According to the interim government's Health Adviser Nurjahan Begum, more than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds injured during the protests against the Hasina-led government.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) last month launched an investigation against Hasina and nine others on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity that took place from July 15 to August 5 during the students' mass movement.</p>

<p>Islam said the International Crimes Tribunal and its investigation team will have to be reconstituted by appointing new judges and investigators as previous judges, prosecution team and investigation agency appointed by the previous government have stepped down after the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed in the country following the fall of the Hasina-led government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who is currently in Saudi Arabia for a key Gulf summit, will travel to Germany and Switzerland later this week on an official visit.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar will reach Berlin, Germany, on Tuesday for a two-day official visit - his third visit as Foreign Minister to Berlin.</p>

<p>The minister will meet the German Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock as well as the leadership and other ministers from the German government with an aim to review the entire gamut of bilateral relations between India and Germany, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>"Both India and Germany share a robust Strategic Partnership and Germany is one of India's prominent trading partners and among the largest Foreign Direct Investors," the MEA said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar is currently in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to attend the First India-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Foreign Ministers' Meeting. His visit comes as India looks to bolster its ties in West Asia, popularly called the Middle East.</p>

<p>The Gulf Cooperation Council is a political and economic union of six countries in the Gulf region- Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After his Germany visit, Mr Jaishankar will travel to Geneva, Switzerland, from September 12 to 13. Mr Jaishankar will meet the Swiss Foreign Minister to review the close partnership between the two countries and explore avenues to enhance the bilateral relationship further, according to the MEA.</p>

<p>Geneva is home to some of the most important international organisations and UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Labour Organisation.</p>

<p>The minister is expected to meet the heads and representatives of international organisations with whom India is actively engaged.</p>

<p>As the most populous country in the world and among the top 5 global economies, India has been vying for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for years. Countries like Russia, France, the US, and the UK have endorsed India's bid, with China being the only hindrance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ahead of the iPhone 16 series launch, a throwback video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone viral on social media where he addresses the common misconceptions about why the US-based company invested in China for manufacturing of its products.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple, the Cupertino tech giant, relies on the vast manufacturing network in China for the mass production of its iPhone and other devices. In recent times, the company has also shifted focus to other key markets, including India, to diversify its manufacturing base.<br />
<br />
Now, days ahead of the highly-anticipated launch of the iPhone 16 series, an old video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has gained significant attention on social media. In the viral video, Cook is seen addressing the common misconception about why the US-based company has invested heavily in China for its product manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Debunking the common belief that companies flock to China for cheap labour, Mr Cook said, "There is a confusion about China. And let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labour costs. I am not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being a low labour cost country many years ago."<br />
<br />
The Apple CEO elaborated on the advanced tooling and precision required to produce the products and highlighted China's vocational expertise in these areas.<br />
<br />
"The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is," he said.<br />
<br />
Mr Cook noted that the product it makes requires "really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state of the art."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"And the tooling skill is very deep here. You know, in the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I am not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields. It's that vocational expertise is very, very deep here," he added.<br />
<br />
The throwback clip of Tim Cook was shared on social media site X and has garnered six million views so far. It also caught the attention of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who agreed with his views.<br />
<br />
In the comments section, Mr Musk wrote, "True".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br />
Mr Musk's comment on the Chinese manufacturing sector came just months after his surprise visit to the Asian country where he plans to introduce Tesla's self-driving technology to a market with ferocious competition.<br />
<br />
On his trip, he met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla as a “successful model” for US-China collaboration.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Apple is currently gearing up for its mega event, 'It's Glowtime'. The tech giant will roll out its all-new iPhone 16 series, besides setting the stage for a new artificial intelligence platform.<br />
<br />
The event will take place at 10:30 PM on September 9 in India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gunman crossing from Jordan killed three Israeli civilians at the Allenby Bridge border in the occupied West Bank before security forces shot him dead on Sunday, Israeli authorities said. It was the first attack of its kind along the border with Jordan since October 7, when Palestinian group Hamas carried out an assault on southern Israel, sparking the war in Gaza that has since escalated throughout the region.</p>

<p>The attack took place in a commercial cargo area under Israeli control where Jordanian trucks offload cargo entering the West Bank, officials said. The crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, lies about midway between Amman and Jerusalem just north of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>"A terrorist approached the area of the Allenby Bridge from Jordan in a truck, exited the truck, and opened fire at the Israeli security forces operating at the bridge," the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>"The terrorist was eliminated by the security forces, and three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack," it said.</p>

<p>Jordan was investigating the shooting and a Jordanian official said the crossing has been closed.</p>

<p>The Israeli manager of the crossing said three workers were shot dead at close range by the driver crossing from Jordan.</p>

<p>Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994 and have close security ties. Dozens of trailers cross daily from Jordan, with goods from Jordan and the Gulf that supply both the West Bank and Israeli markets.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"India and the GCC enjoy a deep and multifaceted relationship, in areas including political, trade &amp; investment, energy cooperation, cultural and people - to - people ties. The GCC region has emerged as a major trading partner for India and is home to a large Indian expatriate community, numbering around 8.9 million. The Foreign Ministers meeting will be an opportunity to review and deepen institutional cooperation between India and the GCC across various sectors," the MEA said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar will thereafter visit Berlin, Germany, for a two-day trip from September 10 to 11. This will be his third visit as Minister to Berlin. "Both India and Germany share a robust Strategic Partnership and Germany is one of India's prominent trading partners and among the largest Foreign Direct Investors," the MEA said.</p>

<p>He will also travel to Geneva, Switzerland for an official visit from September 12 to 13. During the visit, he will meet heads and representatives of international organisations with whom India is actively engaged.</p>

<p>Notably, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, will come to India for a two-day official visit from September 9 to 10. The Crown Prince will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold discussions on bilateral cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar on Friday spoke about revitalising the connections between India and the Mediterranean region.</p>

<p>"It is vital that as we move forward, we embrace this collaborative spirit, uphold open communication, and commit to shared goals. Together we can address today's challenges, unlock new opportunities and build a resilient and connected future," he said at the CII India Mediterranean Business Conclave.</p>

<p>He underscored the need for strengthening security and defence cooperation between India and the Mediterranean region, given the high volatility and uncertainty in the global economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mediterranean region has a vast green hydrogen and green ammonia potential. Highlighting this, Mr Jaishankar talked about energy cooperation as another important dimension of collaboration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 14-year-old student who shot dead two students and two teachers at his school in US' Georgia had sent an apology text to his mother before he opened fire, his grandfather told the New York Post.</p>

<p>The text prompted frantic calls by the mother to the school in an apparent bid to stop the tragedy, he said.</p>

<p>Charles Polhamus said his daughter Marcee Gray was at his house when she received a text from her son Colt Gray. "I'm sorry, mom," it read.</p>

<p>After she read the message, she made desperate calls to the school, trying to warn them of an "extreme emergency," her relative told The Washington Post.</p>

<p>"I was the one that notified the school counselor at the high school. I told them it was an extreme emergency and for them to go immediately and find [my son] to check on him," she had told her sister.</p>

<p>Fearing the worst, she began driving to the school and was half way there when she learned that four people had been killed, her father said.</p>

<p>"It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible," Marcee told The New York Post.</p>

<p>After receiving her panicked call, the school authorities tried to avert the disaster. A school official also went to Colt's classroom but he entered minutes after he had left the room.</p>

<p>Both Colt and his father are now facing charges of murder in connection to the shooting. Authorities said the father gifted him the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting as a Christmas gift.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The virus was first identified in a 61-year-old patient in Jinzhou city in June 2019, who fell ill five days after being bitten by ticks in Inner Mongolia's wetlands]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new virus, dubbed wetland virus (WELV), has been discovered in China that can spread to humans through tick bites, causing neurological disease in some cases, according to media reports.</p>

<p>The virus was first identified in a 61-year-old patient in Jinzhou city in June 2019, who fell ill five days after being bitten by ticks in Inner Mongolia's wetlands. The patient experienced fever, headache and vomiting, with symptoms resistant to antibiotics, according to a report published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2313722" rel="nofollow,noindex">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>WELV belongs to a group of viruses known for being transmitted by ticks, similar to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which can cause severe illness in humans. Following the initial discovery, researchers conducted a thorough investigation in northern China, where they collected nearly 14,600 ticks from various locations. About 2 per cent of these tested positive for WELV genetic material, primarily from the species Haemaphysalis concinna.</p>

<p>WELV RNA was also found in sheep, horses, pigs and rodents called Transbaikal zokor. The virus showed cytopathic effects in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells and caused lethal infections in animal models.</p>

<p>The researchers also analysed blood samples from forest rangers in the region, finding antibodies to WELV in 12 out of 640 individuals. Further tests on patients with tick bites revealed that 20 individuals tested positive for the virus, with symptoms ranging from fever, dizziness and headache to nausea and diarrhoea. One patient even fell into a coma due to high white blood cell counts in the brain and spinal fluid.</p>

<p>Although all patients recovered after treatment, lab experiments on mice showed that WELV can cause lethal infections and potentially affect the nervous system. This suggests that while WELV can be mild in some cases, it has the potential to cause severe health issues, particularly involving the brain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Duke of Sussex will be eligible to receive a substantial sum on September 15 from a trust established by Queen Elizabeth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry is reportedly set to receive millions from the late Queen Mother on his 40th birthday next week, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/harry-charles-meghan-william-royal-family-latest-news-b2608721.html?page=3" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>. The media outlet states that the Duke of Sussex will be eligible to receive a substantial sum on September 15 from a trust established by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother when he was ten years old.</p>

<p>At that time, the Queen Mother, who was then 94, is said to have set aside a tax-free $40.4 million for her great-grandchildren, as reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/prince-harry-to-get-millions-from-queen-mother-on-40th-birthday-mcvqt339f" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Times</em></a>.</p>

<p>The newspaper further explains that the inheritances were divided into two instalments-one to be given to Princes William and Harry when they turned 21, and another on their 40th birthdays.</p>

<p>A former palace aide told The Times: "There was a trust fund set up at the time. It was a way for the Queen Mother to set aside money for her great-grandchildren when they were older, and a way of passing a portion of her estate down in a tax-efficient manner. It allowed some of her estate to be safeguarded for them."</p>

<p>Sources suggest that Harry may have received a larger portion of the inheritance than his older brother William, 42. Insiders believe this is because the Queen Mother anticipated that William, as Britain's future heir, would inherit a more substantial fortune from the Duchy of Cornwall.</p>

<p>William became Duke of Cornwall when he was named Prince of Wales after King Charles' coronation, inheriting an estimated $50.2 million from the estate.</p>

<p>When the Queen Mother passed away in 2002 at the age of 101, Buckingham Palace released a statement saying, "Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother has bequeathed her entire estate (which mainly comprises the contents of her houses) to the Queen."</p>

<p>"In her will, she requested that the Queen make certain bequests to members of her staff, and these bequests will be subject to inheritance tax as usual. The Queen has decided that the most important of Queen Elizabeth's pictures and works of art should be transferred to the Royal Collection."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">Volcanoes were erupting on the Moon as recently as 120 million years ago, evidence collected by a Chinese spacecraft suggests. Until the last few years, scientists had thought volcanic activity ended on the Moon around 2 billion years ago.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6635">published in Science</a>, come from analysis of lunar rock and soil delivered to Earth by China's Chang'e 5 spacecraft in 2020. While these results are difficult to reconcile with the accepted history of lunar volcanism, it's possible some areas of the Moon's interior were more enriched in radioactive elements that generate the heat that drives volcanic activity.</p>

<p>The region where Chang'e 5 landed, called Oceanus Procellarum, may be one such area where rocks were enriched in these heat-producing elements.</p>

<p>Volcanism is a major way in which all rocky planetary bodies <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/shaping_the_planets/volcanism/">lose their heat</a>. The rocky bodies in our Solar System are Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter's satellite Io, and Earth's satellite, the Moon.</p>

<p>All available evidence suggests that Venus is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02272-1">currently volcanically active</a>. On Mars, we can date the ages of formation of large lava flows by counting the numbers of impact craters on these flows.</p>

<p>This crater-counting technique relies on the fact that craters form randomly and uniformly across planetary surfaces, so highly cratered terrains are considered older. The results suggest that Mars, which is half the size of Earth, is volcanically active <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/17545">every few million years</a>.</p>

<p>This is expected, because larger bodies conserve heat better than smaller ones. On this basis Mercury, which is a third of Earth's size, and our Moon, a quarter the size of Earth, should have been volcanically dead for about 2 billion years.</p>

<p>The same should be true of Io, which is similar in size to our Moon. However, tidal forces generated by gravitational interactions with Jupiter give Io an additional, strong heat source. Io is very volcanically active as a result.</p>

<h2>The Moon's dark areas</h2>

<p>Most eruptions on the Moon took place near the edges of giant depressions formed early in the Moon's history by asteroid impacts. Lava flooded the interiors of these basins <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/80/5/735/6545/Origin-of-Lunar-Maria">to form the dark areas</a> on the Moon's near side. These areas are call maria (singular mare), the Latin for seas, because the flat sheets of lava were mistaken for expanses of water by early observers.</p>

<p>Analyses of the composition and age of samples returned from these mare areas by the six Apollo missions and three Soviet robotic probes were consistent with the belief there had been no geologically recent volcanic activity on the Moon.</p>

<p>This understanding persisted until very high-resolution images of the lunar surface from the US <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission</a> became available following the mission's launch in 2009. Counts of the numbers of very small impact craters revealed a lack of craters in some volcanic areas with unusual surface textures, named <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JE006362">irregular mare patches (IMPs)</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest explanation for this was that these IMPs were young, typically about 100 million years old. This is 20 times younger than the 2 billion-year youngest age that had been expected.</p>

<p>In an attempt to reconcile these observations with the accepted history of lunar volcanism, it was pointed out that the lack of any atmosphere on the Moon would make eruptions there significantly different from those on Earth. The lack of confining pressure would have allowed erupting lavas to release almost all of the gaseous compounds dissolved in them, allowing some lava flows to contain very large numbers of gas bubbles – <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027316303705">to the extent of being a foam</a>.</p>

<p>Meteoroid impacts into this soft foam would produce much smaller craters than in solid rock, thus causing the crater-counting method to give ages that were too young.</p>

<p>This issue has seen much debate, and the best way to resolve it is the return of samples to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis. Chang'e 5 brought back samples from a very large lava flow which was already known, from crater-counting, to be relatively young in geological terms.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04100-2">Initial analyses</a> of many fragments of the lava were consistent with the long-accepted theory that lunar volcanism stopped 2 billion years ago. However, closer examination of the Chinese samples, as described in the new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6635">Science paper</a>, focused on some of the smallest fragments – the majority from rock shattered and melted into droplets by meteoroid impacts.</p>

<p>Three of these 3,000 droplets were identified from their detailed chemistry as volcanic in origin, and are only 120 million years old – very similar to the young ages inferred for IMPs elsewhere on the Moon.</p>

<h2>Lunar eruptions</h2>

<p>Lunar eruptions should have involved high lava fountains like those commonly seen erupting in Hawaii, for example. While most of these droplets would have accumulated into lava flows, some would have been thrown out for tens of kilometres to other parts of the Moon's surface.</p>

<p>The three “volcanic droplets” identified in the Chang'e 5 sample were probably not erupted from the same vent as the bulk of the rock and soil delivered to Earth. This would explain why these droplets are much younger than the lava flow at Chang'e 5's landing site.</p>

<p>These three glassy droplets are the first physical evidence we have for anomalously recent volcanic activity on the Moon. There would have to have been much higher concentrations of heat-producing radioactive elements in some areas than others for volcanic activity to have occurred as recently as the new results imply. So, these findings could prompt a major revision in our understanding of how the Moon developed.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic visit to Ukraine, India finds itself in a position to play peacemaker in the years-long Russia-Ukraine war. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval will be travelling to Moscow this week to hold crucial discussions in this regard.</p>

<p>In July, PM Modi had also travelled to Russia on an official visit and held detailed discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>India, because of its independent foreign policy, finds itself in a unique position to be able to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. With Europe and its western allies (NATO allies) finding themselves in a stalemate with Russia, backed by China, India, which has maintained friendly ties with most nations, opens a thrid axis in a largely bipolar world.</p>

<p>"We (India) are not neutral. From the very beginning, we have taken sides. And we have chosen the side of peace. We have come from the land of Buddha where there is no place for war," PM Modi had said during his recent visit to Ukraine.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="PM Modi was received warmly both by Putin and Zelenskyy during his recent visits to Russia and Ukraine." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/op79fk94_pm-modi-putin-zelenskyy-modi-russia-ukraine_625x300_08_September_24.jpg" title="PM Modi was received warmly both by Putin and Zelenskyy during his recent visits to Russia and Ukraine." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">PM Modi was received warmly both by Putin and Zelenskyy during his recent visits to Russia and Ukraine.</p>
</div>

<p>In his talks with Mr Zelensky that took place under the shadow of the conflict, PM Modi said India is ever ready to play an "active role" in every effort to restore peace in Ukraine and he would even like to contribute personally in ending the conflict.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi, who had already visited Russia earlier, followed up his Ukraine visit with a phone call to President Putin. "Spoke with President Putin today," he had written on social media site X on August 27, adding that the two leaders "Exchanged perspectives on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and my insights from the recent visit to Ukraine. Reiterated India's firm commitment to support an early, abiding and peaceful resolution of the conflict."</p>

<p>Earlier, PM Modi's Office in the joint India-Ukraine statement said both leaders reiterated their readiness for further cooperation in upholding principles of international law, including the UN Charter.</p>

<p>While Russia had described PM Modi's visit as "historic, game-changing", Ukraine too had called the Prime Minister's visit "historic", saying India is "key" in the global diplomatic efforts to end the war. The United States too, praised India's efforts, with President Biden saying, "I spoke with Prime Minister Modi to discuss his recent trip to Poland and Ukraine, and commended him for his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine."</p>

<p><strong>NSA AJIT DOVAL'S RUSSIA VISIT</strong></p>

<p>National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's visit to Moscow comes days after PM Modi's visit to Kyiv where he spoke with President Zelenskyy, and subsequent phone calls with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>During the PM's phone call with President Putin, the leaders decided that Ajit Doval would visit Moscow for peace talks, sources said. No other details regarding the schedule of this visit is known yet.</p>

<p>Speaking about the phone call, the Russian Embassy said, "Vladimir Putin shared his principled assessment of the destructive policies of the Kiev authorities and their Western patrons, and went on to highlight Russia's approaches to resolving this conflict."</p>

<p>Sources also said that Mr Doval will be carrying PM Modi's peace plan which he will deliver to President Putin and discuss in detail with top Kremlin officials.</p>

<p>President Putin's phone call with PM Modi and now a visit by Ajit Doval indicates that Russia is open to peace talks, signalling the end of the years-long war. President Putin had said earlier that, "We (Russia) seek negotiations based on agreed documents, not on fleeting demands (by Ukraine)."</p>

<p><strong>INDIA'S RISING ROLE IN GLOBAL DIPLOMACY</strong></p>

<p>Calling India a "Major geopolitical actor" in a recent interview to NDTV, former United Nations Security Council chief and ex-Singapore diplomat Kishore Mahbubani said, "How many leaders in the world can comfortably visit both Russia and Ukraine and be received warmly by both countries. Very few countries in the world. And the fact that Prime Minister Modi can do that is a sign of how India has arrived as a major geopolitical actor."</p>

<p>Itaian PM Georgia Meloni said on Saturday that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-can-help-resolve-russia-ukraine-conflict-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-6514363" target="_blank">India can help resolve</a> the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>The White House too described PM Modi's visits to Russia and then Ukraine as "potentially helpful."</p>

<p>The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine began on February 24, 2022.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A six-year-old girl from the UK has climbed a 13,600-foot mountain to raise money for the hospital that saved her life as a baby.</p>

<p>A resident of Wales, Seren Price, became the youngest person to climb Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains in Morocco.</p>

<p>The six-year-old now plans to climb Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Western Europe, in an effort to raise money for Birmingham Children's Hospital.</p>

<p>Seren said that when she was a baby she had a "lump in my neck" and the hospital helped treat her condition which is why she is now raising money for it. Her father said the hospital saved her life when she was young as she was born prematurely with a haemangioma on her neck that affected her breathing.</p>

<p>Seren and her father Glyn Price flew to Morocco in August. With their guide, they walked for eight hours to Mount Toubkal base camp even as temperatures topped 40 degrees.</p>

<p>Mr Price said they reached the summit the next day. "It was a tough hike with narrow paths on slippy vertical scree," he told BBC.</p>

<p>"The heat was the biggest challenge... but once we got to the top it was brilliant. There were about 20 people there who had followed her story on social media, and they were giving her a big round of applause," he added.</p>

<p>On her training for the daunting climb, Seren confidently said she trained only for a week, her father laughed and corrected her saying it was much longer than that.</p>

<p>The father-daughter duo had been training for about a year which also included nighttime walks in a nearby national park. "We were able to replicate some of the tracks. Obviously, the weather wasn't the same, but the terrain was," Mr Price said.</p>

<p>This is not the first time the young mountaineer has broken a record. In 2022, she became the youngest person to complete the UK's three peaks challenge -- climbing the three highest peaks of Scotland, England and Wales -- in under 48 hours.</p>

<p>Now, the young climber has her eyes set on Mount Blac which she says she is excited to scale to "see the snow".</p>

<p>Mr Price, who also has a son said one cannot force children's passions. "I have a boy and I've tried to take him up the mountains, he's not interested - but Seren loves it."</p>

<p>When asked what makes her love climbing, Seren said: "I like spending time with my dad - and seeing the nice things when I'm at the top of the mountain."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Iran-backed Hezbollah has exchanged near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the group's October 7 attack on Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and Israeli forces traded cross-border attacks, both sides said early Sunday, a day after the Lebanese health ministry reported three rescuers killed in an Israeli attack.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed Lebanese movement has exchanged near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip, with repeated escalations during 11 months of the cross-border violence.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had bombarded the northern Israeli town of "Kiryat Shmona with a volley of Falaq rockets" early Sunday "in response to the enemy attacks... and particularly the attack" that killed the emergency workers in the Lebanese village of Froun.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency responders were killed and two others wounded, one of them critically, in an Israeli strike on Froun.</p>

<p>The ministry said the attack had targeted "a Lebanese civil defence team that was putting out fires sparked by the recent Israeli strikes", while the Israeli military said it had "eliminated terrorists" from the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement in Froun.</p>

<p>Lebanon's civil defence agency said three of its employees were killed in "an Israeli strike that targeted a firefighting vehicle after they had finished a firefighting mission".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying in a statement that "this new aggression against Lebanon is a blatant violation of international laws... and human values".</p>

<p>Separately on Sunday, Hezbollah said that its fighters had also fired rockets at the Israeli community of Shamir, near Kiryat Shmona.</p>

<p>Hezbollah usually says it targets military positions in northern Israel, while Israel has said it targets Hezbollah infrastructure and fighters in south and east Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military on Sunday morning announced it had carried out a series of air strikes on "Hezbollah military structures" and intercepted projectiles launched from Lebanon during the night.</p>

<p>In Froun on Saturday, a military statement said Israeli forces "struck and eliminated" Amal members who "operated within a Hezbollah military structure".</p>

<p>Hezbollah ally the Amal movement said two of its members were among the dead in Saturday's strike. It said they were killed "while carrying out their humanitarian and national duty defending Lebanon and the south".</p>

<p>The Lebanese health ministry statement condemned the "blatant Israeli attack that targeted a team from an official body of the Lebanese state".</p>

<p>It added that the attack was "the second of its kind against an emergency team in less than 12 hours".</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, the ministry said two emergency personnel from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Committee were wounded when "the Israeli enemy deliberately targeted" near a fire they were heading to extinguish in south Lebanon's Qabrikha, causing their vehicle to swerve.</p>

<p>Several militant groups operate health centres and emergency response operations in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had announced a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Saturday, including with Katyusha rockets and "explosives-laden drones", some in a stated response to "Israeli enemy attacks" on south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed some 614 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 138 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p>

<p>A statement from Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said that "due to the (Israeli) aggression", 27 emergency personnel and health workers have been killed and 94 others wounded since October.</p>

<p>Two hospitals and 21 health centres have been "targeted", while 32 fire or ambulance vehicles have been "put out of service or partially damaged", the statement said, urging an end to the "repeated and deliberate targeting of health workers and civilians".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prince Harry was recently spotted attending the funeral of Lord Robert Fellowes, the husband of Lady Jane Fellowes, and is believed to have "secretly" stayed with his uncle Charles Spencer at Althorp House, the childhood home of Princess Diana.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry, who has been estranged from several members of the British royal family, including his brother Prince William and father King Charles, is reportedly still in close contact with his mother's relatives.</p>

<p>According to former BBC Royal correspondent Jennie Bond, the Duke of Sussex has maintained a strong connection with his aunts and uncle, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Lady Jane Fellowes, and Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, who are the siblings of his late mother, Princess Diana.</p>

<p>"Quietly, behind the scenes, it is obvious that the Spencer family have kept the communication channels open with Harry and that their affection for him is reciprocated," Ms Bond told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/royal/prince-harry-communication-family-expert-33611483 ">OK!</a>&nbsp;“I'm sure Harry feels it's important that he still has some kind of anchor here in the UK and, for now at least, it seems that it is with his aunts and uncle. And that has to be a positive thing.”</p>

<p>Prince Harry was recently spotted attending the funeral of Lord Robert Fellowes, the husband of Lady Jane Fellowes, and is believed to have "secretly" stayed with his uncle Charles Spencer at Althorp House, the childhood home of Princess Diana.</p>

<p>The Spencer family has been a constant source of support for Harry, who has faced scrutiny and criticism since stepping back from royal duties. His late mother, Princess Diana, was laid to rest on the grounds of Althorp House, which holds sentimental value for Harry.</p>

<p>The news comes as Prince Harry's relationship with his brother, Prince William, and father, King Charles, remains tense.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Adalina, an Italian restaurant in Chicago led by Top Chef alum Soo Ahn, has launched a "Marrow Martini," considered one of the most expensive cocktails in the US Priced at several thousand dollars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ultra luxurious new cocktail in Chicago, Illinois, comes with a several thousand dollar price tag attached. According to <em>Fox News Digital,</em> Adalina, an Italian restaurant in the Windy City, has unveiled the "Marrow Martini, which contains more than just a drink; it's a piece of stunning diamond jewellery.</p>

<p>Led by Top Chef alum Soo Ahn, Adalina partnered with the jewellery brand Marrow Fine, headquartered just underneath the restaurant, to develop a truly unique experience. The martini will be served with a 9-carat diamond tennis necklace featuring 150 diamonds set in 14K gold.</p>

<p>With that, "it's likely the most expensive Martini in the United States," says Colin Hofer, a manager at Adalina, in an email to<em> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chicago-restaurant-serving-most-expensive-martini-us-priced-13k">Fox News Digital.</a> </em>It pumps up the luxury within the cocktail scene in the United States.</p>

<p>"Instead of traditional spirits like gin or vodka, I chose Mezcal because I believe it has untapped potential as a luxury spirit. Mezcal, much like heirloom jewellery, is often overlooked despite its richness. The particular Mezcal we use is a rare, sought-after brand made from Green Agave, native to the deserts of San Luis Potosi, Mexico," Hofer said.</p>

<p>Jillian Sassone, founder of Marrow Fine, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chicago-restaurant-serving-most-expensive-martini-us-priced-13k"><em>Fox News Digital </em></a>via email she suspects the drink will make for memorable evenings.</p>

<p>"Adalina was a natural choice to partner with, not only because of its proximity but also because of their world-class menu from Top Chef Soo Ahn. Each time I have visited Adalina, I'm blown away by every dish but also by the palpable energy and excitement in the restaurant," she said.</p>

<p>"While it's not something we expect to see sold frequently, it has sparked a lot of interest among our clientele. It's more about creating an iconic experience for a select few rather than broad popularity," Hofer said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday revealed that his father was on a hijacked flight in 1984 and said he had a unique window on "both sides" in such situations - the perspective of family members and those in the government.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar was answering a question during a community event in Geneva about the recently released television series on the hijacking of IC-814 in 1999.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar told the audience how as a young officer then, he was part of the team dealing with the hijack situation on the one hand and on the other, he was part of the group of families putting pressure on the government.</p>

<p>During the question and answer session after his address to the Indian community, a member of the audience asked the Minister about his comments on the recently released series 'IC-814: The Kandahar Hijack' on Netflix, which he said, showed "the bureaucracy and the government dealing with hijacking in poor light." With a disclaimer that he has not watched the series, Mr Jaishankar went on to reveal his personal connection with the hijacking incident.</p>

<p>"In 1984 there was a hijacking. I was a very young officer. I was part of the team which was dealing with it. I rang up my mother, actually, to tell her, 'Look, I can't come. There's a hijacking," he said elaborating how it was his turn to go home and feed his young son as his wife too was working.</p>

<p>"And then I discovered, my father was on the flight. The flight ended up in Dubai. It's a long story, but fortunately, nobody got killed. It could have ended as a problem," he added.</p>

<p>On July 5, 1984, an Indian Airlines flight was hijacked from Pathankot and taken to Dubai. After more than 36 hours, 12 pro-Khalistani hijackers surrendered to authorities and released all 68 passengers and six crew members unharmed.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar was an IFS officer and became a minister after his retirement. His father K Subrahmanyam was an IAS officer and a regular commentator on strategic issues.</p>

<p>"And it was interesting because on the one hand, I was part of the team which was working on the hijacking. On the other hand, I was part of the family members who are pressing the government for the hijacking. So actually, I have that very unique window on both sides, in that sense of the problem," he added.</p>

<p>"So, often these are situations and movie guys don't make the governments look good. The hero is supposed to look good. Then nobody would watch the movie and you got to accept that," he commented, evoking peals of laughter from the audience.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 25-year-old man of Pakistani heritage has been convicted of murdering an Indian restaurant manager with a stolen car while the victim was cycling back home in south-east England on Valentine's Day this year.</p>

<p>Vignesh Pattabhiraman, 36, was killed by Shazeb Khalid with a "stolen Range Rover" while he cycling back from his workplace - an Indian restaurant 'Vel' - in Reading, United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Indian man was declared dead at the Royal Berkshire Hospital and a murder investigation was launched.</p>

<p>Khalid was arrested on February 19 and charged with murder the following day.</p>

<p>Khalid was on Wednesday found guilty of murdering Pattabhiraman following a trial at Reading Crown Court that lasted 28 days.</p>

<p>Khalid pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter at an earlier hearing but was convicted of murder by the jury.</p>

<p>Soiheem Hussain, 27, and Mya Reilly, 20, who were also arrested and charged in the case, also appeared during the same trial.</p>

<p>While Hussain was found guilty of assisting an offender, Reilly was found not guilty on the same charge.</p>

<p>Khalid is set to be sentenced on October 10.</p>

<p>Thames Valley Police, which had conducted the murder investigation, told the court that a post-mortem examination ascertained that Pattabhiraman had died due to a head injury following the collision.</p>

<p>"I am glad that the jury has found Khalid guilty of murder," said Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Stuart Brangwin, the Senior Investigating Officer of the case at Thames Valley Police.</p>

<p>"It was obviously clear to the jury that Khalid intended to cause Vignesh harm that evening. He used the stolen Range Rover he was driving as a weapon and left him to suffer knowing that he had hit him," he said.</p>

<p>"The communication between Khalid and Hussain throughout the evening of Pattabhiraman's death showed that Hussain was very much aware of what happened and that he assisted in the aftermath. The death of Vignesh has left his family devastated, and I hope this verdict will help them in some way," added DCI Brangwin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Just Giving charity initiative set up online by Pattabhiraman's friends and family to help with repatriation costs and support for his grieving wife Ramya after the "senseless tragedy" has raised over GBP 52,500.</p>

<p>"Vignesh was a committed restaurant manager at Vel, where he poured his heart and soul into his work, earning recognition for his exceptionally warm nature, customer service and work ethic. His dream of reaching a senior management position in the hotel industry was within reach, with an exciting opportunity awaiting him at Hyatt Regency Mayfair London," reads the online tribute.</p>

<p>"In addition to his professional endeavours, Pattabhiraman cherished time with his beloved wife, Ramya, and their shared aspirations for a bright future in the UK. Their dreams were shattered by this senseless tragedy, leaving behind a void that cannot be filled," it adds.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamza bin Laden, the son of Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, is alive and leading the terror outfit, according to intelligence reports cited by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.themirror.com/news/world-news/osama-bin-ladens-dead-son-691261"><em>The Mirror</em></a>. Hamza is secretly running Al Qaeda from Afghanistan along with his brother, Abdullah bin Laden, the publication says in an explosive report. The National Mobilisation Front (NMF), an anti-Taliban military alliance, also carried a report detailing the operations of Hamza and his associates. The outlet said that the man dubbed the “crown prince of terror” is hiding in northern Afghanistan under the constant protection of 450 snipers.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.memri.org/jttm/afghan-resistance-media-reports-terror-hideouts-afghanistan-abdullah-bin-laden-son-osama-bin">The </a><em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.memri.org/jttm/afghan-resistance-media-reports-terror-hideouts-afghanistan-abdullah-bin-laden-son-osama-bin">NMF</a> </em>has warned that since the 2021 fall of Kabul, Afghanistan has become a "training centre for various terror groups".</p>

<p>"Hamza bin Laden has been moved to Dara Abdullah Khel district (in Panjshir), where 450 Arabs and Pakistanis are protecting him," it said, warning that "under his command, Al Qaeda is regrouping and preparing for future attacks on Western targets".</p>

<p>The <em>NMF</em> report contradicted claims that Hamza was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza is believed to have worked closely with Ayman al-Zawahiri, who took over the affairs of Al Qaeda after Osama's killing.</p>

<p>The news about Hamza's killing was released after his audio and video messages surfaced calling for attacks on the US and other countries.</p>

<p>However, the place and date of death was unclear, per an old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49187315"><em>BBC</em> report</a>. The Pentagon too did not comment on the issue.</p>

<p>Hamza bin Laden was officially designated by the US as a global terrorist and was believed to have been under house arrest in Iran.</p>

<p>He is thought to have been born in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, before spending years with his mother in Iran.</p>

<p>Hamza's father Osama bin Laden was killed by US Special Forces in 2011, in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He had approved the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the MVA-BN vaccine as the first vaccine against mpox to be added to its prequalification list.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the MVA-BN vaccine as the first vaccine against mpox to be added to its prequalification list. This is expected to facilitate timely and increased access to this vital product in communities with urgent need, to reduce transmission and help contain the outbreak, WHO said in a statement on its website.</p>

<p>WHO 'prequalification' and 'emergency use listing' are mechanisms used to evaluate quality, safety and efficacy of medical products, such as vaccines, diagnostics and medicines, and product suitability for use in a low- and middle-income country context.</p>

<p>WHO's assessment for prequalification of the mpox vaccine is based on information submitted by the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic A/S, and reviewed by the European Medicines Agency, the regulatory agency of record for this vaccine.</p>

<p>"This first prequalification of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa, and in future," said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p>

<p>"We now need urgent scale up in procurement, donations and rollout to ensure equitable access to vaccines where they are needed most, alongside other public health tools, to prevent infections, stop transmission and save lives," Dr Ghebreyesus said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">WHO has prequalified the MVA-BN vaccine, the first vaccine against <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mpox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mpox</a> to be approved!<br />
<br />
This approval is a major step towards expanding access and reducing transmission in high-risk communities.<a href="https://t.co/Tk700dct6J">https://t.co/Tk700dct6J</a> <a href="https://t.co/v42K66u0rP">pic.twitter.com/v42K66u0rP</a></p>
— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1834528802619236558?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The MVA-BN vaccine can be given to people over 18 years old as a two-dose injection, four weeks apart, WHO said. After prior cold storage, the vaccine can be kept at 2-8 degree Celsius for up to eight weeks, it said.</p>

<p>The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation reviewed all available evidence and recommended the use of MVA-BN vaccine in the context of an mpox outbreak for people at high risk of exposure, WHO said.</p>

<p>While MVA-BN is currently not licensed for people younger than 18 years, this vaccine may be used "off-label" in infants, children and adolescents, and in pregnant and immunocompromised people, WHO said. This means the vaccine use is recommended in outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks.</p>

<p>WHO has, however, emphasised the need to collect further data on vaccine safety and effectiveness under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Available data shows that a single-dose MVA-BN vaccine given before exposure has an estimated 76 per cent effectiveness in protecting people against mpox, with the two-dose schedule achieving an estimated 82 per cent effectiveness.</p>

<p>Vaccination after exposure is less effective than pre-exposure vaccination, WHO said.</p>

<p>The escalating mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO Director-General on August 14.</p>

<p>Over 120 countries have confirmed more than 1.03 lakh cases since the onset of the global outbreak in 2022. In 2024 alone, there were 25,237 suspected and confirmed cases, and 723 deaths from different outbreaks in 14 African nations, WHO said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A landslide in Greenland, triggered by glacier melting due to climate change, caused an earthquake, vibrations from which reverberated throughout the planet for nine straight days and damaged infrastructure, according to a new study.</p>

<p>In September 2023, a 1.2 kilometre-high mountain peak in an East Greenland fjord - a narrow inlet of sea between two steep cliffs - collapsed, causing a tsunami about 200 metres tall.</p>

<p>Researchers said the giant wave rocked back and forth across the fjord for nine days, which sent seismic shocks reverberating throughout Earth's crust, baffling scientists around the world.</p>

<p>While no one was hurt, the shocks destroyed infrastructure worth nearly USD 2,00,000 at an unoccupied research station on Ella Island in eastern Greenland, the international team, including researchers from the University College London, UK, said.</p>

<p>According to them, the landslide was a result of the melting of glacier at the foot of the mountain, becoming thinner and unable to hold up the rock-face above it - this was ultimately due to climate change.</p>

<p>"Our findings highlight how climate change is causing cascading, hazardous feedbacks between the cryosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere," the authors wrote in the study published in the journal Science.</p>

<p>"When I first saw the seismic signal, I was completely baffled. Even though we know seismometers can record a variety of sources happening on Earth's surface, never before has such a long-lasting, globally travelling seismic wave, containing only a single frequency of oscillation, been recorded. This inspired me to co-lead a large team of scientists to figure out the puzzle," co-author Stephen Hicks, from the University College London, said.</p>

<p>For the study, the researchers used a mathematical model and recreated the landslide, along with the uniquely narrow and bendy fjord, to understand how the sloshing of water could have continued on for nine straight days without dying down.</p>

<p>The team, comprising 68 scientists from 41 research institutions, combined seismic recordings from around the world, field measurements, satellite imagery and computer simulations for their analysis.</p>

<p>The simulations were eventually able to closely match the height of the real-world tsunami as well as the slow cycles of the long-lasting back-and-forth sloshing of water, they said.</p>

<p>By bringing together diverse datasets, the model predicted that the giant tsunami wave would have moved back and forth every 90 seconds, matching the recordings of vibrations travelling in the Earth's crust all around the globe, the researchers said.</p>

<p>As climate change continues to melt Earth's polar regions, it could lead to an increase in large, destructive landslides such as this one, they said.</p>

<p>"Climate change is shifting what is typical on Earth, and it can set unusual events into motion," said co-author and seismologist Alice Gabriel, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California - San Diego, US.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A year after a bizarre seismic signal baffled scientists globally, researchers have finally pinpointed its origin. The enigmatic signal, classified as an "unidentified seismic object" (USO), was traced back to a colossal landslide in Greenland's remote Dickson Fjord. The landslide, triggered by the thinning of a glacier due to global warming, caused a mega-tsunami and a seiche, resulting in a continuous hum with a single vibration frequency that lasted for nine days.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9247">new study published in the journal Science</a>, the landslide's immense power was due to the weakening of the mountain's support caused by decades of glacier thinning. When the mountain collapsed, it sent vibrations through the Earth, shaking the planet and generating seismic waves that were felt globally.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The glacier, enough to fill 10,000 Olympic swimming pools, had plunged into the fjord, triggering a towering mega-tsunami. The resulting wave reached an astonishing 200 metres in height – twice the size of London's iconic Big Ben.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In the study, researchers revealed that the unusual seismic signal was generated by standing waves in the fjord caused by the rockslide. Scientists warn that we may see more of these unexpected events as the planet continues to warm.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The study further reveals a complex interplay between climate change, the cryosphere, hydrosphere and mass wasting events. The authors suggest that signals like this may offer a new perspective on understanding these interactions.</p>

<p>Consider the full magnitude of Kamala Harris' challenge coming into Tuesday's debate. She is half Black and half Indian in a predominantly white nation where they are in a growing funk about being reduced to less than a majority by 2042. Her opponent is an alpha male, Donald Trump, in a society that is more macho than any other “advanced” country.</p>

<p>Harris had a disastrous campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2020. She is remembered for her left-of-centre policies like universal health care and decriminalisation of illegal immigration, and for opposing fracking. She was the Vice-President - among the nation's most nondescript jobs - to a president who became deeply unpopular because of high inflation and botched immigration controls.</p>

<p>She did not go through the grind of nomination party primaries where her policies, postures and personality would get defined. She was catapulted into being the Domestic contender less than 100 days before election eve. She is not the leftist of 2020. She cannot position herself as the baton carrier of Biden's legacy because that would be electoral suicide. Her biggest problem is that people do not know enough about her or what she stands for.</p>

<h2><strong>Most Don't Know Who Kamala Really Is</strong></h2>

<p>She had a great debut at the August Democratic National Convention (DNC), but the NYT/Siena poll on the eve of the debate came as a damper. Almost a third of those polled said they do not know enough about her or her policies, compared to only 5% for Trump. Some 36% felt she is too “progressive” compared to 28% who felt Trump is too “conservative”. As many as 97% of those who voted for Trump in 2020 said they would vote for him again. His base of white non-college educated, elderly, rural and evangelicals is rock solid.</p>

<p>Going into the debate, it was the swing vote in the “Arjun eye” of both Trump and Harris. Some 18 million of the US's 161 million American voters are registered as “undecided”. Within them, it is estimated that the swing vote is 7% in seven states. Now observers have narrowed the swing vote down to 50,000 from five states.</p>

<p>For that narrow target audience - as much for anybody other than MAGA (Make America Great Again) <em>bhakts</em> - there is little doubt that Harris won the debate, hands down. In a consolidation of her convention profile, she came across as presidential, fully aware of the power and prestige of the office; as somebody who engages with policies and solutions, and wants to represent all Americans, including Republicans; somebody who values freedom in its widest sense, including woman's rights over their bodies; somebody who wants to lead Americans out of their recent fractious past into a future of opportunity.</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala Sprung A Surprise</strong></h2>

<p>She had become fully prepped by a team which, in a departure from Biden's lot, includes disillusioned ex-members of Trump's core team. She had her list of talking points and she made sure she ticked off all of them, irrespective of the questions asked. She made no effort to defend Biden's record on its weakest legacies but spiritedly defended the regime's record on healthcare and the NATO support for Ukraine. Her policy prescriptions were as nondescript — whatever does an “economy of opportunity mean? — as at the DNC, but she was at her passionate best on abortion.</p>

<p>Most importantly, she baited Trump repeatedly on all his pet peeves, so that the worst of him came out. This she did brilliantly from her opening statement, priming the audience to expect the “same old playbook and bunch of lies”. To her delight, Trump fell for every single bait she laid for him.</p>

<p>She said people left his rallies out of “boredom and exhaustion”; predictably, Trump thundered that his rallies are the “biggest ever”. She said the world's leaders she had met as V-P would laugh at Trump; at how easily he could be manipulated by flattery; that they call him a “disgrace”. He shouted into the mic how “strong” world leaders like Victor Urban of Hungary say that the world has gone to pieces after Trump; how the wars in Ukraine and Israel-Gaza would never have happened had be been President; how he would end the wars in “24 hours” by bashing the heads of all combatants the day he became the President-elect.</p>

<h2><strong>How Trump Missed Opportunities</strong></h2>

<p>Her coup de grace against Trump was on the results of the 2020 elections. In response to a question from the moderator, Trump repeated that he had not accepted that he had lost the last election. Harris latched on to the response, saying he had been “fired” by 81 million voters, and that his attempts at reviewing the vote had been turned down by over 60 courts. She stressed how his refusal to process the fact that he had indeed lost the election cast doubt on whether “this candidate standing to my right” had the cognitive ability to accept facts, and that the American people deserved something better from their Chief Executive.</p>

<p>So rattled was Trump that he barely nicked Harris on her vulnerabilities when he could have stuck a knife through her. He did repeat rants like “Biden was the worst President of the US and she was the worst Vice-President”, and he did nail the Biden administration on the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan leaving behind $ 85 billion of fresh armaments. But he failed to pin her down on her several policy flip-flops, on the crisis of affordability in American families on the price of groceries, housing and healthcare, on the inability of the Biden administration to end the war in Gaza or to cripple Russia's economy because of the Ukraine invasion, or to prevent China from attaining superiority in strategic technologies.</p>

<p>On abortion, where he was on the defensive, he could have deeply wounded Harris by pointing out that women seeking abortion in Minnesota face no restriction on which pregnancy stage they opt for abortion at. In fact, Trump mentioned Tom Walz, the Minnesota governor and Harris's V-P nominee, as he began his answer on abortion, but he made only an elliptical reference to Walz and then lost his way. Instead, he alleged that Democrats were allowing unwanted babies to be “executed” after they were born, only to be corrected by the fact-checking moderators.</p>

<h2><strong>Shooting Himself In The Foot</strong></h2>

<p>Much as Harris predicted, Trump brought up immigration even when the question was not about that. He repeatedly ranted at the “millions and millions of criminals and insane lunatics” invading the country and went on to make the fantastic claim that this “invasion” would lead to WW-III.</p>

<p>In his first mention of immigration on the debate, he predictably repeated a lie that Haitian migrants in Ohio were eating cats and dogs of the people. Only, again, to be fact-checked by the moderator that town authorities had completely denied the story. The next day, the parents of the boy whose story had ostensibly led to the lie spread by the right-wing media and brought to national attention by a tweet from J.D. Vance asked the Republicans to back off.</p>

<h2><strong>Did Trump Underestimate Kamala?</strong></h2>

<p>No question, Harris got the debate she would have wanted in her dreams. Trump was either poorly prepared or, more likely, not prepared at all. A&nbsp;<i>New York Post</i>&nbsp;reporter, who has met him over the last 10 years, was shocked to learn at her latest meeting that Trump did not seem to know that Harris's upbringing had little to do with her Marxist-economist professor father. His staff confirmed to her that he was not being briefed.</p>

<p>It was evident in the debate that Trump is yet to come to terms with being denied the opportunity to take revenge from Biden. Sensing this, a sharp Harris reminded him in the debate that it wasn't Biden who he was contesting against, reinforcing the image of a man not in touch with reality. The debate was not even over when Taylor Swift tweeted that she was endorsing Harris, identifying herself as a “Cat Lady”, referring to Vance's rant against “cat ladies”. Swift's endorsement, in the air since the DNC, will impact some of the youth vote.</p>

<h2><strong>A Trip To The 'Spin Room'</strong></h2>

<p>There were other happy straws in the wind to follow for Harris. Word got out that Trump had visited the “spin room” immediately after the debate. This is a room where the candidate's media team gathers to issue denials and clarifications, gauge response and initiate social media ripples, knowing that it is the memes and clips that are played over and over again that agglomerate the debate's impact among fans and critics. Candidates typically never visit the “spin room” post the debate.</p>

<p>The next morning brought further confirmation for Harris when Trump lashed out at the&nbsp;<i>ABC</i>, the host of the debate. He charged the moderators with being biased because of their several fact-checks, which the channel had announced it would do, unlike other media hosts in the past. Trump ranted that the moderators should be criminally prosecuted and that the channel's licence should be revoked.</p>

<p>This was the ultimate proof that Harris had eminently succeeded in her objective of getting under his skin.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Harris Has Round One</b></h2>

<p>Will there be another debate? Harris needs the vast audience these debates bring — 67 million watched the Tuesday debate — to present her personable and confident self to the electorate. Democrats have made it known they want another slugfest. Trump may not be able to resist the opportunity to get his own back at a candidate who he disparages privately far more than he does so richly in public.</p>

<p>This election will hinge on countless anonymous assessments made regarding which candidate has the better character to be the next President of the United States, based on fleeting and superficial considerations by people with only a scant interest in politics. The Harris team won this gladiatorial contest but the war will be on at full pitch till November 5.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">Banning children under 16 from social media <a href="https://theconversation.com/view-from-the-hill-social-media-age-ban-all-to-the-good-but-can-albanese-deliver-before-election-238686">sounds like a seductive idea</a>. For overwhelmed parents <a href="https://theconversation.com/should-parents-be-worried-about-social-media-we-asked-5-experts-238772">navigating their kids' lives</a> in a digital age, this move from the Australian government may seem like a welcome relief.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>However, evidence shows it's highly <a href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/about/media/media-releases/mental-health-organisations-collaborate-to-call-for-changes-to-social-media-platforms">unlikely bans will positively impact the youth mental health crisis</a> in this country. Indeed, bans <a href="https://theconversation.com/should-parents-be-worried-about-social-media-we-asked-5-experts-238772">may make our children even more vulnerable</a> online.</p>

<p>Children and young people <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/1334805/Young_and_Online_Report.pdf">go online primarily to socialise with their peers</a>. Online spaces are one of the few avenues our <a href="https://theconversation.com/active-or-overscheduled-kids-how-parents-can-consider-benefits-and-risks-of-extracurricular-activities-218988">overscheduled children</a> have to interact freely with each other, which is crucial for their wellbeing.</p>

<h3><strong>Not just safe, but optimal</strong></h3>

<p>Safety by design is not the whole solution. Building on the efforts to develop <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/industry/codes#:%7E:text=online%20industry%20must%20prevent%20and,1C%20and%20class%202%20material.">industry codes</a>, industry and government should come together to develop a wider range of standards that deliver not just safe, but <em>optimal</em> digital environments for children.</p>

<p>How? High-quality, child-centred evidence can help major platforms develop industry-wide standards that define what kinds of content are appropriate for children of different ages.</p>

<p>We also need targeted education for children that builds their <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1976503/Reimagining_Online_Safety_Education.pdf">digital capabilities</a> and prepares them to deal with and grow through their engagement online.</p>

<p>For example, rather than education that focuses on extreme harm, children are calling for online safety education in schools and elsewhere that supports them in managing the low-level, everyday risks of harm they encounter online: disagreements with friends, inappropriate content or feeling excluded.</p>

<h3><strong>Heed the evidence</strong></h3>

<p>Some authoritative, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/general-comments-and-recommendations/general-comment-no-25-2021-childrens-rights-relation">evidence-based guidance</a> already exists. It tells us how to ensure children can mitigate potential harms and maximise the benefits of the digital environment.</p>

<p>Where the evidence doesn't yet exist, we need to invest in child-centred research. It's the best method for gaining nuanced accounts of children's digital practices and can guide a coherent and strategic <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620919372">long-term approach to policy and practice</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/STEFSS-5">Drawing on lessons from the COVID pandemic</a>, we also need to better align evidence with decision-making processes. This means speeding up high-quality, robust research processes or finding ways for research to better anticipate and generate evidence around emerging challenges. This way, governments can weigh up the benefits and drawbacks of particular policy actions.</p>

<p>Technology is not beyond our control. Rather, we need to decide, together, what role we want technology to play in childhood.</p>

<p>We need to move beyond a protectionist focus and <a href="https://researchdirect.westernsydney.edu.au/islandora/object/uws%3A44562">work with children themselves</a> to build the very best digital environments we can imagine. Nothing short of the future is at stake in doing so.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Coelacanths are deep-sea fish that live off the coasts of southern Africa and Indonesia and can reach up to two metres in length. For a long time, scientists believed they were extinct.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51238-4">new research</a> published in Nature Communications, we reveal the best-preserved coelacanth fossil ever found from the ancient period hundreds of millions of years ago when these ancient sea-dwellers first evolved. The fossil comes from the Gogo Formation on Gooniyandi Country in northern Western Australia.</p>

<p>We also studied the evolution of all the hundreds of coelacanth species we know from the fossil record to find out what drove the creation of new species across the aeons.</p>

<p>The answer came as a surprise: the greatest influence on coelacanth evolution was not ocean.</p>

<p>Later, during the age of dinosaurs which began around 250 million years ago, coelacanths became more diverse. In total, we have found traces of more than 175 fossil species from all over the globe.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years ago, all signs of coelacanths mysteriously vanished from the fossil record. For a long time, scientists assumed the coelacanths were casualties of the massive asteroid impact that also signed the death warrant of the dinosaurs (along with around three-quarters of all life on Earth).</p>

<p>All that changed in 1938, when fisherpeople in South Africa pulled a large, enigmatic fish from the ocean depths that was like nothing they had seen before. A local museum employee with a keen interest in the natural sciences, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Courtenay-Latimer">Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer</a>, immediately knew the fish was special.</p>

<p>Courtenay-Latimer enlisted her friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._B._Smith">J. L. B. Smith</a>, a renowned South African chemist with an interest in ichthyology (the study of fish). Smith identified and named <em>Latimeria</em>, the first living coelacanth known to science.</p>

<p>Discovering this “Lazarus fish” was like stumbling across a live <em>Triceratops</em> dinosaur still roaming the forests of North America today. Even today, coelacanths are often described as “living fossils”.</p>

<h3><strong>A new fossil coelacanth</strong></h3>

<p>Our team from Flinders University, together with other colleagues from Australia, Canada and Europe, discovered a new species of fossil coelacanth on Gooniyandi Country in northern WA. Around 380 million years ago, the site was a tropical reef teeming with more than 50 species of fish.</p>

<p><em>Ngamugawi wirngarri</em>, the new fossil coelacanth, is the first fish found in the area to bear a name given to us from the Gooniyandi language. The name means “ancient fish in honour of Wirngarri”, a respected elder of the community.</p>

<p><em>Ngamugawi</em> is the best three-dimensionally preserved coelacanth from the Devonian Period (359 million to 419 million years ago). This fossil provides a great insight into the early anatomy of this lineage.</p>

<h3><strong>Plate tectonics drive coelacanth evolution</strong></h3>

<p>Our study of the new species led us to analyse the evolutionary history of all known coelacanths. In doing so, we calculated the rates of evolution across their 410 million-year history.</p>

<p>We found that coelacanths have generally evolved slowly, with a few intriguing exceptions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we analysed a series of environmental factors that we considered potential candidates for influencing coelacanth evolutionary rates. These included tectonic plate activity, ocean temperatures, water oxygen levels, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.</p>

<p>Of all the variables we looked at, the one with the greatest influence on the rate of coelacanth evolution was tectonic plate activity. New species of coelacanth were more likely to evolve during periods of heightened tectonic activity, as seismic movement transformed habitats.</p>

<h3><strong>Are coelacanths still evolving?</strong></h3>

<p>Along with our analysis of all fossil coelacanths, we also had a close look at the two living species, <em>Latimeria chalumnae</em> and <em>Latimeria menadoensis</em>.</p>

<p>At first glance, these fish look almost identical to some of their counterparts from hundreds of millions of years ago. However, on closer analysis, we could see they were in fact distinct from their extinct relatives.</p>

<p>While <em>Latimeria</em> has essentially ceased evolving new features, the proportions of its body and the details of its DNA are still changing a little. So perhaps it's not a “living fossil” after all.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As tropical storm Bebinca barrels towards waters off northern Taiwan gathering strength into a possible typhoon, weather forecasters in Taipei are using a new and so far successful method to help track its path - artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>AI-generated forecasts, some powered by software from tech giants including Nvidia, whose chips are made by Taiwan's homegrown semiconductor champion TSMC, have so far outperformed traditional methods in predicting typhoon tracks.</p>

<p>In July, it was AI-based weather models, used for the first time, that helped Taiwan better predict the path and impact of Typhoon Gaemi, the strongest to strike the island in eight years that brought record-breaking rainfall.</p>

<p>The new technology impressed Taiwan forecasters by predicting a direct hit as early as eight days before Gaemi made landfall - handily outperforming conventional methods, which remain the mainstay of prediction planning.</p>

<p>"People are starting to realise AI indeed delivered some stunning performances compared to conventional models," said Chia Hsin-sing, director at the weather service provider Taiwan Integrated Disaster Prevention of Technology Engineering Consulting Company Ltd.</p>

<p>Bebinca is now being tracked using the same AI tools by people including Lin Ping-yu, a forecaster at Taiwan's Central Weather Administration (CWA), who said AI has given them a higher degree of confidence there will not be a direct hit.</p>

<p>"This (AI) is a good thing for us. It is like having one more useful tool to use," said Lin.</p>

<p>The AI weather programmes on offer include Nvidia's FourCastNet, Google's GraphCast and Huawei's Pangu-Weather, as well as a deep learning-based system by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</p>

<p>"It is a hotly watched competition. We will know soon who is winning," said Chia.</p>

<p>Such AI models have also begun to be used to predict storms and hurricanes in other regions with good accuracy, according to forecasters and academics.</p>

<p>The AI-based software is trained using historical weather data to learn the cause and effect relationships of meteorological systems and can predict hundreds of weather variables days in advance - a process that requires only a few minutes to complete.</p>

<p>For all the typhoons in the Western Pacific this year up until mid-September, AI's accuracy in predicting storm tracks over a three-day window was nearly 20% higher than that of conventional models, according to data compiled by the CWA.</p>

<p>Ahead of Gaemi, AI helped the administration foresee an unusual loop in its path that prolonged its impact on Taiwan and prompted them to swiftly issue a rare warning for rainfall of 1.8 metres (5.9 feet), which was later proven accurate, according to CWA's deputy head Lu Kuo-Chen.</p>

<p>"(AI) boosted the confidence for forecasters to make that prediction," Lu said, adding the early warning gave extra time for authorities to carry out preparations.</p>

<p>Lu is also pinning hopes on a partnership with Nvidia, which this year announced a generative AI tool called CorrDiff that aims to forecast more precise locations of typhoon landfall and provide higher resolution images inside a storm.</p>

<p>"We are seeing the potential," Lu said.</p>

<p>For now, however, experts say the AI tools were not able to deliver quality forecasts for more detailed impact of a typhoon, such as its strength and winds, and more time is needed for the new technology to solidify its lead over more traditional ways.</p>

<p>"Was it just good luck?" said Chia, pointing to AI's stellar performance on Gaemi. "We need to give AI a bit more time. It is something to look forward to."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hailey Clifton-Carmack was charged with child molestation, statutory rape, and endangering the welfare of a child, in addition to sexual contact with a student. However, these charges were dropped as part of the plea deal.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A 26-year-old former high school math teacher in Missouri, US, has pleaded guilty to felony sexual contact with a 16-year-old student. Hailey Clifton-Carmack was arrested in January for her relationship with the student, which included having sex in a driveway while other students served as “lookouts,” reported <a href="https://people.com/hailey-clifton-carmack-missouri-teacher-pleads-guilty-felony-sexual-contact-student-8709913 ">People magazine</a>. She is currently under house arrest as she awaits her sentencing on October 11.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the probable cause statement, the boy showed another student photographs of scratches on his back, claiming they were inflicted by Clifton-Carmack during their encounter. Clifton-Carmack faces four years in prison under Missouri's Sex Offender Assessment Program.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Initially, Clifton-Carmack was charged with child molestation, statutory rape and endangering the welfare of a child, in addition to sexual contact with a student. However, these charges were dropped as part of the plea deal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a probable cause statement obtained by People Magazine, a student witness revealed that Clifton-Carmack had openly discussed her personal life with the class, including her troubles with the administration for being “too close with students.” The Laquey School District superintendent confirmed a private discussion with Clifton-Carmack regarding her student interactions.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The student informant also alleged that the victim had claimed to be the reason for Clifton-Carmack's divorce. Court records show that Clifton-Carmack's husband filed for divorce in August 2023, and the couple, who had a child together, were officially divorced the following month.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When Detective Sergeant Bryan Gibbs confronted Hailey Clifton-Carmack in December 8 last year, she willingly handed over her phone, showing no signs of distress despite the serious accusations against her. A search of her phone revealed a damning conversation between Clifton-Carmack and the victim, discussing their illicit relationship.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the criminal complaint, Clifton-Carmack continued to contact the victim until December 23, when she left the state and moved to Texas to live with her family.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Further testimony from a witness, whose name has been withheld, alleged that the victim's father was aware of the abuse but failed to intervene. When confronted about his knowledge, the father reportedly said, “They are going to do it behind my back, so I may as well let it happen,” reported People magazine He also allegedly admitted to allowing the pair to use students as “lookouts” during their trysts at school and claimed he would lie to protect his son if necessary.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The student's father now faces felony charges for child endangerment and his case is currently on hold until the teacher's sentencing on October 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases (NPD), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and depression, have a negative impact on individuals, families, and society. Unfortunately, effective therapies are often lacking.</p>

<p>It's becoming increasingly obvious that genetic mutations in specific genes can raise the likelihood of getting NPD, and hundreds of those "risk genes" have been found to date, but their involvement in NPD remains unknown.</p>

<p>"Very little is known about the basic function of most of these genes, and what we do know often comes from work in cancer cell lines rather than brain cell types," said David Panchision, Chief of the Developmental and Genomic Neuroscience Research Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), who spearheaded the SSPsyGene programme aiming to tackle this challenge.</p>

<p>"As such, we still don't have a clear understanding of how alterations in these genes may work individually or in combination to contribute to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."</p>

<p>To get to the bottom of this, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) initiated a consortium called SSPsyGene (sspsygene.ucsc.edu) in 2023, uniting research teams from renowned US universities with the joint goal of characterising the genetic origins of NPD, focusing on 250 selected high-risk genes.</p>

<p>Among the contributors are Jubao Duan, Endeavor Health (formerly NorthShore University Health System) and University of Chicago, USA and Zhiping Pang, Rutgers University, USA with their teams, who developed a method for mutating NPD risk genes in human stem cells at large scale.</p>

<p>In the modified cells, a selected NPD risk gene is mutated so that it no longer makes a functional protein. The modified stem cells can subsequently be turned into neurons and other brain cells to model the consequences of risk gene mutations in a simplified, lab-based version of the human brain.</p>

<p>In the initial phase of the project, the teams tested 23 NPD risk genes, reported in work published in a recent article in the journal Stem Cell Reports. The resulting stem cell lines will be made available to other researchers worldwide to facilitate research on those risk genes and their contribution to NPD.</p>

<p>In future works, Pang, Duan and the other members of the consortium will join forces to generate mutated stem cell lines for a much larger number of risk genes, with the ultimate goal of understanding the genetic causes of NPD and generating better treatments.</p>

<p>"The hope is that this collaborative work will generate a highly impactful resource for the neuroscience and psychiatric research community," said Panchision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore will put a call to Earth and participate in a press conference aboard the International Space Station in low Earth orbit, the US space agency said.</p>

<p>The space call is scheduled at 2:15 p.m. EDT (local time) on September 13 to the newsroom at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston.</p>

<p>The pair had launched aboard <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-why-helium-leaks-delayed-boeing-starliner-astronauts-return-6509846">Boeing's Starliner</a> spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed flight, arriving at the space station on June 6.</p>

<p>A decision was made to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boeings-starliner-spaceship-returns-to-earth-without-astronauts-6509833">return Starliner to Earth without its crew</a> and the spacecraft successfully returned on September 6 after more than three months in space. It made a safe landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico.</p>

<p>Both astronauts Sunita <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasa-says-there-was-tension-with-boeing-over-astronauts-space-rescue-6493860">Williams and Butch Wilmore</a> called down to flight controllers to thank teams for their support before the uncrewed Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth.</p>

<p>"You guys it's time to bring Calypso home. We have your backs and you have got this. Bring her back to Earth," Sunita Williams said in the radio message referring to the spacecrafts nickname.</p>

<p>Both the astronauts will remain on the international space station as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew and return home in February 2025 aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members on NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 mission.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, crew of the Polaris Dawn the Elon Musk-led private charted spaceflight created history when they completed the first commercial spacewalk.</p>

<p>Donning newly-designed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits, the crew began their approximately two-hour operation at 3:12 a.m. EDT while traveling at 17,500 miles per hour in an elliptical orbit of 190 x 700 km above the EarthThe spacewalk represents an important milestone of the Polaris Program, a developmental program designed to further the advancement of human spaceflight.</p>

<p>After opening the hatch, the Polaris Dawn crew became the first four astronauts to be exposed to the vacuum of space at the same time, the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Over approximately twenty minutes, Commander Jared Isaacman and Mission Specialist Sarah Gillis egressed the vehicle, completed a series of tests designed to evaluate the suit's mobility, thermal systems and the Dragon mobility aid "Skywalker" before returning to the cabin and closing the hatch.</p>

<p>Mission Pilot Scott "Kidd" Poteet and Mission Specialist and Medical Officer Anna Menon supported Isaacman and Gillis throughout the entire operation monitoring vital support systems.</p>

<p>Once the hatch was closed, Dragon was re-pressurized, cabin oxygen and pressure levels confirmed.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his experience, mission commander and billionaire Isaacman, who financed the mission reflected on the experience: "SpaceX, back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world."</p>

<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson relayed good wishes to SpaceX and the Polaris Dawn crew in a statement on X. "Congratulations @PolarisProgram and @SpaceX on the first commercial spacewalk in history!" Nelson wrote.</p>

<p>"Today's success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry and @NASA's long-term goal to build a vibrant U.S. space economy."</p>

<p>The Polaris Dawn mission targeted splashdown off the coast of Florida, however SpaceX has not yet released details about the upcoming landing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A preview version of the model will be available through OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, to paid Plus and Team users on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is releasing a new artificial intelligence model known internally as "Strawberry" that can perform some human-like reasoning tasks, as it looks to stay at the top of a crowded market of rivals.<br />
The new model, called o1, is designed to spend more time computing the answer before responding to user queries, the company said in a blog post Thursday. With the model, OpenAI's tools should be able to solve multi-step problems, including complicated math and coding questions.</p>

<p>"As an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images," the company said. "But for complex reasoning tasks this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Given this, we are resetting the counter back to 1 and naming this series OpenAI o1."</p>

<p>A preview version of the model will be available through OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, to paid Plus and Team users on Thursday. Bloomberg previously reported the company could release the new model as soon as this week.</p>

<p>The model's release comes as San Francisco-based OpenAI is looking to raise billions in funding and faces heightened competition in the race to develop ever more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. OpenAI isn't the only company working on such capabilities; competitors Anthropic and Google have also touted "reasoning" skills with their advanced AI models.</p>

<p>In its blog post, OpenAI gave examples of the AI model's responses to questions on topics including coding, English, and math, and asked it to solve a simple crossword puzzle. In a series of posts on X, Noam Brown, a research scientist at OpenAI, said the company is releasing the model in preview now in part to get a sense for how people use it, and where it needs to be improved.</p>

<p>The experience of using OpenAI's updated AI system will differ somewhat from what people have come to expect with ChatGPT, the company's chatbot. Before responding to a user's prompt, the new software will pause for a matter of seconds while, behind the scenes and invisible to the user, it considers a number of related prompts and then summarizes what appears to be the best response. This technique is sometimes referred to as "chain of thought" prompting.</p>

<p>OpenAI has been working to get computers to carry out multi-step actions for some time. In May 2023, for instance, the company released a blog post and an accompanying research paper about its efforts to improve AI systems' abilities to solve math problems. According to the paper, the company trained a model by rewarding it for each correct step in the process toward coming up with an answer to a problem, rather than by just rewarding it for generating an accurate answer.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Scott Stein had always admired the Japanese flag that hung in his grandfather's den on Long Island, New York. Passed down after Bernard Stein's death, the flag was a remnant of World War II, brought home as a war trophy by his grandfather, who served in the US Army's 38th Infantry Division. It wasn't until years later that Scott realised its significance, and made the decision to return it to its rightful place.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I knew it was important to him, but he never spoke of his experiences,” Stein, 55, told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/09/12/japanese-good-luck-flag-wwii/ ">Washington Post</a>, reflecting on the silence that often surrounded his grandfather's combat stories. “We never knew where he got the flag, but we knew it had to have come from some heavy fighting.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The flag, known as a Yosegaki Hinomaru, or “good luck flag,” bore the name of its original owner, Japanese soldier Yukikazu Hiyama, along with messages of well-wishes from his family and friends. Each Japanese soldier carried such a flag into battle, tucked under their uniforms, as a personal memento.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">After inheriting the flag, Scott Stein displayed it in his own home for years until he began to feel it wasn't appropriate as decor. “I started to realise a while back that maybe it wasn't the best home decor,” he said. Determined to return it to its origins, he learned about the OBON Society, a non-profit dedicated to reuniting families with these personal artefacts of war.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Scott Stein mailed the flag to the OBON Society, which, after years of research, tracked down Hiyama's only surviving child, Tsukasa Hiyama, an 81-year-old man living on the Japanese island of Honshu. Tsukasa never knew his father, who was killed in action in 1945, two years after leaving to serve in the Imperial Army.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For Tsukasa, the return of the flag was a profound moment. “When I held the flag in my hands, it felt as if I could sense my father's warmth for the first time,” he said. He took the flag to his mother's tombstone and unfurled it, bringing a sense of closure to a family that had long wondered about the fate of their loved one.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The OBON Society, founded by Keiko and Rex Ziak, has returned more than 600 such flags to families of fallen soldiers. Keiko Ziak noted that these flags were often the last tangible connection families had to their loved ones, calling them “like a love letter to each soldier.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">For Scott Stein, the act of returning the flag felt like fulfilling a larger purpose. “It feels like good karma to give it back,” he said. “I hope it raises awareness that these flags are still out there, hanging on other walls.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump marked the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks with commemorative stops in New York City and Pennsylvania on Wednesday. However, his tributes were overshadowed by the presence of far-right figure Laura Loomer, who has a history of promoting conspiracy theories about the 2001 attacks and posting anti-Muslim content on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loomer, who was banned from Twitter (now X) for her inflammatory posts before being reinstated by Elon Musk, has previously suggested that the 9/11 attacks were an “inside job.”</p>

<p>When asked why Loomer was part of Trump's entourage, a campaign official sidestepped the question, and told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/laura-loomer-donald-trump-influence/index.html ">CNN</a> that the day was about “the souls no longer with us, their families, and the heroes who courageously stepped up to save their fellow Americans on that fateful day.”</p>

<p>In a phone interview, Loomer defended her presence at the memorial. “I don't understand the issue with me going to a 9/11 memorial,” she told CNN. “People who greeted President Trump were happy to see me and thanked me for coming.” She added that she has never denied the role of Islamic terrorists in the attacks, doubling down on her history of vocalising concerns about “Islamic terrorism in America.”</p>

<p>Laura Loomer's presence around Donald Trump has grown increasingly prominent, with reports indicating she has access to his personal phone number and regularly attends his events.</p>

<p>The controversial figure was also spotted deboarding Trump's private plane in Philadelphia before his debate against Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Later that night, Trump referenced a baseless rumour about Haitian migrants, which Loomer had also promoted online.</p>

<p>Some of her other provocative social media posts have even preceded Trump's own public statements, suggesting a possible influence on his rhetoric.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This association is consistent with Trump's history of embracing conspiracy theorists, dating back to his promotion of the “birther” conspiracy about former President Barack Obama's birthplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loomer's potential sway over Trump was also recently seen when Trump questioned Kamala Harris' heritage during an interview, with some sources attributing the talking points to Loomer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In defence, Loomer told CNN, “I don't think it's racist to mock the fact that Kamala Harris panders to every single group of people who she encounters in an effort to try to convince them that she shares their same identity,” but she did not confirm if she influenced Trump's remarks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry was once one of the British royal family's most popular members, but as he celebrates his 40th birthday this weekend he is increasingly distanced from the UK public and his own family.</p>

<p>The younger son of King Charles III, now living in California with his American television actress wife Meghan and their two young children, reaches the landmark on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Archie, aged five, and three-year-old Princess Lilibet live in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, near Santa Barbara, on the US West Coast.</p>

<p>But Harry is not only separated by geography.</p>

<p>"He is completely isolated. I don't see him coming back even with a minor role... there's no sign of an official role for him," Pauline Maclaran, from Royal Holloway University of London, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They (the public) don't trust him," added royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams.</p>

<h3><strong>Fraught ties with royals&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Harry's ties with the royal family have been increasingly fraught since the couple quit royal life and moved to North America in early 2020.</p>

<p>First came an explosive television interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which the couple claimed that senior royals speculated about the colour of their unborn son's skin.</p>

<p>Meghan is of mixed heritage.</p>

<p>Suggestions of racism prompted Harry's brother William, heir to the throne, to declare when asked that the royals were "very much not a racist family".</p>

<p>The brothers' grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, also politely questioned Harry and Meghan's version of events.</p>

<p>"Recollections may vary," she said in a statement, promising to look into the matter.</p>

<p>A potentially decisive rupture came early last year with the publication of Harry's uncompromising and unfiltered autobiography "Spare".</p>

<p>The book, which is set to be released in paperback in October, was seen as an all-out attack against the centuries-old institution of the royal family, which still plays a central role in British life.</p>

<p>It includes lengthy passages on Harry's strained relationship with his "beloved brother" William, 42, whom he also describes as his "arch-nemesis", and their father.</p>

<p>Experts told AFP they did not see any reconciliation on the horizon.</p>

<p>"His differences from other members of the royal family probably would have been settled by now if any agreement had ever been possible," said Mark Garnett, from the University of Lancaster in northwest England.</p>

<p>"The idea of a divided royal family only increases unwelcome media attention."</p>

<p>Harry told American TV network ABC in February that he was "sure" his father's cancer diagnosis could reunite the family, days after a brief visit to the king.</p>

<p>However, on another visit by the prince to London in May, father and son were at separate events nearby but did not meet.</p>

<p>Harry, who has railed against media intrusion, even reportedly declined an invitation to stay at Buckingham Palace during his visit and instead stayed at a London hotel.</p>

<p>"He is naive about the damage he has caused", said Maclaran.</p>

<h3><strong>'Locked horns'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Relations between William and Harry, whose once-close bond was forged with the death of their mother Princess Diana in 1997, remain publicly frosty.</p>

<p>They were seen together at the late queen's funeral in September 2022 but have pointedly kept their distance at subsequent events, including at their father's coronation in May last year.</p>

<p>Royal author Robert Jobson likened the pair, who are reportedly not on speaking terms, to stags "who have locked horns".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I can't really see a reconciliation in the near future," he told reporters in London this week.</p>

<p>While Harry and Meghan have more supporters in the United States, the British public has also apparently taken sides in the family feud.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan languish at the bottom of royal popularity surveys, alongside his disgraced uncle Prince Andrew, whose links to the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made him persona non grata.</p>

<p>In contrast, William and his wife Catherine, who is recovering from cancer, are hugely popular.</p>

<p>Former British Army captain Harry, meanwhile, is keeping busy with several projects, chief among them the preparation and promotion of the Invictus Games he founded for military veterans with disabilities.</p>

<p>He and Meghan also recently completed a mini-tour in Colombia and Nigeria promoting mental health, equality and inclusion.</p>

<p>If royal tours are a "vehicle for (British) diplomacy", the Sussexes' visits are a way of refining their "branding", said Maclaran, who has written about the royals and consumer culture.</p>

<p>The tours are a way to "stay relevant", she added. It is only "the (royal) titles that make them different from other celebrities", she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sudan's priceless archaeological heritage is being stripped from museums, with looters loading statuettes and fragments of ancient palaces onto lorries, smuggling them out of the war-torn country, and selling them online.</p>

<p>More than a year of war between rival generals has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions more to flee their homes, and left the country's prized antiquities at the mercy of pillagers.</p>

<p>On Thursday, UNESCO, the United Nations's cultural body, said the "threat to culture appears to have reached an unprecedented level, with reports of looting of museums, heritage and archaeological sites and private collections".</p>

<p>In the capital Khartoum, where fighting broke out in April 2023 between the army and paramilitary forces, the recently renovated Sudan National Museum has had prized artefacts stolen, archaeologists and officials say.</p>

<p>The museum houses prehistoric artefacts from the Palaeolithic era and items from the famed site of Kerma in northern Sudan, as well as Pharaonic and Nubian pieces.</p>

<p>First opened in 1971, the museum was founded in part to house objects rescued from an area due to be flooded by the construction of Egypt's massive Aswan dam.</p>

<p>Now, its artefacts are under threat from war.</p>

<p>"The Sudan National Museum has been the subject of major looting," said Ikhlas Abdel Latif, head of museums at the national antiquities authority.</p>

<p>"Archaeological objects stored there have been taken in big lorries and transferred to the west and to border areas, particularly near South Sudan," she told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>'Refrain' from trade&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The extent of the looting is hard to determine because the museum is located in an area controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p>

<p>Officials and experts have accused the RSF of looting the site. Contacted by AFP, a spokesman for the force did not comment.</p>

<p>In May, the RSF said it was being "vigilant" in "protecting and preserving the antiquities of the Sudanese people".</p>

<p>Throughout history, fighters have used plunder to fund their war efforts.</p>

<p>UNESCO said it was calling on "the public and the art market... in the region and worldwide to refrain" from trading in Sudanese items.</p>

<p>The agency also said it was planning training in the Egyptian capital Cairo for law enforcement and the judiciary from Sudan's neighbours.</p>

<p>"Because of the war, the museum and the artefacts are not being monitored," said Hassan Hussein, a researcher and former director of the National Antiquities Authority.</p>

<p>The army, led by Sudan's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is locked in conflict with the RSF, which is led by his former deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.</p>

<h3><strong>For sale&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Island of Meroe, a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Kush and dozens of its pyramids, is also under threat.</p>

<p>Artefacts and exhibition accessories have been stolen from the museum in Nyala, the South Darfur state capital, said Abdel Latif.</p>

<p>In Omdurman, just across the River Nile from Khartoum, part of the Khalifa House museum was also destroyed, she said.</p>

<p>Last week, the Association of Friends of Sudanese Museums condemned "in the strongest terms" the looting that is taking place across the country.</p>

<p>Experts voiced alarm after finding looted artefacts offered for sale online.</p>

<p>On the auction site eBay, a user offered items presented as Egyptian antiquities that, according to Sudanese media, were looted from Sudan.</p>

<p>AFP saw the listings, with items offered for a few hundred dollars, but was not able to independently verify the authenticity or origin of the items.</p>

<p>A Sudanese archaeologist, speaking anonymously for security reasons, told AFP that pottery, gold objects and paintings listed for sale appeared to have come from the National Museum in Khartoum -- although at least one statuette was an imitation.</p>

<p>He said he feared for the larger statues, which "must be handled by specialists in a precise manner" and could be damaged if looters were to lay hands on them.</p>

<p>The issue is set to be discussed at an upcoming conference in Germany, which Hussein will attend.</p>

<p>"The current state of the collections is a concern for anyone who cares about humanity's heritage," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA['Sohu' claims to be 20 times faster in running transformers like ChatGPT than Nvidia's flagship- H100s, betting on transformer ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) chipset.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The reason why you are able to ask ChatGPT "how to eat a mango without spilling it" and much more is Nvidia's H100 and B200 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These magical chipsets that power AI chatbots have propelled Nvidia to become the frontrunners of the AI hardware industry, with market capitalization reaching the 3 trillion-dollar mark-more than Microsoft and Apple last month.</p>

<p>But now, a relatively young startup founded by two Havard dropouts have set their eyes on their share of the AI hardware pie. Etched, the California based startup, is looking to disrupt the AI chipset market with their transformer ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) chip called Sohu.</p>

<p>Sohu claims to be 20 times faster in running transformers like ChatGPT than Nvidia's flagship- H100. The B200, which is the more powerful Nvidia offering than H100, is reportedly 10 times slower then Sohu, according to the claims made by the company based on emulation tests.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Source: X/@Etched</p>
</div>

<p>Sohu is taking an entirely different approach to providing high computational power to run billions of parameters (Variables that are used in training an AI Model) for transformer models. Unlike GPUs that can do multiple computationally heavy tasks (like rendering graphics in real time), Etched is choosing to create a specialised chip that caters to only transformer AI models - ones that run ChatGPT, Sora (OpenAI's text to video AI model) and Google's Gemini.</p>

<p>What this means is it cannot run other AI models like Convolutional Neural Networks (used for image recognition). This opens up the possibility of exploring new AI products by developers that were till now not possible due to limited power on GPUs.</p>

<p>For example, Sohu can potentially lead to a real-time translator that can hear and read Hindi, Gujarati or Tamil and respond back in French, English and German. Of course, such multimodal and multilingual translation needs more than just the computational power, but in theory, it opens up the possibility.</p>

<p>Another multimodal application of transformers that the chipset might tap into is integrating visual and language areas. This essentially means that such a model will understand both text and images simultaneously, throwing open the possibility of visual questions and answers- like an interview.</p>

<p>But all of this remains a theory. Etched has raised 120 million USD on 25 June to make it a reality, with a real timeline as to an actual release of the Sohu ASIC remaining elusive.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Etched has claimed it already has "tens of million dollars" worth of hardware reserved in preorders. The company has also secured a deal with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) to fabricate the 4-nanometer chip, promising the deal is going to help "ramp up our first year of production."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 20-year-old who tried to assassinate former US President Donald Trump at his campaign rally in Pennsylvania made a series of stops to stock up on ammo before the attack, the CNN reported.</p>

<p>Thomas Matthew Crooks also practised firing at a shooting range on Friday, a day before the Trump rally. The next morning, Crooks went to the Home Depot to buy a five-foot ladder. He then bought 50 rounds of ammunition from a gun store, the report said.</p>

<p>Sources say he used the same ladder to climb the building from where he opened fire at the 78-year-old Republican nominee.</p>

<p>Crooks was gunned down by the Secret Service agents after he attacked Trump. Investigators are trying to piece together a timeline of his actions leading up to the failed assassination bid. The motive remains unknown.</p>

<p>Even after breaking into his phone and searching his computer, officials still haven't found evidence that would suggest political or ideological impetus for the shooting, law enforcement sources told CNN.</p>

<p>Trump survived with a nicked ear during his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday after Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at him. The attack left him with a bloodied face as the former president said the bullet pierced his "upper part of right ear".</p>

<p>The early details that have emerged about Thomas Matthew Crooks show that he was a math whiz, working an entry-level job near his hometown in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He graduated high school in 2022 with a reputation as a bright but "quiet" classmate.</p>

<p>His counselor at Bethel Park High School described him as "respectful" and said he never knew him to be political.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With investigators still searching for clues about what may have led <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/thomas-matthew-crooks-donald-trump-rally-shooter-wanted-to-join-schools-shooting-club-he-was-rejected-6108539" target="_blank">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> to attack Donald Trump, new details that have emerged in the case show that the 20-year-old was spotted by three police snipers minutes before he opened fire at the former US president.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The 78-year-old Republican presidential candidate was injured in an assassination attempt at his campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/first-photo-of-thomas-matthew-crooks-20-year-old-loner-who-shot-at-trump-6107465" target="_blank">Crooks</a>, a resident of nearby Bethel Park, had climbed on a rooftop with a rifle in hand to attack Trump. He, however, was killed by a US Secret Service sniper minutes after he opened fire, which killed a bystander and injured two spectators.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting US political leaders, has since then faced backlash over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was allowed to take position on a roof some 500 feet from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/shooter-who-fired-at-trump-had-explosives-in-his-car-report-6105229" target="_blank">Trump</a>, who is pitted against US President Joe Biden in the November 5 elections.</p>

<p>Mobile footage has emerged of people sighting the gunman on the roof and trying to warn security before he opened fire.</p>

<p>According to CBS News, there were three snipers stationed inside the building the shooter used during Saturday's shooting. The operations plan had them stationed inside the building looking out windows toward the Trump rally.</p>

<p>One of the snipers inside saw Crooks outside and looking up at the roof, observing the building and disappearing, a local law enforcement officer told CBS News. The 20-year-old then came back, sat down, and looked at his phone. At that point, one of the snipers took a picture of him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crooks took out a rangefinder and the Secret Service sniper radioed to the command post, CBS News reported. He then disappeared again and came back a third time with a backpack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Secret Service snipers called in with information that he had a backpack and said he was walking toward the back of the building. Officers believe that the shooter might have used an air conditioning unit to get on top of the roof.</p>

<p>By the time other officers came for backup, he had climbed on top of the building and was positioned above and behind the snipers inside the building, CBS News reported citing an officer.</p>

<p>Two other officers who heard the sniper's call tried to get onto the roof. State police started rushing to the scene, but by that time, a Secret Service sniper had already killed Crooks, the officer said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The body of a spade-toothed whale -- a species so rare it has never been seen alive -- appears to have washed up on a New Zealand beach, scientists say.</p>

<p>The remains of the obscure, five-metre (16.4 foot) long, beaked creature were found near a river mouth in southern Otago province on July 4, government researchers said.</p>

<p>It was identified by marine-mammal experts from New Zealand's Department of Conservation and the national museum, Te Papa, as a male spade-toothed whale.</p>

<p>A DNA investigation has been launched to confirm its classification, the scientists said.</p>

<p>"Spade-toothed whales are one of the most poorly known large mammalian species of modern times," said the conservation department's coastal Otago operations manager, Gabe Davies.</p>

<p>"Since the 1800s, only six samples have ever been documented worldwide, and all but one of these was from New Zealand," Davies said in a statement Monday.</p>

<p>"From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge."</p>

<p>The find was fresh enough to offer the first opportunity for a spade-toothed whale to be dissected, the conservation department said.</p>

<p>The species is "so rare next to nothing is known about them", it said.</p>

<p><strong>'International importance'</strong></p>

<p>The body of the whale has been placed in cold storage and genetic samples have been sent to the University of Auckland as curators of the New Zealand Cetacean Tissue Archive.</p>

<p>It may take several weeks or months for the DNA to be processed and a final identification confirmed.</p>

<p>"The rarity of the whale means conversations around what to do next will take more time because it is a conversation of international importance," the conservation department said.</p>

<p>The species was first described in 1874 from just a lower jaw and two teeth collected from the Chatham Islands off the east coast of New Zealand.</p>

<p>That sample, along with skeletal remains of two other specimens found in New Zealand and Chile, enabled scientists to confirm a new species.</p>

<p>But because so few specimens have been found and there have been no live sightings, little is known about the spade-toothed whale and it is classified as "data deficient" under New Zealand's Threat Classification System.</p>

<p>The first intact specimen was from a mother and calf stranding in Bay of Plenty in 2010, the New Zealand conservation department said.</p>

<p>A further stranding in 2017 in Gisborne added one more specimen to the collection.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's well known that as far as the climate crisis goes, time is of the essence.</p>

<p>Now a study out Monday shows that the melting of the polar ice caps is causing our planet to spin more slowly, increasing the length of days at an "unprecedented" rate.</p>

<p>The paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that water flowing from Greenland and Antarctica is resulting in more mass around the equator, co-author Surendra Adhikari of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's like when a figure skater does a pirouette, first holding her arms close to her body and then stretching them out," added co-author Benedikt Soja of ETH Zurich.</p>

<p>"The initially fast rotation becomes slower because the masses move away from the axis of rotation, increasing physical inertia."</p>

<p>Earth is commonly thought of as a sphere, but it's more accurate to call it an "oblate spheroid" that bulges somewhat around the equator, a bit like a satsuma.</p>

<p>What's more, its shape is constantly changing, from the impacts of the daily tides that affect the oceans and crusts to longer-term effects from the drift of tectonic plates, and abrupt, violent shifts caused by earthquakes and volcanoes.</p>

<p>The paper relied on observational techniques like Very Long Baseline Interferometry, where scientists can measure the difference in how long it takes for radio signals from space to reach different points on Earth, and use that to infer variations in the planet's orientation and length of day.</p>

<p>It also used the Global Positioning System, which measures Earth's rotation very precisely, to about one-hundredth of a millisecond, and even looked at ancient eclipse records going back millennia.</p>

<h3><strong>Implications for space travel&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>If the Earth turns more slowly, then the length of the day increases by a few milliseconds from the standard measure of 86,400 seconds.</p>

<p>A currently more significant cause of slowdown is the gravitational pull of the Moon, which pulls on the oceans in a process called "tidal friction" that has caused a gradual deceleration of 2.40 milliseconds per century over millions of years.</p>

<p>But the new study comes to a surprising conclusion that, if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases at a high rate, the effect of a warming climate will be greater than that of the Moon's pull by the end of the 21st century, said Adhikari.</p>

<p>Between the year 1900 and today, climate has caused days to become around 0.8 milliseconds longer -- and under the worst-case scenario of high emissions, climate alone would be responsible for making days 2.2 milliseconds longer by the year 2100, compared to the same baseline.</p>

<p>That might not sound like a great deal, and certainly not something that humans are able to perceive.</p>

<p>But "there are definitely a lot of implications for space and Earth navigation," said Adhikari.</p>

<p>Knowing the exact orientation of Earth at any given moment is crucial when attempting to communicate with a spaceship, such as the Voyager probes that are now well beyond our solar system, where even a slight deviation of a centimetre can end up being kilometres off by the time it reaches its destination.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US President Donald Trump on Monday announced US Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate for the November Presidential polls.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump on Monday announced US Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate for the November Presidential polls. The announcement came ahead of the former president's surprise appearance at the Republican National Convention, just two days after he survived an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, will join Trump on the ticket to challenge President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election.</p>

<p><strong>Who is JD Vance?</strong><br />
<br />
1. JD Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother struggling with addiction. His father left the family when Vance was a toddler. He grew up with his grandparents; his grandmother “Mamaw” was a “blue dog” Democrat and a devout Christian who owned 19 handguns.<br />
<br />
2. Vance served in the US Marine Corps after high school, including a tour in the Iraq War. He then pursued higher education, graduating from The Ohio State University and Yale Law School. Until 2017, he worked at a venture capital firm.<br />
<br />
3. Before entering politics, Vance gained national attention with his memoir <em>Hillbilly Elegy,</em> which was later adapted into a Netflix movie.<br />
<br />
4. JD Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Chilukuri Vance. They met at Yale Law School and got married in Kentucky in 2014. In addition to a traditional ceremony, they had a separate Hindu ceremony conducted by a Hindu priest. They have three children.<br />
<br />
5. Vance was once a vocal critic of Donald Trump, calling him an “idiot” and “reprehensible” and comparing him to Hitler in earlier interviews in 2016. However, he has now transformed into one of Trump's steadfast allies, rarely missing an opportunity to defend him. Although his name was long mentioned as a potential political candidate, Vance seized the chance to run for Ohio's Senate seat in 2022 after Republican Senator Rob Portman decided not to seek re-election. His campaign struggled initially but gained momentum after receiving a $10 million donation from his former boss, Peter Thiel. Despite being in a predominantly Republican state, Vance's past criticism of Donald Trump posed a hurdle to his election. He managed to mend things with the former President for his previous remarks and secure Trump's endorsement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Loneliness affects everyone at different times. Although it is well-documented that men are less likely than women to talk about feelings and to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560805/">seek help</a>, our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-18770-w">research</a> found men's work arrangements can be a significant contributor.</p>

<p>We found loneliness was highest among men in their late 40s but it also occurred at other times, often shaped by how they perceived their careers and income.</p>

<p>This suggests the workplace and societal expectations around work are important in men's experiences of loneliness.</p>

<h2>Measuring loneliness</h2>

<p>Our findings are based on an analysis of yearly data from 12,117 Australian men, aged 15 to 98, collected for over 19 years for the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) <a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda">Survey</a>.</p>

<p>We measured loneliness by examining men's responses to a question asking whether they agreed with the statement: “I often feel very lonely”. The responses range from one (completely disagree) to seven (completely agree).</p>

<p>We then used statistical techniques to ensure we were measuring loneliness and not similar constructs, such as social isolation.</p>

<p>We also used methods that examined how much of men's loneliness was uniquely due to their social relationships (for example, their romantic relationships or friendships), versus other aspects of their lives, such as their living situation or their working arrangements.</p>

<h2>The role of work</h2>

<p>Given loneliness is a social problem, we were not surprised to find problems in men's social relationships, particularly their romantic relationships, friendships and family relationships were linked with loneliness. However, we were surprised to see work also played a significant role.</p>

<p>Men who were unemployed or in insecure jobs experienced more loneliness than those with stable employment. Job loss can impact a person's identity and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621006717">limits the social connections work typically provides</a>. Unemployment also limits income, making it harder to afford social activities. Insecure “gig” work, with its often unpredictable and long hours spent alone, <a href="https://theconversation.com/working-in-isolation-can-pose-mental-health-challenges-heres-what-anyone-can-learn-from-how-gig-workers-have-adapted-194712">disrupts work-life balance and can isolate people</a>.</p>

<p>Our research suggests societal expectations also worsen loneliness for some men. We measured the degree to which men agreed with the statement: “It is not good for a relationship if the woman earns more than the man”.</p>

<p>Men, particularly middle-aged men, who believed they should be the main breadwinners in a household were lonelier than those without this belief.</p>

<p>This suggests traditional views around work in the context of heteronormative relationships can be damaging to social connection.</p>

<p>This once mainstream view not only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211126/">harms relationships</a> but is also unrealistic when surviving on a single income is increasingly difficult for many households.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Men who believed men, not women, should be the main breadwinner were more lonely.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-white-coat-protective-goggles-face-1708180012">Marion Weyo/Shutterstock</a></span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Improving men's personal relationships is only one way to reduce male loneliness. The work sector and social pressures around work should also adapt.</p>

<h2>Shifting social norms</h2>

<p>Public stereotypes that make men feel solely responsible for household income need to shift. Public awareness and education campaigns <a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/pdf/S2405-8440(21)00763-5.pdf">can help shift gender norms and stereotypes</a> by building knowledge and awareness, and may therefore reduce loneliness.</p>

<p>Helping men attain better work-life balance <a href="https://theconversation.com/helping-men-get-work-life-balance-can-help-everyone-43000">can help everyone</a>. Such change, however, requires major cultural shifts which take time. A shorter term solution, particularly for men at retirement age, is volunteering.</p>

<p>Volunteering provides purpose and opportunities to socialise, although <a href="https://csrm.cass.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/docs/2023/10/Ongoing_trends_in_volunteering_in_Australia.pdf">recent evidence</a> suggests volunteering has not returned to pre-COVID levels.</p>

<h2>How governments can help</h2>

<p>Increasing casualisation of the workplace and the growth of the gig economy offer flexibility but also decrease job security. Our research shows job insecurity or unemployment rates contribute to male loneliness.</p>

<p>Government amendments to the Fair Work Act should help reduce job insecurity by allowing the Fair Work Commission to set fair minimum standards, including access to dispute resolution for “employee-like” workers, such as Uber drivers, who work through a digital platform.</p>

<p>Governments can also support activities of interest to men by ensuring regular funding for programs like <a href="https://mensshed.org/">Men's Sheds</a> or opportunities to <a href="https://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/wp-content/uploads/Volunteering-Australia-%E2%80%93-Navigating-change-and-charting-a-new-course-volunteering-in-recent-times.pdf">work with animals</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092430/">Social prescribing</a> – where a GP or other health worker links patients with resources and activities to improve health and reduce loneliness – can also involve men in roles which best fit their needs and interests.</p>

<h2>How employers can help</h2>

<p>Thankfully, workplaces can do a lot to reduce loneliness. A recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681323000010">review</a> suggests employers can:</p>

<p>1) Create opportunities for social connection, for example, dedicating time for non-work activities such as designing communal areas in offices to support connection.</p>

<p>2) Support flexible and remote, potentially isolated workers by fostering workplace connections using virtual spaces such as online dinners, while still encouraging work-life balance.</p>

<p>3) Foster a people focused culture by building employee autonomy, tolerating mistakes and providing mentoring opportunities.</p>

<p>The relationship between managers and workers is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/73/9/557/7591258">especially important</a> for well-being, because managers can shape working conditions, model positive behaviour and improve staff knowledge, but few interventions target this area.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance branded China the biggest threat to America in one of his first interviews since being named Donald Trump's running mate, underscoring the likely hawkish stance of their administration toward Beijing if elected.</p>

<p>The Ohio Senator made the remarks in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday local time. When asked about the war in Ukraine, Vance said Trump would negotiate with Moscow and Kyiv to "bring this thing to a rapid close so America can focus on the real issue, which is China."</p>

<p>Senator JD Vance, a Republican from Ohio and Republican vice-presidential nominee, during the Republican National Convention (RNC) at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US, on Monday, July 15, 2024. The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee will go on as scheduled, despite an assassination attempt against former</p>

<p>"That's the biggest threat to our country and we are completely distracted from it," he said, shortly after joining the Republican presidential ticket.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden and his challenger Trump are jockeying to be seen as tough on China as they head toward an election rematch in November. Trump has promised to hike tariffs on China across the board if reelected, vowing a 60% tax on all Chinese imports. Biden has already announced a new 100% levy on electric cars from the world's No. 2 economy.</p>

<p>US spies believe that China has no clear preference between the two candidates, Bloomberg News previously reported.</p>

<p>Vance, 39, was tapped by Trump days after a failed assassination attempt on the former president upended what had already been a chaotic presidential contest.</p>

<p>It's not the first time Vance has criticized China. The venture capitalist-turned-senator previously called for "broad-based tariffs" on Chinese goods and advocated for bringing American manufacturing back home to reduce dependency on Beijing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Misinformation and conspiracy theories were spreading online after an assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on Saturday.</p>

<p>Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was alleged to have shot at the Republican presidential candidate from a rooftop during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding Trump's right ear. One spectator died and two others were injured.</p>

<p>Reuters has fact-checked some of the most widely shared narratives online.</p>

<p><strong>Misidentified shooters</strong></p>

<p>Within hours of the shooting, an image surfaced online of a man dressed in a black sweatshirt, hat and black sunglasses. Social media posts said the man was "Antifa extremist" Mark Violets and that he was named by local police as the suspect in the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>However, the man in the photograph is Marco Violi, who had nothing to do with the shooting. Violi is an Italian sports writer who shares content on the Italian soccer team AC Roma.</p>

<p>In a statement emailed to Reuters and shared on his social media, Violi said he was in Rome and had awoken at 2 a.m. to numerous messages, adding that he "categorically denied any involvement in the situation."</p>

<p>Violi was not the only individual to have been misidentified in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.</p>

<p>Viral posts also misidentified another man, Maxwell Yearick, as the shooter. In 2016, various media outlets reported that Yearick, who does not resemble Crooks, was arrested outside a Pittsburgh Trump rally after an altercation with police.</p>

<p><strong>Altered Images, False Claims Shooting Was Staged&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Doctored images of Trump and Secret Service agents smiling on stage surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The fake images were shared to support claims that the assassination attempt had been "staged" as a ploy to boost Trump's popularity in November's election.</p>

<p>The original photographs were captured by an Associated Press photographer and show Trump and the agents with serious facial expressions.</p>

<p>The FBI on Sunday said Crooks acted alone and the agency had yet to identify a motive.</p>

<p><strong>Predictive Programming Conspiracy Theories</strong></p>

<p>Predictive programming is a conspiracy theory, often revived in the aftermath of a major news event, that suggests governments and powerful groups provide indications of planned events to the public by embedding predictions in books, TV shows and movies.</p>

<p>Within an hour of the attempted assassination, a fabricated screenshot resurfaced of a cartoon of Trump in a casket and was described as a scene from the TV series "The Simpsons."</p>

<p>But this image has made the rounds on social media since at least 2017.</p>

<p>Matt Selman, an executive producer for the show, told Reuters in an email that the screenshot never appeared on the show, adding that it is "all too easy to create fake Simpsons 'predictions' like these for the purpose of misleading people."</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman has acknowledged that he heavily relied on advice from his friend, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, to grow OpenAI after ChatGPT became a global sensation. In a joint interview with Mr Chesky at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the OpenAI CEO mentioned that while many people offered help once ChatGPT gained popularity in late 2022, Mr Chesky was the only one who truly pitched in, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/sam-altman-airbnb-ceo-gave-me-hours-of-advice-on-growing-openai.html"><em>CNBC Make It </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>"Everything just went crazy for me," Mr Altman said. "Brian would sit down with me for about three hours every other week and provide a list of things I needed to do. He'd point out where I was behind, what I was messing up, and what I needed to proactively consider."</p>

<p>Five days after ChatGPT launched to the public, it surpassed 1 million users. By January 2023, the platform had 100 million monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according to CNBC Make It. As the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company experienced rapid growth, Chesky became a close confidant, Altman noted. Mr Chesky was "almost always right," Altman added, saying, "I learned to just always shut up and follow the advice."</p>

<p>Elaborating on the impact of Mr Chesky's advice on OpenAI's business, Altman mentioned that his friend guided him on hiring decisions and how to "map" out the company's strategy.</p>

<p>Recently, Mr Chesky pointed out that Mr Altman was "probably not thinking enough about" the political consequences of the company's generative AI technology, the OpenAI CEO said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk said he plans to commit roughly $45 million each month to a new fund backing Donald Trump for US president, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</p>

<p>Musk's donations will go to a political group dubbed America PAC, which will focus on promoting voter registration, early voting and mail-in ballots among residents in swing states ahead of the November general election, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Musk is one of several major backers of the new fund, with others reportedly including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, former US ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft and cryptocurrency investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.</p>

<p>The Tesla founder formally endorsed Trump's candidacy for US president on Saturday after the former president survived a shooting at a political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk wrote on the social media platform X, which he acquired in 2022.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery <a href="https://t.co/ZdxkF63EqF">pic.twitter.com/ZdxkF63EqF</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Musk, the wealthiest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $250 billion, has grown increasingly friendly with Trump over the course of the 2024 US election.</p>

<p>In March, the two met in person during a donor breakfast hosted at the Florida residence of billionaire Nelson Peltz.</p>

<p>Though individual campaign donations in the United States are capped at $3,300 per person, loopholes in the campaign finance system allow political mega-donors to contribute to funds known as political action committees or "PACs," which support candidates.</p>

<p>Trump previously decried mail and absentee voting, but has backtracked on his criticisms after it became clear Democrats had an edge among mail voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Queen Camilla was eating ice cream when a member of the royal staff whispered something to her. At the same time, King Charles was approached by his protection officer and informed that they needed to leave immediately.</p>

He said, "He stopped at the stall and said, 'Ooh, sea salt.' And I said, 'Come and have a chat, sir'. Then his security appeared and grabbed me and said, 'He has to go, now.'</p>

<p>"He didn't seem panicked, but he was quite stern. They just ushered him out. It's a shame, as he'd stopped to chat with us of his own accord."</p>

<p>A concern raised by a member of the visit team led to this security alert, which was later determined to be a false alarm after a full background check. The event resumed shortly afterward.</p>

<p>This false alarm occurred just days after an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was hit in the ear by a bullet and then swiftly taken to the ground by Secret Service agents, who returned fire and killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump received a hero's welcome Monday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, as he made his first public appearance since being wounded in an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Wearing a white bandage on his ear, the former US president waved at a packed arena and received a standing ovation from cheering supporters, two days after the botched attack at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, made no remarks to the convention, which erupted in loud applause and chants of "USA! USA!" Instead, he stood alongside his newly announced running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, and soaked in the warm reception.</p>

<p>After surveying the convention floor filled with more than 2,400 delegates, Trump took a seat next to Vance in a VIP box that also included House Republican Byron Donalds and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.</p>

<p>Trump, wearing a blue suit and a trademark red tie, smiled and applauded as officials, guests and others took the stage to address the convention -- and to thank their party leader or praise his survival from a would-be assassin's attack.</p>

<p>Given Saturday's horrific events, "he has proven to be one tough S.O.B.," Sean O'Brien, president of the major International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, told the convention, drawing a huge roar from the crowd.</p>

<p>Trump is due on Thursday to formally accept his party's nomination as flagbearer to challenge President Joe Biden in the November 5 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels on Monday said they targeted two tankers in the Red Sea with missiles and drones after a British security agency reported several attacks in the troubled waterway.</p>

<p>In a statement on social media platform X, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree identified the two ships as BENTLEY I, a Panama-flagged oil tanker, and the CHIOS LION, a Liberia-flagged crude oil tanker.</p>

<p>The BENTLEY I was attacked with "drone boats, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ballistic missiles", while the CHIOS LION was targeted with uncrewed surface vessels, Saree said.</p>

<p>They were targeted because their owners had used Israeli ports, according to the rebel spokesperson.</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations reported two separate incidents in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>A ship sailing southwest of the port city of Hodeidah came under attack from three small vessels, two of which had three people each on board, UKMTO said.</p>

<p>The third skiff was unmanned, according to the agency, which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.</p>

<p>The "unmanned small craft collided with the vessel twice and the two manned small craft fired at the vessel", UKMTO said.</p>

<p>"After 15 minutes, the small craft aborted the attack. The vessel and crew are reported safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call."</p>

<p>The same ship later reported four missiles exploding in "close proximity", UKMTO said, adding that the strikes did not cause any injuries or damage.</p>

<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey also reported the attack, saying the merchant vessel had a private armed security team on board.</p>

<p>In a separate incident on Monday, an uncrewed surface vessel "impacted" a merchant vessel 97 nautical miles northwest of Hodeidah, UKMTO said.</p>

<p>The attack caused "some damage and light smoke", it said, adding that "the vessel and crew are reported safe and proceeding to next port of call".</p>

<p>Houthi drone and missile strikes have taken place despite the deployment of Western naval forces to protect ships in the Red Sea, a vital waterway for global trade.</p>

<p>Since January, the United States and Britain have carried out repeated retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the US military's Central Command (CENTCOM) said its forces destroyed several Houthi drones.</p>

<p>"These actions were taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure," it said in a post on social media platform X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Chris Harris, a father of three from Merthyr Tydfil, sustained a permanent brain injury from a single punch by former professional boxer Daniel Gerrard outside a pub in 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chris Harris, a 40-year-old Merthyr Tydfil resident and father of three, had a permanent brain injury from a single punch outside of a pub. He now faces a lengthy recovery process. The incident happened outside the Vulcan Inn in the wee hours of May 2, 2022.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/15/man-left-permanent-brain-injury-single-punch-ex-boxer-21232132/">reports</a>, Harris was struck by former professional boxer Daniel Gerrard. This is not Gerrard's first offence; he has a prior conviction for manslaughter in 2012, resulting from a fatal punch during another pub brawl. The force of Gerrard's blow rendered Harris unconscious.</p>

<p>Harris sustained a serious head injury, including a two-inch skull fracture and bleeding on the brain. He woke up a day later at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. The full extent of his recovery and the lasting effects of the brain injury remain unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Describing the aftermath of the attack, Chris told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/i-punched-outside-nightclub-changed-29531140"><em>WalesOnline: </em></a>“I was woken up by my wife Lynsey, and she told me I had a massive brain injury and what happened. They'd operated fast and drilled my skull to release the pressure. I just broke down in tears. I thought my life was done. I had an hour to live basically before they operated."</p>

<p>“Lynsey told me that when she went home while I was being operated on, she didn't know if I would survive. I woke up after the operation in so much pain that I was crying throughout. I remained on the critical care ward for three days. Only three days later was I able to look at the scar on my head. It had 23 staples for that injury, and I was shocked by it. I stopped eating and lost a stone and a half in weight. When you go through something like that, you just think, ‘Wow. I've got three kids.' I just didn't know how we'd cope.”</p>

<p>Detective Constable <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.south-wales.police.uk/news/south-wales/news/2023/med-sep/merthyr-man-jailed-for-unprovoked-assault/">Michael Snare commented</a>, "Our thorough &nbsp;investigation showed at no time did Gerrard act in self-defence. All four men he violently assaulted did not pose any threat to him at the time he attacked them. Gerrard caused significant harm to these innocent bystanders."</p>

<p>The third victim suffered significant injuries having to undergo lifesaving surgery for a bleed to the brain. The other victims had a lump to the side of his head, and the first victim sustained stiches to his eyes, a broken nose and bruising and swelling to his face."</p>

<p>Gerrard from the Gurnos was sentenced to a total of four years imprisonment, with an extended licence of one year. While Jason Cox received a 12-month suspended sentence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Monday said he was wrong to call for Donald Trump to be put in the "bullseye" in the race for the White House.</p>

<p>"It was a mistake to use the word," Biden told NBC when asked if he had gone too far with his rhetoric against the newly confirmed Republican nominee, who survived an attempted assassination Saturday at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"I meant focus on him, focus on what he's doing. Focus on his policies, focus on the number of lies he told in the debate," said Biden.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt, in which Trump was grazed in one ear, shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>Several prominent Republicans have since accused Biden of having responsibility for the assassination attempt because of his language against Trump.</p>

<p>"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs," said J.D. Vance, who was announced on Monday as Trump's running mate for the 2024 ticket.</p>

<p>"That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination," wrote Vance on social media.</p>

<p>Biden had made the initial comments in a call to Democratic donors early last week.</p>

<p>"It's time to put Trump in the bullseye," the president said, in a call that was intended to galvanize supporters amid growing dissent over Biden's continued candidacy.</p>

<p>Those divisions emerged from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, in which the president slurred his words, spoke incoherently at times and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked.</p>

<p>Biden's interview with NBC on Monday was the latest post-debate attempt by the White House to assuage growing fears over the 81-year-old president's age and mental state.</p>

<p>Speaking without the aid of a teleprompter, Biden told NBC's Lester Holt that his mental sharpness was "pretty damn good."</p>

<p>"I'm old," Biden told the US broadcaster, according to a transcript.</p>

<p>"But I'm only three years older than Trump, number one. And number two, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good."</p>

<p>He added: "I understand why people say, 'God, he's 81 years old. Whoa. What's he gonna be when he's 83 years old, 84 years?' It's a legitimate question to ask."</p>

<p>While accepting his language against Trump had been a "mistake," Biden said it was right to maintain focus on the threat posed by another Trump presidency.</p>

<p>"Look, I'm not the guy that said 'I want to be a dictator on day one,'" he said, referring to remarks by Trump that alarmed many people</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance has openly praised the work of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, a sign that the agency's broad approach to antitrust enforcement could enjoy some level of support from a second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Vance, a Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, joined the presidential ticket on Monday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump officially became the party's nominee.</p>

<p>Vance is one of several Republican lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri and Florida U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz, called "Khanservatives" for their agreement with the FTC chair that U.S. antitrust law has a broader purpose than keeping prices down for consumers.</p>

<p>"She recognized there has to be a broader understanding of how we think about competition in the marketplace," Vance said at an event in Washington in February.</p>

<p>The comments reflect a tension in the conservative movement, between an impulse to shrink regulatory agencies and a willingness to use antitrust laws to challenge powerful corporations — especially in Big Tech, where some hope to tackle perceived censorship of conservatives online.</p>

<p>Joseph Coniglio, director of antitrust policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said Vance is among the latter.</p>

<p>"I do think that picking Senator Vance as vice president certainly sends a signal in one direction," said Coniglio. His think tank receives funding from several major technology companies.</p>

<p>Scrutiny of Big Tech would not be a departure for Trump. The FTC and Department of Justice under Trump initiated investigations into Meta, Amazon, Apple and Google over alleged antitrust violations. All four companies were eventually sued, and have denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Vance is a Yale-educated lawyer and venture capitalist who worked at corporate law firm Sidley Austin and has helped Trump fundraise in Silicon Valley. He has also called for the breakup of one of its biggest companies.</p>

<p>"Long overdue, but it's time to break Google up," Vance tweeted in February, lamenting that "monopolistic control of information in our society resides with an explicitly progressive technology company."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what a potential second Trump administration would focus on. The conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 policy platform discusses ways conservative causes can be championed by antitrust enforcers, but also questions whether the FTC should continue to exist.</p>

<p>Business groups have criticized President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers for going beyond traditional considerations of how competition affects prices to focus on issues including labor.</p>

<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued to block the FTC's recent ban on employers requiring workers to sign agreements not to join rivals or launch competing businesses.</p>

<p>Vance said at the February event, hosted by Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, that his view of antitrust encompasses not only helping small firms compete, but also on workers and the quality of consumer goods.</p>

<p>He disagreed with what he described as some conservatives' view that corporations' behavior cannot be "tyrannical."</p>

<p>"I want people to live good lives in our country," he said. "I don't really care if the entity that is most threatening to that vision is a private entity or a public entity."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of JD Vance, whom Donald Trump declared as his running mate in the upcoming US presidential elections on Monday, brings a wealth of credentials and a deep connection to Indian values and culture.</p>

<p>A litigator at a national firm, Usha Vance is the daughter of Indian immigrants and has an impressive academic background.</p>

<p>She holds a bachelor's degree in History from Yale University and a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge, according to the New York Times.</p>

<p>Born Usha Chilukuri, she has carved out a distinguished career in the legal field, having clerked for Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh before Kavanaugh's nomination to the Court.</p>

<p>Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, with a strong emphasis on education and hard work, Usha's academic achievements include serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law &amp; Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal, according to a biography from Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson law firm.</p>

<p>After four years of intense extracurricular activity at Yale, she continued her studies as a Gates fellow at Cambridge, where she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups. She was a registered Democrat in 2014.</p>

<p>Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony, according to the New York Times. The couple has three children together.</p>

<p>Usha Vance has played a subtle yet significant role in her husband's success. She assisted Vance in organizing his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.</p>

<p>In the past, she has made some rare appearances with Vance as he sought the Ohio Senate seat.</p>

<p>As the US presidential elections draw near, former US President Donald Trump made his pick for Vice President, selecting JD Vance as his running mate on Monday. Trump confirmed Vance's candidature through a post on social media.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and a well-known entrepreneur, AI Mason said, "Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants -- and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket."</p>

<p>"She knows the Indian culture and all about India. She can be a big help to her husband in navigating great ties between USA and India," the entrepreneur, who is also a friend of the Trump family, said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in an interview earlier with Fox &amp; Friends, Usha Chilukuri Vance and her Senator husband talked about the two having different faiths, and what are their views on the speculations of him becoming a pick for the Vice President of the US.</p>

<p>"I don't think people understand how hard he works and how creative he is. Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better," Usha Vance said.</p>

<p>On being asked about the reason behind her support for JD Vance, as the US Presidential elections remain around the corner, Usha told Fox, "There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him."</p>

<p>The interview was taken three weeks before the announcement of JD Vance as the running mate of Trump in the upcoming US presidential polls.</p>

<p>Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign says the former president, following his brush with death, will call for unity in the face of tragedy instead of criticising his political adversaries as he faces off with President Biden in a 2024 election rematch.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dodging a bullet at a rally and seeing the US Supreme Court bolster his presidential immunity claims this month, Donald Trump was handed another gift Monday: the dismissal of his classified documents case.</p>

<p>As the only president ever to be twice impeached -- and twice acquitted -- and the country's only ex-president convicted of criminal charges, the septuagenarian has often struggled to stay afloat.</p>

<p>His blunders, multitude of scandals and vitriolic statements have shocked millions of Americans. Many heads of state see him as a danger to global stability and the fight against global warming, and he has stood accused of indulging far-right groups and disparaging immigrants.</p>

<p>But each time he is said to be sunk, he roars back to the surface, and this week he is heading into Milwaukee riding very high.</p>

<p>On Thursday the Republican National Convention will overlook Trump's vows of vengeance against his political enemies and swat aside his various legal woes to formally nominate him as the party's flagbearer going into the November election against President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the brash billionaire who burst onto the political landscape a decade ago as a super disruptor and champion of conservatives, appears unstoppable.</p>

<p>"It sure seems he's on a roll," Texas alternate delegate Orlando Dona, wearing Trump pins and a straw-colored cowboy hat, told AFP.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old Dona, like many conservatives, believes the various cases against Trump have been politically motivated, "and he is coming out of all this justified."</p>

<p>As for the shooting, some are chalking it up to divine intervention.</p>

<p>"I personally think it was the hand of God," Wisconsin former governor Scott Walker told AFP at the convention.</p>

<p>Walker, who ran for president against Trump briefly in 2016, said Trump the man has earned a reputation for taking on anything.</p>

<p>"He's never going to stop being a fighter," he said. "And I think people here realize he's fighting for them, and these wins are not just about wins for him, they're wins for the American people."</p>

<p><strong>- 'A lot of obstacles' -</strong></p>

<p>Trump earned the nickname "Teflon Don" for weathering a multitude of storms.</p>

<p>The #MeToo movement precipitated the downfall of dozens of powerful Americans. Not Trump, despite multiple accusations of sexual abuse, a 2023 civil trial finding of liability for the sexual assault of writer E. Jean Carroll, and an alleged affair with pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>After an explosive "Access Hollywood" tape emerged in 2016 in which Trump makes degrading remarks about women and boasted about groping their genitals, some Republican heavyweights withdrew their support, and he was predicted to lose the female vote.</p>

<p>That collapse didn't happen, and he won the White House a month later.</p>

<p>Now, it appears he will pull off another miracle, avoiding three of the four lawsuits he had been facing before the election.</p>

<p>"If the story of even the last 18 months teaches us anything, there were a lot of obstacles that were put up to president Trump, and the fact that he's gotten through them shows, I think, part of what gives me faith in this country," businessman and former 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy told reporters at the convention.</p>

<p>"As Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long but it bends towards justice," Ramaswamy said. "I believe that's exactly what it is doing in recent months, days, and over the last year of president Trump's journey as well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic have signed deals with the United States government for research, testing and evaluation of their artificial intelligence models, the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The first-of-their-kind agreements come at a time when the companies are facing regulatory scrutiny over safe and ethical use of AI technologies.</p>

<p>California legislators are set to vote on a bill as soon as this week to broadly regulate how AI is developed and deployed in the state.</p>

<p>"Safe, trustworthy AI is crucial for the technology's positive impact. Our collaboration with the U.S. AI Safety Institute leverages their wide expertise to rigorously test our models before widespread deployment," said Jack Clark, Co-Founder and Head of Policy at Anthropic, backed by Amazon and Alphabet.</p>

<p>Under the deals, the U.S. AI Safety Institute will have access to major new models from both OpenAI and Anthropic prior to and following their public release.</p>

<p>The agreements will also enable collaborative research to evaluate capabilities of the AI models and risks associated with them.</p>

<p>"We believe the institute has a critical role to play in defining U.S. leadership in responsibly developing artificial intelligence and hope that our work together offers a framework that the rest of the world can build on," said Jason Kwon, chief strategy officer at ChatGPT maker OpenAI.</p>

<p>"These agreements are just the start, but they are an important milestone as we work to help responsibly steward the future of AI," said Elizabeth Kelly, director of the U.S. AI Safety Institute.</p>

<p>The institute, a part of the U.S. commerce department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will also collaborate with the U.K. AI Safety Institute and provide feedback to the companies on potential safety improvements.</p>

<p>The U.S. AI Safety Institute was launched last year as part of an executive order by President Joe Biden's administration to evaluate known and emerging risks of artificial intelligence models.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have identified the hormone that triggers a starfish to shed its limbs to survive predators, describing it as being similar to the one controlling appetite in humans.</p>

<p>The research team at Queen Mary University of London, UK, proposed that when this hormone -- 'ArSK/CCK1' -- is released in response to stress, it triggers a muscle at the base of the starfish's arm to tense, thereby effectively causing it to break off. They studied a common European starfish, Asterias rubens.</p>

<p>The authors said the findings, published in the journal Current Biology, revealed a key piece of the puzzle regarding processes which underlie autotomy, or the ability of an animal to detach a body part to escape predatory attacks.</p>

<p>"Our findings shed light on the complex interplay of neurohormones and tissues involved in starfish autotomy. While we've identified a key player, it's likely that other factors contribute to this extraordinary ability," author Ana Tinoco from Queen Mary University of London said.</p>

<p>Starfish are known to possess the ability to regenerate limbs lost over time. Therefore, understanding the processes related to this ability could have implications for regenerative medicine and the development of new treatments for limb injuries, the researchers said.</p>

<p>"This research not only unveils a fascinating aspect of starfish biology but also opens doors for exploring the regenerative potential of other animals, including humans.</p>

<p>"By deciphering the secrets of starfish self-amputation, we hope to advance our understanding of tissue regeneration and develop innovative therapies for limb injuries," lead researcher Maurice Elphick, a professor of animal physiology and neuroscience at Queen Mary University of London, said.</p>

<p>Autotomy is a well-known survival strategy among animals, another example of which is lizards shedding tails.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The gig economy, once seen as a side hustle, has become essential for supplementing income as inflation outpaces wage increases.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the post-pandemic era, the United States has witnessed a disturbing trend: an increasing number of people are forced to take multiple jobs to make ends meet. Of late, what was once referred to as the "gig economy" or "side hustle" has turned necessary for most Americans who struggle through the rising cost of living, lack of wage increases, and poor economic security. Whereas inflation is consistently beating wage growth, the gig economy has become a sort of lifeline to supplement income derived from a primary source.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/more-americans-are-working-two-jobs-to-make-ends-meet/"><em>CBS News,</em></a>&nbsp;the jobs report from the US Department of Labour showed nearly 8.4 million people had multiple jobs in October, 2023. That's the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Women appear to be leading that trend. The federal data showed nearly six percent worked multiple jobs in October compared to 4.7 percent of men. Experts say people may be taking on additional jobs to offset high inflation, which has been easing but is still painfully high for some households. Non-profits like the United Way said inflation is outpacing wage growth, and that's making it harder for them to help families..</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/workers-multiple-jobs-lifestyle-economy-344c8f10"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, job growth slowed sharply in July, 2024, with the national unemployment rate rising to its highest level since 2021. At the same time, the share of people holding more than one job ticked up to 5.3% in July from 5.2% in June. That is a significant increase from a pandemic low of 4% in April 2020, according to US Bureau of Labour Statistics data. The figure averaged 4.94% from 2010 through 2019.</p>

<p>The comeback of multiple-job holders speaks to some of the mixed currents in an economy that still boasts a growing job market but has come with higher prices on a broad variety of goods and services and essentials like rent and insurance.</p>

<p>"One story is that people are short of cash, and they need extra hours, and the only way to pick up extra hours is by picking up a short-term job," Christopher Taber, chairman of the economics department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/workers-multiple-jobs-lifestyle-economy-344c8f10">WSJ</a>. "Another story is that it's easier to work two jobs now than it was before."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This electric field drives the polar wind, propelling charged particles into space at supersonic speeds and shaping Earth's atmosphere, particularly over the poles.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking discovery, a long-suspected electric field around Earth has been observed to generate a kind of polar wind that propels particles into space at supersonic speeds. Scientists call this an "ambipolar electric field," which is a weak phenomenon on a global scale-one theorized for the very first time more than 60 years ago. Recent observations from NASA's Endurance rocket, published in <em>Nature</em>, confirm its existence and suggest it significantly influences Earth's atmosphere, most especially over the poles.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-discovers-long-sought-global-electric-field-on-earth/">NASA</a>, the ambipolar electric field is a key driver of the "polar wind," a steady outflow of charged particles into space that occurs above Earth's poles. This electric field lifts charged particles in our upper atmosphere to greater heights than they would otherwise reach and may have shaped our planet's evolution in ways yet to be explored.</p>

<p>Measurements from the rocket, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07480-3">NASA's Endurance mission</a>, have confirmed the existence of the ambipolar field and quantified its strength, revealing its role in driving atmospheric escape and shaping our ionosphere - a layer of the upper atmosphere - more broadly.</p>

<p>Understanding the complex movements and evolution of our planet's atmosphere provides clues not only to the history of Earth but also gives us insight into the mysteries of other planets and determining which ones might be hospitable to life. The paper was published Wednesday, August 28, 2024, in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>"Something had to be drawing these particles out of the atmosphere," said Glyn Collinson, principal investigator of Endurance at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the paper. Scientists suspected a yet-to-be-discovered electric field could be at work.</p>

<p>"It's like this conveyor belt, lifting the atmosphere up into space," Collinson added.</p>

<p>Endurance's discovery has opened many new paths for exploration. The ambipolar field, as a fundamental energy field of our planet alongside gravity and magnetism, may have continuously shaped the evolution of our atmosphere in ways we can now begin to explore. Because it's created by the internal dynamics of an atmosphere, similar electric fields are expected to exist on other planets, including Venus and Mars.</p>

<p>"Any planet with an atmosphere should have an ambipolar field," Collinson said. "Now that we've finally measured it, we can begin learning how it's shaped our planet as well as others over time."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US-India defence relationship is rapidly expanding, adapting to evolving regional and global security demands. This includes safeguarding supply chains, advancing critical and emerging technologies, and enhancing cooperation in cyber, space, and new dimensions of battlespace dominance. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to the US from August 23-26 highlighted these shifts, aiming to bridge bilateral gaps in these critical areas. The visit underscored a clear trend: while major defence deals continue to strengthen traditional security ties, both nations are increasingly emphasising emerging strategic elements to integrate the security partnership with a purposive intent towards making the Indo-Pacific region free and open.</p>

<p>Issues central to joint India-US interests in the Indian Ocean and the security of the Indo-Pacific are being prioritised. India's increasing role in shaping regional security by ensuring freedom of navigation, now especially as a member of the Combined Maritime Force (CMF), was acknowledged. With India assuming leadership in the Combined Task Force 150 in 2025, stakes for an expanded regional security role have increased for New Delhi.</p>

<h2><strong>The Indo-Pacific Arena</strong></h2>

<p>As the Indo-Pacific remains central to regional and global security, enhancing partnership in this region is key to shaping a regionally favourable security architecture. Towards this, the visit provided an opportunity for steps in increasing supply chain security as well as enhancing maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Among the highlights was a new agreement to expand and strengthen operational coordination between India and the US by placing Indian liaison officers at US commands. The agreement is a step up for regional security coordination and domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific for India, complementing an earlier initiative to host US officers at the Information Fusion Centre (IFC-IOR) in India. It also overcomes the capacity limitations of India, indeed any country, to solely monitor the vast expanse of the Indo-Pacific on a real-time basis. Beyond the Indo-Pacific, placing Indian liaison officers at the other 10 Combatant Commands could usher new vistas in information sharing.</p>

<p>At the heart of the visit were steps to strengthen the Major Defence Partnership (MDP) and provide fresh momentum to joint production, including the reigniting of the Defense Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI). Under the US-India Roadmap for Defense Industrial Cooperation, an agreement to jointly produce jet engines, unmanned platforms, munitions, and ground mobility systems was signed. Leading up to the third summit of the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X) to be held in September in the US, discussions to expand cooperation in the areas of undersea and space-related collaborations were timely.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is SOSA</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most significant outcomes of the visit was the signing of the Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA), which makes India the 18th country to enter into this agreement with the US. It reflects a shared long-term vision to seamlessly integrate the defence industrial ecosystems of both nations while safeguarding supply chains from future disruptions. SOSA complements the Major Defense Partnership (MDP) and the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Notably, the visit aimed to reinvigorate the DTTI, a co-production initiative launched with high expectations, but that had lost momentum. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment will host a DTTI meeting in the coming months, bringing together government and private stakeholders from both countries' defence industries. The DTTI's primary goal is to integrate the defence industrial bases of the US and India, promoting bilateral co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment efforts.</p>

<p>SOSA strengthens the partnership by establishing guardrails for supply chains between the two countries' defence industries, which are poised to grow with new co-production and co-development opportunities. Guided by the US Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS), the arrangement provides structural and institutional assurances for defense supplies. India, in turn, is expected to develop a common code of conduct for government and industry stakeholders, prioritizing critical supplies to the US on a voluntary basis. With SOSA in place, working groups will have the framework to communicate more frequently and take proactive steps to ensure supply chain stability in both peacetime and crisis situations.</p>

<h2><strong>Diaspora As A 'Living Bridge'</strong></h2>

<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's reference to the Indian diaspora in the US as a 'living bridge' now resonates within the context of the growing India-US defence relationship. This June marked the first anniversary of the US-India INDUS-X Initiative, which aims to build a defence innovation bridge between the two countries under the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET). By connecting researchers, investors, and defence tech companies from both nations, INDUS-X outlines a strategy to harness private capital for defence innovation.</p>

<p>India and the US are swiftly adapting to the evolving global security landscape, responding to new threat perceptions with increased innovation and cooperation in advanced domains. The second US-India Advanced Domains Defense Dialogue (AD3) held this year underscored the importance of coordination in emerging defence areas, including space, cyber, and artificial intelligence, while identifying critical sub-sectors for potential industrial collaboration.</p>

<h2><strong>The Next Goals</strong></h2>

<p>The Defence Minister also visited the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Memphis, accompanied by a delegation from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), signalling a potential pathway for co-learning and development. In a boost to India's Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capabilities, India secured the purchase of sonobuoys from the US in the lead-up to the visit. The acquisition and co-production of General Atomics' MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft systems and the joint production of GE F414 jet engines in India are the next major goals for both nations.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh's visit managed to underline once again that defence is the main driver when it comes to shaping the trajectory of US-India bilateral engagement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Taliban government's morality police said it would not cooperate with the United Nation's mission in Afghanistan, calling it "an opposing side".</p>

<p>It comes after the UN mission, known as UNAMA, warned that a new morality law cementing policies that restrict women's lives would damage prospects for engagement with the international community.</p>

<p>"Due to its continued propaganda, effective from now, the PVPV (the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice) will not provide any support or cooperation with UNAMA, which will be considered as an opposing side," the ministry said in a statement on social media late Thursday.</p>

<p>"We want international organisations, the countries, and those individuals who criticised the mentioned law to respect the religious values of the Muslims and refrain from such criticisms and statements that insult Islamic values and sanctities."</p>

<p>The 35-article morality law -- which says women must cover up completely and not raise their voices -- was published in the official gazette on July 31.</p>

<p>It establishes prohibitions already generally known, but its enactment could allow for increased control of the population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Starliner's propulsion system issues were deemed too risky for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boeings-starliner-set-for-first-crewed-mission-to-international-space-station-5598833" target="_blank">crewed</a> return after the capsule experienced a series of glitches within the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS.</p>

<p>The journey back to Earth for the Starliner is expected to take approximately six hours from undocking to landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, NASA said in a blog post.</p>

<p>Ground teams will remotely guide the spacecraft through necessary manoeuvres for a safe undocking, re-entry and parachute-assisted landing in southwestern United States.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Arizona Wells Fargo employee was found dead at her desk four days after clocking into work. Sixty-year-old Denise Prudhomme was last recorded entering her office building on the 1100 block of West Washington Street in Tempe at 7 am on Friday, August 16. However, it wasn't until the following Tuesday, August 20, that building security called authorities after finding she was unresponsive in her cubicle.</p>

<p>Tempe police have stated that their initial investigation found no signs of foul play. The department's criminal investigations bureau is now working with the Maricopa County Medical Examiner to determine the exact cause of Ms Prudhomme's death.</p>

<p>According to reports from <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/investigation-underway-after-body-of-wells-fargo-employee-found-dead-at-work-tempe/75-1329570f-3b63-4869-b4bd-7d45801a80f2 ">local media</a>, Ms Prudhomme's body was discovered by a colleague walking around the building. Police responded to a 911 call made by on-site security, who claimed "she was dead in a cubicle located on the third floor of the building." Officials arrived at the scene and pronounced her dead at 4:55 pm that day. It is believed that Ms Prudhomme had been sitting at her desk for the entire weekend and Monday, unnoticed by her coworkers.</p>

<p>Employees reportedly noticed a foul odour in the office but assumed it was related to plumbing issues. A distressed employee told 12 News, "It's really heartbreaking. What if I were just sitting there? No one would check on me?"</p>

<p>A Wells Fargo spokesperson <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/08/29/wells-fargo-employee-dies-work-tempe-office-body-not-found-until-days-later/">released a statement</a>&nbsp;saying they were "deeply saddened" by the "tragic loss of our colleague." "Our thoughts and prayers are with their family and loved ones during this difficult time," the statement read.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A team of Finnish researchers has developed a new suite of methods to test for the antivirulence and antibacterial effect of hundreds of unknown compounds from the Arctic Sea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of Finnish researchers has developed a new suite of methods to test for the antivirulence and antibacterial effect of hundreds of unknown compounds from the Arctic Sea.</p>

<p>The team from the University of Helsinki targeted an enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strain that causes severe diarrhoea in children under five, especially in developing countries. The compounds were derived from four species of actinobacteria and tested against EPEC adhering to colorectal cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EPEC causes disease by adhering to cells in the human gut. Once it adheres to these cells, EPEC injects so-called "virulence factors" into the host cell to hijack its molecular machinery, ultimately killing it.</p>

<p>Two compounds showed strong antivirulence or <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rare-flesh-eating-bacteria-that-can-kill-in-2-days-spreading-in-japan-5896619" target="_blank">antibacterial</a> activity: one from an unknown strain (T091-5) in the genus Rhodococcus and another from an unknown strain (T160-2) of Kocuria. The compound from T091-5 was most likely a phospholipid, a class of fatty phosphorus-containing molecules that play important roles in cell metabolism.</p>

<p>"Here we show how advanced screening assays can identify antivirulence and antibacterial metabolites from actinobacteria extracts," said Dr. Paivi Tammela, a professor at the University of Helsinki in Finland.</p>

<p>The molecule from T091-5 did not inhibit the development of EPEC bacteria, in contrast to the compounds from T160-2.</p>

<p>Of the two strains, T091-5 is the most promising since EPEC is less likely to develop resistance to its antivirulence actions.</p>

<p>Using sophisticated analytical techniques, the team found that the active component from T091-5 was most likely a phospholipid -- a family of fatty phosphorus-containing molecules vital for cell <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/microbes-have-adapted-to-microwave-ovens-finds-study-how-to-disinfect-6290180" target="_blank">metabolism</a>. But this is subject to further studies, they noted, in the paper published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.</p>

<p>"The next steps are the optimisation of the culture conditions for compound production and the isolation of sufficient amounts of each compound to elucidate their respective structures and further investigate their respective bioactivities," said Tammela.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey arrested over 100 suspected members of the Islamic State group this week, authorities said Friday, the latest mass detention targeting the terror organisation.</p>

<p>The country has been hit by several major attacks claimed by IS, including a 2017 nightclub shooting that killed dozens of people.</p>

<p>The fresh raids took place across the country, including in the capital Ankara and Turkey's largest city Istanbul, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>The arrest of 119 people this week follows other mass detentions, including 99 announced in early August.</p>

<p>Since the 2019 collapse of the self-proclaimed "caliphate", some suspected IS members have settled in Turkey.</p>

<p>Turkish authorities said that since June 2023 more than 3,600 people with suspected ties to the jihadist group have been arrested.</p>

<p>Two of the assailants who massacred 145 people at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow last March, an attack for which IS claimed responsibility, had spent several weeks in Turkey before heading to Russia, according to local authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Durek, in an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/11/the-princess-and-the-shaman" rel="nofollow,noindex">Vanity Fair</a> in 2020, shared he had died at age 28. He suffered seizures, organ failure and flatlined for four minutes. During this intense moment, he claimed to have felt like flaming knives were stabbing him and heard his grandmother's spirit telling him to let go.</p>

<p>However, his mind took him back to his "mother's womb", where he relived every moment of his life and re-met every person he had ever known. After being resuscitated, Mr Verret spent two months in a coma and eight years on dialysis, until his sister donated a kidney in 2012. He believes his recovery required him to think with his "expansive soul" rather than his "limiting brain."</p>

<p>Mr Verret's spiritual practices and claims, including his assertion that he rose from the dead, have raised eyebrows in Norway, a country known for its more conservative royal traditions.</p>

<p>Mr <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/norway-princess-announces-wedding-plans-with-hollywood-guru-4386325 ">Verrett is an African-American spiritual advisor</a>&nbsp;who counts celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Antonio Banderas among his followers. He has suggested that cancer is a choice, advocated exercises to remove "imprints" from women's bodies left by previous sexual partners, and sold $222 medallions on his website, claiming they helped him overcome COVID-19. These beliefs have led to him being labelled as a "charlatan, a quack" by Norwegian columnist Dagfinn Nordbo.</p>

<p>Despite the controversy, Princess Martha Louise, who is fourth in line to the Norwegian throne, has stood by her fiance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Louise introduced Mr Verrett to the world via an Instagram post in 2019. In the post, she defended her choice, urging critics to refrain from judgment and stressing that Mr Verrett was simply "a man I love spending my time with."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cindy Rodriguez Singh, a woman with ties to India, is wanted for allegedly killing her 6-year-old son Noel, who has been missing since October 2022. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to her arrest.</p>

<p>While police have not been able to recover the boy's body, they believe his mother had a role to play in his death. Police cadaver dogs detected human remains on a carpet that had once been on the floor of a shed on the Singh's property.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The carpet was disposed of by Singh's husband Arshdeep Singh but later recovered by police.</p>

<h2><strong>Why is Cindy Rodriguez Singh a suspect?</strong></h2>

<p>Reports have suggested that Singh believed her son was "evil, possessed or [had] a demon in him."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the days leading up to his suspected death, witnesses told police that she told people she feared the boy would "hunt" her newborn twins.</p>

<p>The child was last seen at the hospital when Singh gave birth to her twins and one other time in October 2022. Those who saw the child told police that he appeared "malnourished" and "unhealthy". Noel reportedly suffered from severe disabilities including chronic lung disease.</p>

<p>Singh was also reported to be "abusive and neglectful" to the child, relatives told police.</p>

<p>"One relative witnessed Cindy strike Noel in the face with keys for drinking water. Witnesses additionally stated that food and water were often withheld from Noel because Cindy did not like changing Noel's dirty diapers," police said.</p>

<p>According to a report by Fox News, Noel's grandmother had told police that Singh told her that she sold the 6-year-old to another woman at a grocery store.</p>

<h2><strong>Where is Cindy Rodriguez Singh?</strong></h2>

<p>In March 22, 2023, Singh along with her husband and six other children boarded an international flight for India and have not been located. The missing child was not with the family at the time, and did not board the flight.</p>

<p>The police first suspected Singh after she lied to officers, who had visited her home for a welfare check. She told them that the boy was living with his biological father in Mexico, and had been there since November 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/s-jaishankar" target="_blank">S Jaishankar</a> has signalled a distinct change in the government's Pakistan policy, stating "the era of uninterrupted dialogue... is over" but acknowledging also that New Delhi stands ready to react to developments across the border "whether positive or negative".</p>

<p>At a private event in Delhi this week, he also offered a stern "actions have consequences" warning to Pakistan, and those within who support terrorist attacks on India. "The issue is... what kind of relationship can we contemplate with Pakistan..." he responded to a question about ties with Pakistan.</p>

<p>On a suggestion that India is content for the relationship to continue as is, he said, "Maybe yes, maybe no... but what I do want to say is that we are not passive, and that whether events take a positive or negative direction... either way we will react."</p>

<p>India's relationship with Pakistan is volatile with border disputes in Jammu and Kashmir a regular flashpoint. New Delhi has often raised concerns over Pakistan's support - financial and logistical - of cross-border terrorism, red-flagging these in bilateral and international forums.</p>

<p>In March Mr Jaishankar, on a visit to Singapore, lamented Pakistan's "almost industry-level" sponsoring of terrorism and terror activities, but stressed "India will not skirt this problem..."</p>

<p>"How do you deal with a neighbour who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft? It's not one-off... but very sustained, almost at an industry level."</p>

<p>He indicated then that while New Delhi will always be open to a friendly dialogue to resolve disputes - as it has stressed in conflict between Russia and Ukraine and amid military tension in West Asia - this could not be at the continued cost of terrorist attacks on India and Indians.</p>

<p>"I don't have a quick instantaneous fix... but what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore. We are not going to say, 'Well, that happened and (now) let's continue our dialogue'... we should not give the other country a free pass," he said in Singapore.</p>

<p>A couple of months earlier Mr Jaishankar re-emphasised India's zero-tolerance stance on cross-border terrorism, and made it clear New Delhi would not, under any circumstance, overlook terror attacks.</p>

<p>"In this country, I think tolerance for any kind of cross-border terrorism is very low... there will be consequences. That is the message of Balakot," he said, referring to a precision strike by Indian armed forces on a terror training camp in Pakistan. This was after a terror attack that killed 19 soldiers.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's comment on dialogue with Pakistan must also be viewed against the backdrop of elections in Jammu and Kashmir in less than 20 days. The former state will hold its first Assembly election in a decade over three phases beginning September 18.</p>

<p>Ahead of voting both mainstream regional parties - the National Conference and the People's Democratic Party - have spoken about resuming dialogue and diplomatic ties with Pakistan.</p>

<p>In its manifesto, ex Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's PDP promises advocacy of "diplomatic initiatives between India and Pakistan, emphasising conflict resolution, confidence-building measures, and regional cooperation" and establishment of "trade and social exchange."</p>

<p>The National Conference, led by former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar, also an ex Chief Minister, has allied with the Congress and it too seeks dialogue with Pakistan.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The king of New Zealand's Maori died on Friday after heart surgery, with aides saying the beloved 69-year-old monarch, praised as a symbol of national unity, had "passed to the great beyond".</p>

<p>Spokesman Rahui Papa said King Tuheitia died peacefully surrounded by family, just days after celebrating the 18th anniversary of his coronation.</p>

<p>A symbol of Maori identity and kinship, Tuheitia occupied a largely ceremonial role and for most of his reign only spoke publicly once a year.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, he helped put New Zealand's rich Indigenous heritage at the centre of public life.</p>

<p>He campaigned to reduce high rates of Indigenous incarceration and for whales to be granted legal personhood, hoping to protect them from the ravages of evermore polluted and warming seas.</p>

<p>"The death of Kiingi Tuheitia is a moment of great sadness," Papa said in a statement. "A chief who has passed to the great beyond. Rest in love."</p>

<p>After a string of health problems, Tuheitia had been in hospital trying to recover from heart surgery when he died.</p>

<p>His body was brought on Friday afternoon to lie in state at a marae -- ceremonial grounds -- near the north island town of Ngaruawahia.</p>

<p>Black-clad mourners flocked to the site as news of the king's death spread.</p>

<h3><strong>Kawakawa leaves</strong></h3>

<p>New Zealand's Maori currently make up about 17 percent of the population, or about 900,000 people.</p>

<p>Women carried wreaths of kawakawa leaves on their heads and were cloaked in patterned shawls. Some prayed gently as they placed bouquets of flowers.</p>

<p>Many were marked with facial tattoos -- an indelible statement of pride in their Maori heritage.</p>

<p>They passed under an ochre-red archway, ornately carved with beaked figures, and into the ceremonial grounds.</p>

<p>Inside, leaders sang songs of bereavement -- the dirges and polyphonic melodies that have marked Maori funerals for generations.</p>

<p>A royal spokesperson told AFP that Tuheitia will lie in state before being buried on Wednesday at Mount Taupiri, the sacred "embracing mountain" that is the final resting place for Maori royals.</p>

<p>The process of electing his successor will be guided by a privy council.</p>

<p>During Tuheitia's past periods of ill health, his eldest son Whatumoana Te Aa Paki took over official duties.</p>

<h3><strong>'Immense fondness'</strong></h3>

<p>King Charles III, New Zealand's formal head of state, led the tributes, saying he was "shocked" having recently spoken to Tuheitia by phone.</p>

<p>"My wife and I were profoundly saddened to learn of the death of Kiingi Tuheitia," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I had the greatest pleasure of knowing Kiingi Tuheitia for decades."</p>

<p>The UK monarch said he remembered with "immense fondness" his meetings with Tuheitia in New Zealand in 2015 and at Buckingham Palace last year.</p>

<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon praised the king's "unwavering commitment to his people" as he ordered flags on government and public buildings to be flown at half-staff.</p>

<p>"Today, we mourn," Luxon said in a statement from Tonga, where he is attending the Pacific Islands Forum.</p>

<p>The Kiingitanga -- Maori King movement -- was founded in 1858 with the aim of uniting New Zealand's Indigenous Maori under a single sovereign, in the face of British colonisation.</p>

<p>The position has significant political and symbolic weight, but carries no legal status.</p>

<p>Tuheitia was the seventh Kiingitanga monarch.</p>

<h3><strong>Whales' rights</strong></h3>

<p>In 2006, Tuheitia succeeded his mother, Queen Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, who held the position for four decades.</p>

<p>During his reign he held countless ceremonies, visited the United Nations, met Pope Francis at the Vatican and represented a New Zealand delegation at the Olympic games in Paris.</p>

<p>Tuheitia called a 'hui' (national meeting) in January, when he asked for unity among Maori in response to concerns that the policies of the coalition government are undermining Indigenous rights.</p>

<p>In March, Tuheitia made international headlines with an impassioned call for whales to be granted the same legal rights as people, in a bid to protect vulnerable species.</p>

<p>He wanted the marine mammals to have inherent rights, such as having a healthy environment, to allow the restoration of their populations.</p>

<p>Chief of staff Ngira Simmonds told local media he would miss the king's love of music and community.</p>

<p>"I think what he will leave behind for this nation at large was his strong belief for unity, that unity is the best way forward for us as a nation," Simmonds said.</p>

<p>Around half a million New Zealanders tuned in to watch the last funeral of a Maori monarch when Tuheitia's mother was buried in 2006.</p>

<p>Maori expert Carwyn Jones told AFP, saying thousands would likely attend in person.</p>

<p>"Here is an opportunity to see (the Kiingitanga) operating and being a focal point for Maori."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of External Affairs is making efforts to push for an early return of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl from Thane district, who has been in foster care in Germany for the past 36 months following allegations of minor physical abuse, local MP Naresh Mhaske has said.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has assured him that the government is expediting legal processes to secure the return of the girl, Ariha. Her parents, who are currently in Germany, can now meet their daughter twice a month, said Mr Mhaske in a release on Thursday.</p>

<p>Ariha's parents Bhavesh and Dhara Shah are residents of Mira Bhayander in Thane district.</p>

<p>After the Thane MP raised the matter in Parliament earlier this month, the Foreign Minister wrote to him detailing the efforts being made through his ministry.</p>

<p>It was as a result of "our" intervention that the German Youth Welfare Authorities decided against appealing the court orders granting visitation for the parents, Mr Jaishankar said in his letter dated August 16.</p>

<p>"The matter has been raised with the German side at all levels, including personally by myself with my German counterpart where I emphasized that the long-term welfare of Ariha can only be ensured when she is brought up in her own socio-cultural environment in India," wrote Mr Jaishankar.</p>

</div>

<p>The MEA and embassy officials in Berlin are trying to ensure that the toddler is introduced to Indian culture and familiarised with the elements of the cultural environment of her original upbringing by sharing resources on Jainism, Indian festivals, and cultural and religious traditions with a request that the foster parent may use these resources appropriately, the letter said.</p>

<p>Ariha has been taken to Indian temples twice by embassy officials and efforts are being made to work out an arrangement under which she can be taught Gujarati/Hindi, he wrote.</p>

<p>"Pursuant to court orders, the parents have been granted visitation rights twice a month with the child (the time for which has also been increased recently by the courts) In addition, the German side has also been granting regular consular access for our Embassy officials to visit the child," the Foreign Minister said.</p>

<p>He has assured Mhaske that the government will continue to make all possible efforts to bring the child to India.</p>

<p>"It is important to note that this case centers around a minor girl child, and the aforementioned diplomatic efforts are all being undertaken in a consistent and continuous manner by the Ministry of External Affairs. I also hope that you would appreciate the sensitivities surrounding this case and handle the matter with appropriate discretion," added the letter.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After more than four years in the making, French video game designer Ubisoft on Friday released its much-anticipated "Star Wars Outlaws", an immersive spinoff from the famed saga.</p>

<p>The group's first foray into the universe created by George Lucas, "Outlaws" is an open-world adventure featuring Kay Vess, a young outlaw who travels the galaxy far away to pull off the heist of the century.</p>

<p>"This project is a childhood dream for many of us," the studio's creative director Julian Gerighty told AFP.</p>

<p>The game crafted by Sweden-based Massive Entertainment allows players to explore cities and space stations in a fictional planet truthful to the sci-fi epic.</p>

<p>While "Outlaws" is not the first <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/what-is-star-wars-day-why-is-it-celebrated-on-may-4-heres-everything-to-know-5584954" target="_blank">Star Wars</a>-themed game, Gerighty says his teams managed to design dense cities and ultra-realistic vessels thanks to the advent of state-of-the-art, powerful consoles.</p>

<p>"We created new planets, new moons, and characters that enter this universe," said Gerighty.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/star-wars-outlaws-like-reconnecting-with-childhood-developer-of-star-wars-outlaw-game-6079823" target="_blank">"Outlaws"</a>is the product of a partnership struck with the company LucasFilms, the video game branch of the Disney-owned franchise.</p>

<p>Its creators were granted access to the entertainment giant's "exclusive library with all the details and design documents" of Star Wars -- the key to rendering an authentic atmosphere.</p>

<h3><strong>An odyssey without Jedis</strong></h3>

<p>Fans however should not expect Jedis -- members of the saga's mystical knightly order. Rather, "Outlaws" brings the galaxy's underworld into the spotlight.</p>

<p>The world features iconic <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/princess-leias-star-wars-gold-bikini-sells-for-175-000-in-us-6211898" target="_blank">characters</a> and legendary locations, with planet Tatooine, where original hero Luke Skywalker was born, as its setting.</p>

<p>The "incredibly ambitious" project inserts itself between the events of the "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi", said Gerighty.</p>

<p>Some of the adventure's protagonists could appear in other productions, he added, as Disney in recent years has scaled up spinoffs from the franchise.</p>

<p>"Outlaws" will be the first Star Wars game to be developed by a publisher other than Electronic Arts (EA), since an exclusivity contract between the brand and the US firm ended in 2021.</p>

<p>Some gamers who were granted early access reported a few bugs, which the creators have pledged to fix.</p>

<h3><strong>A plethora of adaptations</strong></h3>

<p>EA since 2013 has rolled out a number of titles, from shooting multiplayer "Star Wars <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korea-set-to-deploy-starwars-laser-weapons-to-take-down-n-korean-drones-6087822" target="_blank">Battlefront</a>" to laser sabre combat "Jedi: Fallen Order" and "Jedi Survivor".</p>

<p>"These games have been key successes," said Mat Piscatella, an analyst for the industry-tracking firm Circana, who says Disney terminated its deal with EA to "maximise" revenue from the franchise.</p>

<p>The latest Star Wars video games have all ranked among the top 10 best-sellers in the US, according to Piscatella's figures -- the likely trajectory for "Outlaws".</p>

<p>"There has been a plethora of adaptations" since the late 1970s, said Thibaut Claudel, the author of "Star Wars - Disney and the legacy of George Lucas".</p>

<p>"As an entrepreneur and an artist, George Lucas has always been interested in gaming," which explains the "insane range" of games in the early 2000s, when the second trilogy came out, said Claudel.</p>

<p>"It's a lot of pressure on the creators," he added, pointing out that fans with high standards dissect every fresh release.</p>

<p>Once the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/may-the-fourth-be-with-you-internet-celebrates-star-wars-day-4004904" target="_blank">"Outlaws"</a> frenzy dies down, connoisseurs will shift their attention to "Star Wars Eclipse", a space epic by French studios Quantic Dream, who have yet to announce a release date.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's census will ask citizens about their sexuality for the first time, the government said Friday, a policy U-turn aimed at quelling anger from LGBTQ groups.</p>

<p>Supporters have said questions about sexual identity would provide a more accurate snapshot of who Australians are and who they love.</p>

<p>Just a day after his ministers explained the census change had been scrapped to avoid a divisive debate, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Friday that a question about sexuality would in fact be included in the 2026 survey.</p>

<p>Australia's statistics bureau has developed a new question about sexual orientation, which will now be tested before it can be included in the survey, he said.</p>

<p>"We think that is a common sense position," Albanese told public broadcaster ABC.</p>

<p>It is compulsory to complete the census in Australia, with fines for those who fail to do so.</p>

<p>But people would have the option of answering the sexual orientation question or not, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>Asked why the government had backed down, Albanese said: "No, this is the first time I have been asked about it."</p>

<p>He made no mention of plans to include a question about gender identity, however, saying only that there would not be "massive changes" to the census.</p>

<p>Equality Australia, a rights advocacy group, said it was now unclear how the census would affect trans and gender-diverse people, as well as people with innate variations of sex characteristics.</p>

<p>"We welcome the inclusion of a sexual orientation question but the national snapshot of our nation must include all of us, not just some of us," said Equality Australia chief executive Anna Brown.</p>

<p>"The federal government shouldn't pick and choose those of us who are worthy of being counted."</p>

<p>Brown said including LGBTQ people in the census would bring Australia into line with other countries that already do so, including Britain, Canada and New Zealand.</p>

<p>"It would be a shame if the government doesn't trust the Australian public enough to accept that the census needs to gather basic data about our nation for it be meaningful and useful," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has confirmed that an F16 fighter jet crashed and its pilot died while combating Russian airstrikes.</p>

<p>The F16 fighters participating in the combat had destroyed four missiles, and one of the aircraft lost contact while approaching the next target, the General Staff said in a statement on Telegram.</p>

<p>"As it turned out later, the plane crashed, and the pilot died," the statement said, without specifying the date of the incident.</p>

<p>The special commission of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is working on the scene to determine the cause of the crash, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian Air Force said pilot Oleksii Mes was killed on August 26 while repelling a Russian attack on Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Air Force did not specify whether Mes was an F16 pilot.</p>

<p>In early August, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the first batch of F16s had arrived in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naming others is considered a marker of highly advanced cognition in social animals, previously observed only in humans, bottlenose dolphins and African elephants.</p>

<p>Marmoset monkeys have now joined this exclusive club, according to a new study published in Science on Thursday.</p>

<p>The diminutive primates use loud, high-pitched calls to assign each other "vocal labels," as shown in research conducted by a team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"We are very interested in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/iit-mandi-study-deploys-robots-to-unravel-homing-behaviour-in-animals-6421711" target="_blank">social behavior</a> because we think that social behavior is essentially what drove us humans to be so special compared to other animals," senior author David Omer told AFP.</p>

<p>"We don't run fast, we don't fly, we don't excel in anything else besides being social and all our achievements as a society are our societal achievements."</p>

<p>Marmosets are ideal subjects to study the evolution of social behavior and language in humans, he explained, because they exhibit similar traits, living in small monogamous family groups of six to eight individuals that cooperatively rear their young.</p>

<p>Led by graduate student Guy Oren, the researchers recorded natural conversations between pairs of marmosets separated by a visual barrier, as well as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/iit-researchers-discover-how-animals-find-their-way-home-using-robots-6434736" target="_blank">interactions</a> between the monkeys and a computer system that played back pre-recorded calls.</p>

<p>They discovered that marmosets use "phee calls" -- very high-pitched vocalizations, as loud as power tools -- to address one another. Notably, the monkeys could recognize when such calls were directed at them and were more likely to respond when addressed by their name.</p>

<h3><strong>Machine learning advances</strong></h3>

<p>The ten marmosets they tested came from three separate families, and the research also revealed that members within a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/research-suggests-cats-mourn-the-death-of-companion-animals-even-dogs-6325308" target="_blank">family group</a> used similar sound features to code different names, akin to dialects or accents in humans. This held true even for adult marmosets that weren't related by blood, suggesting they learned from others within the family group.</p>

<p>Marmosets are relatively distant relatives of humans. We last shared a common ancestor around 35 million years ago, while the split between ourselves and chimpanzees could have happened 5-7 million years ago.</p>

<p>Rather than genetic proximity, Omer attributes the acquisition of vocal labels by marmosets to "convergent evolution," or the idea that they evolved similar traits in response to comparable environmental challenges.</p>

<p>For marmosets, vocal labeling may have been crucial for maintaining <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/can-hippos-fly-new-uk-research-reveals-bizarre-finding-6065938" target="_blank">social bonds</a> and group cohesion in the dense rainforests of South America, where visibility is often limited.</p>

<p>How and when humans first began talking is a matter of debate, but until recently many scientists had dismissed the idea we could look to other primates for clues. Omer stressed the latest research was yet another blow to that long-standing opinion.</p>

<p>"We can still learn a lot from non-human <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/animals-experience-time-differently-from-humans-16566" target="_blank">primates</a> about the evolution of language in humans," he said.</p>

<p>The team's statistical analysis of the marmosets' calls was made possible by recent advancements in computational power and machine learning, he added. Looking ahead, one exciting avenue for future research could be leveraging AI to further decipher the content of marmoset conversations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

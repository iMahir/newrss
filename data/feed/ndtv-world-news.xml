<p>While the first US presidential debate of the 2024 race dwelled little on foreign policy, a shaky performance by President Joe Biden will have America's allies steeling for the return of Donald Trump, analysts say.</p>

<p>Biden's supporters had hoped the debate would erase worries that he was too old to serve, but several lawmakers, analysts and investors said the event had given Trump a boost.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trump didn't win but Mr. Biden might have imploded," said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat and now research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies, a think tank.</p>

<p>"Unlike eight years ago, we are much more prepared, as are other European and Asian allies. Still, Mr. Trump is unpredictable."</p>

<p>For Japan and South Korea, among the closest U.S. allies in Asia, relations with Trump's administration were at times strained by his demands for more payments towards military assistance as well as trade tensions.</p>

<p>"The biggest question for Japan would be whether Trump will truly value and maintain the security alliance," said Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Japan's Takushoku University in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Peter Lee, research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said the debate had put into "much more stark relief" the possibility of a second Trump administration. Lee said he expected Trump to be "very tough" second time around in pressuring allies to up their defence spending.</p>

<p>Trump also started a tariff war with China, the world's second largest economy, and has floated tariffs of 60% or higher on all Chinese goods if he wins the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Overseas firms dependent on U.S. markets, such as automakers, would also be wary of the heightened possibility of Trump's return given the "myriad" of tariff-related policies he imposed during his previous term, said Lee Jae-il, analyst at Eugene Investment &amp; Securities.</p>

<p>"Trump, like a trade war maniac, might not just target China but impose tariffs against other countries as well under the concept of American exceptionalism," added Stephen Lee, chief economist at Meritz Securities in Seoul.</p>

<p><strong>WAR IN UKRAINE</strong></p>

<p>In Europe, Trump's criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and demands that other members pay more dominated his previous administration. His scepticism towards NATO is causing further anxiety this time, as Russian's war in Ukraine has brought conflict to the bloc's doorstep.</p>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz previously cheered on Biden's prospects for re-election. But on Friday a senior defence figure in the ruling coalition lamented Biden's performance and urged Democrats to find another candidate.</p>

<p>"The fact that a man like Trump could become president again because the Democrats are unable to put up a strong candidate against him would be a historic tragedy that the whole world would feel," Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, of the liberal FDP party, told the Rheinische Post paper.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Scholz did not comment on the specifics of the debate, but stressed the chancellor valued Biden highly and that Scholz had never spoken to Trump as their terms did not overlap.</p>

<p>During the debate, Trump accused Biden of not standing up to China on trade. He also said China's Xi Jinping, North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin "don't respect" Biden and that he was driving the country "into World War Three".</p>

<p>Biden retorted by saying Trump's tariff proposals would result in higher costs for American consumers, and that he "cuddles up" to the likes of Kim and Putin.</p>

<p>Putin has said it made little difference to Russia who was in the White House, and on Friday the Kremlin declined comment on what it said was an internal U.S. matter.</p>

<p>U.S. allies including Japan and Germany have in any case started laying the groundwork for a possible Trump return in recent months.</p>

<p>"The possibility of a Trump comeback may have increased. High tariffs and support for Ukraine will also bring about major changes," said Kazuhiro Maeshima from the Sophia University in Tokyo.</p>

<p>"The Japanese government has also been anticipating various developments in the event of a Trump and has been gradually taking steps to deal with them, including making contact with people close to Trump."</p>

<p><strong>'TRUMP 2.0'</strong></p>

<p>In Sydney, several Australian officials and experts had attended a workshop titled "Trump 2.0" as the debate was aired.</p>

<p>"The overwhelming feeling from today is that it was a disaster for Biden," said Peter Dean, a professor at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney who was at the workshop.</p>

<p>"The mood has changed considerably after the debate and the general view is that if you weren't preparing for a Trump 2.0 then that is the smart play and the smart move now."</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour party and the frontrunner in an election due next week, was asked on BBC radio if he was concerned about Biden after the debate.</p>

<p>"I've got enough on my hands with our own election campaign at the moment...The relationship between the UK and the US is strong, it's historic, and obviously, it's above the individuals," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A historic letter written by Albert Einstein to President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1939, urging the US to develop a nuclear program, is set to be auctioned for at least $4 million.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A historic letter written by Albert Einstein to former US President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1939 is going up for auction. The letter urged the US to develop its own nuclear programme in fear that Nazi Germany might be on the path to creating atomic bombs, according to the <em>BBC.</em></p>

<p>The letter is part of a collection belonging to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and will be sold alongside other artefacts.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-ak-47-emerged-as-weapon-of-the-century-5895531">Also Read | How AK-47 Emerged As 'Weapon Of The Century'</a></strong></p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxxxx1w9znko">news outlet</a>, the letter urged the US to initiate its own nuclear program. President Roosevelt responded by establishing a committee, a precursor to the Manhattan Project led by J Robert Oppenheimer.</p>

</div>

<p>This project ultimately produced the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, closing World War II but also opening the door to the nuclear age.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/3-99-store-vase-turns-out-to-be-2-000-year-old-mayan-artifact-5947824"><strong>Also Read | $3.99 Store Vase Turns Out To Be 1,800-Year-Old Mayan Artifact</strong></a></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/style/albert-einstein-letter-fdr-auction-paul-allen-estate-12c80eb2?mod=hp_listc_pos3"><em>Wall Street Journal,</em></a> Christie's plans to ask for at least $4 million for this two-page, typed letter, which is dated August 2, 1939, and begins bluntly. "Sir, recent work in nuclear physics has made it probable that uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy."</p>

<p>The letter isn't likely to break the $13 million record set in 2021 for one of Einstein's few surviving records detailing his theory of general relativity. But the record for any letter by Einstein is $2.8 million set in 2018 for a letter in which the physicist ruminates on God and religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group rose as much as nearly 13% in premarket trading on Friday after President Joe Biden's faltering performance against Republican rival Donald Trump at the first 2024 U.S. presidential debate.</p>

<p>Biden delivered a shaky, halting performance while Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks at the debate on Thursday, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged personal insults ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>"Investors are probably going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt given how positive he was for markets in his presidency," said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at digital brokerage eToro.</p>

<p>"If you're looking for a real-time proxy of investor expectations for the result in November, they're (Trump stocks) telling you that Trump is in pole position for this election, and he's cemented his perceived lead last night."</p>

<p>Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), which owns Trump's social media platform Truth Social, was last up 7.3% at $39.54, while software developer Phunware, which worked on Trump's 2020 election campaign app, climbed 8.1% to $6.81.</p>

<p>Shares of video-sharing platform Rumble, popular with conservatives, edged up 0.5% to $5.7.</p>

<p>TMTG's shares have jumped about 110% this year as Trump gained momentum in his bid to become the Republican candidate in the election. The stock however came under pressure earlier this month after a jury found Trump guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star.</p>

<p>Trump owned 64.9% of TMTG as of June 10, which is worth about $6.5 billion as of last close.</p>

<p>He had vowed to stick exclusively with Truth Social after being banned by Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.</p>

<p>However, Trump returned to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, months after his ban was reversed by new owner Elon Musk.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Princess Anne, the sister of Britain's King Charles III, has been discharged from hospital where she was treated for concussion after being struck by a horse at her country estate.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, suffered concussion and minor head injuries at Gatcombe Park in southwestern England on Sunday evening and was taken to hospital in Bristol.</p>

<p>It is believed she was struck by a horse as she was walking within the protected perimeter of the sprawling estate, which hosts equestrian events.</p>

<p>The princess's medical team said at the time her injuries were consistent with a potential impact from a horse's head or legs.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, as she is also known, is a skilled horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and has a reputation as the hardest-working royal.</p>

<p>She has stepped in to represent Charles while he postponed public engagements during his cancer treatment, and rode at his official birthday parade earlier this month.</p>

<p>But the accident forced her to withdraw from an appearance at a state banquet on Tuesday evening for visiting Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and cancel an upcoming trip to Canada.</p>

<p>Her husband Tim Laurence was seen earlier in the week leaving Southmead Hospital in Bristol after visiting his wife.</p>

<p>He thanked the medical team at Southmead Hospital "for their care, expertise and kindness during my wife's short stay".</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace said on Monday that Anne was in hospital "as a precautionary measure for observation and was expected to make a full and swift recovery".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy who dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses earlier, has now taken a jibe at US President Joe Biden for his re-run.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy who dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses earlier, has now taken a jibe at US President Joe Biden for his re-run, and said that the debates should use commercial breaks to swap in real Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy's remarks came as the debate between Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, hosted by CNN concluded on Thursday night (local time).</p>

<p>Taking to X, Ramaswamy said, "The game is now more obvious than ever: the Democrat Party served up an old man as their sacrificial lamb tonight."</p>

<p>"They should use the commercial break to swap in the real Democratic nominee," he went on to say.</p>

<p>Slamming Biden for his Presidential candidacy, and the performance during Thursday night debate, Ramaswamy said, "The only time Biden came remotely close to life in the debate is when he's talking about Trump's conviction and J6. Turns out he doesn't give a damn about the things Americans actually care about."</p>

<p>He further added saying, "They didn't drug up Biden. They lobotomized him instead."</p>

<p>Ramaswamy, who was himself a contender for the White House run, said he was "shocked by Biden's brain-dead performance" in the President debate.</p>

<p>"The fact that anyone is shocked by Biden's brain-dead performance tonight is a scathing indictment of the media which has gone to great lengths to cover this fact up for the public," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>On several analysts calling for replacing Biden as the nominee for Democrats, the Indian-American entrepreneur recalled how everyone called his message to the Democracy party of Biden purring an end to his candidature, as a "conspiracy theory."</p>

<p>"The media dismissed it as a "conspiracy theory" when I called for Biden to end his candidacy last fall. 8 months later, they're starting to call for it themselves," Ramaswamy wrote on X.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy had finished fourth in Iowa, according to CNN News projections, well behind Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.</p>

<p>The Iowa caucus victory was considered the first step in Donald Trump's bid to claim the Republican nomination in a third consecutive election.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden launched his re-election campaign in April 2023, describing the contest between him and Trump as a "stark choice" for voters between the continuation of democracy in America and its possible "destruction" under Trump.</p>

<p>He is the oldest president to ever hold office and would be 86 at the end of a second term. Polling shows that voters are far more concerned about Biden's age than his opponent's. But if Trump wins, he would break Biden's record as the oldest president before the end of his term.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump launched his bid to reclaim the White House in November 2022. He aims to reclaim the White House after his bitter exit in 2020, as he looks forward to becoming only the second commander-in-chief to win two non-consecutive terms in office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian student was arrested and deported after it came to light that he falsified documents to obtain a full scholarship. Aryan Anand, a student at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, boasted about building “his life and career on lies” in a now-deleted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1axnhdz/deleted_by_user/ ">Reddit post</a>, which was later flagged by a platform moderator.</p>

<p>Anand made a stunning confession about how he forged his class 10 board exam results and used fraudulent means to secure admission to a US college with a full scholarship.</p>

<p>It included fabricating transcripts, essays and even the death certificate of his father, who is alive. After successfully deceiving his way into college, the 19-year-old admitted he lost interest in his studies, turned to heavy drinking and cheated in exams to maintain his scholarship. He also faked internships to earn money.</p>

<p>Anand was arrested two months ago and faced up to 20 years in prison for felony counts of forgery and theft of services, reported <a href="http://https://6abc.com/post/post-reddit-unveils-lehigh-university-student-aryan-anands/14999668/ ">6ABC</a>. However, at the request of university officials, he was expelled and deported to India instead.</p>

<p>Lehigh University, in a statement, said, “We appreciate the report and the thorough investigation that brought this matter to light.”</p>

<p>Michael Weinert, Northampton County Assistant DA, explained how the Reddit moderator connected Anand to Lehigh University. “The defendant only had one other university that he followed, which was Lehigh University. So, the moderator reached out to Lehigh to give them a heads up,” Mr Weinert said, as per 6ABC.</p>

<p>Mr Weinert praised Lehigh University's thorough investigation, saying, “It was challenging to verify the facts, but Lehigh and their police force did an excellent job of digging deep and uncovering the truth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polls in Iran opened on Friday for a presidential election following the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.</p>

<p>Around 61 million Iranians are eligible to vote in the polls where reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, hopes for a breakthrough win against a divided conservative camp.</p>

<p>The Guardian Council, which vets candidates, allowed him to run against a field of conservatives now dominated by parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.</p>

<p>Also left in contention is cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi after two ultraconservatives dropped out -- Tehran major Alireza Zakani and Raisi's former vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi.</p>

<p>"We start the elections" for the country's 14th presidential ballot, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said in a televised address.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his ballot shortly after the polls opened and urged Iranians to vote.</p>

<p>"Election day is a day of joy and happiness for us Iranians," he said in a televised speech where he also called for a high turnout.</p>

<p>"We encourage our dear people to take the issue of voting seriously and participate," he said.</p>

<p>The election in sanctions-hit Iran comes at a time of high regional tensions between the Islamic Republic and its arch-foes Israel and the United States as the Gaza war rages on.</p>

<p>Polls opened at 8:00 am (0430 GMT) in 58,640 stations across the country, mostly in schools and mosques.</p>

<p>Polling stations will be open for 10 hours, though authorities could extend voting time as in previous elections.</p>

<p>Early projections of the results are expected by Saturday morning and official results by Sunday.</p>

<p>If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, a second round will be held on July 5, for only the second time in Iranian electoral history after the 2005 vote went to a runoff.</p>

<p>The candidacy of Pezeshkian, until recently a relative unknown, has revived cautious hopes for Iran's reformist wing after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps.</p>

<p>Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, praised him as "honest, fair, and caring".</p>

<p>Khatami, who served from 1997 to 2005, had also endorsed the moderate Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidency and sealed Iran's nuclear deal in 2015 with Western powers before it was derailed three years later.</p>

<h3><strong>'Resolve our problems'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Iranian opposition, particularly the Iranian expatriates, has called for a boycott of the vote.</p>

<p>Ultimate political power in Iran is held by Khamenei, the supreme leader.</p>

<p>Khamenei insisted this week that "the most qualified candidate" must be "the one who truly believes in the principles of the Islamic Revolution" of 1979 that overthrew the US-backed monarchy.</p>

<p>The next president, he said, must allow Iran "to move forward without being dependent on foreign countries".</p>

<p>However, Khamenei also said that Iran should not "cut its relations with the world".</p>

<p>During campaign debates, Jalili criticised the moderates for having signed the 2015 nuclear accord which promised Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on the programme.</p>

<p>Jalili said the deal, which the United States withdrew from in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump, "did not benefit Iran at all".</p>

<p>Pezeshkian has urged efforts to salvage the agreement and lift crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy.</p>

<p>"Are we supposed to be eternally hostile to America, or do we aspire to resolve our problems with this country?" he asked.</p>

<p>The contentious issue of compulsory head covering for women also emerged during the campaign, almost two years since a vast protest movement swept the country after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22.</p>

<p>An Iranian Kurd, Amini had been arrested for an alleged violation of the country's strict dress code for women.</p>

<p>In the televised debates, all candidates distanced themselves from the sometimes heavy-handed police arrests of women refusing to wear the hijab head covering in public.</p>

<p>Pourmohammadi, the only clerical candidate, said that "under no circumstances should we treat Iranian women with such cruelty."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck off the coast of central Peru on Friday, the United States Geological Survey said, but a tsunami threat from the tremor has passed.</p>

<p>The USGS said the tremor hit 8.8 kilometers (5.5 miles) from Atiquipa district, raising an initial magnitude rating soon after the quake was reported.</p>

<p>The USGS said that strong shaking from the quake would have been felt in areas near the epicenter.</p>

<p>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had earlier said "hazardous tsunami waves are forecast for some coasts" but later said the threat had passed.</p>

<p>"There is no longer a tsunami threat from this earthquake," it said.</p>

<p>Peru, with some 33 million inhabitants, lies on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a vast area of intense seismic activity that runs along the west coast of the Americas.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The co-founder of OceanGate, which conducted a fatal excursion to the Titanic last year, is set to embark on a new journey. Guillermo Sohnlein plans to study a "virtually unexplored" sinkhole in the Bahamas, which is dubbed as "portal to hell" by the locals. According to <em>New York Post</em>, Mr Sohnlein plans to descend in a submersible into the Dean's Blue Hole, one of the world's deepest ocean sinkholes. He will be joined by scientist Kenny Broad and chief medical officer and former NASA astronaut Scott Parazynski, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/25/us-news/oceangate-co-founder-to-lead-dive-into-deans-blue-hole-in-bahamas/">the outlet further said</a>.</p>

<p>"Dean's Blue Hole remains virtually unexplored, offering an opportunity to discover the hidden secrets of cave-dwelling species, geological climate history and unique ecosystems," according to a page on <a href="https://bluemarbleexploration.com/abyss/">the company's website</a>.</p>

<p>Dean's Blue Hole is a 664-foot underwater cavern surrounded by a beach on a remote Bahaman island, according to Blue Marble. It formed some 15,000 years ago and, due to its extreme depth, very little is known about it.</p>

<p>The sinkhole is shaped like a vase with a narrow opening near the surface that leads to much wider water body below.</p>

<p>Scientists believe the chamber below is connected to the Atlantic Ocean, something that the company says will offer a "certain amount of unpredictability".</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges will be to manage the pressure on the ocean floor, which will be considerably high as compared to the surface.</p>

<p>"We fully expect to find human remains and prepare to handle those situations with proper respect for the families," the <em>Post</em> quoted the company as saying. However, the date when the expedition will start has not been announced.</p>

<p>Mr Sohnlein founded OceanGate in 2009 with Stockton Rush - who was one of the five killed when the Titan submersible imploded last June - but left and started another deep-sea exploration company, Blue Marble Exploration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's military on Friday released a video that it said showed a North Korean missile abnormally spiralling early in flight and exploding, a rare publicising of surveillance footage to dismiss the North's claim of a successful test.</p>

<p>Footage filmed by a thermal observation device with South Korean frontline units showed a projectile spiralling out of control on an irregular flight path, then disintegrating.</p>

<p>The South Korean military assessed that "instability during flight" led to the missile's explosion, it said in a statement on Friday, calling North Korea's claims of success as "deception and exaggeration to cover up the failure".</p>

<p>North Korean state media had said that Pyongyang successfully conducted an important test on Wednesday aimed at developing missiles able to deploy multiple warheads, a claim rejected by South Korea.</p>

<p>North Korea's missile administration used the first-stage engine of a solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile to test the separation and guidance of multiple warheads, according to the North's official KCNA news agency.</p>

<p>South Korea's military said it had detected signs of missile launch preparations early on Wednesday and was watching as the rocket was launched.</p>

<p>In April, Pyongyang said it had tested a new solid-fuel hypersonic missile with intermediate range, part of an intensifying race for the next generation of long-range rockets hard to track and intercept.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Donald Trump squared off Thursday in a debate watched by millions, and what voters saw may have sparked more questions than answers.</p>

<p>Here are five takeaways from the Atlanta showdown.</p>

<h3><strong>Dems, we have a problem&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Biden -- diagnosed with a cold, according to his campaign -- looked all of his 81 years onstage, speaking in a halting, hoarse voice and missing key opportunities to forcefully and coherently push back against Trump.</p>

<p>While the veteran Democrat showed occasional spark, he mostly appeared lackluster. The post-debate analysis came in quickly -- and it was devastating.</p>

<p>"It was an unmitigated disaster," University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato told AFP.</p>

<p>"This debate is a problem," added Princeton University professor Julian Zelizer, saying Biden's supporters "are going to be extremely concerned how this unfolded."</p>

<p>Trump at times looked more authoritative and energetic, although he unleashed a barrage of falsehoods about Biden's presidency, election fraud, and abortion policy.</p>

<h3><strong>A more disciplined Trump&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Of the two candidates, it was Trump who may have surprised viewers, by showing a more restrained, civil side to his normal political bulldozing. Host CNN turned the microphones off unless a candidate was asked a question, a move experts say benefited the challenger.</p>

<p>When Biden railed against Trump, for example, for having "encouraged" rioters to storm the US Capitol in early 2021, Trump largely held his tongue, looking down or shaking his head.</p>

<p>And when it was his turn to speak, he pounced.</p>

<p>"Trump's somewhat tempered and authoritative demeanor -- at least for him -- masked a number of mistruths he made throughout the night and helped him appeal to swing voters on top polling issues like the economy and the border," Ashley Koning, director of the Rutgers Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>It's personal&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The debate, which began without a handshake, left no doubt these men did not like one another. From Biden's blasting his rival as "a convicted felon" to Trump musing that "I don't think (Biden) knows what he said," the personal animus was glaring.</p>

<p>"You have the morals of an alley cat," Biden hissed after laying out Trump's various legal challenges and verdicts against him.</p>

<p>"You're the sucker, you're the loser," Biden said.</p>

<p>Trump punched back, saying "Everything he does is a lie."</p>

<p>"He's the worst president in the history of our country," Trump fumed.</p>

<h3><strong>Less chaos, less accountability&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The helter-skelter tumult of their first 2020 debate, in which then-president Trump ran roughshod over Biden and the debate moderators, was but a memory Thursday night, as CNN's strategy to avoid a shouting match worked.</p>

<p>"I think the rules may have aided Trump because they prevented him from yelling over Biden's answers," said Robert Rowland, a communications professor at Kansas University.</p>

<p>With no studio audience cheering or jeering, both candidates had greater opportunities to focus on the issues.</p>

<p>And with CNN moderators failing to offer real-time fact checks during the debate, Trump and to a lesser degree Biden were unrestrained in making misleading or false statements on a variety of topics, from immigration and crime to the economy.</p>

<h3><strong>Ominous tone&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's couched response to a key question near the debate's end offered a concerning look into the post-election future.</p>

<p>Moderators asked Trump three times whether the Republican would accept the results of the vote before he finally addressed the question directly, saying "If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely."</p>

<p>But in the same breath, he repeated his baseless claims about 2020 vote rigging or interference, saying "the fraud and everything else was ridiculous."</p>

<p>Biden suggested even Trump's conditional response should not be trusted. "I doubt that you'll accept it because you're such a whiner," Biden said</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laughing and joking, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un cruised around Pyongyang last week in a Russian-made Aurus limousine to showcase their strengthened anti-Western alliance.</p>

<p>The luxury sedan was intended to epitomize Russia's domestic prowess and reduce dependence on imported technology and goods when unveiled in 2018.</p>

<p>But customs records show that the company that builds it uses millions of dollars in imported parts, many arriving in Russia from what Kim has described as his country's "primary foe", South Korea.</p>

<p>The imports point to Russia's ongoing reliance on Western technology as it seeks to navigate Western attempts to cut it off from global supply chains as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The two leaders took turns driving the armoured limousine during Putin's pomp-filled visit, his first in nearly a quarter of a century to North Korea, in a demonstration of the two nuclear powers' increasingly close ties.</p>

<p>Russia imported equipment and components worth at least $34 million between 2018 and 2023 for assembling Aurus cars and motorcycles, customs records seen by Reuters showed. Reuters does not have access to more recent data.</p>

<p>The imports included car body parts, sensors, programmable controllers, switches, welding equipment, and other components worth almost $15.5 million imported from South Korea. Parts were also imported from China, India, Turkey, Italy, and other EU countries.</p>

<p>Foreign supplies for Aurus kept coming after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with goods worth almost $16 million, including $5 million produced in South Korea, imported since February 2022, the records showed.</p>

<p>Reuters could not determine specifically which imported foreign parts ended up in the car gifted to Kim, and the imports were not in breach of sanctions - Aurus LLC was sanctioned by the United States in February 2024.</p>

<p>The Aurus sedan was developed by Russian state-owned research institute NAMI in partnership with Russian carmaker Sollers, which has since sold its stake.</p>

<p>Aurus Motors and its CEO Andrey Pankov did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the use of foreign parts, including from South Korea, in its vehicles.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Growing Production</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p>The company launched official production in Russia's Tatarstan region, around 1,000 km (620 miles) from Moscow, in 2021 - before then it was made on a small, experimental scale at NAMI. It will start additional production in St Petersburg later this year at Toyota's former factory.</p>

<p>Toyota is one of many foreign carmakers to exit the Russian market since the invasion, which Russia calls a "special military operation".</p>

<p>The exodus has left a gap that Chinese producers have been quick to fill, rapidly seizing more than half the market share and exposing Russia's limited domestic production capacity.</p>

<p>South Korean firms were among the largest suppliers to Aurus, including industrial equipment producer Kyungki Industrial Co, car body parts manufacturer BYT CO LTD, and batteries supplier Enertech International Inc.</p>

<p>Italian plastic parts producer Industrie Ilpea Spa and Hong Kong company Rain Electronics also supplied goods.</p>

<p>An official at Kyungki Industrial Co confirmed that the company has supplied parts to Aurus LLC and continues to do so. The company is not concerned about any potential sanctions, the official said, declining to give further details.</p>

<p>Rain Electronics could not be reached for comment. When a Reuters correspondent visited the address listed on the internet as the company's office in Hong Kong, there was no trace of Rain Electronics on the floor listed online or in the office building.</p>

<p>BYT CO LTD, Enertech International, and Industrie Ilpea Spa did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Aurus Senat, retro-styled after the Soviet-era ZIL limousine, is Russia's official presidential car and was used by Putin at his presidential inaugurations in 2018 and 2024.</p>

<p>Putin has now given Kim, believed to be a keen automobile fan, two Aurus cars, first during Kim's visit to Russia in February, and a slightly different model in North Korea in June.</p>

<p>Prices for Aurus cars - there are four models including an SUV and an armoured version - start from 46.625 million roubles ($528,356). Customers include Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdymukhamedov.</p>

<p>Aurus sold 107 cars in Russia in 2023, according to data from Russian analytical agency Autostat. Aurus does not disclose production numbers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for the US Presidential poll, accused President and Democratic candidate Joe Biden of taking money from China and called him a "Manchurian candidate" during their first presidential debate on Thursday. Held at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta, the debate kicked off the 2024 election cycle.</p>

<p>Trump said that the US currently has "the largest deficit in the history" of the country. "We have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He's a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China," Trump said during the heated debate.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Trump: "He gets money from China. He's a Manchurian candidate."<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The term "Manchurian candidate" appears to be a reference to Frank Sinatra's 1962 film of the same name. The movie tells the story of Raymond Shaw, an American soldier captured and brainwashed by communist forces to become a sleeper agent and carry out a political assassination.</p>

<p>Frank Sinatra plays Major Bennett Marco, Shaw's commanding officer, who starts uncovering the sinister plot through disturbing nightmares. The film was remade in 2004 with Denzel Washington taking on the role of Major Bennett Marco.</p>

<p>The two presidential candidates clashed on various issues, including the economy, abortion, and immigration, during the high-stakes debate.</p>

<p>President Biden, 81, began with a rapid-fire critique of Trump's presidency, stumbling over his words several times. The Republican nominee, 78, seized on Biden's phrasing, laying the blame for the Ukraine war squarely at his feet.</p>

<p>"If we had a leader, this is a war that never should have started."</p>

<p>He accused Biden of giving "$200 billion or more to Ukraine", claiming that it was a lot of money and that there never has been "anything like it".</p>

<br />
Trump also accused Biden of siding with Palestinians in the Gaza conflict, claiming he refused to support Israel against Hamas. “He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian - but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian. He's a weak one,” Trump said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook owner Meta is considering blocking news content from the platform in Australia if the government makes it pay licensing fees, a company representative told a parliamentary hearing on Friday.</p>

<p>Meta's regional policy director Mia Garlick told lawmakers "All options are on the table" when asked if the company would block Australians from sharing news content to avoid paying fees.</p>

<p>"There's a large number of channels that people can get news content from," Garlick told the inquiry.</p>

<p>She said Meta was waiting for Canberra to decide if it would apply an untested 2021 law that gives the government the right to set the fees U.S. tech giants pay media outlets for links.</p>

<p>The comments are the strongest indication so far that Meta would take the same hardline approach in Australia as it took in Canada in 2023 when that country introduced similar laws.</p>

<p>Meta struck deals with Australian media firms including News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp when the law was brought in Australia, but has since said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024.</p>

<p>It now falls on Australia's assistant treasurer to decide whether to step in and force Facebook to pay for news content. The assistant treasurer has said he is still collecting advice but that Meta seems to respect the law only when it suits.</p>

<p>Asked if blocking news from Facebook in Australia would amount to sidestepping the law, Garlick said taking that action would be complying with it.</p>

<p>"Every other law - tax laws, safety laws, privacy laws - we work to comply with," she said. "It's just compliance would look slightly different in relation to this law if it's fully enacted."</p>

<p>Garlick defended Meta's processes for Australians to complain if they believed the company was spreading harmful misinformation or scams, although she said its content moderation centres were all in other countries.</p>

<p>Asked about Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, who is suing Meta for showing cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring his face, Garlick said the company had processes in place to detect and stop scams, but "there are a lot of challenges".</p>

<p>How could Meta call itself an advertising business when "some ads sell lies", asked Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.</p>

<p>"We have policies and systems and tools to do everything we can to prevent those ads," Garlick replied.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Donald Trump traded barbs Thursday in the first debate of the 2024 election campaign.</p>

<p>AFP fact-checked what the candidates said on key issues.</p>

<p><strong>'Migrant crime'</strong></p>

<p>Trump falsely claimed that under Biden, "we don't have borders anymore."</p>

<p>"Because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen. We call it 'migrant crime.' I call it 'Biden migrant crime.'"</p>

<p>Following criticism over record border crossings and a bipartisan immigration bill that faltered in Congress, Biden signed an executive order early this month to temporarily shut down the border to asylum seekers after certain daily limits are hit.</p>

<p>That has amounted to "increased enforcement at the border," according to Nicole Hallett, director of the University of Chicago Law School's Immigrants' Rights Clinic.</p>

<p>Despite a few high-profile incidents, including the killing of a university student in the state of Georgia, there is "no evidence" of the migrant crime wave Trump described, Hallett told AFP.</p>

<p>"Crime is down across the country, even as migration has increased," she said.</p>

<p>Violent and property crimes are near the lowest levels in decades, according to FBI data from 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.</p>

<p>"The overwhelming majority of violent crimes are committed by citizens," said Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Fagan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A June 2023 study found a decline in incarceration rates among immigrants from all regions since 1960.</p>

<p>Other research has also found migrants commit fewer violent crimes than US citizens -- including a Cato Institute report published this week that found migrants are less likely to be convicted of murder in the state of Texas.</p>

<p>Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, said there is also no evidence to support Trump's claims during the debate that prisoners and people from mental institutions are flooding across the southern US border.</p>

<p><strong>Inflation blame </strong></p>

<p>Both Trump and Biden sought to defer blame for rising prices by criticizing each other's economic policies.</p>

<p>"He causes inflation. I gave him a country with essentially no inflation," Trump said after reciting his favorite -- but false -- line about ushering in the greatest economy in US history.</p>

<p>Biden countered by saying Trump "decimated the economy" and there were "no jobs" when he took office.</p>

<p>Both candidates misled by omitting the impact of Covid-19 on the economy.</p>

<p>When Trump left office, inflation was around 1.4 percent as the country continued to battle the virus.</p>

<p>Unemployment was about 6.4 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, down from its peak of 14.8 percent in April 2020 after the outbreak.</p>

<p>Inflation started to climb in April 2021 as the country opened up. It continued to balloon under Biden's presidency, hitting a peak of around nine percent in June 2022 before falling to its current level of about three percent.</p>

<p>Several pandemic-related factors have contributed to that trend, including emergency spending packages under both Trump and Biden, a supply crunch and the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>Rewriting January 6 </strong></p>

<p>Trump attempted to deflect blame for the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, over which he was impeached, by pointing to former House speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>"I offered her 10,000 soldiers, or National Guard, and she turned them down," he falsely claimed.</p>

<p>Pelosi's team has denied being made aware of any request for National Guard assistance until the Capitol was under siege by Trump supporters seeking to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>In fact, Pelosi would not have even had the authority to reject the National Guard's activation had Trump authorized it.</p>

<p>The District of Columbia National Guard "reports only to the president," its website says.</p>

<p>Trump's claim traces back to remarks from former acting defense secretary Christopher Miller, who told a reporter that he recalled Trump floating the idea before January 6 of needing 10,000 troops.</p>

<p>But Miller later told lawmakers that "there was no order from the president."</p>

<p>The House committee that investigated the January 6 attack wrote in its final report that Trump "never gave any order to deploy the National Guard."</p>

<p>Trump also insisted again that "the fraud and everything else was ridiculous" in the 2020 election he lost to Biden -- claims officials from both parties have refuted.</p>

<p>Dozens of lawsuits aimed at overturning the election failed, while audits and recounts in battleground states reaffirmed Biden's win.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump faced off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 race. Below are reactions from lawmakers, political analysts, strategists and leaders of advocacy groups:</p>

<p><strong>Kamala Harris, Vice President</strong></p>

<p>"What we saw tonight is the president making a very clear contrast with Donald Trump on all the issues that matter to the American people. Yes it was a slow start but it was a strong finish," Harris told CNN when asked about concerns that Biden should step aside.</p>

<p>"People can debate on style points but ultimately this election ... has to be about substance," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I've been watching the last three-and-a-half years of performance."</p>

<p><strong>Top Biden Donor, Who Did Not Wish To Be Named</strong></p>

<p>"There is no way to spin this. His performance was disqualifying. There is going to be a call for a brokered convention. Whitmer, Pritzker, Newsom, Beshear. Those could all be the options. It's inevitable."</p>

<p>The donor added that it would likely come down to Jill Biden to convince him. "He (Biden) is a stubborn guy ... It cannot be described how bad this performance was."</p>

<p>The donor said they thought Andy Beshear, the popular Democratic governor of Kentucky, a deeply Republican state at the federal level, would be the likely winner.</p>

<p>"He won red Kentucky. He'll be a great candidate who can still bring this home. I don't think Newsom (Democratic governor of California) will win."</p>

<p>Fundraising will "dry up," the donor predicted. "Money follows enthusiasm. How can anyone with a straight face say donate to elect Joe? ... I will continue to fundraise for him. What else can we all do? There is no option."</p>

<p><strong>Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock</strong></p>

<p>"I would be concerned if the president didn't have a record to run on, but the fact of the matter is this is a man who's passed historic legislation," Warnock said after the debate.</p>

<p>Julian Castro, Former Hud Secretary Under President Barack Obama</p>

<p>"Tonight was completely predictable. Biden had a very low bar going into the debate and failed to clear even that bar," Castro said on social media network X. "He seemed unprepared, lost, and not strong enough to parry effectively with Trump, who lies constantly."</p>

<p><strong>Amy Walter, Editor-In-Chief Of The Cook Political Report And A Prominent Political Analyst</strong></p>

<p>The debate "only served to remind voters of Biden's weaknesses, especially his health and stamina," Walters said. "To be sure, Trump did not 'win' this debate as much as Biden lost it. Trump lobbed multiple falsehoods and lies. He failed to make a positive case for his second term, spending more time litigating Biden's failures. But, Trump is leading in the polls and doesn't need a 'rest' in the way Biden does."</p>

<p>"I don't think that this debate will sway undecided voters, especially those who say they dislike both candidates. If you came into this debate thinking both men were unsatisfactory choices, their debate performances did not disabuse you of this opinion."</p>

<p><strong>Mitch Landrieu, Biden Campaign Co-Chair</strong></p>

<p>"Well, I thought it was a really bare-knuckled brawl. I think they're right, the president started off slow, but then he came back," Landrieu said on NBC News.</p>

<p>Landrieu acknowledged that the physical performance aspect of the debate will be top of people's minds. "But when you get into the substance of what was said, I think the takeaway from this was that Joe Biden was right on the substance. He told the truth."</p>

<p><strong>Matt Grossmann, Political Science Professor At Michigan State University</strong></p>

<p>"Obviously the biggest factor is that Biden still seemed old and raspy and less coherent than when he ran last time, and that's going to be the big story, I think, out of the debate. I don't think Trump really did anything to help himself beyond his existing supporters, but I think it is eclipsed by people's impressions of Biden on his biggest vulnerability."</p>

<p>Grossmann said that from the beginning of the debate Biden had trouble getting his points across "and just seemed a lot softer." He said Biden didn't really start delivering effective answers until 20 minutes into the debate. "It's hard to recover from that."</p>

<p>Grossmann said that debates typically have a small impact on presidential races and that impact dissipates over time. "Debates do not normally have huge influence on election results. But because we're at this 50-50 election where the country is divided, any small change can make a difference."</p>

<p>Grossmann said one problem for Biden is that some of his supporters are expressing their concerns about his performance rather than defending it. "So there's not a message in his favor. And to the extent that it has an influence, the influence will be to make people's concerns about Biden's age even more salient."</p>

<p><strong>Tevi Troy, Bipartisan Policy Center Fellow And Presidential Historian:</strong></p>

<p>Overall the debate "is going to be a problem for Biden," Troy said. Biden had a lot of answers where he looked weak. "There were other answers where he was more solid, but it doesn't matter because the problematic answers are going to live on through Twitter and social media."</p>

<p>Trump on the other hand was "more restrained" than in previous debates, Troy said. The rules of the debate where they shut off the mics "actually helped him (Trump) so he wasn't interrupting and didn't seem quite as rude."</p>

<p>"There's the phenomenon of the double haters, where people like neither candidate ... One guy's crazy, the other guy's too old. They were definitely validated in thinking the one guy is too old, and in terms of the crazy I think Trump did dial it down."</p>

<p><strong>Adrianne Shropshire, Executive Director Of Blackpac, An Organization That Works To Mobilize Black Voters</strong></p>

<p>Shropshire said she wrote down two things in her notepad while watching the debate. "One is that Trump lies," she said. The other was that Biden "was not as forceful as I thought he needed to be."</p>

<p>Shropshire criticized the moderators for allowing Trump to make various false claims without any pushback. "Trump was essentially allowed to do what he does at his rallies, which is say whatever he wants, regardless of the relationship it has to the truth. And that was really unfortunate."</p>

<p>Shropshire said Biden could have pushed back on Trump's false claims more forcefully. "I think he tried to take the high road by talking policy. And I think that has its place. But when we think about where our politics are right now, there really is a need to just assert facts and assert them very clearly. And I think that got muddled a bit in his policy responses."</p>

<p>Shropshire said she was not as worried as others who have said Biden had an unsteady performance that could increase about his age. "He has great performances that people have talked about just in the past few months," she said. "I also think that it just doesn't change the dynamics of the race, because they also saw Trump standing next to Joe Biden, and I don't think that they saw someone who was stronger necessarily. I think they saw the same unhinged Trump that they see at every rally and in clips when they're on social media."</p>

<p>Shropshire said one strong moment for Biden was when he pointed out that Trump was a convicted felon and criticized his morality. She also said that Trump's reference to migrants taking Black jobs had become "a hilarious meme all across Black Twitter right now." She said it showed how Trump was failing to connect with Black voters. "That there are specific Black jobs for Black people that immigrants are coming to take. Utter nonsense."</p>

<p><strong>Waleed Shahid, Senior Democratic Strategist And A Spokesperson For The National Uncommitteed Movement Against Biden</strong></p>

<p>"You can be mad at Biden but honestly the party establishment has been misleading people about Biden's electability. And it's malpractice - political and moral malpractice," Shahid said. "He completely lost the debate and if the strategy is to go into using the same tactics, where they want to recycle the 2016 playbook and make this an election about fact checking, that is not going to win."</p>

<p>Shahid called the debate "a tipping point," adding that "voters aren't stupid."</p>

<p>"I think we'll see what shakes out in a couple of weeks. But if they do end up replacing the candidate, that candidate does need time. So I don't know what will end up happening. I mean, this is unprecedented."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden was left fumbling for words during his first presidential debate against his Republican rival and predecessor Donald Trump. The 81-year-old leader, frequently seen fumbling and freezing during public events, appeared to lose his train of thought while answering a question by a CNN anchor on the economy.</p>

<p>A 30-second video showed the US President failing to make sense as he answered the question. “...making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the with the COVID, excuse me, dealing with everything we have to do with..." the leader paused before making another gaffe by saying, “We finally beat Medicare".&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">YIKES: Joe Biden starts to freeze <a href="https://t.co/AQ7irpCrDf">pic.twitter.com/AQ7irpCrDf</a></p>
— Wendell Husebø (@WendellHusebo) <a href="https://twitter.com/WendellHusebo/status/1806497206033133810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Medicare is a US state health insurance program for people age 65 or older and people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Trump was quick to use the slip-up as an opportunity to hit out at his opponent. “He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death,” he quipped.</p>

<p>The Democrat made yet another mistake while answering a question on voters feeling "worse off" under his presidency</p>

<p>"Unemployment rate rose to 15% [under Trump], it was terrible,” Biden argued. “And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs,” he said, instead of “15 million new jobs.”</p>

<p>During the fiery 90-minute debate, the two leaders traded barbs over the economy, democracy, war and the effect of age on their cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>While stopping at a restaurant for a meal after the debate, Biden told reporters he had a sore throat but "I think we did well."&nbsp;His deputy, Vice President Kamala Harris, admitted to CNN that the president had a slow start. "Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish," she said.</p>

<p>A survey by CNN found that 67 per cent of viewers thought Trump had won the debate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday called for the building of "bridges" in the global economy, as Beijing grapples with economic and security disputes with its neighbours and trading partners around the world.</p>

<p>China will never leave the road of peaceful development, Xi said at a conference commemorating China's guiding principles for foreign affairs first formulated 70 years ago.</p>

<p>China will also not become a "strong" state that would try to dominate others, Xi told conference attendees that included former Myanmar President Thein Sein and former General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party Nong Duc Manh.</p>

<p>"Facing the history of peace or war, prosperity or unity or confrontation, more than ever before, we need to carry forward the spirit and connotation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," Xi said.</p>

<p>The Five Principles first appeared in a 1952 pact reached with regional rival India over their Himalayan border. Even so, Indian officials were absent from the front row of the audience reserved for guests of honour.</p>

<p>Since the 1950s, China's ruling Communist Party has gone from not being recognised by the United Nations to boasting the biggest diplomatic footprint in the world and presiding over the second-biggest economy.</p>

<p>Beijing now signals a desire that other countries see it as a diplomatic heavyweight, even as other countries accuse it of economic coercion and unfair competition.</p>

<p>After China brokered an unexpected detente between Iran and Saudi Arabia last year, Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would continue to play a constructive role in handling global hotspot issues.</p>

<p>But Beijing's unwillingness to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pursuit of a "no-limits partnership" with Moscow present hurdles to that ambition and saw China skip a summit on a peace conference in Switzerland earlier this month.</p>

<p>Rising tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, where Vietnam also has claims, have also led U.S. officials to remind Beijing that the mutual defence treaty obligations it has with the Philippines are ironclad.</p>

<p>China's trade ties with the European Union have also come under strain as the 27-state bloc plans to impose additional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, potentially opening up a new front in the West's tariff war with Beijing which began with Washington's initial import duties in 2018.</p>

<p>The EU accuses China of flooding its market with cheap EVs produced by Chinese automakers that have benefited from heavy state subsidies.</p>

<p>"In the era of economic globalisation, what we need is not to create chasms of division, but to build bridges of communication, and not raise the iron curtain of confrontation but to pave the way of cooperation," Xi said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bad tempered and unedifying US presidential debate between the two oldest candidates ever to run for office degenerated into a squabble over golfing prowess on Thursday.</p>

<p>The first head-to-head in an already painfully long campaign saw 81-year-old Joe Biden and his 78-year-old challenger Donald Trump trade insults and accusations for 90 minutes on prime time television.</p>

<p>There was name-calling: "You're the worst!" "No, YOU'RE the worst!"</p>

<p>There were accusations: "You're a whiner!"</p>

<p>And then they fought over their golf handicaps.</p>

<p>"He can't hit a ball 50 yards," said Trump, on one of the few occasions the two men directly addressed each other.</p>

<p>"He challenged me to a golf match. He can't hit a ball 50 yards."</p>

<p>Trump's own vitality was never in question, he boasted, insisting "I'm in as good a shape as I was years ago."</p>

<p>Not to be outdone over his putting prowess, Biden insisted he was game on the green.</p>

<p>"I'd be happy to have a driving contest," he said. "I got my handicap when I was the vice president down to a six."</p>

<p>Trump scoffed.</p>

<p>"A six handicap?" he snorted. "I've seen your swing. I know your swing."</p>

<p>The exchange came towards the end of the CNN-hosted debate, which had started without the handshake that is customary on such occasions and gone downhill from there.</p>

<p>The animosity between the two men was palpable, with Biden taking an early swing at a man he said had "the morals of an alley cat."</p>

<p>"How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public... for having sex with a porn star... while your wife was pregnant," he said, in reference to Trump's alleged dalliance with adult film actress Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>The Republican former president again denied adultery, but a New York jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to her.</p>

<p>Trump wasted few chances to hammer home his claim that Biden was "weak" and not "a leader."</p>

<p>He also took aim at Biden's perceived mental frailties, an issue that polls repeatedly show voters are concerned about.</p>

<p>"I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know, we made it public," he said.</p>

<p>"He took none. I'd like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one, like go through the first five questions. He couldn't do it."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A halting Joe Biden struggled Thursday to hold off a forceful offensive from Donald Trump as the two traded personal insults in the fiery first debate of a razor-close presidential race.</p>

<p>A bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage. Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was hesitant as he spoke rapidly in a soft, trailing-off voice and stumbled on his words several times.</p>

<p>It was the first debate ever between a president and former president -- and each accused each other of being history's worst. Trump and Biden, who were each the oldest president when first elected, even accused each other of being childlike as they argued over their golf swings.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the CNN headquarters in Atlanta. There was no live audience and their microphones muted as the other spoke -- rules agreed as they open a campaign in a deeply polarized country.</p>

<p>Biden, who was reported to have a cold, hit Trump with clearly rehearsed lines as he sought to remind millions of television viewers that Trump would be the first convicted felon in the White House.</p>

<p>"Think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for, for molesting a woman in public," Biden said, and "for having sex with a porn star on the night, while your wife was pregnant?"</p>

<p>"You have the morals of an alley cat," Biden said.</p>

<p>Trump, a veteran of rallies and reality television, spoke loudly as he rushed through a long list of complaints about Biden's record.</p>

<p>"It's a shame what's happened to our country in the last four years," Trump said "I'm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We're no longer respected."</p>

<p>Trump sought to seize on Biden's delivery, saying at one point, "I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either."</p>

<p>Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden communications director, acknowledged that "it was a really disappointing debate performance" from the president.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is any other way to slice it," she told CNN after the debate.</p>

<p><strong>Attack on economic record</strong></p>

<p>Biden immediately attacked Trump when he was asked about stubborn inflation, saying that he inherited an economy in "freefall."</p>

<p>Trump said that he led "the greatest economy in the history of our country."</p>

<p>"We have never done so well. Everybody was amazed by other countries were copying us," he said.</p>

<p>Biden shot back: "Well, look, the greatest economy in the world? He's the only one who thinks that."</p>

<p>In one of the most personal attacks, Biden cited accounts that Trump had described soldiers who died in the Normandy landing as "suckers" and noted his own son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of cancer.</p>

<p>"My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser," Biden said.</p>

<p>Trump denied the remarks and repeatedly accused Biden of not being coherent.</p>

<p><strong>Clash on world role</strong></p>

<p>On the world stage, Trump accused Biden -- who faces a backlash from parts of his Democratic base over his support for Israel -- of not helping Israel "finish the job" against Hamas.</p>

<p>"He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian -- but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian, he's a weak one," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump described Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan as the "most embarrassing moment in the history of our country" and said it encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine.</p>

<p>Biden, however, noted that he was the first recent president who has not had soldiers at risk overseas.</p>

<p>Trump and Biden also locked horns over abortion and immigration, key issues for their respective bases.</p>

<p>Biden, attacking Trump for appointing justices to the Supreme Court who ended Roe vs. Wade, the decision that allowed abortion rights around the country, said: "It's been a terrible thing, what you've done."</p>

<p>Some Democratic supporters quickly voiced anxiety about Biden's performance.</p>

<p>At a watch party in San Francisco, Hazel Reitz said she would still vote for Biden but added: "I can't understand a word that he says. Isn't it sad?"</p>

<p>Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, said Biden's supporters will be "extremely concerned."</p>

<p>"Biden fueled the basic perception that has continued to overshadow him," he said.</p>

<p>One candidate not on the stage was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the member of the storied political dynasty who is running an anti-establishment campaign but failed to meet CNN's standard of reaching 15 percent in four national polls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kennedy instead spent the 90 minutes of the Biden-Trump debate taking questions on a livestream.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

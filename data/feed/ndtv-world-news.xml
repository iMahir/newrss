       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PM Narendra Modi is headed for his much-anticipated trip to Ukraine after wrapping up his two-day visit to Poland this morning. He is scheduled to meet the Ukrainian PM Volodymyr Zelenskyy, upon whose invite he is visiting the conflict-hit nation-state.</p>

<p>PM Modi's Ukraine visit comes nearly six weeks after he visited Russia to discuss the conflict-ridden situation amid Russia Ukraine. This shall also be an Indian PM's first visit to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal posted on the social media platform X (formerly, Twitter) that PM Modi's visit to Poland after four decades will widen and deepen India-Poland relations.</p>

<p>The UN secretary-general's office said that they hope that the Indian PM's visit to Ukraine might bring up the possibility of putting an end to the war.</p>

<p>Although India has yet to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, PM Modi's statement said, "As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region."</p>

<p>"I look forward to the opportunity to build upon earlier conversations with President Zelenskyy on strengthening bilateral cooperation and share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict. I am confident that the visit will serve as a natural continuation of extensive contacts with the two countries and help create the foundation for stronger and more vibrant relations in the years ahead," it further added.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian PM congratulated PM Modi on his election victory earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica.

<p>She also mentioned that if their late mother was here, she would say how proud she was of her daughter. Then, "without missing a beat, she'd say, 'That's enough. You've got work to do.'"</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Hindus in the US have come together to create “Hindus For Kamala Harris”, a support group for the Democratic presidential nominee, saying she would be good for India, America and the world.</p>

<p>The group has been created “to support Kamala Devi Harris to become the 47th President of the United States of America”, its founding members said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Harris, 59, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2024-national-democratic-convention-day-4-live-kamala-harris-to-give-biggest-speech-of-career-on-final-day-of-dnc-6397465">formally accepted</a> the nomination of the Democratic Party to be its presidential nominee.</p>

<p>“We must help her win. This is the best outcome for America, India and the World! The alternative Trump is a disaster!' one of the members of the group said.</p>

<p>“There is a simple path to victory. Without rejecting the other side, promote Harris candidacy because of what it stands for and the solution it will provide," another member said, adding that the candidacy has a unique momentum to win.</p>

<p>The group is urging Hindus to vote in the elections, display signs of support near their house, and make donations in support of the Harris campaign.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of California sea lions have taken over San Carlos Beach in Monterey, California, prompting local officials to close the area to people.</p>

<p>Caution tape has been put up but crowds are still drawn to the animal spectacle, taking photos of the sea lions as they rest and play on the sand and in the water.</p>

<p>While sea lions, or eared seals, are often seen at certain beaches up and down the California coast, local residents say they have never seen so many of the marine mammals gathered in Monterey.</p>

<p>Lisa Uttal, a marine biologist with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, said it was unclear exactly why the sea lions chose San Carlos Beach, but they may be attracted to the rich diversity in the ecosystem's food supply. Virtually all those gathered on the beach were male, she said.</p>

<p>"They migrate up here down from Ventura and the Channel Islands ... They are incredibly mobile. They're usually chasing the food and because Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is so productive out here, the productivity is really rich," Uttal said.</p>

<p>They were expected to remain on San Carlos Beach for three to four weeks, Uttal said.</p>

<p>Marge Brigadier, a volunteer with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary's Bay Net program, said the sea lions were protected by the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits people from changing the behaviour of the sea lions, meaning that approaching too close or forcing them to flee is a violation.</p>

<p>"People just need to think about how they would feel if they were resting on their bed taking a nap and something big kept coming and chasing them out of the house," Brigadier said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The largest diamond found in more than a century has been unearthed in Botswana at a mine owned by Canadian firm Lucara Diamond, the <em>BBC </em>reported. The Botswana government said that the huge 2,492-carat stone is the biggest find since the 3,106-carat Cullinan diamond, found in South Africa in 1905. It stated that the diamond, which is yet to be named, is also the largest ever discovered in the southern African state. It was found at Karowe mine, which is about 500km north of Botswana's capital, Gaborone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Botswana is one of the world's biggest producers of diamonds, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w78rwlqvxo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. In a statement, the Canadian firm said that the stone was "one of the largest rough diamonds ever unearthed". "We are ecstatic about the recovery of this extraordinary 2,492-carat diamond. The ability to recover such a massive, high-quality stone intact demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach to diamond recovery and our commitment to maximizing value for our shareholders and stakeholders," said Lucara Diamond's head William Lamb.</p>

<p>"This discovery reinforces Karowe's position as a truly world-class diamond mine and highlights the continued success of our operational and underground development strategy," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://lucaradiamond.com/newsroom/news-releases/lucara-recovers-epic-2-492-carat-diamond-from-the-122900/" rel="noindex, nofollow">statement</a>, the diamond was detected with the use of Lucara's Mega Diamond Recovery X-ray technology. It has been used since 2017 to identify and preserve high-value diamonds so that they do not break during one-crushing processes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company did not reveal details about the diamond's quality or its value. However, according to the <em>Financial Times</em>, people close to Lucara estimated that the stone could be worth upwards of $40 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This discovery symbolizes Botswana's continued ascent as a global leader in diamond production. It represents not only the unparalleled wealth found in Botswana's soil, but also the remarkable progress the nation has made in developing its diamond industry for the benefit of its citizens," the Canadian firm said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, this latest recovery joins an impressive roster of other significant finds from the mine, including the Sewelo diamond, which was found at the Karowe Mine in 2019, and was recognised as the second-biggest mined diamond in the world at 1,758 carats. It was bought by French fashion house Louis Vuitton for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p>A 1,109-carat diamond, unearthed at the same mine in 2016, was bought for $53 million by London jeweller Laurence Graff, chairman of Graff Diamonds, in 2017.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Democratic National Convention, a four-day mega event which saw a tearful Joe Biden getting a farewell, and Kamala Harris making a surprise entry in a tan suit, will end today.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The fourth day will witness Kamala Harris deliver the biggest, most important speech of her political life as she accepts the Presidential nomination, the second woman in the party's history to ever get nominated.</li>
	<li>The groundwork for her performance has been laid by her boss, US President Joe Biden, who said "She is tough, experienced and has enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story." Barack Obama tweaked his 2008 campaign "Yes We Can" to Yes, She Can", to praise Ms Harris. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama termed Kamala Harris's story as "the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country."</li>
	<li>Kamala Harris is expected to talk about her past experiences, and her life story from a successful lawyer to becoming the first Black, South Asian female Vice President in American history. The seasoned lawyer will present her case in front of the delegates at United Center Arena in Chicago.</li>
	<li>From Barack and Michelle Obama to Bill Clinton, senior figures have warned all week that Ms Harris has a brutal fight on her hands to beat the 78-year-old Trump.</li>
	<li>Tim Walz, the Minnesota Governor, yesterday, accepted the Vice President nomination. He called it the "honour of his life" and shared his upbringing in a middle-class family in Nebraska, how he learned from helping his family on the farm and his experience of teaching students. These stories are intended to connect with the larger middle-class American population that is reeling through an economic slowdown coupled with inflation and unemployment.</li>
	<li>Mr Walz's son, Gus, stole the spotlight on day 3 of the event. The 17-year-old who is neurodivergent and has ADHD, was overcome with emotion as he watched his father take the stage. With tears streaming down his face, Gus stood up and proudly pointed at his dad, exclaiming, "That's my dad!".</li>
	<li>Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey endorsed the party's nominees. Ms Winfrey made a surprise entry yesterday and said "What we're going to do is elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. And let us choose joy!" Winfrey said, a day after former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle addressed the DNC."</li>
	<li>The chemistry between 59-year-old Harris and Walz and the noisy energy generated at their rallies is helping to fuel Democratic hopes that they can defeat Donald Trump.</li>
	<li>A recent poll showed Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. The four-point lead is a small but notable improvement for Democrats in the election race, a month after polls had shown then-presidential nominee Joe Biden and Trump in a dead heat.</li>
	<li>Immigration is set to be a key issue in the upcoming Presidential elections. A slowdown in the economy which leads to unemployment and inflation, deeply impacts the attitude towards immigration. The immigrants fear a second Trump term, who has been a staunch hardliner on such issues.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven people were killed and 12 others injured in a fire at a hotel in South Korea, authorities said Friday.</p>

<p>The blaze erupted Thursday night in a room on the eighth floor of a hotel in Bucheon, around 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of Seoul, Seoul's interior ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire, which was extinguished about three hours after it began, was not yet clear, the ministry said, adding three people had been seriously injured.</p>

<p>The nine-story hotel had 64 rooms and 27 guests were staying there when the fire broke out, according to Seoul's Yonhap news agency.</p>

<p>While the blaze did not spread extensively within the building, the smoke it generated led to casualties, the news agency reported.</p>

<p>In June, 23 people were killed in a massive fire at a South Korean lithium battery plant, one of the country's worst factory disasters in years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is "a cog in the wheel and a puppet", Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy said on Thursday, and added that the Democratic presidential candidate is staying away from talking about policy in her speeches as it makes her less popular.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy, 39, was flown into Chicago, venue of the Democratic National Convention, by the Trump Campaign on the day Harris, 59, was scheduled to accept the party's presidential nomination.</p>

<p>"She's a cog in the wheel, she's a puppet. The reality is she's staying away from policy because the more she talks about policy, the less popular she becomes and that I think is the winning strategy for our side,' Ramaswamy told PTI in an interview.</p>

<p>"We win on policy. I think we need to go harder after her for her failed economic policies and her record at the Southern border. The reality is if we do that, I believe we're going to be successful not only in winning this election but in saving the country,' Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy said Donald Trump is the right choice for the country and that he is doing everything he can to make sure he is elected.</p>

<p>'We're only going to implement that agenda if we have control of the Senate and the House as well. So I'm doing everything I can to be helpful, while also continuing some of my own independent ventures in the business world now in the world of film and a couple of other areas where I think we could impact the country as well,' he said.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy is an executive producer of City of Dreams, a new movie. "It's actually made by director who is an immigrant from India, Mohit Ramchandani. Very talented guy," he said adding that the movie is coming out on August 30 "I've been involved in a number of my business ventures, have a book coming out called Truths: The Future of America First. That's come in in late September as well. So, a number of ventures outside of politics, because I think it's important to drive those changes in culture. But the most important objective is to make sure that we win not only the presidency but control of the House and Senate as well,' Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>The American entrepreneur-turned-politician slammed Harris for her open border policy. "I think it's offensive to every legal immigrant to have an open a border to ten million people who enter this country illegally. I also think that one of the things that Indian-Americans do and should care about is merit in the country right,' he said.</p>

<p>"It's a lot harder to get into a good college or even to get a job if you're have the wrong race, gender, or sexuality, but race. In the GOP, we want to end affirmative action not because we're against anybody, but because we stand from meritocracy. That's why many legal immigrants do come to this country. I think it's time we restore merit in the United States of America," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted on Thursday, the meteorological office said, spraying red-hot lava and smoke in its sixth outbreak since December.</p>

<p>"An eruption has begun. Work is under way to find out the location of the recordings," the meteorological office said in a statement without providing further detail.</p>

<p>Livestreams from the area showed glowing hot lava shooting up from the ground.</p>

<p>Studies had shown magma accumulating underground, prompting warnings of new volcanic activity in the area located just south of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik.</p>

<p>The most recent eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula, home to some 30,000 people or nearly 8% of the country's total population, ended on June 22 after spewing fountains of molten rock for 24 days.</p>

<p>The eruptions show the challenge faced by the island nation of nearly 400,000 people as scientists warn that the Reykjanes peninsula could face repeated outbreaks for decades or even centuries.</p>

<p>Since 2021, there have been nine eruptions on the peninsula, following the reactivation of geological systems that had been dormant for 800 years.</p>

<p>In response, authorities have constructed man-made barriers to redirect lava flows away from critical infrastructure, including the Svartsengi geothermal power plant, the Blue Lagoon outdoor spa and the town of Grindavik.</p>

<p>Flights were unaffected, Reykjavik's Keflavik Airport said on its web page</p>

<p>Grindavik, home to one of Iceland's key fishing ports and nearly 4,000 people, has been largely abandoned since late last year when residents were first ordered to evacuate.</p>

<p>Volcanic outbreaks in the Reykjanes peninsula are so-called fissure eruptions, which do not usually disrupt air traffic as they do not cause large explosions or significant dispersal of ash into the stratosphere.</p>

<p>Iceland, which is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Kentucky, boasts more than 30 active volcanoes, making the north European island a prime destination for volcano tourism - a niche segment that attracts thrill seekers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Arizona man is wanted after threatening over social media to kill former President Donald Trump, the Cochise County Sheriff's Office said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is in Cochise County as he visits the U.S. border with Mexico as part of his campaign.</p>

<p>The man, Ronald Lee Syvrud, 66, has multiple outstanding warrants from Wisconsin, the sheriff's office said.</p>

<p>"No, I have not heard that but I am not that surprised and the reason is because I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys," Trump said when asked about that threat against him in Arizona.</p>

<p>This is the latest in a series of threats against candidates ahead of the Nov. 5 general election.</p>

<p>In early August, a Virginia man was charged with threatening Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, and a New Hampshire man was arrested in December for threatening to kill Republican presidential candidates.</p>

<p>In July, Trump was shot in his ear in an attempted assassination that left two others injured and one man dead.</p>

<p>The U.S. Secret Service came under widespread scrutiny following the shooting. It resulted in the resignation of the agency's director.</p>

<p>Despite this and new threats, Trump said he has "great respect" for the Secret Service and "the job they do," while adding they made mistakes from which they will learn.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris is addressing the American public on the final night of the National Democratic Convention (DNC) in Chicago on Thursday. In her anticipated keynote speech, Harris praised her outgoing boss, President Joe Biden, as she formally accepted her party's nomination for the upcoming presidential race.</p>

<p>Harris' address will follow the nomination of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. Walz introduced himself to the nation on Wednesday, highlighting his readiness to support Harris in the bid for the White House.</p>

<p>In her keynote address, Kamala Harris shared her personal story.&nbsp;During speech, Harris articulated her vision for America's future, contrasting it with what her campaign characterises as former President Donald Trump's "dark, conservative" vision for a second term in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>The final day of the convention featured addresses from several prominent Democratic figures, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, civil rights leader Al Sharpton, and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The theme for the fourth and final day of the DNC is "For Our Future".</p>

<p>The convention's concluding night promises to set the stage for the upcoming election, with Harris and her allies aiming to rally support and energise voters ahead of the November election.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris is poised to deliver the biggest speech of her political life on Thursday as she accepts the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago after a historic turnaround in the 2024 White House race.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old US vice president will focus on joyful "vibes" after electrifying her party in the space of a single heady month since President Joe Biden dropped out of the contest.</p>

<p>Now Harris will tell her personal story to the American people, using her televised address to the Democratic National Convention to contrast her optimism with the darker tone of Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"It's going to blow the roof off," said Amanda Taylor, a 47-year-old delegate from Missouri.</p>

<p>Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, also swapped messages on X on Thursday for their 10th wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>"To the best partner I could ask for: Happy anniversary, Dougie," the Vice President wrote, while he said: "Forever to go. Happy anniversary @VP. I love you."</p>

<p>Yet while Democrats' hopes are soaring and as Harris edges ahead in the polls, they know the battle is far from won.</p>

<p>From Barack and Michelle Obama to Bill Clinton, senior figures have warned all week that Harris has a brutal fight on her hands to beat the 78-year-old Trump.</p>

<p>The sheer speed of her astonishing rise to the top of the ticket also means Harris remains an unknown quantity to many US voters.</p>

<p>A trailblazer as the first woman, Black and South Asian vice president in US history -- and now bidding to become its first woman president -- her role has largely kept her in the background the last four years.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Fight for freedom' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris will seek to remedy that in her speech. She will talk about how she was raised by a working mother and knows the challenges facing families hit by inflation, a campaign official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>She will set her confident vision for America's future against what her campaign calls Trump's dark, conservative inspiration for a second term in the Oval Office, the official said.</p>

<p>Speaker after speaker has focused on the idea of freedom during the Democratic convention, as the party targets what it says are Republican plans to further limit abortion and clamp down on democratic institutions.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Harris's energetic running mate Tim Walz formally accepted the party's nomination, saying: "Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead."</p>

<p>But Harris has been short on policy announcements since taking over as the Democratic standard-bearer, particularly when it comes to the economy, a key issue in the election.</p>

<p>She has to take advantage of her first major speech in a presidential setting, as "you don't get a second chance to make a first impression," political analyst Larry Sabato told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Kamala vibes' -</strong></p>

<p>"Voters already have the Kamala vibes. Now they need the Kamala agenda," said Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia. A lack of economic policy "can defeat her faster than the border," he added.</p>

<p>But when it comes to vibes, Democrats are in full on celebration mode, unrecognizable from the party that was steeped in despair after the 81-year-old Biden's catastrophic debate performance against Trump.</p>

<p>The Obamas raised the roof in Chicago on Tuesday, with the ex-first lady declaring that under Harris "hope is making a comeback."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Clinton, television talk show host Oprah Winfrey and musicians Stevie Wonder and John Legend were the warm-up acts for Walz, the governor of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Biden's farewell address on Monday, when Harris made a surprise appearance on stage to give him a hug, already seems like a distant memory.</p>

<p>If the transition has been head-spinning for Biden and the Democrats, it has completely unsettled Trump.</p>

<p>In a roller-coaster summer he has survived an assassination attempt, and then seen what he thought was certain victory turned on its head by a new and far younger opponent.</p>

<p>Trump will be in Arizona on the Mexican border on Thursday to push Harris's weak spot on the issue of illegal immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Secretary-General hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ukraine will contribute to ending the war, his Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Asked for a reaction to Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine amid the war, Dujarric said, "We've seen a lot of heads of state and government travel to the region (and) we hope that all of these visits will bring us closer to an end of the conflict in line with General Assembly resolutions, international law, and the territorial integrity."</p>

<p>The General Assembly has demanded an end to the Russian invasion in at least three resolutions and in another to stop attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure. India has abstained on the resolutions.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to go to Ukraine on Friday where he is to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>The Kyiv visit follows his trip to Russia last month, where he discussed the Ukraine situation with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>According to reports, he will convey messages between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>An India-Russia joint statement at the end of Prime Minister Modi's Moscow visit said that the two leaders "highlighted the imperative of peaceful resolution of the conflict around Ukraine through dialogue and diplomacy including engagement between both parties".</p>

<p>The statement added cryptically, "They noted with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation and good offices aimed at peaceful resolution of the conflict in accordance with international law and on the basis of the UN Charter in its entirety and totality".</p>

<p>While India has kept up a veneer of neutrality by not voting for the condemnation of Russia's invasion at the UN, Prime Minister Modi has criticised it.</p>

<p>He told Putin at a 2022 meeting in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, "I know that today's era is not of war and we have talked to you many times over the phone on the subject that democracy and diplomacy and dialogue are all these things that touch the world".</p>

<p>On the day of Prime Minister Modi's arrival in Moscow in July, Russia's missile attack hit a children's hospital in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Reacting to it, Prime Minister Modi said, "Whether it is war, conflict or a terrorist attack, any person who believes in humanity is pained when there is loss of lives. But even in that, when innocent children are killed, the heart bleeds and that pain is very terrifying."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi and President Zelensky have spoken by phone several times since Russia's invasion began in February 2022.</p>

<p>After a conversation in March, the Prime Minister posted on X that he "conveyed India's consistent support for all efforts for peace and bringing an early end to the ongoing conflict. India will continue to provide humanitarian assistance guided by our people-centric approach".</p>

<p>Zelensky said in his X post that "Ukraine is interested in strengthening our trade and economic ties with India, particularly in agricultural exports, aviation cooperation, and pharmaceutical and industrial product trade".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nestle chief executive Mark Schneider is leaving the Swiss food group after eight years in charge and will be replaced by Latin America boss Laurent Freixe, the company said Thursday.</p>

<p>Schneider "has decided to relinquish his roles as CEO and member of the Board of Directors", Nestle said in a statement, adding that the move would be effective September 1.</p>

<p>"Leading Nestle for the past 8 years has been an honor for me. I am grateful for what we have achieved, having transformed Nestle into a future-proofed, innovative and sustainable business," Schneider said in the statement.</p>

<p>Freixe, who joined Nestle in France in 1986, "successfully managed: the company's European zone during the 2008 financial crisis and until 2014, the statement said.</p>

<p>He was then named CEO of the Americas region being taking over at the newly created Latin America zone in in 2022, "where he has been successfully leading through challenging conditions".</p>

<p>Nestle said Freixe has been nominated as a candidate for the board of directors at its 2025 annual general meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>'Perfect fit'</strong></h3>

<p>Nestle, whose brands range from Nespresso coffee capsules to Purina dog food and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, lowered its sales growth outlook for 2024 last month as it slowed its price increases in the first half of the year.</p>

<p>The global packaged-food giant and its rivals had logged high sales growth in the past three years as they raised prices to make up for higher costs due to soaring inflation.</p>

<p>The company has also faced controversy in recent years, with Swiss NGO Public Eye accusing Nestle of selling baby food with high levels of added sugar in low-income countries but not in wealthier nations.</p>

<p>Nestle has counted that it had "no double standard" and applied the same nutrition and health principles everywhere.</p>

<p>It has also scrambled to ease any concerns over its Perrier brand after France's food safety watchdog recommended stricter monitoring of sites where Nestle extracts mineral water following the discovery of traces of "faecal" contamination.</p>

<p>The company has since said it has stepped up monitoring of the sites, and Schneider has said the group's water was safe to drink.</p>

<p>Nestle said Thursday that Schneider "has actively shaped the company's portfolio, in line with Nestle's strategy and with a focus on high-growth categories like coffee, pet care and nutritional health products".</p>

<p>Nestle chairman Paul Bulcke praised Freixe a "a talented leader with strategic acumen, extensive in-market experience and expertise as well as a deep understanding of markets and consumers".</p>

<p>"Laurent is the perfect fit for Nestle at this time," Bulcke added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passenger on Australian budget carrier Jetstar threw open an emergency door and exited by clambering over the wing and engine after landing in Melbourne on Thursday, officials said.</p>

<p>Australian federal police arrested the man following his unauthorised departure from the Sydney-Melbourne flight.</p>

<p>"We can confirm that a passenger opened the emergency exit door after arrival into Melbourne, which automatically deployed the slide," a Jetstar spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"The plane was parked at the gate."</p>

<p>After leaving by the emergency exit door, the man walked along the wing before making his way down to the ground via the engine, officials said.</p>

<p>Audrey Varghese, a fellow passenger on the flight, told Melbourne radio 3AW that the man had been exhibiting "quite strange behaviour", ignoring the seatbelt signs and multiple requests by flight attendants for him to remain seated.</p>

<p>"People thought that was quite strange. And then as soon as the plane had started to come to a stop, he immediately got up and basically charged to where the emergency exit row is," she said.</p>

<p>In the process, he was "shoving people, causing a bit of commotion," Varghese said.</p>

<p>He then "ripped open" the emergency door, deploying the slide, and "jumped off the plane".</p>

<p>Varghese said there were "screams and shrieks" from other passengers, who were obviously "very frightened".</p>

<p>"I think people were just screaming because of how strange this behaviour was."</p>

<p>Federal police said they arrested a man for "alleged aggressive behaviour and breaching aircraft safety protocols on a domestic service".</p>

<p>"The man was assessed by ambulance officers and later transferred to hospital for further assessment, where he remains," a police spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Police said they were still investigating but charges were likely to be laid "at a future date".</p>

<p>Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas, said it wanted to thank passengers for their "patience and understanding" during the incident.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A six-year-old boy missing for four days was found alive in a forest in a mountainous part of northern Vietnam, police said Thursday.</p>

<p>The child was reported missing on Saturday after he failed to return home with his siblings from a celebration at a relative's house in Yen Bai province.</p>

<p>Police in Lam Giang commune launched a search for the boy and "even dried up a pond as they were afraid he had fallen," an officer, who declined to give his name, told AFP.</p>

<p>Over the past four days, more than 200 people joined a search for the boy, according to state media.</p>

<p>He was finally found on Wednesday, the police official said.</p>

<p>"We were told that the boy was tired. They gave him things to eat and checked his health. He is ok now," the police official told AFP.</p>

<p>State media reported that a man had heard crying and discovered the exhausted boy covered in mud, sitting in a cassava bush in the forest.</p>

<p>Lam's mother, Ly Thi Phai, told the VietnamNet news site of her relief.</p>

<p>"I was so happy that my child had returned alive," she said.</p>

<p>"I cried because he looked thinner and weaker than before he disappeared."</p>

<p>According to state media, the boy said he had become lost in the forest and the more he walked, the more disorientated he became.</p>

<p>To survive, he said he drank water from a stream and picked leaves and wild fruits he recognised.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US talk show host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Wednesday, calling on her fellow independent voters to vote for "joy".</p>

<p>In an electrifying address to the US political party convention, Winfrey said: "We are so fired up we can't wait to leave here and do something".</p>

<p>"And what we're going to do is elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. And let us choose joy!" Winfrey said, a day after former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle addressed the DNC.</p>

<p>"Let us choose common sense over nonsense," said the 70-year-old television personality to applause from the thousands of attendees at the United Center in Chicago -- home of her globally acclaimed morning talk show.</p>

<p>"America is an ongoing project that requires commitment... and every once in a while it requires standing up to life's bullies."</p>

<p>"So I'm calling on all you independents and all you undecideds. You know this is true. You know I'm telling you the truth, that values and character matter most of all," she said.</p>

<p>Winfrey recounted her experiences witnessing racism, sexism and income inequality in the United States, adding that she had at times been on the receiving end of it.</p>

<p>She took a jibe at remarks by Republican Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick, J.D. Vance, who singled out Harris when he called Democrats a "bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives."</p>

<p>Harris has two stepchildren and the comments have sparked accusations that father-of-three Vance represents a backward Republican mindset.</p>

<p>"When a house is on fire, we don't ask about the homeowner's race or religion... We just try to do the best we can to save them. And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out too," Winfrey said.</p>

<p>"Let us choose common sense over nonsense. Common sense tells us Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect," she told the convention, where she was one of the warm-up acts to Walz's address, alongside musicians Stevie Wonder and John Legend.</p>

<p>"Very soon, we're going to be teaching our daughters and sons about how this child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father -- two idealistic, energetic -- how this child grew up to become the 47th President of the United States," she said.</p>

<p>"That is the best of America."</p>

<p>Harris is due to give her speech when she accepts the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's Supreme Court, which observers say is loyal to the government of President Nicolas Maduro, on Thursday declared him the winner of the disputed July 28 election amid opposition claims of widespread vote fraud.</p>

<p>In its ruling read by presiding judge Caryslia Rodriguez, the court said it had "indisputably certified election materials and validates the results of the July 28, 2024 presidential election issued by the National Electoral Council (CNE)," naming Nicolas Maduro as the winner.</p>

<p>Nicolas Maduro himself had asked the court earlier this month to weigh in on the election, in which he claims to have defeated opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia with 52 percent of ballots cast, according to the CNE.</p>

<p>The CNE did not provide a precinct-level breakdown of its results, saying it had been the victim of a cyberattack. Observers however say they believe the supposed hack is an excuse to not provide vote results.</p>

<p>The opposition says its own tally of polling-station-level results showed Gonzalez Urrutia, 74, had won more than two-thirds of votes.</p>

<p>"To the court's judges: no decision will replace the will of the people. The country and the world know about your bias and, as a result, your inability to resolve this conflict," Gonzalez Urrutia said earlier Thursday in a social media post.</p>

<p>"Your ruling will only make the crisis worse."</p>

<p>Rodriguez said earlier this month that the court's ruling would be "final."</p>

<p>Official sources have reported 25 people have been killed, 192 injured and 2,400 arrested in election-related protests.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The move has already led to evictions from private shelters, with around 2,000-3,000 refugees potentially losing their housing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new law threatening to drive thousands of migrants from Ukraine back to their home country or onto the streets has been implemented in Hungary. With effect from Wednesday, this legislative move denied Ukrainian refugees access to government-subsidised accommodation.</p>

<p>This new rule is the outcome of a decision made in June by Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban to restrict public assistance to refugees from areas of Ukraine that are not thought to be impacted by the war between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>The list, which will be updated monthly by the Hungarian government, includes thirteen regions in Ukraine. It is unknown how many of the 31,000 Ukrainians who are seeking refuge in Hungary will be impacted by the new legislation.</p>

<p>Government Commissioner Norbert Pal defended the change as "reasonable and proportionate" after two and a half years of war. He told the pro-government Magyar Nemzet newspaper that "those who wanted to get back on their feet in Hungary have been able to do so."</p>

<p>Privately-owned shelters have already started evicting refugees now ineligible for support, the Migration Aid group said.</p>

<p>In Kocs, north of Budapest, around 120 refugees were ousted from a guest house under police supervision on Wednesday, an AFP photographer saw.</p>

<p>Most were Roma women and children from Transcarpathia in western Ukraine, where there is a large Hungarian community.</p>

<p>"We are in a hopeless situation because we have nowhere to go," Marina Amit, a mother-of-five who fled to Hungary last year, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We cannot go home to Ukraine; I have a 17-year-old son," she added, saying she feared he would be conscripted into the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimated this week that 2,000-3,000 Ukrainians could lose access to subsidised accommodation.</p>

<p>The rule change will result in "job losses and impact school enrolment, jeopardising the positive integration achievements obtained so far," UNHCR said in a statement urging Hungary to reconsider.</p>]]></content:encoded>

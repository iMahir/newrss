       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesian president starts U.S. visit with call to Trump ahead of Biden meeting</p>

<p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory in a phone call after landing in Washington on an official visit that includes a meeting with President Joe Biden on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Prabowo, who has said he will pursue a non-aligned foreign policy, posted a video of his call to Trump made after he arrived from China, where he had met with President Xi Jinping on his first overseas trip since taking office last month.</p>

<p>"Wherever you are, I'm willing to fly to congratulate you personally, sir," Prabowo said in the video of the call posted on his social media accounts.</p>

<p>"We'll do that, anytime you want," Trump replied.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Glad to be connected directly with President Elect <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a> to extend my heartfelt congratulations on his election as the 47th President of the United States.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to enhance the collaboration between our two great nations and to more productive… <a href="https://t.co/KfSVUsZSGc">pic.twitter.com/KfSVUsZSGc</a></p>
— Prabowo Subianto (@prabowo) <a href="https://twitter.com/prabowo/status/1855981733646356732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Prabowo's office said he made the call on Monday after arriving in Washington. It did not immediately respond when asked if he is scheduled to meet Trump in person.</p>

<p>Trump described his election victory as amazing, and giving him a big mandate. "We had tremendous success. The most successful in over 100 years, they say," he said.</p>

<p>Trump also said the Indonesian President was "very respected," and praised his English, to which Prabowo, a former special forces commander, replied: "All my training is American, sir."</p>

<p>Prabowo expressed his shock over the assassination attempt on Trump during campaigning, and relief that he had survived.</p>

<p>"Yes, I got very lucky. I just happened to be in the right place with the right direction, otherwise I wouldn't be talking to you right now," Trump replied.</p>

<p>Prabowo also met with several U.S. company representatives in Washington, his office said, including from Freeport McMoRan and energy company Chevron, and urged the companies to invest in Indonesia.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The re-election of Donald Trump in the US has cast a shadow on climate talks at the COP29 in Baku, with the with the President-elect pledging to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The re-election of Donald Trump in the US has cast a shadow on climate talks at the COP29 (Conference of the Parties) in Baku, with the with the President-elect pledging to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement.</p>

<p>When Trump was elected in 2016, he had taken the US out of the Paris Agreement. Four years later, it was rectified by Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The ongoing COP29, the annual climate conference, began in Baku, Azerbaijan on Monday (November 11) amid worries of the US pulling out of the Paris climate agreement for the second time. The conference is focusing on strategies for the phased reduction of fossil fuels and climate aid to developing (poorer) nations.</p>

<p>At Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries made a commitment to mobilise $100 billion annually to help developing countries address climate-related challenges and build greener economies.</p>

<p>The Paris pact reaffirmed the 2009 commitment, but only $83.3billion was raised as of 2020. The target was finally met in 2023. All 196 countries, including the US, had signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 and had made non-binding pledges to reduce their earth warming pollution.</p>

<p>However, there are no penalties for not adhering to the agreement.</p>

<p>At the Baku summit, delegates are deciding on a 10-fold increase in financial flows - from the current $100 billion each year that developed countries pledged to raise, to at least a trillion dollars a year from 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Fear Of Exit</strong></p>

<p>At Baku, Washington's top climate envoy John Podesta acknowledged the next US administration would "try and take a U-turn" on climate action, but said that US cities, states and individual citizens would pick up the slack. "While the United States federal government under Donald Trump may put climate change action on the back burner, the work to contain climate change is going to continue in the United States with commitment and passion and belief," he said, according to AFP.</p>

<p>"The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country," he added.</p>

<p>Regardless of assurances, Trump believes that climate change is a 'hoax' and may go ahead with his plans quicker and without much opposition. He may even take the US out of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>

<p>When the previous Trump government walked out of the Paris Agreement, it was just a little over a year old.</p>

<p>The exit had provoked strong international reactions and fears that other countries may also go the US way.</p>

<p>The US rejoined the Paris Agreement under Joe Biden in 2021 and then announced that by the year 2030, America would cut its emissions by half from 2005 levels.</p>

<p>If Trump goes ahead with his campaign promises, it will deal a severe blow to the entire framework for the annual global climate negotiations, causing lasting damage to efforts to limit global warming.</p>

<p>The countries that opted for the Paris Agreement are expected to furnish new plans by mid-February 2025. But if the world's biggest economy doesn't submit its plans, then it definitely sends a wrong signal to detractors of stringent climate action in China, India or Europe. The negative elements in these countries will force their governments to water down efforts towards climate ambition and continue with the dependence on fossil fuels. &nbsp;</p>

<p>US' withdrawal from climate change panels would prevent the country from participating in international discussions about the expansion of clean energy. This would give China an opportunity to elbow out America on solar panels, electric vehicles and other green technologies.</p>

<p>The Trump administration's climate strategy will be clearly known only after the inauguration of the new President on January 20.</p>

<p><strong>Impact On Baku Summit</strong></p>

<p>2024 has been the warmest year on record. According to the EU's (European Union) climate service, this is also the first time that global warming has exceeded 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>In simple terms, the long-term temperature increase must be limited to below 1.5 degrees to avoid the devastating impact of climate change.</p>

<p>India, too, has had its share of extreme weather events, from intense rainfall to heatwaves, in 2024. The latest India Climate Report 2024 published on November 8 reveals that the country faced extreme weather events on 93% of the days in the first nine months of this year (from January 1 to September 30, 2024). This means extreme events occurred on 255 out of a total 274 days, leaving 3,200 people dead, affecting 3.2 million hectares of crops, destroying 2,35,862 houses and buildings, and killing 9,457 livestock across the country.</p>

<p>In the last two conferences, delegates had agreed to set up a Loss and Damage Fund to help countries deal with extreme weather events. The Baku summit aims to push further discussions.</p>

<p>At climate meetings in the run-up to Baku, developed nations have already said they are not ready to bear the cost and are asking to widen the donor base to include other rich countries like Singapore, China and the UAE.</p>

<p>Any US decision will influence other developed nations like Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, the UK and the EU to rethink their stance. After the US exit during Trump's first term, these countries had decreased their share of climate finance. Even after Biden reversed Trump's move in 2021, the US did not contribute a major share of its financial pledges from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>This constrained the developed nations' mission to raise $100 billion annually to fund climate goals for developing countries.</p>

<p>This time around the fear is that the US may default on its $3 billion pledge to the UN's Green Climate Fund. The US has been a defaulter under other Presidents like Obama and Biden, but didn't opt out of the negotiations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US is the second biggest emitter after China and the largest contributor to historical emissions. Its role and active participation are instrumental in not only mobilising finances for climate change but also in slashing emissions. Setting climate targets will be pointless without the US on board. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has hit out at a Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit mocking him. The said episode aired on November 9, days after Donald Trump's win in the US presidential election that shocked the world. Both Mr Musk and Mr Trump were lampooned in the episode, with actors sarcastically sharing their support for the president-elect to avoid being put on his "enemies list". Mr Musk's character was portrayed by Dana Carvey, a regular SNL cast member. The episode was hosted by comedian and actor Bill Burr.</p>

<p>During the episode, comedian Kenan Thompson said, "If our planet falls apart, we can all go to Mars with the other man that we love and trust: Elon Musk." At this point, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/latenightercom/status/1855472585561289036">Carvey appears mimicking Mr Musk</a>.</p>

<p>He wore a dark MAGA hat while jumping up and down with his hands in the air.</p>

<p>"Check it out: dark MAGA. Yeah! But seriously, I run the country now. America's going to be like one of my rockets. They're super cool and super fun, but there's a slight chance it could blow up and everybody dies. Haha!" said Carvey.</p>

<p>He also threw his hands in the air and exclaimed, "See you in the White House!"</p>

<p>The billionaire was not impressed by the skit and wrote "Dana Carvey just sounds like Dana Carvey," on X, replying under a clip.</p>

<p>Responding to another post, he wrote, "They are so mad that @realDonaldTrump won," and also added a few crying-laughing emojis.</p>

<p>Mr Musk had thrown his weight behind Mr Trump, urging voters to elect the Republican leader. He had even offered cash rewards to people who vote.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, Mr Musk's net worth has surpassed $300 billion for the first time in almost three years, as shares of Tesla Inc. soar on bets that his close ties with President-elect Donald Trump will bolster the company.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Sun has kicked into high gear, and the Binar satellites are far from the only casualty.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, three tiny Australian satellites from Curtin University's <a href="https://www.binarspace.com/">Binar Space Program</a> burned up in Earth's atmosphere. That was always going to happen. In fact, Binar means “fireball” in the Noongar language of the First Nations people of Perth.</p>

<p>When a satellite is in low Earth orbit (2,000km or less), it experiences orbital decay as it drags closer and closer to the surface, <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-research-shows-most-space-rocks-crashing-into-earth-come-from-a-single-source-241455">eventually burning up</a>.</p>

<p>But these <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/what-are-smallsats-and-cubesats/">cube satellites (CubeSats)</a>, known as Binar-2, 3 and 4, entered the atmosphere much sooner than originally planned. They only lasted for two months – a third of what was expected. This significantly reduced valuable time for science and testing new systems.</p>

<p>The reason for their untimely demise? Our Sun has kicked into high gear, and the Binar satellites are far from the only casualty. Recent high solar activity has been causing an unexpected headache for satellite operators in the last few years, and it's only increasing.</p>

<h2>Why is the Sun so active?</h2>

<p>Solar activity includes phenomena such as sunspots, solar flares and solar wind – the stream of charged particles that flows toward Earth.</p>

<p>This activity is a product of the Sun's ever-changing magnetic field, and approximately every 11 years, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/the-suns-magnetic-field-is-about-to-flip">it completely flips</a>. At the midpoint of this cycle, solar activity is at its highest.</p>

<p>While this cycle is known, specific solar activity is challenging to predict – the dynamics are complex and solar forecasting is in its infancy.</p>

<p>In the last few months, indicators of solar activity were more than <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression">one and a half times higher than predictions</a> for this point in the current cycle, labelled <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/solar-cycle-25-forecast-update">solar cycle 25</a>.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E65T2AV-EjM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="440"></iframe></figure>

<h2>The impact of space weather</h2>

<p>Space weather refers to the environmental effects that originate from outside our atmosphere (mostly the Sun). It affects us on Earth in a variety of noticeable and unnoticeable ways.</p>

<p>The most obvious is the presence of auroras. In the past few months, auroras have been visible far more intensely and closer to the equator <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-auroras-so-hard-to-predict-and-when-can-we-expect-more-229909">than in the last two decades</a>. This is a direct result of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/wondering-why-the-aurora-borealis-was-visible-so-far-south-last-night-heres-why-its-all-thanks-to-the-sun">the increased solar activity</a>.</p>

<p>Space weather, and solar activity in particular, also creates additional challenges for satellites and satellite operators.</p>

<p>Higher solar activity means more solar flares and stronger solar wind – resulting in a higher flux of charged particles that can <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/articles/2024/january/solar-maximum">damage or disrupt electrical components on satellites</a>.</p>

<p>It also means an increase in ionising radiation, resulting in a <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/9725/chapter/4#30">higher dose for astronauts</a> and <a href="https://www.versantphysics.com/2024/03/27/flight-crews-and-radiation-exposure/">pilots</a>, and potential disruptions to <a href="https://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Educational/1/3/6">long-distance radio communications</a>.</p>

<p>But for satellites in low Earth orbit, the most consistent effect of solar activity is that the extra energy gets absorbed into the outer atmosphere, causing it to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/news/111522-starlink">balloon outward</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226665395_The_Effect_of_Atmospheric_Drag_on_Satellite_Orbits_During_the_Bastille_Day_Event">all satellites less than 1,000km from Earth</a> experience a significant increase in <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/impacts/satellite-drag">atmospheric drag</a>. This is a force that disrupts their orbit and causes them to fall towards the planet's surface.</p>

<p>Notable satellites in this region include the International Space Station and the Starlink constellation. These satellites have thrusters to counteract this effect, but these corrections can be expensive.</p>

<p>Low Earth orbit also contains many university satellites, such as the Binar CubeSats. Cube satellites are rarely equipped with tools that can adjust their altitude, so they're entirely at the mercy of space weather.</p>

<h2>What happened to Binar?</h2>

<p>The Binar Space Program is a satellite research program operating out of Curtin University. It aims to advance our understanding of the Solar System and lower the barrier for operating in space.</p>

<p>The program began operations with its first satellite, <a href="https://theconversation.com/australias-first-binar-spacecraft-just-came-down-to-earth-as-a-fireball-heres-what-we-learned-191677">Binar-1</a>, in September 2021. This was less than a year into solar cycle 25 when solar activity was relatively low.</p>

<p>In these conditions, the ten-centimetre cube satellite started at an altitude of 420km and survived a full 364 days in orbit.</p>

<p>The program's follow-up mission – Binar-2, 3, and 4 – were three equally sized CubeSats. However, they were expected to last approximately six months owing to the extra surface area from new <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2024/all2024/8/">deployable solar arrays</a> and a forecast increase in solar activity.</p>

<p>Instead, they only made it to two months before burning up. While cube satellite missions are relatively cheap, the premature ending of a mission will always be costly. <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-loss-space-weather-forecast">This is even more true for commercial satellites</a>, highlighting the need for more accurate space weather forecasting.</p>

<p>The good news is the Sun will calm down again. Despite the current unexpectedly high solar activity, it will likely slow down by 2026, and is expected to <a href="https://www.almanac.com/solar-cycle-25-sun-heating">return to a solar minimum in 2030</a>.</p>

<p>While this was not an explicit goal of the mission, the Binar Space Program has now poignantly demonstrated the dramatic effects of solar activity on space operations.</p>

<p>While the untimely loss of Binar-2, 3 and 4 was unfortunate, work has already begun on future missions. They are expected to launch into far more forgiving space weather.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year's U.N. climate summit - COP29 - is being held during yet another record-breaking year of higher global temperatures, adding pressure to negotiations aimed at curbing climate change.</p>

<p>The last global scientific consensus on climate change was released in 2021 through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, however scientists say that evidence shows global warming and its impacts are unfolding faster than expected.</p>

<p><strong>Here is some of the latest climate research:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.5C BREACHED?</strong></p>

<p>The world may already have hit 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 F) of warming above the average pre-industrial temperature - a critical threshold beyond which it is at risk of irreversible and extreme climate change, scientists say.</p>

<p>A group of researchers made the suggestion in a study released on Monday based on an analysis of 2,000 years of atmospheric gases trapped in Antarctic ice cores that extends the understanding of pre-industrial temperature trends.</p>

<p>Scientists have typically measured today's temperatures against a baseline temperature average for 1850-1900. By that measure, the world is now at nearly 1.3 C (2.4 F) of warming.</p>

<p>But the new data suggests a longer pre-industrial baseline, based on temperature data spanning the year 13 to 1700, the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience said.</p>

<p>Either way, 2024 is certain to be the warmest year on record.</p>

<p><strong>SUPERCHARGED HURRICANES&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Not only is ocean warming fuelling stronger Atlantic storms, it is also causing them to intensify more rapidly, for example, jumping from a Category 1 to a Category 3 storm in just hours.</p>

<p>Growing evidence shows this is true of other ocean basins.</p>

<p>Hurricane Milton needed only one day in the Gulf of Mexico in October to go from tropical storm to the Gulf's second-most powerful hurricane on record, slamming Florida's west coast.</p>

<p>Warmer air can also hold more moisture, helping storms carry and eventually release more rain. As a result, hurricanes are delivering flooding even in mountain towns like Asheville, North Carolina, inundated in September by Hurricane Helene.</p>

<p><strong>WILDFIRE DEATHS</strong></p>

<p>Global warming is drying waterways and sapping moisture from forests, creating conditions for bigger and hotter wildfires from the U.S. West and Canada to southern Europe and Russia's Far East creating more damaging smoke.</p>

<p>Research published last month in Nature Climate Change calculated that about 13% of deaths associated with toxic wildfire smoke, roughly 12,000 deaths, during the 2010s could be attributed to the climate effect on wildfires.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CORAL BLEACHING&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>With the world in the throes of a fourth mass coral bleaching event - the largest on record &nbsp;- scientists fear the world's reefs have passed a point of no return.</p>

<p>Scientists will be studying bleached reefs from Australia to Brazil for signs of recovery over the next few years if temperatures fall.</p>

<p><strong>AMAZON ALARM&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Brazil's Amazon is in the grips of its worst and most widespread drought since records began in 1950. River levels sank to all-time lows this year, while fires ravaged the rainforest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This adds concern to scientific findings earlier this year that between 10% and 47% of the Amazon will face combined stresses of heat and drought from climate change, as well as other threats, by 2050.</p>

<p>This could push the Amazon past a tipping point, with the jungle no longer able to produce enough moisture to quench its own trees, at which point the ecosystem could transition to degraded forests or sandy savannas.</p>

<p>Globally, forests appear to be struggling.</p>

<p>A July study found that forests overall last year failed to absorb as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as in the past, due largely to the Amazon drought and wildfires in Canada.</p>

<p>That means a record amount of CO2 entered the atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>VOLCANIC SURGE&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Scientists fear climate change could even boost volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>In Iceland, volcanoes appear to be responding to rapid glacier retreat. As ice melts, less pressure is exerted on the Earth's crust and mantle.</p>

<p>Volcanologists worry this could destabilize magma reservoirs and appears to be leading to more magma being created, building up pressure underground.</p>

<p>Some 245 volcanoes across the world lie under or near ice and could be at risk.</p>

<p><strong>OCEAN SLOWDOWN</strong></p>

<p>The warming of the Atlantic could hasten the collapse of a key current system, which scientists warn could already be sputtering.</p>

<p>The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which transports warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic, has helped to keep European winters milder for centuries.</p>

<p>Research in 2018 showed that AMOC has weakened by about 15% since 1950, while research published in February in the journal Science Advances, suggested that it could be closer to a critical slowdown than previously thought.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[China is putting ever-greater pressure on the Philippines to cede its sovereign rights in the South China Sea, Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China is putting ever-greater pressure on the Philippines to cede its sovereign rights in the South China Sea, Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro said on Tuesday after a meeting with his Australian counterpart in Canberra.</p>

<p>"What we see is an increasing demand by Beijing for us to concede our sovereign rights in the area," he said, adding that the Philippines was a "victim of Chinese aggression".</p>

<p>China and the Philippines have sparred repeatedly this year over disputed areas of the South China Sea, including the Scarborough Shoal, one of Asia's most contested features.</p>

<p>Teodoro's meeting with his Australian counterpart Richard Marles, their fifth since August 2023, reflects growing security ties between the countries, both of whom have expressed concern about Chinese activity in areas of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations.</p>

<p>The two nations signed a strategic partnership in September 2023 and held their first joint sea and air patrols in the South China Sea several months later. The Philippines also joined war games in Australia this year for the first time.</p>

<p>China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 said China's claims had no legal basis, a ruling Beijing rejects.</p>

<p>Teodoro said China's claims and behaviour were contrary to international law and defence deals with partners such as Australia were an important way to deter Chinese incursions.</p>

<p>"Although they (China) claim to act under the aegis of international law, everybody knows that what they're doing is contrary to the tenets of international law," he said.</p>

<p>"The biggest evidence of this is that nobody has actually supported their actions or activities."</p>

<p>In addition to closer ties with countries including Australia and the United States, the Philippines also plans to spend at least $33 billion on new weapons including advanced fighter jets and mid-range missiles.</p>

<p>Marles said Australia wanted to work more closely with the Philippine defence industry and would send an engineering assessment team to the country early next year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Three decades on from independence, Kyrgyzstan is still dealing with the consequences of the Cold War nuclear arms race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a mask and a hazmat suit, Ermek Murataliyev drives a truck filled with Soviet-era radioactive waste along the winding mountain roads of Kyrgyzstan.</p>

<p>His is a hazardous mission: two such trucks crashed into ravines over the summer.</p>

<p>Drivers in this former Soviet Central Asian state are forbidden to stop until they reach their final destination -- a storage zone where the waste will be buried under thick layers of compacted clay and rock.</p>

<p>Murataliyev had to undergo a medical inspection and have regular health checks to get the job.&nbsp;"I have been trained on how to keep myself safe," he said.</p>

<p>Three decades on from independence, Kyrgyzstan is still dealing with the consequences of the Cold War nuclear arms race, when Central Asia provided the Soviet Union with all of its uranium.</p>

<p>Kyrgyz authorities say there are now six million cubic metres of radioactive waste in 30 sites such as Min-Kush, which require complex and costly disposal measures.</p>

<p>"When the Soviet Union collapsed, Kyrgyzstan had neither the equipment nor the money to transfer the waste to safe sites," said Ilgiz Ernis, deputy mayor of the Min-Kush municipality.</p>

<p>"The process was badly delayed," he said.</p>

<p>The disposal work is now in its final stages and is being carried out by the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom as well as the European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>

<p><strong>'Radioactive Lake'</strong></p>

<p>Local resident Aiman Kishkenalina said "this problem is not just for Min-Kush but for all of Kyrgyzstan".</p>

<p>Kishkenalina is one of around 5,600 residents of the run-down uranium mining town -- a ticking time bomb with grave human and environmental consequences.</p>

<p>"Some experts with dosimeters found that the (radiation) level was too high in some places," she said.</p>

<p>Local officials say it is in fact up to six times higher than the norm.</p>

<p>Radioactive waste has also been found in the river running through Min-Kush that flows into the Syr Darya, the second-largest river in the region, potentially threatening up to 80 million people.</p>

<p>"The (radioactive) content of the water that passes under the disposal area breaches admissible norms," said Bakytbek Asankulov, who is in charge of radioactive security at the Kyrgyz emergency situations ministry.</p>

<p>Asankulov also warned of the risk of a landslide where natural disasters exacerbated by climate change are becoming more frequent.</p>

<p>He said a landslide triggered by either foul weather or the earthquake-prone country's tremors could block up the river and "create a radioactive lake".</p>

<p>If the water from such a lake were to burst out, it "would reach the Fergana Valley" -- the most populated part of Central Asia where Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan meet.</p>

<p><strong>'Hair Falling Out'</strong></p>

<p>Warnings from the authorities not to drink contaminated water from the river are ignored by some local inhabitants.</p>

<p>"We eat the livestock and we drink the milk of cows" that have drunk the water, said Perizat Berdaliyeva, a retired former accountant at the uranium mine.</p>

<p>Health risks from radiation were covered up in Soviet times but, unlike many other parts of the Communist bloc, atomic industry towns like Min-Kush had no food shortages.</p>

<p>"Everything was available," Berdaliyeva remembered.</p>

<p>Scientific studies have found an abnormal prevalence of illnesses such as cancer and depleted immune systems among people living close to nuclear waste sites.</p>

<p>"My two daughters' hair is falling out. They are often sick. My husband gets nose bleeds," said Nazgul Zarylbek, 25.</p>

<p>Her house was recently pulled down by the authorities because it was contaminated with radiation. She received 5,000 euros ($5,300) in compensation and was re-housed in a different part of Min-Kush.</p>

<p>Located in a picturesque valley at an altitude of 2,000 metres (6,500 feet), Min-Kush could appear relatively normal were it not for an electronic display outside the mayor's office showing the current radiation levels.</p>

<p>The town in central Kyrgyzstan wants to turn the page from its toxic past and local officials are even hoping that it could have tourism potential.</p>

<p>"The transfer of uranium waste to a safer area will allow Min-Kush to be taken off the red list for tourism," deputy mayor Ernis said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of people in the US East Coast are reporting outage in Verizon Fios internet. According to Down Detector, the reports started coming from early Tuesday morning (local time). The heat map of the United States shows users majorly reporting issues in Boston, New York and Washington. The area covers an area of almost 300 miles or 500 kilometres from Philadelphia and Pennsylvania to Richmond and Virginia. Verizon's wireless network is one of the largest in the United States, covering 70 per cent of the country with its LTE network.</p>

<p>Several users started posting about the outage on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>"Verizon has all of us night owls and insomniacs in a tizzy because there's an apparent outage, nationwide. It's definitely here in DC, MD, and I believe Virginia," commented one user. "This verizon internet outage seems unusual. Annoying also," said another.</p>

<p>"Huge internet outage for Verizon happening overnight. It's already been out over two hours," said a third user.</p>

<p>Responding to one of the users, Verizon said, "There is either an outage or network maintenance impacting your area. We don't have full details just yet. Our apologies for any inconvenience this is causing. We're trying to get all the information from our network team so we can provide you all an update."</p>

<p>Reports of the outages spiked between midnight and 2 am EST, with the network receiving thousands of complaints during this time, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/">Down Detector</a>.</p>

<p>Ninety per cent of these complaints relate to the internet services, nine per cent were described as "total blackout" while one per cent affected TV streaming.</p>

<p>Verizon Fios is a fiber-optic internet, TV, and phone service provided by the company.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The couple, together for nine years, had announced the wedding date in January and were eagerly looking forward to their long-awaited special day.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kalina Marie was left devastated after she walked into her wedding venue, only to find most of her friends and family missing as the lavishly decorated hall wore an empty and sad look. Ms Marie had long dreamt of a fairytale wedding, surrounded by her loved ones but what she saw was every newlywed's nightmare. Documenting the incident on social media, Ms Marie, hailing from Oregon, US, posted a video where she alongside the groom, Shane, could be seen walking hand-in-hand into the reception area with long faces as only a handful of people cheered the couple.</p>

<p>The only silver lining was the couple's son who came alongside and walked them down the aisle as Miley Cyrus' "When I Look at You" played in the background as the entry song. According to Marie, she had 'digitally' invited 75 people and personally sent 25 invitations to the masquerade-themed event.</p>

<p>"The Masquerade ball that I have talked excessively about for the last 10 months. The same ball that I not only digitally invited over 75 people to. But also spent money to send 25 beautiful invitations out to," she wrote in the caption of the past, adding that only "FIVE PEOPLE SHOWED UP!!!!".</p>

<p>The couple, together for nine years, had announced the wedding date in January and were eagerly looking forward to their long-awaited special day.</p>

<p>"Like, are you kidding me!?!? As you see in the video, we enter the venue. And no one is there. The invite said 1 pm. My mum messaged me at 1:15 pm that no one was there. My husband and I finally showed up at 2 o'clock, to five people, in a venue planned for 40," she added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/massachusetts-court-revises-engagement-rules-bride-ordered-to-return-70-000-ring-6977830" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Bride vs Groom Over $70,000 Engagement Ring: US Court's Landmark Decision</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>'Little embarrased'</strong></h3>

<p>Feeling low by the disappointing turnout, Ms Marie decided to pick herself up and headed to the dancefloor to have her first dance with Shane. The video clips showed the few people in the venue joining the couple as well to make the best of the situation.</p>

<p>"It just makes me think, like, why? What did we do? Am I that bad of a person? What did my husband ever do to deserve any of this?" she questioned. "Why couldn't we matter enough for people to show up?"</p>

<p>Ms Marie posted an update a few days after the wedding, admitting that she and her husband were "a little embarrassed and still moving through the stages of grief" as well as "still dealing with anger".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a landmark ruling last month, for the first time in South Korea, a court recognised misogyny as a motive for a hate crime.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aspiring South Korean writer On Ji-goo never considered herself a feminist but changed her mind after being physically attacked by a man for having short hair.</p>

<p>"I know you are a feminist," her attacker yelled as he beat her up at the convenience store where she worked part time.</p>

<p>Her assailant, in his 20s, also severely assaulted an older man who tried to intervene, telling him: "Why aren't you supporting a fellow man?"</p>

<p>On was left with hearing loss and severe trauma but insisted on pressing charges -- resulting in a landmark ruling last month where, for the first time in South Korea, a court recognised misogyny as a motive for a hate crime.</p>

<p>"I now think I'm a feminist," On, who wanted to use her pen name for security reasons, told AFP in an interview.</p>

<p>The Changwon District Court ruling "has historical significance, but it seems to hold even greater meaning for me personally", she said.</p>

<p>The attack generated outrage in South Korea, and On became an inadvertent heroine for the country's women's rights movements.</p>

<p>Short hair has been very loosely associated with feminism in South Korea, which remains socially conservative despite its booming economy and the global popularity of its K-pop and K-drama content.</p>

<p>Same-sex marriage is not recognised, and among advanced economies it has relatively low rates of female workforce participation and one of the worst gender pay gaps.</p>

<p><strong>#MeToo, 4B Moments</strong></p>

<p>As part of the global #MeToo movement that emerged around 2017, South Korean women held enormous rights demonstrations and won victories on issues from abortion access to harsher punishment for spycam crimes.</p>

<p>Some campaigners went viral by destroying makeup products or cutting their hair short on camera to protest against the country's demanding beauty standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also saw the emergence of the extreme 4B movement, which rejects dating, sex, marriage, or childbearing with men.</p>

<p>The movement, which means "Four Nos" in Korean, has been trending since Donald Trump won the US presidential election.</p>

<p>But South Korea has also seen a recent anti-feminism backlash, with President Yoon Suk Yeol courting young men on the campaign trail with denials of institutional discrimination against women and promises to abolish Ministry of Gender Equality, which his supporters claimed was "outdated".</p>

<p>The backlash previously ensnared unsuspecting victims such as triple Olympic archery champion An San, who was bullied online during the 2021 Tokyo Games for her short hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Writer On said she followed the furore at the time, even reporting online abuse she saw.&nbsp;"When I first heard that having short hair meant you were a feminist, I found it absurd," On said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Athletes often find it more convenient to have short hair when they are training," she added, noting she had cut her own hair short before being assaulted last year because of the hot weather.</p>

<p>Archer An never officially commented on the online abuse, and her "pride and confidence, along with her ability to simply ignore negativity, were truly impressive," said On.</p>

<p>"Over time, I found myself (inspired by) her sense of dignity and confidence... thinking: 'Is there really anything that I should be ashamed of?'"</p>

<p><strong>Getting Worse?</strong></p>

<p>A spate of high-profile deepfake pornography cases were uncovered this summer, targeting female students and staff at the country's schools and universities.</p>

<p>A Seoul court jailed one perpetrator for 10 years last month for assaulting women who attended the nation's top Seoul National University, saying his actions stemmed from "hatred toward socially successful women".</p>

<p>One victim, whose campaign name is Ruma, told AFP that her assailant "wanted to emphasise that no matter how accomplished a woman is, she can be trampled on and treated like a prank by men."</p>

<p>Activists such as Jung Yun-jung, who supported On through her trial, say the situation could worsen as inequality and competition for jobs increase.</p>

<p>South Korea has one of the world's lowest birthrates as well as a falling marriage rate, with experts pointing to intense competition over jobs and housing a factor, leaving young people despondent for their futures.</p>

<p>On is still on medication to treat the mental and physical wounds of her attack, but she has found purpose in supporting other women who may find themselves victimised in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Feminism, in the end, is about believing that "women's rights are equally as important", she said.</p>

<p>"In that sense, I had indeed been a feminist even before the incident."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The prankster claims that as many as seven schools fell prey to his prank and made the hats.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladislav Bokhan, an exiled Belarusian blogger and prankster, staunchly against the Kremlin, recently fooled Russian teachers by getting them to wear tinfoil hats and posing for photographs, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/russia-teachers-tricked-nato-plot-tinfoil-hats-70vmckpj7" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Times</em></a>. Bokhan wrote letters to teachers in the Voronezh region, pretending to be from President Vladimir Putin's party and urged the teachers to make "Helmets of the Fatherland", claiming they would protect them from a malicious NATO plot. Bokhan said the prank was aimed at showing the absurdity of Putin's claim of liberating Ukraine from Nazis.</p>

<p>The letter declared that the tinfoil hats would provide protection against NATO satellites attempting to "irradiate the Russian people". To make the prank more convincing, Bokhan even referred to "United Russia" in the letter.</p>

<p>"Evil NATO members are planning to irradiate the Russian people physically and biologically. Therefore, our teachers will have to learn to resist this with the help of primitive means of protection, like a tinfoil hat," Bokhan <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://rtvi.com/news/pranker-ubedil-uchitelej-iz-rossii-sdelat-shapochki-iz-folgi-dlya-zashhity-ot-nato/" rel="noindex, nofollow">revealed </a>what he wrote in the letter on his YouTube channel.</p>

<p>"The goal of the master class is to strengthen patriotism, increase awareness and skills of teachers in the field of practical classes in civil defence, the ability to work with improvised materials to make primitive means of protection against the threat of the use of satellite and electronic equipment by NATO, and to develop skills in working with foil," the letter added.</p>

<p>The prankster claims that as many as seven schools fell prey to his prank and made the hats. One of the teachers also made a video, documenting the activity and explained why it was important.</p>

<p>"Making tinfoil hats is not only an interesting and creative activity but also an important patriotic act, symbolising a readiness to defend one's homeland from foreign threats," said the teacher.</p>

<h3><strong>Internet reacts</strong></h3>

<p>While some social media users commended the prank for its flawless execution, others sympathised with the teachers and said they were unnecessarily dragged into the issue.</p>

<p>"This is the most epic troll I've ever been lucky enough to see. I'm still wiping tears from my eyes," said one netizen, while another added: "Neat prank and the picture are worthy of being great memes."</p>

<p>A third commented: "Kinda sad tbh, a profession such as being a teacher falling for this just make my heart hurt a little, a lot of teachers from every country deserve better."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As advisers and allies of Republican President-elect Donald Trump search for personnel to staff his coming administration, one quality is absolutely paramount: unquestioning loyalty.</p>

<p>During his 2017-2021 term, Trump butted heads with key appointees, particularly those in the intelligence, national security and law enforcement communities, several of whom later recounted slow-walking or trying to talk Trump out of his most controversial plans.</p>

<p>Without people around him who are inclined to push back, the president-elect may find it easier to bend longstanding norms in pursuit of his conservative agenda, both Trump supporters and opponents say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump named his campaign chief, Susie Wiles, as White House chief of staff. And on Saturday, Trump said he would not invite back his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, nor his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, both of whom have criticized elements of Trump's conduct and policy, even as they tried to make amends in recent months.</p>

<p>Just days before the Nov. 5 election, one of Trump's former chiefs of staff, John Kelly, called him a "fascist" in an interview. One of his national security advisers, John Bolton, has repeatedly described Trump as unintelligent. And his second defense secretary, Mark Esper, recounted talking Trump out of bombing drug cartels in Mexico in his 2022 autobiography.</p>

<p>Trump has in return blasted those former cabinet-level officials, going so far as to suggest that his second joint chiefs of staff chairman, Mark Milley, should have been executed for treason. This time around, Trump has said only true believers in him - and in his "Make America Great Again" movement - will be allowed into government.</p>

<p>"President Trump has publicly said that he's learned from his first term," Mike Davis, a conservative attorney who frequently talks to the president-elect, told Reuters. Davis, who helped Trump get his Supreme Court picks through the Senate as a high-ranking Capitol Hill aide, has drawn frequent praise from Trump's most conservative allies.</p>

<p>"Political appointees require both competency and loyalty. You can't have just one or the other. You need both."</p>

<p>On X last week, Davis put it bluntly: "Before asking me for help, I am going to ask you to provide me specific and concrete evidence of your loyalty to Trump," he wrote. "If you cannot provide a lot of that, stop asking me."</p>

<p><strong>A Forensic Look</strong></p>

<p>To keep actors considered disloyal out of Trump's government, his transition team is taking a forensic look at every potential appointee for signs they might turn against their boss, even for lower-level appointees like assistant and deputy secretaries, according to two people involved in the effort.</p>

<p>Researchers contracted by Trump's transition team are sifting through potential appointees' past statements to see if they have ever spoken negatively about Trump, according to one of those people involved in the transition effort, who has direct knowledge of the matter. They are also checking if potential appointees have donated to Democrats - or even to Republicans who have sharply criticized the president-elect, that person said.</p>

<p>While such donations or negative statements are not necessarily disqualifiers, the person added, they are demerits.</p>

<p>Davis singled out the attorney general as a particularly crucial position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, after he declined to shut down inquiries into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russian officials. Trump later said that hiring Sessions was his "biggest mistake."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump also fired his first FBI director, James Comey, under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>With a more loyal attorney general and FBI director, Trump allies say, he would be less likely to face damaging probes. Trump would also likely face less resistance if he tries to make good on campaign trail pledges to investigate opponents, including Democratic President Joe Biden, a matter of serious concern for Democrats and civil servants.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Trump did not address the dynamics of how potential political appointees were being selected, beyond saying decisions on key appointments were imminent. Three appointments - White House chief of staff, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and border czar - have already been announced.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Democratic National Committee expressed concern that Trump was choosing loyalists they said would put Trump's interests over those of the nation.</p>

<p>"Instead of making sure agencies and law enforcement have the best and the brightest with the resources they need, Trump and his cronies are looking to dole out job offers to loyalists who will put Trump ahead of the American people," said Alex Floyd, a DNC spokesperson.</p>

<p><strong>Loyalty To Police - And The Man</strong></p>

<p>While it is normal for presidents to choose loyal allies for key appointments, the focus on loyalty over subject-matter expertise goes beyond the norm, according to interviews with five Trump advisers and public statements made by the president-elect's associates.</p>

<p>In many cabinets, presidents often reach out to the various wings of their own party so that distinct ideological factions have a seat at the table. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, said on the trail that she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet.</p>

<p>"We're going to give people the role based on their capacity - and their fidelity and loyalty to the policy, as well as to the man," Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of Trump's transition effort, told the Financial Times last month.</p>

<p>One Trump adviser predicted the president-elect would bring much of his campaign to the White House, many members of whom have proven their loyalty in Trump's eyes by running a disciplined and tight-lipped campaign. Last time around, that adviser noted, Trump hired officials from the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>"Loyalty is super important," said the Trump adviser, who was not authorized to speak to the media.</p>

<p>"There will be a lot more of the campaign staff that will transition over to the White House. Last time, a lot of party folks ended up in the White House, but their loyalty wasn't to the president. It was to themselves."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What started with four Chinese students riding nearly 50 kilometres for soup dumplings turned into a night-time cycling trend, with thousands participating in it.</p>

<p>Dubbed the "Night Riding Great Army", the university students travelled on a straight road that connected Zhengzhou, the largest city in Henan province, with Kaifeng, an ancient city famed for its historic sites and soup dumplings.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In China, a trend of night bike rides led by university students cycling from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng gained popularity, with over 17,000 students participating. Initially inspired by students seeking Kaifeng's famous soup dumplings.<br />
<br />
However, issues emerged, including traffic… <a href="https://t.co/BTvurkGLyB">pic.twitter.com/BTvurkGLyB</a></p>
— Volcaholic ? (@volcaholic1) <a href="https://twitter.com/volcaholic1/status/1855613780098425166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The authorities initially encouraged the trend to promote local tourism but soon scrambled to curb the craze. Police officials were deployed, and bike lanes were shut after its popularity went out of hand and the intercity traffic was brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Kaifeng city government cited the risk of riders falling and sustaining injuries, or blocking other road users from accessing medical care.</p>

<p>"(You) have demonstrated the wilful whimsy of youth," it said, "but... more and more people are starting to worry about the hidden dangers".</p>

<p>While piles of discarded bikes overwhelmed several streets in Kaifeng, commuters in Zhengzhou struggled to find one for themselves to ride back home.<br />
<br />
Zhengkai Avenue, the main road connecting Zhengzhou with Kaifeng, was crammed with an endless flow of cyclists taking over the five car lanes in some sections.</p>

<p>The authorities in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou then closed bike lanes on Zhengkai Avenue over the weekend to stop the cyclists from entering the ancient city.</p>

<p>On social media, some students even claimed that the colleges and universities in Zhengzhou restricted students from leaving the campus to prevent them from joining the cycling crowd.<br />
<br />
Three major bike-sharing platforms in Zhengzhou issued a joint statement and warned people that their bikes would get locked down automatically if they were taken out of the city.</p>

<p>The trend reportedly started after four women college students from Zhengzhou decided to ride for several hours on shared bikes to reach Kaifeng in search of 'guan tang bao', the city's famous oversized soup dumplings.<br />
<br />
The posts from their journey later gained massive attention on social media, triggering a new trend on the Chinese streets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump has named Mike Waltz, a Congressman from Florida and co-chair of the India Caucus, as the new National Security Adviser.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has named Mike Waltz, a Congressman from Florida and co-chair of the India Caucus, as the new National Security Adviser. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-appoints-mike-waltz-india-caucus-head-as-national-security-adviser-6998168">Mr Waltz's appointment</a> to such an important post hints at a positive future for US-India relations under Mr Trump's second presidency.<br />
<br />
<strong>Five key points in Mr Waltz's journey from military service to politics:</strong><br />
<br />
1) Early life and family background: Born in Boynton Beach, Florida, and raised by a single mother in Jacksonville, Mr Waltz grew up in a family with a strong military tradition. His grandfather served as Navy Chief.<br />
<br />
2) Military service: Mr Waltz's military journey began at the Virginia Military Institute from where he graduated before going on to serve as a Green Beret. He served 27 years in the US Army and National Guard, retiring during his second term in Congress. Mr Waltz completed multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa.<br />
<br />
3) Political career: Serving in the US House of Representatives since 2019, Mr Waltz has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden's foreign policy vis-a-vis China, Afghanistan and Ukraine. He criticised the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
4) Advocacy for strong foreign policy: Mr Waltz has consistently called for a stronger US foreign policy, especially in relation to China and Ukraine. He has urged Europe to increase its support for Ukraine amid the war with Russia, and, in the past, advocated for a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br />
<br />
5) Personal life: Mike Waltz is also a proud family man. He is married to Dr. Julia Nesheiwat, a combat veteran who has served in multiple presidential administrations and was also the Homeland Security Advisor to President Trump. They have a daughter in college and a baby son.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks between WHO member states on a landmark global accord on handling future pandemics will roll into 2025 after countries decided Monday there were too many gaps to seal a deal this year.</p>

<p>The key faultlines in the negotiations are between Western nations with major pharmaceutical industry sectors, and poorer countries who do not want to be sidelined when the next pandemic strikes.</p>

<p>The negotiations, which kicked off in February 2022, are being held at the World Health Organization's headquarters in Geneva, between the WHO's 194 member states.</p>

<p>Countries "think they still have work to do", talks co-chair Anne-Claire Amprou told a press conference.</p>

<p>"Today member states agreed we need to conclude the agreement as soon as possible, and continue negotiations into 2025, with the goal of concluding the agreement by the next World Health Assembly scheduled in May.</p>

<p>"We are moving in the right direction," she insisted.</p>

<p>In December 2021, fearing a repeat of the devastation wrought by Covid-19 -- which killed millions of people, crippled health systems and crashed economies -- countries decided to draft a new accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.</p>

<p>While much of the draft text has been agreed, disputes remain over some key provisions, notably over sharing access to pathogens with pandemic potential -- and then equitably sharing the benefits derived from them, such as vaccines, tests and treatments.</p>

<p>In June at the annual World Health Assembly -- the WHO's top decision-making body -- countries agreed to give themselves until the next assembly in May 2025 to conclude and adopt the agreement -- and to get it done by the end of the year if possible.</p>

<p>To finish this year, countries would have had to call the third-ever special session of the assembly in December -- with Monday the last possible day to make the decision.</p>

<p>However, countries accepted Monday they were not in a position to have the agreement's text finished so soon.</p>

<p>And the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency also risks further shaking up the process. In his first term, he began pulling the United States out of the WHO before current President Joe Biden reversed the decision.</p>

<p>The two-week, 12th round of talks began on November 4, but the first week concluded Friday with little progress achieved on agreeing outstanding articles under discussion.</p>

<p>Talks co-chair Precious Matsoso said that all countries want to be better prepared and prevent the next disaster from happening.</p>

<p>"Our biggest fear though is that when the next pandemic happens, it will be more severe than what we experienced with Covid-19," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A nine-year study published last month found that elephants avoided farms with the ferocious bees 86 percent of the time.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"We used to hate elephants a lot," Kenyan farmer Charity Mwangome says, pausing from her work under the shade of a baobab tree.</p>

<p>The bees humming in the background are part of the reason why her hatred has dimmed.</p>

<p>The diminutive 58-year-old said rapacious elephants would often destroy months of work in her farmland that sits between two parts of Kenya's world-renowned Tsavo National Park.</p>

<p>Beloved by tourists -- who contribute around 10 percent of Kenya's GDP -- the animals are loathed by most local farmers, who form the backbone of the nation's economy.</p>

<p>Elephant conservation has been a roaring success: numbers in Tsavo rose from around 6,000 in the mid-1990s to almost 15,000 elephants in 2021, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).</p>

<p>But the human population also expanded, encroaching on grazing and migration routes for the herds.</p>

<p>Resulting clashes are becoming the number one cause of elephant deaths, says KWS.</p>

<p>Refused compensation when she lost her crops, Mwangome admits she was mad with the conservationists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But a long-running project by charity Save the Elephants offered her an unlikely solution -- deterring some of nature's biggest animals with some of its smallest: African honeybees.</p>

<p>Cheery yellow beehive fences now protect several local plots, including Mwangome's.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A nine-year study published last month found that elephants avoided farms with the ferocious bees 86 percent of the time.</p>

<p>"The beehive fences came to our rescue," said Mwangome.</p>

<p><strong>Hacking Nature</strong></p>

<p>The deep humming of 70,000 bees is enough to make many flee, including a six-tonne elephant, but Loise Kawira calmly removes a tray in her apiary to demonstrate the intricate combs of wax and honey.</p>

<p>Kawira, who joined Save the Elephants in 2021 as their consultant beekeeper, trains and monitors farmers in the delicate art.</p>

<p>The project supports 49 farmers, whose plots are surrounded by 15 connected hives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each is strung on greased wire a few metres off the ground, which protects them from badgers and insects, but also means they shake when disturbed by a hungry elephant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Once the elephants hear the sound of the bees and the smell, they run away," Kawira told AFP.</p>

<p>"It hacks the interaction between elephants and bees," added Ewan Brennan, local project coordinator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been effective, but recent droughts, exacerbated by climate change, have raised challenges.</p>

<p>"(In) the total heat, the dryness, bees have absconded," said Kawira.</p>

<p>It is also expensive -- about 150,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,100) to install hives -- well beyond the means of subsistence farmers, though the project organisers say it is still cheaper than electric fences.</p>

<p><strong>'I Was Going To Die'</strong></p>

<p>Just moments after AFP arrived at Mwanajuma Kibula's farm, which abuts one of the Tsavo parks, her beehive fence had seen off an elephant.</p>

<p>The five-tonne animal, its skin caked in red mud, rumbled into the area and then did an abrupt about-face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I know my crops are protected," Kibula said with palpable relief.</p>

<p>Kibula, 48, also harvests honey twice a year from her hives, making 450 shillings per jar -- enough to pay school fees for her children.</p>

<p>She is fortunate to have protection from the biggest land mammals on Earth.</p>

<p>"An elephant ripped off my roof, I had to hide under the bed because I knew I was going to die," said a less-fortunate neighbour, Hendrita Mwalada, 67.</p>

<p>For those who can't afford bees, Save the Elephants offers other solutions, such as metal-sheet fences that clatter when shaken by approaching elephants, and diesel- or chilli-soaked rags that deter them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not always enough.&nbsp;"I have tried planting but every time the crops are ready, the elephants come and destroy the crops," Mwalada told AFP.</p>

<p>"That has been the story of my life, a life full of too much struggling."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Ryanair flight from Tirana, Albania, to Manchester Airport made an emergency landing at London Stansted on Sunday, November 10, after a passenger died onboard. The flight, which had already crossed Switzerland and France, diverted shortly before 8 pm, according to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/11/ryanair-flight-manchester-engulfed-chaos-man-suddenly-dies-mid-air-21972642/#:~:text=A%20Ryanair%20flight%20was%20forced,medical%20emergency'%20mid%2Dair." rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro.&nbsp;</a></em>Upon landing, emergency crews, including paramedics, police, and an air ambulance, met the aircraft. Despite their efforts, the man, whose age and identity have not been disclosed, was pronounced dead on the scene.</p>

<p>The incident caused considerable disruption onboard as passengers grappled with the unexpected situation.&nbsp;According to an eyewitness, the man began "having convulsions" before crew members rushed to his aid, moving him to the aisle where CPR was administered in a desperate bid to save his life.</p>

<p>"He stopped breathing and everything went into chaos. A few of us with first aid training jumped in to help and started CPR while the defibrillator was set. Two aircrew members and three passengers managed to keep doing CPR as instructed by the defibrillator for 25 minutes when we finally landed in an emergency in London," he told the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/everything-went-chaos-horror-ryanair-30348173" rel="nofollow, noindex">Manchester Evening News</a></em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/everything-went-chaos-horror-ryanair-30348173" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p>"The paramedics continued for another 30 minutes when we were all instructed to leave the plane. After about another hour, the ambulance was still there but we boarded again with a new aircrew to continue the trip to Manchester, without the man and his friends. I asked and was told that, unfortunately, the man did not make it. I was devastated to learn the sad news," he added.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the East of England Ambulance Service said: "One ambulance, one Hazardous Area Response Team vehicle, one paramedic car and Essex and Herts Air Ambulance were called to Stansted Airport on Sunday evening following reports of a man with a medical emergency on an aircraft. Sadly, despite the best efforts of all involved, the man had died at the scene."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Thai woman has been experiencing nearly two decades of constant, stinging pain after a suture needle was left in her vagina post-childbirth, according to a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3285795/thai-woman-suffers-18-years-pain-after-childbirth-finds-needle-left-vagina-during-suturing" rel="noindex, nofollow">SCMP</a></em>. The 36-year-old woman from the Cho Airong district in the Narathiwat province has been suffering severe abdominal discomfort since then but unable to find any treatment. She approached the village headman Aruman Waenogi, earlier this month, who in turn contacted a non-profit organisation (NGO) named Pavena Foundation for Children and Women for help.</p>

<p>The NGO, dedicated to assisting victims of abuse. rape, harassment and human trafficking took note of the issue and started coordinating with the Narathiwat Provincial Public Health Office.</p>

<p>According to the NGO, 18 years ago, the nurse dropped a needle in the victim's vagina when she was receiving stitches. The doctor attempted to fish it out using his fingers but could not retrieve it. Worried about the excessive bleeding, the doctor opted to close the wound, leaving the needle stuck inside. It wasn't until 2023 that the woman, troubled by the pain, went to have an X-ray at a government hospital and discovered the needle.</p>

<h3><strong>No surgery yet</strong></h3>

<p>As of the last update, the woman had no surgery officially scheduled but was required to visit the hospital four times a month for regular monitoring. "Currently, the young woman still has to travel to the hospital about 3-4 times a month. Even though she uses the gold card for treatment, there are travel expenses," the NGO stated.</p>

<p>The NGO has contacted the local security office to arrange for hospital visits and pledged to continue following up on her care. It is also unclear as to whether she will take legal action against the hospital and doctor who left the needle inside her, leading to lifelong problems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli researchers and their colleagues from the United States developed an antibody-based treatment that empowers the body's immune system to effectively attack cancer cells and prevent their spread, Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>WIS-led scientists revealed that a form of breast cancer known as triple-negative breast cancer encourages nearby immune cells to form "molecular bridges." These bridges prevent immune cells from attacking the tumor, resulting in immune suppression.</p>

<p>The research team demonstrated that an antibody treatment blocking the formation of these bridges can revive the immune system's ability to mount a robust attack on cancer cells, halting tumor progression in mouse models. They explained that while the breast cancer cells themselves express very low levels of the protein CD84, which is used to build the bridges, they induce nearby immune cells to produce large quantities of this protein, creating the bridges that suppress the immune response.</p>

<p>The study also found that higher levels of CD84 in patients' tumors were linked to shorter survival times. Experiments with genetically engineered mice lacking CD84 revealed smaller tumor growth, highlighting how CD84 within the tumor environment suppresses T cell activity in the immune system.</p>

<p>Administered twice weekly in mice with developing breast cancer, the antibody significantly slowed tumor growth and, in some cases, led to full recovery.</p>

<p>The team noted that the antibody selectively targets cells with elevated CD84 levels, sparing healthy immune cells, which express this protein at lower levels, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The researchers suggested that this treatment approach could be applied to various cancer types byfocusing on the tumor microenvironment rather than the cancer cells themselves.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

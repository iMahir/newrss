       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon over the last day have killed at least 40 people including several children, Lebanese authorities said on Saturday, after heavy Israeli bombardment pounded the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut overnight.</p>

<p>At least seven people were killed in the coastal city of Tyre late on Friday, Lebanon's health ministry said. The Israeli military has previously ordered swathes of the city to evacuate but there were no orders published by the Israeli military spokesperson on social media platform X before Friday's strikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ministry said two children were among the dead. Rescue operations were ongoing and other body parts retrieved in the aftermath of the attack would undergo DNA testing to identify them, the ministry added.</p>

<p>Strikes in nearby towns on Saturday killed 13 people, including seven medics from rescue groups affiliated to Hezbollah and its ally Amal, the health ministry said.</p>

<p>At least 20 more people were killed in Israeli strikes on Saturday across the eastern plains around the historic city of Baalbek, the health ministry said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had struck Hezbollah infrastructure sites in the areas of Tyre and Baalbek, including fighters, "operational apartments," and weapons stores.</p>

<p>The Lebanese health ministry said Israeli attacks have killed at least 3,136 people and wounded 13,979 in Lebanon over the last year. The toll includes 619 women and 194 children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has been locked in fighting with Lebanese armed group Hezbollah since October 2023, but fighting has escalated dramatically since late September of this year. Israel has intensified and expanded its bombing campaign, and Hezbollah has ramped up daily rocket and drone attacks against Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Iran-backed group announced more than 20 operations on Saturday, as well as one that it said fighters carried out the previous day against a military factory south of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>More than a dozen Israeli strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight, once a bustling collection of neighbourhoods and a key stronghold of Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Now, many buildings have been almost entirely flattened, with Hezbollah's yellow flags jutting out from the ruins, according to Reuters reporters who were taken on a tour of the area by Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Some buildings were partially damaged by the strikes, leading some floors to collapse and sending furniture and other personal belongings spilling onto parked cars below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Men and women were picking through the rubble for their belongings, shoving blankets and mats under their arms or into black plastic bags. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are trying to gather as many (of our possessions) as we can, so we can manage to live off them, nothing more," said Hassan Hannawi, one of the men looking for his belongings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Princess Kate attended a Remembrance Day event in London on Saturday, in her latest public engagement after undergoing preventive treatment for cancer this year.</p>

<p>Kate arrived for the Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall wearing a black dress adorned with a red poppy, which has become a symbol of respect for those who have lost their lives in conflict.</p>

<p>She was accompanied by her husband Prince William and other members of the royal family and was followed shortly afterwards by King Charles, whose wife Queen Camilla has cancelled engagements as she recovers from a chest infection.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales said in September she had finished chemotherapy, but her path to full recovery would be long. At the time, the 42-year-old said she would be carrying out a handful of public engagements later in the year.</p>

<p>Her last public appearance was in October when she met the bereaved families of three young girls who were murdered at a dance class in northwest England.</p>

<p>Kate is also expected to attend the main Remembrance Day ceremony on Sunday, Buckingham Palace said on Friday.</p>

<p>The ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial is held on the nearest Sunday to Nov. 11 to mark the end of World War One, and pays tribute to those who lost their lives in conflict.</p>

<p>Camilla hopes to return to public duties early next week, the palace said. She pulled out of planned engagements this week after her doctors advised a period of rest. She would mark Remembrance Day privately at home, the palace added.</p>

<p>In South Africa, Prince William told British media on Thursday that the past year had probably been the "hardest" of his life after Kate and his father King Charles were diagnosed with cancer.</p>

<p>Prince William visited South Africa as part a climate-focused trip planned around his multimillion dollar Earthshot Prize, created to encourage innovations to combat environmental problems.</p>

<p>As he prepared to leave South Africa, Prince William said, in remarks published on Saturday by British media, he was trying to carry out his public duties "differently" from previous generations.</p>

<p>"I'm doing it with maybe a smaller R in the royal," he told reporters. "It's more about impact philanthropy, collaboration, convening, and helping people.</p>

<p>"And I'm also going to throw empathy in there as well, because I really care about what I do. ... I think we could do with some more empathetic leadership around the world," Prince William added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US leader Joe Biden will receive President-elect Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday, the presidency said in a statement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday after the US leader pledged an orderly transfer of power following the Republican's decisive election victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden and Trump will meet at the Oval Office at 11:00 am (1600 GMT), the White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president's return to power in January.</p>

<p>Trump sealed a historic comeback to the White House in the November 5 election, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of US politics overshadowed by his hardline, disruptive right-wing politics.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a "fascist."</p>

<p>Exit polls showed that voters' top concern remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>Biden, who dropped out of the race in July over concerns about his ability to continue at the age of 81, called Trump to congratulate him after his election win.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a unique online romance scam, a man in Tianjin, China, fell victim to a bizarre "marriage bed burning" ritual, costing him Rs 11 lakh.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A love-struck man from Tianjin lost a considerable sum of money in a bizarre ritual for a cunning online romance scam, according to<em> the South China Morning Post.</em> The victim, surnamed Wang, was found by police to have been misled by a false story involving an ex-husband who was dead and a superstitious "marriage bed burning" ceremony.</p>

<p>Wang's online romance with Li, a woman who portrayed herself as wealthy and single and who owns multiple properties. Li was ready for a new married life, but she asked for a rather bizarre favour-Wang was to perform a 'marriage bed burning' ritual to appease the spirit of her former husband-a necessary step, she claimed, to ensure a prosperous marriage.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3285568/man-pays-china-lover-burn-old-marital-bed-new-start-ritual-then-she-vanishes"><em>SCMP,</em></a> Wang was told all Li's properties were inherited from her ex, and the ritual would be a "thank you gesture" for him, the mainland media outlet Hongxing News reported on October 31. She told Wang he needed to spend 100,000 yuan (Rs 11,81,858) on the ritual to show his sincerity. She required Wang to transfer her the money without showing up at the ritual because it would bring bad luck to him.</p>

<p>After Wang sent over the money, Li disappeared, and Wang was left heartbroken and penniless.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the increasing sophistication of online scams and the vulnerability of those seeking love and companionship in the virtual world. Though ancient superstitions-even primitive rituals-are the main traditions in some parts of China, they are, in fact, unwittingly used by fraudsters to manipulate their victims.</p>

<p>The more one seeks his/her perfect match online, the more cautious that individual needs to be. Experts say that when meeting acquaintances from the Internet, identities must be verified. Personal data must not be communicated unless absolutely necessary, and any requests for money or other such transactions must be suspect.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sailor was found floating in the middle of the ocean several nautical miles off the coast of Australia more than a day after he fell overboard a cargo ship.</p>

<p>The man, who was sailing in the vessel Double Delight - a Singapore-based bulk carrier. The sailor, who fell while he was out on deck late at night, was found 8 nautical miles off the coast of Newcastle, a harbour city north of Sydney in Australia.</p>

<p>A search was initiated shortly after 11:30 pm local time on Thursday when the ship's staff informed coastal authorities in Sydney. However, no contact or visibility could be detected in the night-long operations.</p>

<p>The rescue operation, that went on late into the night, involved two life boats, two helicopters and an aircraft.</p>

<p>Authorities got information about a man found floating in the ocean by recreational fishermen who were returning to the harbour late on Friday evening. An ambulance service from New South Wales was pressed into effect and paramedics were rushed to a beach in Swansea, a neighbouring town south of Newcastle, to attend to the man found at sea.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the coalstal authorities in Sydney said, "The patient, a man in his 20s, reportedly was in the water for about 24 hours. He was wearing a life jacket, he was conscious, he was able to communicate with us, but he was very cold and absolutely exhausted."</p>

<p>The sailor has been admitted to a hospital for the required treatment. The authorities are yet to record his statement to understand what exactly happened and how he went overboard in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>The fact that he was found with a life jacket fastened to him suggests it might have been an intentional jump, however, there is no clarity on that yet.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Days after an attack on Hindus at a Brampton temple, Canadian MP Chandra Arya has come down heavily on politicians pitting Hindus and Sikhs on "opposing sides".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after an attack on Hindus at a Brampton temple, Canadian MP Chandra Arya has come down heavily on politicians pitting Hindus and Sikhs on “opposing sides” and asserted that the Hindu-Canadians and the Sikhs are on one side and the Khalistanis on the other.</p>

<p>Due to the deliberate actions of some politicians and the influence of Khalistanis, Canadians now mistakenly equate Khalistanis with Sikhs, Arya said in wake of several Canadian politician trying to portray the Brampton incident as a clash between the Canadian Hindu and Sikh communities.</p>

<p>Protesters carrying Khalistani flags clashed with devotees at a Hindu Sabha temple and disrupted an event co-organised by the temple authorities and the Indian Consulate on November 3 at Brampton, a city in Ontario's Greater Toronto Area.</p>

<p>“Politicians are deliberately avoiding recognising and mentioning Khalistanis as responsible for this attack or are shifting the blame to other entities. They are misleading Canadians by framing this as an issue between Hindus and Sikhs,” Arya, a member of Parliament from Nepean, Ontario, said in a post on X on Friday.</p>

<p>“Politicians are portraying Hindus and Sikhs as opposing sides regarding the attack on the temple by Khalistani extremists. This picture is simply not true. The two sides are actually Hindu-Canadians and the vast majority of Sikh-Canadians on one side, and Khalistanis on the other,” Arya said in the post on X which had both a video and a text statement.</p>

<p>Strongly condemning the attack by Khalistani extremists “on behalf of Hindu-Canadians and the vast majority of Sikh-Canadians,” Arya also pointed out how it is common in Canada to see Hindus visiting Sikh Gurudwaras and Sikhs visiting Hindu temples.</p>

<p>“Politicians may try their best to divide Hindus and Sikhs. We can—and must—prove them wrong,” he appealed. “We, as Hindus and Sikhs, will not and should not allow vested interests to divide us for their political gain.” The relations between India and Canada have come under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a “potential” involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as “absurd.” Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was designated a terrorist by India.</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.</p>

<p>India has expelled six Canadian diplomats and withdrawn its high commissioner Sanjay Verma and other "targeted" officials from Canada after strongly dismissing Ottawa's charges.</p>

<p>Arya, who has been vocal on the issue earlier too, also mentioned the Sikh community leader and former British Columbia Premier Ujjal Dosanjh, who said that a silent majority of Sikhs do not want to have anything to do with Khalistan and that they just don't speak out because they're afraid of violence and violent repercussions.</p>

<p>Dosanjh said Khalistani supporters control many of the Gurudwaras in Canada but the silent Sikhs “still hold power over which politicians get elected,” Arya said.</p>

<p>“Due to the deliberate actions of some politicians and the influence of Khalistanis, Canadians now mistakenly equate Khalistanis with Sikhs,” he said, adding, Hindus and Sikhs alike must educate Canadians "that we stand united in our fight against Khalistani extremists and their political backers.” He also appealed to Hindus and Sikhs in Canada to urge the community leaders “not to provide a platform at any of our events or temples to politicians unless they publicly recognise and expressly condemn Khalistani extremism.” Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has acknowledged the presence of Khalistan supporters in Canada but said they do not represent the Sikh community as a whole.</p>

<p>His comments came during Diwali celebrations at Ottawa's Parliament Hill recently amid an ongoing diplomatic row with India over Nijjar's killing.</p>

<p>“There are many supporters of Khalistan in Canada, but they do not represent the Sikh Community as a whole. Similarly, there are supporters of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's government in Canada, but they do not represent all Hindu Canadians,” Trudeau said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of people from around the globe will gather next week for COP29, the annual UN climate summit, in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of people from around the globe will gather next week for COP29, the annual UN climate summit, in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku.</p>

<p>But as each year's summit has produced its own set of promises, plans, and paperwork to chase, the rationale for these discussions can be hard to follow.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to know about why COP, short for Conference of the Parties, matters:</p>

<h3><strong>Why do we have a yearly COP?</strong></h3>

<p>Because climate change will affect every country, regardless of whether it contributed to the problem, it demands global solutions that can address the diversity of needs across countries.</p>

<p>In signing the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that launched the global negotiations, the parties that agreed to it took pains to differentiate between the wealthy nations that caused the bulk of warming and poorer countries that suffer disproportionately from it.</p>

<p>Put another way, the talks are framed around the idea that the countries that benefited the most from industrialising should take the most responsibility for dealing with the warming that resulted.</p>

<p>Addressing that imbalance has become more difficult as developing countries' economies have grown and rich nations juggle competing costs including war.</p>

<h3><strong>What can a yearly summit achieve?</strong></h3>

<p>The summit provides a place for countries to discuss solutions, including energy policies, financing schemes or funding needs.</p>

<p>Nearly every summit is also attended by world leaders, giving an important signal that their countries are committed to the UNFCCC goals. The leaders' presence also helps countries hold one another accountable for past promises.</p>

<p>But the annual COP is just the main event in a continuous process. Country representatives meet year round to build support for new climate action proposals ahead of the COP, where they can be agreed by consensus of all countries.</p>

<h3><strong>Is the process working?</strong></h3>

<p>While each summit is meant to advance global climate action from the year before, the event also offers countries a chance to show their citizens the problem is being addressed.</p>

<p>Importantly, the exercise has seen countries counting and reporting their emissions, and has helped move hundreds of billions of dollars in climate aid to developing nations.</p>

<p>By requiring decisions by consensus, the process also ensures strong global support for agreed actions, improving the chances these actions will be implemented.</p>

<p>But the pace of progress has been too slow to contain the rise in global temperatures. Since COP summits began in 1995, both emissions and temperatures have continued to rise, meaning the world is on track for extreme climate change.</p>

<p>Proponents of the UNFCCC process say there is no alternative for negotiating major socioeconomic changes to try to limit global warming.</p>

<h3><strong>What will we get out of COP29?</strong></h3>

<p>This year's summit is hoping for a few headline agreements: a new annual climate finance target, a deal to get multilateral carbon credit markets working, and more aid money pledged for countries already hit by costly climate disasters.</p>

<p>Beyond that, negotiators will continue to work on technical agreements that build on work done at previous summits.</p>

<p>Outside the formal COP framework, groups of countries could launch their own initiatives or pledge funding for specific projects. Companies will likely announce commercial deals related to climate action, while financiers try to raise cash for climate investments.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Azerbaijan's role in COP29?</strong></h3>

<p>Azerbaijan holds the presidency of COP29 this year, when the rotating COP presidency fell to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Next year Brazil will serve as Latin America's host for COP30.</p>

<p>As summit host, a country works the entire year to steer pre-summit negotiations and lobby other governments for ambitious action. This gives the presidency an important part in defining the summit's priorities.</p>

<h3><strong>What else happens at COP?</strong></h3>

<p>Beyond the country negotiations, the COP summit offers a chance for anyone to try to draw attention - or funding - to their cause.</p>

<p>Hundreds of side events see activists and scientists rubbing shoulders with industry lobbyists and banking heavyweights.</p>

<p>Public-facing conference stages host panel discussions on topics from ocean acidification to designing carbon offset projects.</p>

<p>An exhibition hall, dubbed the "Green Zone," features discussions led by national delegations, non-profit organisations and corporations.</p>

<p>While some summits have seen big organized protests, such as the rally of thousands outside of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, the last two conferences in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have allowed for protests only in designated, roped-off areas.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan, which also has banned public protests, will likely see little civic action outside of the high-security conference site.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Qatar has withdrawn as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal and warned Hamas that its Doha office "no longer serves its purpose", a diplomatic source told AFP on Saturday.</p>

<p>Qatar, with the United States and Egypt, has been engaged in months of fruitless negotiations for a truce with a hostage and prisoner releases.</p>

<p>"The Qataris informed both the Israelis and Hamas that as long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate," the source said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose," the source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The informed source said Qatar had already "notified both sides, Israel and Hamas as well as the US administration" of its decision.</p>

<p>"The Qataris conveyed to the US administration that they would be ready to re-engage in mediation when both sides... demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table", the source added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Qatar, which is home to a major US military base, has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with Washington's blessing.</p>

<p>During the talks after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel last year, both Qatari and US officials indicated that the militant group would remain in Doha as long as its presence offered a viable channel of communication.</p>

<p>Qatar said in April that it was reassessing its role as a mediator in the conflict as it was facing criticism, notably from Israeli and US politicians.</p>

<p>At that time, the Qataris gave a similar message over the status of the Hamas office, prompting Hamas officials to leave for Turkey, the diplomatic source said.</p>

<p>But they returned after two weeks at the request of the United States and Israel, as negotiations were "ineffective" while they were in Turkey, the source said.</p>

<p>Apart from a one-week pause in the fighting late last year, during which scores of Hamas-held hostages were released, successive rounds of negotiations have failed to halt the war.</p>

<p>To break the deadlock near the end of US President Joe Biden's term and in the run-up to this week's US elections, Washington and Doha last month announced fresh in-person talks to explore new options.</p>

<p>But the latest initiative produced no breakthrough.</p>

<p>The diplomatic source said Qatar had "concluded that there is insufficient willingness from either side, with the mediation efforts becoming more about politics and elections rather than a serious attempt to secure peace".</p>

<p>Qatar "advised the US administration and both parties that it would not accept being subjected to political exploitation aimed at gaining political leverage at Qatar's expense while misleading public perception", the source added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Saturday seven people including two children were killed in Israeli strikes on the southern city of Tyre a day earlier, with rescuers still searching for missing people under the rubble.</p>

<p>"Israeli enemy strikes on the city of Tyre killed seven people including two girls, and injured 46 others," the ministry said, adding that body parts had been found and will be "identified with DNA testing".</p>

<p>It added that rubble was being cleared following the strikes as part of ongoing efforts to locate missing persons.</p>

<p>The ministry had on Friday reported a toll of three killed and 30 injured in the strikes.</p>

<p>AFP photos showed rescuers carrying bodies on stretchers amid the wreckage, as rubble and twisted metal were strewn across the street.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Lebanon's official National News Agency had said the deadly strikes targeted three buildings in the coastal city, causing "massive damage to dozens of homes".</p>

<p>The NNA also said "enemy fighter jets" destroyed two heritage houses in the southern city of Nabatiyeh.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said on Saturday it targeted Israeli troops, locations and military sites including a base and an area north of Haifa, in addition to downing an Israeli Hermes 450 drone over a south Lebanon village.</p>

<p>Israel intensified its air campaign on Lebanon in September and later sent in ground troops after a year of cross-border clashes.</p>

<p>The escalation came after nearly a year of low-intensity, cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>More than 3,110 people have been killed in Lebanon since the cross-border exchanges began, according to the Lebanese health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Queen Camilla will not attend Remembrance Day events to recover from a chest infection, but hopes to return to public duties early next week, Buckingham Palace said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Camilla, the wife of King Charles, pulled out of planned engagements this week after suffering a chest infection for which her doctors advised a period of rest.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old will miss the annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall on Saturday and the main Remembrance Day ceremony on Sunday.</p>

<p>The ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial is held on the nearest Sunday to Nov. 11 to mark the end of World War One, and pays tribute to those who lost their lives in conflict.</p>

<p>"Following doctors' guidance to ensure a full recovery from a seasonal chest infection, and to protect others from any potential risk, Her Majesty will not attend this weekend's Remembrance events," a palace spokesperson said, adding she would mark the occasion privately at home.</p>

<p>Princess Kate, 42, who is gradually returning to public engagements after preventive treatment for cancer this year, will attend the Remembrance events alongside her husband Prince William, Charles and other members of the royal family.</p>

<p>The Princess of Wales said in September she had finished chemotherapy, but her path to full recovery would be long.</p>

<p>At the time, she said she would be carrying out a handful of public engagements later in the year. Her last public appearance was in October when she met the bereaved families of three young girls who were murdered at a dance class in northwest England.</p>

<p>Charles, who is undergoing treatment for cancer which was diagnosed in February, recently visited Australia and Samoa.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Dozens of inhabitants of flooded communities said that by the time they received the regional government's alert, muddy water was already surrounding their cars, submerging streets of their towns and pouring into their homes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The water was already knee-high on the ground floor of the hotel where Aitana Puchal had taken refugee when she received a text alert from the regional government of Valencia at 8 pm on Oct. 29 warning people to shelter in place from severe flash floods.</p>

<p>"We could have done with (the warning) about six hours earlier," said the 23-year-old, who had fled with other local residents and guests to the first floor of the hotel near the town of Paiporta. "We were all calming down a little from the panic and drying our feet." &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Others were not so fortunate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carlos Martinez, another Paiporta resident, told local television the flood alert came when he was stranded in a tree "seeing bodies floating past."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dozens of inhabitants of flooded communities told Reuters that by the time they received the regional government's alert, muddy water was already surrounding their cars, submerging streets of their towns and pouring into their homes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>After days of storm warnings from the national weather service since Oct 25, some municipalities and local institutions had raised the alarm much earlier. Valencia University had told its staff the day before not to come to work. Several town halls across the region of eastern Spain had suspended activities, shut down public facilities and told people to stay home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the mixed messages and confusion cost lives, dozens of local residents and experts told Reuters. More than 220 people died and nearly 80 are still missing in what is the most deadly deluge in a single European country since 1967, when floods in Portugal killed around 500.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The national weather service AEMET had raised its threat level for heavy rains to a red alert at 7.36am on Oct 29, following heavy rains in mountainous areas west of the city of Valencia from the early morning. In the 12 hours it took for the regional government's shelter-in-place order to come through, waters running through the usually dry Poyo ravine - the epicentre of the flooding - had surged to more than three times the flow of Spain's largest river.</p>

<p>As climate change exacerbates weather patterns along Spain's Mediterranean coast, floods are becoming commonplace and some previous incidents have been deadly. But after at least five decades without a major catastrophe, many people in Valencia were unaware of the grave dangers posed by flash flooding or how to respond.</p>

<p>Puchal, the 23-year old who sought refuge in the hotel, said she had never received much information about the risks of floods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At school, they gave talks about fires," she said. "But not floods." &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That, combined with poor coordination among regional and national authorities as well as political decisions taken years ago not to invest in waterways infrastructure, worsened the calamitous loss of life, seven experts consulted by Reuters said.</p>

<p>"It was foreseeable that we would have catastrophic flooding here," said Felix Frances, professor of hydraulic engineering and environment at Valencia Polytechnic University.</p>

<p>Deaths were recorded in 14 of the 24 towns that had already been identified in environment ministry reports as at high risk of flooding, a Reuters review found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts including hydraulic and civil engineers, geologists, urban planners and disaster relief specialists said successive failures - to conduct flood mitigation work on nearby rivers, better protect houses built on flood plains, educate people and warn residents quickly - added to the fatalities.</p>

<p>With better infrastructure, "those deaths would have been infinitely less," said Luis Banon, an engineer and professor of Transportation Engineering and Infrastructure at the University of Alicante.</p>

<p>One central government source said they expect multiple judicial enquiries to examine decisions made and to attribute responsibility for the high death toll.</p>

<p>As more of the world's population settles on flood plains, climate events become more extreme and Europe warms faster than the global average, what happened in Valencia underscores the need for strategic, coordinated measures to protect people in European cities, said Sergio Palencia, professor of urbanization in Valencia Polytechnic University.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frances said he had helped draw up a plan 17 years ago to build flood works for the Poyo ravine at a cost then of 150 million euros ($162 million). On Nov. 5, a week after the floods, the national government earmarked 10.6 billion euros to help victims.</p>

<p>The plan Frances worked on expired in 2017 because "no work had been initiated," Spain's State Secretary for the Environment Hugo Moran told Reuters. The government had to start from scratch and some works are underway, he said.</p>

<p>Frances said some people were so unaware of the risk they didn't know, for example, that it would be unwise to go down to a basement "to save the car."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Multiple alerts</strong></h3>

<p>AEMET had already warned of a storm known locally as DANA -- a high-altitude isolated depression -- on Oct. 25. In following days, its warnings became more specific until Oct. 29, when the alert was upgraded to red -- the highest level, meaning high risks for the population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 8.45 am, the regional branch of AEMET posted footage on the social media platform X showing cars being swept down roads by a tide of brown water.</p>

<p>Just after noon, the public body managing the region's river basins, the Jucar Hydrographic Confederation (CHJ) emailed regional authorities saying the flow of water through the Poyo ravine had reached 264 cubic meters per second. That's stronger than the average flow of the Guadalquivir river, one of Spain's largest.</p>

<p>The CHJ said it can only feed the information to regional emergency services, which are responsible for issuing alerts to citizens. Three experts told Reuters that once water started rising, it would take less than nine hours to reach the towns. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the next eight hours, officials from the regional and national governments, environmental authorities and emergency services exchanged phone calls, emails and held emergency meetings.</p>

<p>For some time that afternoon, the data from the CHJ suggested the flow was declining.</p>

<p>Carlos Mazon, the region's president and the main person responsible for issuing a shelter-in-place alert, has become a focus for anger over authorities' reaction to the storm. Despite signs of severe flooding, he did not change his schedule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a news conference at lunchtime, he cited a national weather forecast saying the storm's intensity would decrease around 6pm, according to a tweet he later deleted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the day went on Mazon, a member of the conservative People's Party that sits in opposition to the Socialist-run national government, appeared in photos tweeted by his staff receiving a sustainable tourism certification, and discussing budgetary matters.</p>

<p>His office did not respond to requests for comment on his handling of the disaster. Mazon told reporters on Thursday that he had a "work lunch" on Oct 29 and was constantly in touch with his team handling the situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 5pm, as the authorities met again, the CHJ gave "verbal notification" of a generalised increase in water flows running through or near the towns, according to a statement.</p>

<p>At 6.43pm, CHJ sent another email warning that the flow of water through the ravine had reached 1,686 cubic metres per second -- more than triple the pace of the Ebro, Spain's largest river.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twelve minutes later, the CHJ said the Poyo flow had risen to 2,282 cubic meters per second before destroying the sensor that measured it.</p>

<p>"That could fill an Olympic pool every second," said Nahum Mendez, a geologist at Valencia University.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By 7pm, many towns were without power, making it difficult to send alerts immediately to phones or radio stations, officials said.</p>

<p>Maria Isabel Albalat, the mayor of Paiporta, which lies in the outskirts of the city of Valencia, said she called the national government delegate in the region to tell her that "my town was flooding" and "people were already dying." Police drove through the town with sirens, lights and loudspeakers telling people to stay off the bridge and leave the streets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 8 pm, Spain's environment secretary Moran, who was travelling in Colombia, called the regional official in charge of the emergency services Salom&amp;#233; Pradas to say there was a risk a dam would fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pradas told local television on Thursday that a technical advisor then suggested the services send a text alert. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How is it possible that with all the information that was available ... the agencies responsible for activating the alarms did nothing?" Moran said.</p>

<p>Mazon, the regional head, later said the CHJ data showing water flows declining had added to the confusion and delays. Moran, whose department oversees the CHJ, told Reuters its task was just to provide real time information to emergency teams, not to make decisions on their response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paiporta mayor Albalat said that by the time the alert came, "we had been up to our necks in water for more than an hour and a half."</p>

<h3><strong>Flood protections</strong></h3>

<p>Political decisions to not invest earlier in better flood defences to protect a wider area have multiplied the economic cost "by 200," said Banon, the Alicante professor.</p>

<p>"This type of works aren't sexy, don't give political profitability until something happens," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now they have no choice but to undertake the works."</p>

<p>In other countries such as the United States and Japan, natural disasters are more commonplace so people have a better sense of how to respond, said Maria Jesus Romero, 50, Professor of Urban Planning Law at the Polytechnical University of Valencia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some Valencia residents remembered past floods, including a major one in 1957. After that, the city of Valencia was protected by hydraulic works completed under dictator General Francisco Franco in 1973.</p>

<p>Paiporta residents Rosario Masia, 84, and her husband Cristobal Martinez, 87, said past floods were "nothing" compared with this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We had a hard time, but not like now," said Masia. "We are in pieces."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many properties hit by the floods were built before 2003 when revised guidance on building in flood zones was issued, experts said. The new guidance either bans construction or includes strict pre-requisites including that properties built in flood zones should not have basements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the largely working-class suburbs of Valencia, the car is vital to get to work. Many of those interviewed by Reuters in the flood zone said their first move when it rains is to move their cars out of underground car parks of their apartment blocks so the engines aren't damaged by flooding.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's historic comeback has sparked a wave of congratulatory messages and statements from across the globe. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed it as a "historic election victory," while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as "history's greatest comeback." Vikas Swarup, a former Indian diplomat, praised the win as "one of the greatest political comebacks in history." Additionally, the victory has led to a significant surge in online searches related to Donald Trump and his remarkable achievement.</p>

<p>News of Donald Trump getting elected the 47th President of America has evoked two different emotions in the American population. The right-wing populists, who strongly oppose immigration, cheered on and celebrated the new president while the Democrats started to look into new opportunities to migrate themselves.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From New York to the Rio Grande Valley, across big cities like Miami and San Francisco, in college towns and subdivision-dotted exurbs, the US electorate this year shifted unmistakably rightward.</p>

<p>You can see it if you zoom in on a place like Robeson County, North Carolina, a majority-minority county with the state's largest Native American population, which swung 9 points toward Donald Trump. You can see it if you zoom out, with the reliably blue state of New Jersey favoring Kamala Harris by just 5 points only four years after President Joe Biden won it in a 16-point rout.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/j68020to_trump-bloomberg-story-stat-1-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.png" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The trend cut across demographic groups, with the heavily Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, giving a plurality of its votes to the Republican. Latino men backed Trump by a 12-point margin, according to CNN exit polls - an outcome that would've been unimaginable to strategists from both parties as recently as 2012, when the GOP lost the presidency and said in its own autopsy of the contest that non-White voters "think that Republicans do not like them."</p>

<p>The strength of the right was apparent up and down the ballot, with Republicans taking control of the Senate and appearing on the cusp of holding a narrow majority in the House. While the extent of the carnage is still being tallied, Democrats lost their majorities in the lower houses of the Michigan and Minnesota legislatures.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/4ekb6vr4_donald-trump-bloomber-story-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>And the shift was so broad that it left Democrats with hardly any silver linings. After claiming the popular vote in every election since 2008 - and lamenting the Electoral College as a quirky obstacle to what would otherwise be an era of assured political dominance - the party looks poised to lose that, too.</p>

<p>That came despite Democrats outspending Republicans and knocking on millions more doors, and after Harris' star-studded endorsements and meticulous ground game, which in the end fell short as Trump closed the deal with Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. Ultimately, Harris' truncated 107-day campaign after Biden's sudden exit couldn't shake off voter anxiety over the direction of the country, especially the state of the economy and immigration.</p>

<p>"The Democratic Party just has to come to terms with the fact that we were rejected en masse at the national level by the American electorate," said Evan Roth Smith, a Democratic pollster.</p>

<h2><strong>BORDER COUNTIES</strong></h2>

<p>One place that helps illuminate Trump's decisive victory is Maverick County, Texas. Its shift was bigger than that of any other county in the nation: Trump won it with 59% of the vote - a 28-point swing from four years ago.</p>

<p>The last Republican to win Maverick County was Herbert Hoover in 1928.</p>

<p>Maverick, where nearly 90% of the population speaks Spanish at home, has large numbers of Latino voters. Trump won Latino men outright nationwide, and while Latino women still broke for Harris, the Republican chipped away at her party's advantage with them.</p>

<p>The map gives hints about the issues that drove the shift. Eight of the 10 US counties with the largest lurch to the right were in Texas - all of them along the Rio Grande River that separates the US from Mexico. Maverick is home to Eagle Pass, a hotspot for border crossings that Trump promised to shut down.</p>

<p>Both campaigns shelled out on ads aimed at Latino voters, with the percentage of presidential election ads running on Spanish-language television and radio stations hitting a record this year.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/lihgtcss_trump-bloomberg-story-stat-2-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.png" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"These people have always been conservative, they have just never had anyone knocking on their door and saying it's ok to vote this way," said Abraham Enriquez, founder of Bienvenido US, a Republican advocacy group that targeted Latino voters in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Texas during the election.</p>

<p>Betty Silva, a New York voter and daughter of Puerto Rican parents, is one voter who put aside personal dislike of Trump and cast her ballot for him. When the Republican was president, she said, "I could afford stuff."</p>

<p>Trump's victory this time has shown Republicans that a winning coalition can be built around populist appeals to multi-ethnic, working-class voting blocs - and that his 2016 win was no fluke.</p>

<p>Still, it remains to be seen how enduring Trump's MAGA movement will be in 2028, when he will be constitutionally barred from a third term. After all, voters already rejected him in 2020 as the pandemic upended the economy.</p>

<h3><strong>HARRIS COLLAPSE</strong></h3>

<p>The story of the 2024 election is as much about a Harris collapse as it was a Trump surge. With Arizona and Nevada still to be called, but leaning Republican, Trump could get as many as 312 electoral votes if he completes the sweep of all seven battleground states. That's more than the victor received in the last two elections, but well short of a landslide by historical standards: Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all received more.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/mr2ppdso_trump-harris-bloomberg-story-stat-3-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.png" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In states with mostly complete results, Trump improved over his 2020 vote totals in roughly equal proportions in battleground and non-battleground states.</p>

<p>But Harris can't say the same. As of early Friday morning, she was 84,227 votes behind Biden's pace in five battleground states - but 2.7 million votes behind in 29 other states with more than 98% of expected vote counted. As Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray noted, her vote totals suffered most in states where Democrats usually win - a sign of flagging enthusiasm from her base.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/cbfrnnmg_trump-harris-bloomberg-story-stat-4-bloomberg_625x300_09_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Arizona voter Jennifer Linzy couldn't get behind Harris because of the vice president's stance on the Israel-Hamas war. Linzy, a 39-year-old progressive, left a Phoenix polling station on Tuesday saying she only voted in down-ballot races. "This is the first time I've abstained in my entire adult life in a presidential election," she said.</p>

<p>Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, is on track to have a 20% increase in these presidential "undervotes" this year compared to last time.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>Election officials sort ballots ready for tabulation at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center (MCTEC) in Phoenix. Photographer: Dominic Valente/Bloomberg</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>Of the US counties with more than 98% of the expected vote counted as of 12:00 a.m. Friday, Trump had improved his vote share in 2,380 of them. Harris improved over Biden's 2020 mark in just 231 of them. Many of those were the Georgia and North Carolina counties hardest hit by September's Hurricane Helene, suppressing turnout.</p>

<p>In Monroe County, Pennsylvania, in the heart of the Pocono Mountains, New York City expatriates have shaded local politics blue for the last two decades. But after a 7-point shift to the right, Trump is winning the county by 900 votes.</p>

<p>Trump's showing, coupled with Republicans taking control of the Senate and on track to keep the House, will give him a strong hand in negotiating with Congress on taxes, spending, immigration and trade. He's shown a willingness to use his endorsement to impose party discipline, giving him considerable influence over leadership in Congress.</p>

<p>And he's already appointed three justices to the Supreme Court in his first term - creating a six to three conservative majority - and with three justices in their 70s, he could have a chance to nominate even more.</p>

<p>"Voters of the United States of America decisively said we are not happy with what we've received under the Biden presidency, and we're ready to go in a different direction," said Jay Townsend, a bipartisan political consultant.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election – and his threat to impose tariffs on all imports to the United States – highlights an important problem for the global economy.</p>

<p>The US is a technological powerhouse, spending more than any other country on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03403-4">research and development and winning more Nobel prizes</a> in the last five years than every other country combined. Its inventions and economic successes are <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024/10/14/the-american-economy-has-left-other-rich-countries-in-the-dust">the envy of the globe</a>. But the rest of the world needs to do everything in its power to avoid being too dependent on it.</p>

<p>And this situation would not have been much different had Harris won.</p>

<p>The “America first” approach of Donald Trump has actually been a bipartisan policy. At least since previous president Barack Obama's policy of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2023/05/02/us-energy-independence-soars-to-highest-levels-in-over-70-years/">energy independence</a>, the US has been on a mostly inward-looking quest of maintaining technological supremacy while ending the offshoring of industrial jobs.</p>

<p>One of the major choices Trump made in his first term was to accept higher prices for US consumers in order to protect national producers by slapping high tariffs on almost every trading partner.</p>

<p>For instance, Trump's 2018 tariffs on washing machines from all over the world mean US consumers have been paying <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611">12% more</a> for these products.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden – in certainly a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-racism-asian-mcconnell-youngkin-b2227283.html">more polite</a> way – then <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/13/politics/china-tariffs-biden-trump/index.html">increased</a> some of the Trump tariffs: up to 100% on electric vehicles, 50% on solar cells and 25% on batteries from China.</p>

<p>At a time of climate emergency, this was a clear choice to slow down the energy transition in order to protect US manufacturing.</p>

<p>While Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/16/us-eu-agree-ceasefire-in-long-running-trade-war-over-aircraft-subsidies">signed a truce</a> with Europe on tariffs, it started a perhaps even more damaging battle by launching a subsidy race.</p>

<p>The US Inflation Reduction Act for instance contains <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/eu-us-green-arms-race-misses-bigger-picture-2023-03-16/">US$369 billion</a> (£286 billion) of subsidies in areas such as electric vehicles or renewable energy. And the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/08/two-years-later-funding-chips-and-science-act-creating-quality-jobs-growing-local">Chips Act</a> committed US$52 billion to subsidise the production of semiconductors and computer chips.</p>

<h2>China, Europe and the rest of the world</h2>

<p>This US industrial policy might have been inward-looking, but it has clear consequences for the rest of the world. China, after decades of mostly export-based growth, must now deal with massive problems of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6bce03f5-bc7c-45df-9d86-363ade9ab47f">industrial overcapacity</a>.</p>

<p>The country is now trying to encourage more <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d82840e4-755b-4ecc-9277-93245cc8c8a9">domestic consumption</a> and to diversify <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3256119/china-ev-exports-slammed-wests-trade-barriers-find-greener-pastures-free-trade-partners">its trading partners</a>.</p>

<p>Europe, despite a very tight budget constraint, spends a lot of money <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-chips-act_en">in the subsidy race</a>. Germany, a country facing sluggish growth and big doubts on its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c345cf9-8493-4429-baa4-2128abdd0337">industrial model</a>, is committed to matching US subsidies, offering for instance <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/northvolt-gains-eu-nod-986-mln-german-aid-build-ev-battery-plant-2024-01-08/">€900 million</a> (£750 million) to Swedish battery makers Northvolt to continue producing in the country.</p>

<p>All those subsidies are <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/subsidies-and-protection-for-manufacturing-will-harm-the-world-economy">hurting the world economy</a> and could have easily financed urgent needs such as the electrification of the <a href="https://www.tse-fr.eu/debate-ecological-transition-sub-saharian-african-crampes-estache">entire African continent</a> with solar panels and batteries. Meanwhile, China has replaced <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2022/11/04/what-is-chinas-investment-end-game-in-africa/">the US and Europe</a> as the largest investor in Africa, following its own interest for natural resources.</p>

<p>The incoming Trump mandate might be a chance to fix ideas.</p>

<p>One might, for instance, argue that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the thousands of deaths and the energy crisis that followed, could have been avoided had the Biden administration been clearer to Russian president Vladimir Putin about the consequences of an invasion, and provided modern weapons to Kyiv before the war.</p>

<p>But the blame is mostly on Europe. Credit where it's due, the strategic problem of becoming too dependent on Russian gas is something Trump had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/currencies/trump-lashes-germany-over-gas-pipeline-deal-calls-it-russias-captive-idUSKBN1K10VH/">clearly warned Germany</a> about during his first mandate.</p>

<p>There is a clear path forward: Europe could help China fix its overcapacity problems by negotiating an end to its own tariff war on Chinese technology such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_13_501">solar panels</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-slaps-tariffs-chinese-evs-risking-beijing-payback-2024-10-29/">electric cars</a>.</p>

<p>In exchange, Europe would regain some sovereignty by producing more of its own clean energy instead of <a href="https://ieefa.org/european-lng-tracker-september-2024-update">importing record amounts</a> of liquid gas from the US. It could also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-give-china-taste-its-own-medicine-ev/">learn a few things</a> from producing with Chinese companies, and China could use its <a href="https://theconversation.com/russia-has-become-so-economically-isolated-that-china-could-order-the-end-of-war-in-ukraine-232951">immense leverage on Russia</a> to end the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The European Union could also work harder on what it does best: signing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/028981e6-33f0-4f0f-88a1-1846e2616e7c">trade deals</a>, and using them as a way to <a href="https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en">reduce carbon emissions</a> around the world.</p>

<p>This is not only about Europe and China. After decades of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better">continuous improvement</a> on all major dimensions of human life, the world is moving backwards.</p>

<p>The number of people facing hunger is increasing, taking us back to <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-07-2024-hunger-numbers-stubbornly-high-for-three-consecutive-years-as-global-crises-deepen--un-report">the levels of 2008-9</a>. War is raging in Gaza, Sudan, Myanmar, Syria, and now Lebanon. The world had not seen as many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/more-civilian-casualties-recorded-in-2023-than-any-year-since-2010-gaza">civilian casualties</a> since 2010.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-eHOSq3oqI?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Tariffs: how we got here.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For better or worse, it is unlikely that a Trump administration will reverse the path of lower US interventionism. It is also unlikely to lead any major initiative on peace, climate change or on the liberalisation of trade.</p>

<p>The world is alone, and America will not come to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68266447">save it</a>.</p>

<p>We do not know what will happen to the US. Maybe the return of Trump will mostly be a continuation of the last ten years. Maybe <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/if-elected-donald-trumps-proposed-tariffs-would-damage-the-economies-of-united-states-china-and-europe-and-set-back-climate-action/">prohibitive tariffs</a> or destroying the institutions that made the US such an <a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-economics-prize-how-colonial-history-explains-why-strong-institutions-are-vital-to-a-countrys-prosperity-expert-qanda-241305">economic powerhouse</a> will make the US economy less relevant. But this is something Americans have chosen, and something the rest of the world simply has to live with.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the only thing the world can do is learn how to better work together, without becoming too dependent on each other.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[The asteroid was first observed on October 22 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey in Hawaii.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, the Earth's atmosphere was bombarded by a small, boulder-sized asteroid just hours after it had first been detected, having evaded early impact monitoring systems. The object, designated 2024 UQ, was discovered just two hours before entering Earth's atmosphere, and fortunately, there was no real threat, since it measured only 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter.</p>

<p>The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, a four-telescope survey based in Hawaii for monitoring near-Earth objects, had discovered the asteroid on October 22. Within days of its detection, 2024 UQ disintegrated in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, off California, creating an "imminent impactor," or an impact where Earth-bound objects are detected hours before hitting the planet.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/londons-iconic-dogstar-bar-and-nightclub-forced-to-close-down-before-squatters-take-over-6980115">Also Read | London's Iconic Dogstar Nightclub Forced To Close Down Before Squatters Take Over</a></p>

<p>"ATLAS survey obtained images that included detections of a small object in a high-probability collision course. However, due to the location of the object near the edge of two adjacent fields, the candidate was recognized as a moving object only a few hours later," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://neo.ssa.esa.int/documents/d/guest/newsletter-november-2024">ESA wrote in the newsletter.</a>"By the time the astrometry reached the impact monitoring systems, the impact had already happened."</p>

<p>According to ESA, the asteroid was the third imminent impactor detected this year.</p>

<p>That close call serves to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of the modern track system and sets an argument for continuing investment in early detection technology. While harmless in this circumstance, the situation serves to bring focus to Earth's continued improvement efforts in regards to space surveillance-the possibility of potentially dangerous space rocks slipping undetected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's expected foreign policy towards Europe during his second term will have far-reaching, and possibly, grave consequences.</p>

<p>At the end of last week, journalist <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">Nicholas Vincour</a> suggested that the decades-long close Europe-American relationship was about to be over, whoever won the White House. And that Europeans should worry less about the presidency and “more about how Europe can hack it alone on a dangerous global stage”. Yesterday's dismissible cynicism over declining American commitment in Europe is today's cautionary tale. But with Trump as president that concern deepens considerably, particularly over trade and defence.</p>

<p>In his first presidency Trump unleashed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/timeline-key-dates-in-the-us-china-trade-war-idUSKBN1ZE1AA/">battery of tariffs</a>, tit for tats and trade wars with states, companies and regions including the EU. That trend is set to continue, if Trump's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/asia-braces-for-disruption-to-alliances-trade-after-trumps-victory">campaign promises are to be believed</a>, including imposing 10-20% <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-war-donald-trump-elections-triumphs-board-tariffs-transatlantic-relations/">tariffs on all imports</a>, with a particular focus on key states such as Germany and key companies including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/06/german-carmakers-shares-slump-fear-trump-tariffs">Mercedes-Benz</a>.</p>

<p>Trump's stated preference is to reset the supply chains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFskg98w204">to US advantage</a>, either through eye-wateringly high <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-economy-risks-big-hit-under-trump-tariffs-plan-think-tank-says-2024-11-06/">tariffs</a> or ensuring greater post-manufacture assembly of foreign goods in the US. These are high stakes indeed. The US is the EU's biggest trade partner, with ever-increasing volumes of <a href="https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/united-states_en">goods and services</a> being purchased.</p>

<h2>Is Europe prepared?</h2>

<p>Not only has the European Commission been sharpening its teeth on a number of trade, tech, AI and investment-related mechanisms designed to keep <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai#:%7E:text=The%20AI%20Act%20is%20the%20first%2Dever%20comprehensive%20legal%20framework,powerful%20and%20impactful%20AI%20models">Trump-upmanship</a> at bay. But the highly anticipated trade war has already <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/european-semester_en">been prepared for</a>, at least in terms of protecting the EU's financial interests.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu">European Commission</a> is focused on increasing the EU's overall self-sufficiency in big tech, including climate tech and raw materials. This will likely invite arguments with the US, as well as unresolved arguments over steel.</p>

<p>Trump's antipathy to Europe isn't new. And it isn't entirely personal. Washington is no longer populated with policy makers with a natural empathy to, or even personal connections with, Europe. Even under presidents <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/what-will-define-barack-obamas-european-legacy-eu-us/">Barack Obama</a> and Joe Biden, Washington shifted clearly, and possibly permanently, away from both Europe <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/05/trump-win-nato-european-defense/">and Nato</a> and towards Asia</p>

<p>Whether via <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2024/09/u-s-troop-withdrawals-from-europe-wont-benefit-its-rivals/">reduced troop levels</a> or diminished diplomatic interest in Europe among officials in the State Department, <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2024/04/the-united-states-stepping-back-from-europe-is-a-matter-of-when-not-whether?lang=en">US attitudes to Europe</a> range from indifferent at best, to hostile at worst.</p>

<p>The US has moved from post-cold war levels of cooperation in 1994 <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">to pivot towards Asia</a> in the 2000s. Now, accelerated by entrenched partisanship, isolationism and Trump's second win, Washington remains content with <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">the ongoing</a> “downgrading of Europe in the psyche of American elites”.</p>

<p>This despite (<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">as argued</a> by retired US Army officer and former commanding general Ben Hodges) critically reducing the “huge advantage we [the US] have with our leadership inside NATO and our relationship with European countries”. As president, Trump is simply going to accelerate this trend.</p>

<h2>In the Baltics</h2>

<p>Among Baltic countries there is already an expectation that Trump will push European states for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-23/trump-advisers-push-even-higher-target-for-nato-defense-spending?embedded-checkout=true">higher defence</a> spending. However, in the eyes of some, Trump's demand is not a bad thing in and of itself.</p>

<p>As Tallinn-based International Center for Defense and Security director Indrek Kannik <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609513435/expert-joe-biden-will-be-remembered-as-a-weak-president-on-foreign-policy">argues</a>: “If the US spends 3.5 to 4 percent on security, while Europe only spends 1.5 to 2 percent, it's an imbalance.”</p>

<p>Kannick's suggestion that “Europe will gradually assume more responsibility for its defense” echoes perspectives increasingly advocated in Brussels itself. In effect: now is the time for Europe to acknowledge finally its lacklustre, scattered approach to defence coordination.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-eu-officials-china-union-policy-kamala-harris-medicine-ukraine-defense/">Others fear</a> that Trump 2.0 “would be so hostile to Europe … that the bloc would have no choice but to bolster its defense spending”.</p>

<p>For the Baltics, the question of improving defence coordination and sorting out financing is vital in tackling the threat of a territory-hungry Putin on its borders.</p>

<h2>Wake up, Nato?</h2>

<p>Last time around, Trump was fiercely critical of Nato, largely because the US provides <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm">the largest portion</a> of defence spending. Trump's view in 2016 was that this encouraged free-riding among other members, happy to contribute less at the US's expense.</p>

<p>This time, Trump has ramped up his criticism that Nato allies are still failing to spend enough. This in turn has spurred Trump to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-trumps-years-criticizing-nato-defense-spending/story?id=107201586">suggest</a> that he would “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to Nato allies who fail to pay their bill.</p>

<p>This leaves open the question of whether the US itself would defend another member in the event of an attack, or even leave the organisation.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvcikCxCNxE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Sweden recently joined Nato and is concerned about an expansionist Russia.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Trump's options regarding Ukraine are simple: either arm it, or deny it aid. The former risks freezing battle lines and forcing an imperfect peace on Ukraine, the latter gives Russia's President Vladimir Putin a satisfactory victory, bringing an aggressive Russia to the very doorstep of the EU and Nato.</p>

<p>This is particularly worrying for Baltic states: with Ukraine overpowered, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19ef9629-805f-49aa-81bc-54c84240b733">the eastern flank</a> of the EU and Nato would be exposed, which in turn would destabilise European collective security.</p>

<p>From a foreign policy perspective, the frustration is that European decision makers simply cannot be sure of what Trump will actually do next. As journalist <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/10/10/the-biggest-drag-on-us-power-is-that-it-keeps-changing-its-mind/">Janan Ganesh recently observed</a>, the US “at its peak had more going for it than overwhelming strength. It had a certain amount of predictability. Without either, its purchase on events can't be the same”.</p>

<h2>Friends in some places</h2>

<p>Trump's victory will be warmly welcomed by some Europeans, particularly those from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyvglq47y9o">far-right parties</a> who will now be confident in a White House that shares their ideological approaches. Similarly, Trump may even lend active support to far-right governments in Hungary and Italy.</p>

<p>There are opportunities aplenty. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-pm-viktor-orban-donald-trump-win-us-elections-2024/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=alert&amp;utm_campaign=Trump%20win%20is%20%E2%80%98in%20the%20bag%2C%E2%80%99%20Orb%C3%A1n%20gloats">Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán</a> has spent years personally cultivating a deep connection with Trump and Maga-Republicans. And Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni could continue the same balancing act she has within the EU on key issues including immigration.</p>

<p>Others, like the UK and the European Commission, are going to have to play either the pragmatist card, or be prepared to hit back, and hit hard against everything from isolationist tariffs to vanishing defence commitments.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women in Afghanistan are not forbidden from speaking to each other, the Taliban government's morality ministry told AFP on Saturday, denying recent media reports of a ban.</p>

<p>Afghan media based outside the country and international outlets have in recent weeks reported a ban on women hearing other women's voices, based on an audio recording of the head of the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (PVPV), Mohammad Khalid Hanafi, about rules of prayer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PVPV spokesman Saiful Islam Khyber said the reports were "brainless" and "illogical", in a voice recording confirmed by AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A woman can talk to another woman, women need to interact with one another in society, women do have their needs," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added, however, that there were exceptions according to Islamic law, such as those described by Hanafi that women should use hand gestures instead of raising their voices to communicate with other women while praying.</p>

<p>Women in Afghanistan are barred from singing or reciting poetry aloud in public, according to a recent "vice and virtue" law detailing sweeping codes of behaviour, including that women's voices should be "concealed" along with their bodies when outside their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Women's voices have also been banned from television and radio broadcasts in some provinces.</p>

<p>The law codified many rules the Taliban government has imposed based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law since they came to power in 2021, with women bearing the brunt of restrictions the United Nations has called "gender apartheid".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Taliban authorities have banned education after secondary school for girls and women, also barring them from various jobs as well as parks and other public places.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Taliban government has said all Afghan citizens' rights are guaranteed under Islamic law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few minutes after I took my seat at an advanced screening of Amazon Prime's Brian Epstein biopic, Midas Man, I found myself engaged in Beatles chat with the chap next to me. I wasn't surprised to find a fellow Fab Four fanatic at such an event. But I was surprised when I realised I was speaking with the legendary presenter <a href="https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Writer/paul-gambaccini">Paul Gambaccini</a>, a man who, I was soon to discover, met not only John, Paul, George and Ringo, but also original drummer Pete Best and bassist Stuart Sutcliffe's sister. Or “five and a half Beatles”, as he put it.</p>

<p>As the lights went down and we readied ourselves, Gambaccini whispered that he hoped this wasn't going to be “another Beatles film with no Beatles music in it”. The subject of soundtracks in Beatles biopics has always been an elephant in the room among fans, and Midas Man, like Backbeat (1994), In His Life: The John Lennon Story (2000), Lennon Naked (2010) and many others before it, did indeed lack any Lennon and McCartney (or Harrison) originals.</p>

<p>But, given that it cost the 2019 film Yesterday US$10 million (£7.7 million) to <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/beatles-biopics-ranked-2869762">acquire the rights to use the Beatles' music</a> (40% of the entire budget), this shouldn't really come as a surprise. And there aren't any crafty ways round it, either. This much we know from the fate of 1979's Birth of The Beatles which <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/beatles-biopics-ranked-2869762">has been prevented from reissue</a> due to its unauthorised use of songs.</p>

<p>Midas Man tells the story of the legendary Beatles manager, Brian Epstein. The film follows Epstein, played by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd, from his days as the unfulfilled manager of a furniture and musical instrument shop to making good on his promise that his unknown and unsigned band, The Beatles, would one day be “bigger than Elvis”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/music/midas-man-a-flimsy-portrait-of-the-man-who-discovered-the-beatles/ar-AA1tcOBd">Some reviews</a> have taken issue at how the film shows Epstein one minute suavely cajoling American TV host Ed Sullivan, and the next falling to pieces after the death of his father. But such contradictions of character were exactly what made Epstein who he was – a man <a href="https://mrepstein.tumblr.com/post/670711046215008256/the-fifth-beatles-double-life-the-sunday-times">Beatles biographer Craig Brown</a> has described as alternatively lonely, businesslike, scrupulous, obsessive, shrewd, awkward and pernickety.</p>

<p>For me, it's Epstein's complexity that makes him so endearing, both in real life and in Midas Man. Fortune-Lloyd expertly and realistically portrays him as confident in his abilities, but also on the cusp of being consumed by self-doubt at any moment. He also carries off the magnetic charm that led Epstein on his scarcely believable journey from selling pianos in his family shop to one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry within the space of a few years.</p>

<p>In what is ultimately a tragic story of a troubled life, it's unsurprising that there are plenty of tearjerker moments. But screenwriters Brigit Grant and Jonathan Wakeham avoid the temptation to overdo the pathos, choosing subtlety over the sledgehammer.</p>

<p>A combination of this and Fortune-Lloyd's understated acting lead to several poignant moments in the film. Epstein yearns to be a part of the band's world, but is kept on the sidelines due to his position of authority, (perceived) difference in class and, most importantly, his own social awkwardness.</p>

<h2>Being Brian</h2>

<p>The film's sets are a highlight throughout, from 1960s Liverpool's unique blend of vibrancy and poverty to the glitz and glamour of New York. The North End Music Store (NEMs) where Epstein worked and which became his management company, thrums with the energy and anticipation of the tectonic shift in culture that's just around the corner. And I've scarcely experienced a more immersive recreation of The Beatles's lunchtime performances at The Cavern.</p>

<p>Alongside Fortune-Lloyd's nuanced performance, there were several other standouts. Leo Harvey-Elledge provides much of the humour as George Harrison, Darci Shaw has a whale of a time as an effervescent Cilla Black, and the consistently excellent Eddie Marsan and Emily Watson are perfectly cast (although somewhat underused) as Epstein's parents.</p>

Signature" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em><small>Leo Harvey Elledge as George Harrison in Midas Man. Signature</small></em></p>

<p>Good as the overall casting is, however, it's hard to see Fortune-Lloyd's Epstein as only six years senior to Jonah Lees's John Lennon. As versatile as the former is, he looks significantly older than Epstein's 27 years – the age he was when he first saw The Beatles perform at The Cavern in 1961.</p>

<p>This may seem like a minor point, but it affects the dynamic between him and the band, which, combined with the significant height difference between Fortune Lloyd (6ft 2) and Lees (5ft 8) gives a sense of authority that was more representative of The Beatles' producer, George Martin.</p>

<p>The decision to make John “Tex” Ellington (Ed Speleers) such a major character is also a bit of a surprise, as, although based on a real person, the role he played in Epstein's life is much-debated among Beatle historians. But the inclusion of this turbulent love affair did admittedly add another dimension to Epstein's characterisation.</p>

<p>With the exception of this, perhaps, there's nothing in Midas Man that die-hard Beatles fans didn't already know about Epstein. But given that he and The Beatles are part of what's been called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/20/beatles-films-midas-man-paul-mccartney-one-hand-clapping-let-it-be">“the greatest story ever told”</a>, that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after his win in the US Presidential elections, Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate security has been upgraded with a robotic dog. The mechanical canine was spotted patrolling the estate in Palm Beach, Florida, early on November 8, adding a futuristic layer to the estate's security measures.</p>

<p>According to<a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/us-news/robot-dog-seen-patrolling-donald-trumps-mar-a-lago-estate/" rel="nofollow noindex"> The New York Post,</a> in videos, the robot dog, manufactured by Boston Dynamics, is seen moving along the grassy grounds, walking amid the palm trees surrounding the property. A warning label on its side reads, “DO NOT PET.”</p>

<p>The United States Secret Service confirmed the deployment of the robotic dog as part of its ongoing efforts to safeguard the President-elect. A spokesperson for the agency told New York Post, “Safeguarding the President-elect is a top priority. While we cannot get into the specific capabilities, the robotic dogs are equipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations.”</p>

<p>Trump, who survived two assassination attempts during his campaign, has been working on assembling his incoming administration at Mar-a-Lago following his victory over Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Robotic dogs have become increasingly popular among public safety agencies across the US. They provide a way to keep law enforcement officers and first responders out of harm's way in dangerous situations. The New York Police Department (NYPD) unveiled a robotic K-9 unit dubbed “Digidogs,” announced by Mayor Eric Adams last year. Originally leased from Boston Dynamics, the robots were met with public criticism, with social media users drawing comparisons to something straight out of the dystopian series Black Mirror.</p>

<p>Beyond law enforcement, these robots have been deployed for more critical, life-saving roles. In the aftermath of a parking garage collapse in Lower Manhattan last year, one such robot dog was sent into the wreckage to search for survivors and assess the destruction.</p>

<p>The military has also found use for these advanced machines. Earlier this year, Ukraine's military deployed 30 robot dogs, each costing around $9,000, against Russian forces. The “metal pooches” served as reconnaissance units that could swiftly deliver supplies, reducing the risk to human soldiers on the front lines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disappointed Pro-Palestinian activists said Kamala Harris' speech to close the Democratic convention in Chicago failed to demonstrate any break from the status quo, after a week in which the most divisive issue facing the party was mostly ignored.</p>

<p>Under pressure to respond to critics of US support for Israel's war in Gaza, the vice president used her Thursday night speech to repeat earlier calls for a ceasefire and a hostages deal. She said she supported Israel's right to defend itself while also favouring the Palestinian right to self-determination.</p>

<p>Abbas Alawieh, co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement that mobilised more than 750,000 voters to protest US policy on Israel, said Harris missed an opportunity to win over those people, many of whom live in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona.</p>

<p>"What's needed in this moment is courageous leadership that breaks from the current approach," Alawieh told Reuters shortly after Harris formally accepted the party's nomination.</p>

<p>Uncommitted delegates and their allies had pushed unsuccessfully for a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) to address the latest bloodshed in the decades old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which began on October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's assault on Hamas-governed Gaza, with the aid of US support, has since killed 40,000 Palestinians, Gaza health officials say, along with displacing nearly its entire 2.3 million population, causing a hunger crisis and flattening almost the entire enclave.</p>

<p>Rima Mohammad, an Uncommitted delegate from Michigan, said the speech added to disappointment over the DNC's refusal to let a Palestinian speak, and offered nothing to assuage the concerns of her progressive, diverse community in Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>"I'm actually more concerned now," Mohammad said. "This is just a bad look. You're going to lose Michigan."</p>

<p>A campaign spokesperson declined to explain the decision not to schedule a speech by a Palestinian speaker at the DNC. The decision was made by DNC organisers in close consultation with the Harris campaign, sources familiar with the discussions said.</p>

<p>Party insiders fear the Gaza war could cost Harris needed votes in battleground states such as Michigan, which is home to large Muslim and Arab American populations and college campuses that have been the site of Gaza protests.</p>

<p>The convention was held in Chicago, home to the United States' largest Palestinian community, according to the Arab American Institute.</p>

<p>The DNC faced pro-Palestinian protests each day in Chicago, including thousands of demonstrators on Thursday night ahead of Harris' speech. Dozens of arrests were made during the week.</p>

<p>Protesters carried banners that read "No Embargo No Vote" and "No Ceasefire No Vote," while thousands chanted "Ceasefire now," and "Long live Palestine."</p>

<p>"Leading with Israel's right to defend itself in the wake of 40,000 massacred Palestinians is absolutely tone deaf," said Hatem Abudayyeh, spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC and National Chair of the US Palestinian Community Network, who said Harris simply repeated President Joe Biden's positions.</p>

<p>"Harris said nothing new," he said. "We continue to demand that the US and Harris implement an arms embargo and stop sending weapons and all other aid to Israel."</p>

<p>Mohammad, Alawieh and other Uncommitted delegates spent the previous night on the sidewalk outside the convention to protest the DNC's rejection of their request for a Palestinian speaker.</p>

<p>They welcomed a call for a ceasefire and the return of hostages by the parents of one US hostage held in Gaza - Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin - on Wednesday night, but said they should also have been given a chance to speak.</p>

<p>Pro-Palestinian protesters and delegates said they were heartened by messages of solidarity from the United Auto Workers union and the Movement for Black Lives, a network of over 150 leaders and organizations. Muslim Women for Harris-Walz said on X it would cease operations after the DNC decision.</p>

<p>Ruwa Romman, a Georgia state legislator and delegate who spent the night outside the DNC, said Uncommitted organizers had negotiated with the Harris campaign for weeks and provided a list of possible speakers, only to be rejected.</p>

<p>Prior to Harris' remarks, only a handful of speakers even addressed the war, including Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders and Raphael Warnock, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>

<p>One major Harris campaign donor, who requested anonymity to be candid about their private conversations with the campaign, said they worried that without a near-term ceasefire deal and clear statements from Harris about ending the war and protecting civilians, campus protests could flare again when universities resume classes in coming days.</p>

<p>"We need every vote," the donor said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Robert F Kennedy Jr said he would suspend his campaign and endorsed Republican Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump. Robert, the nephew of former President John F Kennedy and the son of Senior Robert F Kennedy, projected himself as an alternative to Donald Trump for the Republican Party in the US. And despite his persistently poor polling numbers, Mr Kennedy was regularly featured in the news cycle, often for bizarre reasons.</p>

<p>Before suspending his White House bid and endorsing the former US President, Ms Kennedy ran a campaign filled with what many have described as outrageous moments.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Brain worm</strong><br />
<br />
In May, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">The New York Times reported</a> that Mr Kennedy believed he had a brain tumor, which was actually the work of a hungry parasite. In a 2012 deposition during divorce proceedings from his second wife, he said that a physician thought an anomaly in his brain scans "was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died." He indicated that he had been suffering from extreme mental haze and memory loss, which had reduced his earning potential.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Kennedy's response to sexual assault allegations</strong><br />
<br />
In July,&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/robert-kennedy-jr-shocking-history" rel="nofollow,noindex">a Vanity Fair piece</a> claimed that Mr Kennedy sexually assaulted a former babysitter for the family. Mr Kennedy's response to the accusations can hardly be considered an apology. During his appearance on the podcast Breaking Point, he said, “The [Vanity Fair] article is a lot of garbage. Listen, I have said this from the beginning. I am not a church boy. I am not running like that." Later, he claimed to have texted Cooney to express regret for his actions.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Eating dogs</strong><br />
<br />
The same article featured a photo of Mr Kennedy grinning and pretending to bite on what looked like a grilled dog carcass.&nbsp;In an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://youtu.be/kedriuDH5o0?si=QvHhtU5PbY8YysaK" rel="nofollow,noindex">News Nation</a>, he said that the image was actually of a goat they were going to eat. He said, "I'm a very adventurous eater, I'll eat virtually anything. There are two things I wouldn't eat — well, three. I wouldn't eat a human, I wouldn't eat a monkey, and I wouldn't eat a dog. I think I'd eat something else."<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Kennedy said he "won't take sides on 9/11"</strong><br />
<br />
Mr Kennedy declared that should he be elected president, he "wouldn't take sides on 9/11" and would be transparent on social media. He claimed his statement was inspired by a "60 Minutes" report on a theory that the Saudi government knew about the plot in advance. He continued, saying, "It's hard to tell what is a conspiracy theory and what isn't." He has previously floated other conspiracy theories about vaccinations, AIDS, and the murder of his uncle.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My take on 9/11: It's hard to tell what is a conspiracy theory and what isn't. But conspiracy theories flourish when the government routinely lies to the public. As President I won't take sides on 9/11 or any of the other debates. But I can promise is that I will open the files…</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><strong>5. The bear cub</strong><br />
<br />
In August, The New Yorker magazine got hold of a story about Mr Kennedy's adventures with a dead bear cub, 10 years ago. To get ahead of the New Yorker's scoop, Mr Kennedy shared the story on Twitter. The tale revealed that Kennedy had discovered a dead bear cub by the side of the road, he then loaded it into the back of his car, snapped a picture with the body, went to do some falconry and had dinner of steak. However, before leaving for the airport, he used the bear's body to stage a death resembling a bicycle hit-and-run incident in NYC's Central Park.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Middle East this week and said Benjamin Netanyahu was on board with a US proposal to bridge gaps and reach a ceasefire.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States said Friday that progress had been made at the latest round of Gaza truce talks after the presence of Israeli troops on the Egyptian border emerged as a major sticking point.</p>

<p>The White House said CIA chief William Burns was among US officials taking part in the discussions in Cairo, joining the heads of Israel's spy agency and security service.</p>

<p>"There has been progress made. We need now for both sides to come together and work towards implementation," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.</p>

<p>Preliminary talks that began Thursday "were constructive in nature", he said, adding that reports that the diplomacy was "near collapse" were inaccurate.</p>

<p>An Egyptian source close to the negotiations told AFP the Egyptian and Qatari intelligence chiefs were also taking part.</p>

<p>"The discussions are taking place in Cairo... in preparation for an enlarged round of negotiations which will begin on Sunday," the source said.</p>

<p>"Washington is discussing with mediators new proposals to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas and for mechanisms to implement" the plan.</p>

<p>According to the White House, US President Joe Biden discussed the upcoming talks by telephone Friday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.</p>

<p>The Egyptian source said Sunday's negotiations would be "a pivotal step in formulating an agreement that will be announced if Washington can pressure (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu".</p>

<p>Representatives of Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, were not attending the Cairo talks.</p>

<p>An official from the Islamist movement, Hossam Badran, told AFP Friday that Netanyahu's insistence that his troops remain on a strip along the Gaza-Egypt border called the Philadelphi Corridor reflected "his refusal to reach a final agreement".</p>

<p>Egypt, Qatar and the United States have for months tried to reach a deal to end more than 10 months of war between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Previous optimism during months of on-off truce talks has proven unfounded.</p>

<p>Fighting raged on Friday, with witnesses reporting combat in northern, central and southern Gaza.</p>

<p>An overnight strike on a house west of the southern city of Khan Yunis killed 11 people -- including four women and four children -- and wounded a number of others, Gaza's civil defence agency said early Saturday.</p>

<h3><strong>'Exhausted and terrified'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The United Nations said tens of thousands of civilians had been on the move again from Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis after Israeli evacuation orders, which precede military operations.</p>

<p>The war has displaced virtually all of Gaza's population, often multiple times, leaving them deprived of shelter, clean water and other essentials as disease spreads, the UN says.</p>

<p>"Civilians are exhausted and terrified, running from one destroyed place to another, with no end in sight," Muhannad Hadi, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said late Thursday.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 40,265 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants also seized 251 hostages, of whom 105 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military recovered the remains of six hostages from a tunnel in the Khan Yunis area this week.</p>

<p>Netanyahu faces regular protests by hostage supporters demanding a deal to bring them home.</p>

<p>Ella Ben Ami, whose father is a hostage, said after meeting Netanyahu Friday that she "left with a heavy and difficult feeling that this (ceasefire deal) isn't going to happen soon", according to a statement from campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.</p>

<h3><strong>'Now is the time'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Diplomatic efforts to reach a Gaza truce and avert a wider war intensified following the killings of two senior Iran-backed militants last month that sparked threats of reprisals from Tehran and its allies, who blamed Israel.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and Israeli forces have exchanged near-daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Lebanon said Israeli strikes killed eight people, including a child, in the south on Friday, with Hezbollah saying the other seven dead were fighters.</p>

<p>A war monitor said Israeli strikes on central Syria Friday killed three Iran-backed fighters.</p>

<p>Accepting her Democratic Party's presidential nomination in Chicago, US Vice President Kamala Harris said "Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done".</p>

<p>The basis of talks has been a framework that Biden outlined in late May, which he described as an Israeli proposal.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Middle East this week and said Netanyahu was on board with a US proposal to bridge gaps and reach a ceasefire.</p>

<p>National Security Council spokesman Kirby said Washington continued to believe that Netanyahu accepted the proposal and appealed again to Hamas to do the same.</p>

<p>Hamas official Badran reiterated Friday that the group "accepted the Biden plan" as originally outlined, and said Washington must pressure Netanyahu.</p>

<p>He said Hamas would accept "nothing less than the withdrawal of occupation forces, Philadelphi included".</p>

<p>Netanyahu's hard-right coalition relies on the support of members opposed to a truce, and his office rejected as "incorrect" media reports that the prime minister "has agreed that Israel will withdraw" from the Philadelphi Corridor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers recently seized a truck carrying more than $5 million worth of methamphetamine at the US-Mexico border hidden inside a shipment of fake watermelons. According to a press release, the powerful stimulant known colloquially as crystal meth was discovered on Friday, wrapped in packages designed to look like bright green watermelons. The truck was seized at the San Diego port of Otay Mesa. More than two tonnes of methamphetamine - in a total of 1,220 packages - was seized by officers.</p>

<p>"The watermelon is known for being a refreshing fruit, but...CBP officers seized more than $5M worth of meth disguised and concealed within a shipment of watermelons. Officers uncovered 1,220 packages, weighing over 4,000lbs disguised as watermelons," the CBP wrote on X while sharing pictures of the fake watermelons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the press note, the US CBP said that the officers had stopped a truck hauling a trailer at the border with Mexico in Otay Mesa. The paperwork suggested that the 29-year-old driver was transporting a shipment of watermelons, but an inspection revealed the parcels contained methamphetamine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"CBP officers seized the narcotics and commercial tractor-trailer, while the driver was turned over to the custody of Homeland Security Investigations for further investigation," the officers said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Port director Rosa Hernandez described the method of concealment as "sophisticated". "As drug cartels continue to evolve their smuggling techniques, we will continue finding new and better ways to prevent these dangerous drugs and other contraband from entering the country," Ms Hernandez added.</p>

Earlier this year, 6 tonnes of meth were also discovered inside a shipment of squash in California. This came after meth and cocaine were found last year in bins of jalapeno paste that were being transported over the border. Traffickers have also stashed drugs inside shipments of green beans, sugar, flour and candy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Border patrol credits the seizures to Operation Apollo, a counter-fentanyl effort that began last October in southern California and expanded to Arizona in April focusing on intelligence collection and partnerships, per the press note.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240821-israeli-hostage-thought-every-night-is-my-last">Noa Argamani</a>, an Israeli woman who was abducted by Hamas on October 7, has dismissed reports suggesting she was beaten and her hair was cut in captivity. She also added that she was injured in a wall collapse incident caused by an Israeli airstrike.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Ms Argamani narrated her ordeal during a meeting with diplomats from Israel and G7 countries in Tokyo. However, she later clarified that her words were taken out of context.</p>

<p>"I cannot ignore what the Israeli media has done to me over the past 24 hours, taking my words out of context," she wrote in her Instagram stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Al Qassam Brigades' members did not hit me while I was in captivity, nor did they cut my hair; I was injured by the collapse of a wall caused by an Israeli airstrike," she added.</p>

<p>Ms Argamani underlined that "no one hit me during captivity, but I was injured all over my body after the airstrike."</p>

<p>The 26-year-old was among the hundreds of people kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova music festival during the October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>She was freed by the Israeli special forces in a raid on the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza on June 8. Besides her, three others -- Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41 -- were freed, AFP reported.</p>

<p>On a visit to Japan with her father, Ms Argamani recalled the time she was held captive by the Hamas militants. "Every night I was falling asleep and thinking, this may be the last night of my life," she said.<br />
<br />
Till the time she was rescued by the Israeli authorities, Ms Argamani "just did not believe that I'm still surviving".</p>

<p>"It's a miracle because I survived October 7, and I survived this bombing, and I also survived the rescue," AFP quoted her as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier, a video showing Ms Argamani on the back of a motorcycle screaming, "Don't kill me", went viral. The video also showed her boyfriend -- Avinatan Or, an engineer -- being taken away separately. However, she has clarified that she had no idea about it until she was freed.</p>

<p>"Avinatan, my boyfriend, is still there, and we need to bring them back before it's going to be too late," she said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had retrieved the bodies of six hostages from various tunnels in the southern region of Gaza.</p>

<p>Around 251 people were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7 last year. Of these, 105, including 34 dead, are still inside Gaza, according to the Israeli army.</p>

<p>Nearly 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, were killed in the October 7 attack. Over the last ten months, Israel has continuously bombed Gaza, killing over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

<p>In Gaza, the Israeli airstrikes have flattened townships, neighbourhoods, hospitals and schools, internally displacing a vast majority of the narrow strip's 2.1 million people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German police said on Saturday that they were still searching for an unknown assailant hours after he killed three people and wounded others in a stabbing attack at a festival in the western city of Solingen.</p>

<p>Eight were injured, five of them seriously, the police said in a statement early on Saturday. That is up from the four serious injuries the police reported earlier.</p>

<p>"Both victims and witnesses are currently being questioned. The police are currently searching for the perpetrator with a large team," police said.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 9:40 p.m. (1940 GMT) on Friday when the man attacked multiple people with a knife, the police said.</p>

<p>The perpetrator aimed specifically for the throats of his victims, the police added. They could not provide further details or a motive.</p>

<p>Fatal stabbings and shootings are relatively uncommon in Germany. The government wants to toughen rules on knives that can be carried in public by reducing the maximum length allowed.</p>

<p>In June, a 29-year-old policeman died after being stabbed in Mannheim during an attack on a right-wing demonstration. A stabbing attack on a train in 2021 injured several.</p>

<p>Friday's attack occurred at a festival marking the 650th anniversary of Solingen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, which borders the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Authorities cancelled the remainder of the weekend event.</p>

<p>The state's interior minister, Herbert Reul, visited the scene early on Saturday, telling reporters it was a targeted attack on human life but declining to speculate on the motive.</p>

<p>The attack occurred at the Fronhof, a market square where live bands were playing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nikki Haley, a former rival to Donald Trump for the US Republican presidential nomination, said on Saturday that isolationism was not healthy and that the party should stand with the country's allies, especially in the face of China.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters during a visit to Taiwan, Haley - Trump's ambassador to the United Nations who then ran against him - said it was important to support Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel.</p>

<p>"I don't think the isolationist approach is healthy. I think America can never sit in a bubble and think we won't be affected," she said.</p>

<p>Trump's bid to return to the White House has sparked isolationist worries among US allies.</p>

<p>During her campaign, Haley called Trump unelectable and unfit for office, but last month she urged her supporters to vote for the former president. He faces the Democratic Party's candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Trump unnerved Taiwan, a democratically governed island claimed by China, in July, saying "Taiwan should pay us for defence" and that it had taken American semiconductor business. His remarks pummelled shares of top Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC.</p>

<p>Taiwan's government rejects China's sovereignty claims.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier. Despite lacking of formal diplomatic ties, Washington is bound by law to provide the means for the island's defence.</p>

<p>"What I want to see the Republican Party talk about is freedom, standing with our allies and making sure that we show strength around the world," Haley said in the capital Taipei. "We don't want to see Communist China win, we don't want to see Russia win, we don't want to see Iran or North Korea win."</p>

<p>After meeting Taiwan President Lai Ching-te and other senior leaders, Haley said supporting Taiwan was an issue both Republicans and Democrats agree on. She said Taiwan's government did not ask her to pass on anything to Trump or his team.</p>

<p>Asked whether she would brief the Trump campaign about her Taiwan visit, Haley said she would "not necessarily meet with his team directly", but would do television interviews, probably write an opinion piece and send messages to Congress and the Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p>Taiwan received strong support during the Trump administration, including visits by cabinet members and arms sales.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war started exactly two years ago. The very next day, on February 25, 2022, India abstained from voting on a draft resolution in the United Nations Security Council. In the course of the ongoing war, New Delhi has been abstaining from taking clear sides, much to the chagrin of establishments in both the European Union and the United States. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Ukraine, after a much-publicised visit to Moscow in July, in maintaining with India's stated position of strategic neutrality, questions are being asked in global capitals about India's motivations. This is the first time an Indian prime minister has visited an independent Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been enough domestic discussions on India's purported role in world peace and other grand enterprise. Let's bring realism back into the game now.</p>

<h2><strong>Decoupling From West Is Not An Option</strong></h2>

<p>Domestic chatter aside, what the Western world - the US, EU, UK nexus - thinks about India's stand on the Russia-Ukraine conflict does, indeed, matter to India. No matter what the virulently nationalist ecosystem clamours for, decoupling from the West is not an option for India. It is not merely about diplomatic grandstanding. Since 2014, PM Modi has been making diplomatic and cultural gestures to bolster India-EU relations. There have been increased levels of engagement to secure crucial strategic and economic partnerships between India and the EU member states. While India's relationship with Ukraine may not have been headline-making historically, its implications have not been any less significant. That explains why India has consistently decried Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p>

<p>With his visit to Kyiv, PM Modi may be revealing India's growing transactions with the EU member states for its defence and strategic needs. After all, the Russian manpower and machines have put up a dismal performance in the current theatre. It's high time Indian generals stopped defending the Russian infrastructure just because they, too, are dependent on it and must swear by its fierceness. India has options for its defence and modernisation needs and must use them. After all, what use are partnerships like the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) that the EU set up with India in April 2022?</p>

<h2><strong>Exports From Russia Are Dwindling</strong></h2>

<p>It needs to be brought back into the picture that India's arms procurement from Russia saw a significant drop in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The trend has been continuing, and as per the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's latest reports, Russian exports to India have sharply declined from 76% in 2009–2013 to 36% in 2019-2024. While India remains the Russian arms industry's biggest market, it's also shopping from elsewhere, and that cart is getting bigger. A war-stressed Moscow is unlikely to meet New Delhi's growing defence needs owing to the latter's neighbourhood concerns. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Au contraire, other countries are pushing their catalogues for New Delhi to browse. The French are coming hot and sexy with their Rafael jets and a “defence industrial roadmap” to jointly design and develop mechanical infrastructure. India and France have joined hands in building submarines, combat aircraft engines, and multi-role helicopters. Ukraine, accounting for 11% of India's total defence imports, too, is an important partner. India is also deepening defence and security ties with countries like South Korea, South Africa and Poland. It is no coincidence that PM Modi made a pit stop in Poland before heading to Ukraine.</p>

<h2><b>A Wise Move By India</b></h2>

<p>By maintaining its stance of strategic neutrality, India is securing self-interest-driven allies in Europe and Asia without the overlordship of the US. It is a wise move on India's part in keeping with the ever-looming shadow of China in the neighbourhood. &nbsp;The US has exhibited reluctance to share crucial defence technology with India despite promises and agreements, like the one between General Electric and Indian partners for technology to power the new fleet of fighter jets. India knows better than to rely on the US, a country that holds its military-industrial complex dearer than any ideological principle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is clear that India—while being on “the side of peace”—is keeping its national interests above everything else. Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential adviser in Ukraine, acknowledges that India “really has a certain influence” over Russia. It is this reputation that India aims to, ought to capitalise on in its attempt to emerge as a dependable global negotiator. Only those who have power can negotiate, the rest only nudge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The timing for Modi's Ukraine visit is almost perfect. India is not expected to use a magic wand to bring Moscow and Kyiv to the negotiating table. The military situation remains hot. Even minor dialling down of fighting, if at all, will be enough for India's influence optics. No significant developments in the region can be expected till the US elects its next president. Till the US gets its house in order and views its NATO obligations afresh, the window is open for India to pedal hard towards its strategic goals—choosing realism over idealism and empty talk.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Bachelor has been backed by Starlight Media (an STB channel) and Warner Bros.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Oleksandr Budko, the 26-year-old Ukrainian soldier who lost both legs during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has been roped in as the face of the Ukrainian version of the US reality television show <em>The Bachelor</em>. Mr Budko, who was guarding the north-eastern Kharkiv region, lost his legs in August 2022.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/the-bachelor-ukraine-oleksandr-budko-1236000633/" rel="nofollow,noindex">Variety</a>, Oleksandr Budko said that he is hopeful of finding love on the show.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I am not looking for an ideal. I'm looking for someone whose inner world I can admire. I want her to be a person with great respect for veterans who cares about barrier-free and inclusive spaces. For me, ‘<em>The Bachelor</em>' is a chance to meet someone I want to try and start a family with. I know from my own experience that miracles can be found anywhere, and I believe one can find love on the show,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Talking about the script and the dating format of <em>The Bachelors</em>, Oleksandr Bohutskyi, CEO of Starlight Media, said: “We thank Warner Bros. International Television for this undoubtedly important partnership and their willingness to see new power and senses in the world's iconic format in the extraordinary circumstances of the Russian-Ukrainian war. We believe that love and life will win. This fall, on STB, we will be cheering for the love story of our modern-day hero and shaping the culture of new relationships.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywj08d89no" rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>, Oleksandr Budko and his girlfriend parted ways in January. Not just love, but Mr Budko also aims to raise awareness of the challenges disabled Ukrainians face with his participation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Recalling the deadly accident, Mr Budko told BBC, "I felt the earth shift onto me. I felt a terrible pain in my legs and realised that it would mean the amputation of my legs. I screamed from horrific pain and shouted for people to hear me. I understood that I had lost my legs at the moment of injury, two or three seconds after I felt the pain.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump, touting plans on taxes and health, tried on Friday to turn the page on a week in which he was overshadowed by Kamala Harris and struggled to focus on policy issues instead of personal attacks on his opponent in the US presidential race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, touting plans on taxes and health, tried on Friday to turn the page on a week in which he was overshadowed by Kamala Harris and struggled to focus on policy issues instead of personal attacks on his opponent in the US presidential race.</p>

<p>From a lectern at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, the Republican candidate spoke about his plan to eliminate taxes on tips to waiters and other service employees. He discussed his campaign's efforts to court Hispanic voters in Nevada, a battleground state that could help determine the November 5 election, and nationwide.</p>

<p>The tax proposal, a pillar of Trump's economic agenda, is the kind of issue his advisers have been pressing him to focus on, rather than his frequent personal attacks against Vice President Harris' looks, Black and Indian heritage and intelligence, warning they could turn off the moderate voters he needs to win.</p>

<p>At an event in Arizona later, the former president repeated his tax pledge, while promising to set up a commission to investigate presidential assassination attempts. He also said he would install a panel to investigate "an increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases."</p>

<p>Both proposals are apparent concessions to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump at the event after dropping out of the race.</p>

<p>Trump's comments come one day after Harris accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination with a muscular speech that laid down broad foreign policy principles and sharp contrasts with Trump with 11 weeks left until Election Day.</p>

<p>Trump sought to counter-program the four-day convention with events of his own around the country, hoping to steal some media attention from Harris. However, his speeches on foreign policy, the economy and crime did little to dislodge the spotlight from Harris and received little attention - a stunning turnabout for a politician used to dominating headlines.</p>

<p>The Republican and his aides hope Thursday's boisterous convention finale marks the end of the honeymoon period for Harris, who emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago, after President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed her.</p>

<p>During Harris' acceptance speech in Chicago, Trump attacked her with dozens of posts on his Truth Social platform, calling her a liar, a Marxist and "Comrade Kamala Harris." One post simply asked: "IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?"</p>

<p>William Rosenberg, a political science professor at Drexel University, said Trump's personal attacks on Harris underscored his frustration with having to face a biracial woman, a task complicated by his history of making racist remarks.</p>

<p>"His anger and his words speak volumes," Rosenberg said. "He's navigating a path which is full of problems for him."</p>

<p>Harris has surged in the polls since entering the race, with polling aggregator website FiveThirtyEight putting her ahead of Trump in six of seven battleground states.</p>

<p>She is also outraising her Republican counterpart. Her campaign told the Federal Election Commission this week that it raised $204 million last month, compared to $48 million reported to the body by Trump's main fundraising group.</p>

<p>One question still to be answered is whether Harris will also outpace Trump on the trail in the coming weeks. Biden, 81, made relatively few campaign stops, easing pressure on Trump to travel more around the country. That may now change with Harris, 59.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, will travel to Detroit on Monday to address a conference of the National Guard Association of the United States and is scheduled to give a speech at a conservative women's group's annual summit in Washington on Friday.</p>

<p>Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would hold at least one additional campaign stop between those two events, without providing details.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign has not yet released details of her movements for next week.</p>

<p>Leavitt blamed the media for focusing their stories on Trump's personal attacks, which she said made up a fraction of his otherwise policy-heavy rallies and speeches.</p>

<p>At a speech event on Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, billed as one on national security, Trump said he had rejected the recommendations of his advisers to focus on policy, and he insulted Harris and other Democrats in personal terms.</p>

<p>He again recounted those conversations with advisers at the rally in Arizona on Friday.</p>

<p>"My geniuses, they get paid a fortune - actually not that much - but I call up my people, I say, 'They're knocking the hell out of me, and you say I shouldn't get personal. I have to get personal, don't I?'" Trump said to applause.</p>

<p>An outside adviser to Trump told Reuters on condition of anonymity that several advisers had told the former president that a continued focus on insults rather than policy could doom his chances in November.</p>

<p>Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump could still win the race, which he predicted would be close, but to do that he should focus on inflation, illegal immigration and other issues that polling shows many voters give him higher marks on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About five million people in Bangladesh were stranded by floods in low-lying areas, as strong currents washed away river embankments.</p>

<p>The death count rose to 15 as at least five rivers in the South Asian nation faced the severest flooding since 2018, according to government data. Eleven districts were affected.</p>

<p>The devastating floods are the latest setback for the country of 170 million people, recently besieged with deadly political protests and violence. An interim government led by Nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus took over after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country earlier this month amid a student-led mass uprising.</p>

<p>"These are the worst floods we have seen in three decades," Liakath Ali, director of climate change at non-governmental organization BRAC, said in a statement. "There are people stranded across the country, and we are expecting the situation to worsen in many places as rains continue."</p>

<p>The government is rushing food and emergency medical supplies to the people marooned in the flooded areas. Authorities opened 3,176 shelters for flood victims and deployed 639 medical teams.</p>

<p>Breakdowns in telecommunications, interruptions to transport, and flooded roads and highways are complicating rescue efforts, according to BRAC.</p>

<p>"People had no time to save anything," Ali said. "Entire villages, all of the families who lived in them, and everything they owned - homes, livestock, farmlands, fisheries - have been washed away."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla vice president Sreela Venkataratnam, who appears to have worked at the automaker since 2013, has quit. Announcing her departure in a LinkedIn Post this week, Ms Venkataratnam said she was leaving the company after 11 years to take a break and spend "quality time with family, reconnect with old friends, and focus on personal well-being". She praised the company and described her journey at the firm as "nothing short of extraordinary", but, in the comments below, she said working there was "not for the faint of heart".&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms Venkataratnam was Tesla's Vice President of Finance and Business Operations. She worked at Tesla since early 2013. Her 11-year tenure began as Director of Finance Operation, and two years later, she moved up to the post of Senior Director of Finance. She then held the vice president position from June 2019 to June 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"After 11 incredible years, I bid farewell to Tesla. Reflecting on this journey, it has been nothing short of extraordinary," Ms Venkataratnam wrote. She further expressed her pride at the company's growth during that time to become the $700 billion colossus it is today, adding that she would take a break before seeking other opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I joined as Director of Finance Operations in early 2013, when Tesla was a company with less than $1B in yearly revenues, a market cap of -$4B and less than 3000 cars delivered in a year," she said. "Leaving as a Vice President (one of only two women VPs in the company) with annual revenues soaring close to $100B, market cap to $700B (reaching $1T during the pandemic) and cars delivered in a year to more than 1.8 million, I am proud of how much we've achieved together," Ms Venkataratnam added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, she expressed that she is "profoundly grateful to the incredible champions, including some who are no longer with the company, my teammates and colleagues who supported me and my team throughout this journey". "Your integrity, dedication and collaboration were instrumental in our shared success," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to a comment from Jason Wheeler, Tesla's former Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Ms Venkataratnam also wrote that working for Tesla is "definitely not for the fault of heart".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You did it right, Sreela. Congrats on an amazing run at a company that wasn't always easy to work at. Bravo!" Mr Wheeler wrote. Responding to this, Ms Venkataratnam expressed gratitude to Mr Wheeler and agreed with him. "It is definitely not for the faint of heart! It was great working with you especially during those tough days!" she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has approved a possible foreign military sale of anti-submarine warfare Sonobuoys and related equipment to India at an estimated cost of USD 52.8 million.</p>

<p>The Defence Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification, notifying Congress of this possible sale today, the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency said in a release.</p>

<p>Notably, the Defence Security Cooperation Agency is an agency within the United States Department of Defence.</p>

<p>"The Government of India has requested to buy AN/SSQ-53G High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare (HAASW) sonobuoys; AN/SSQ-62F HAASW sonobuoys; AN/SSQ-36 sonobuoys; technical and publications and data documentation; US Government and contractor engineering and technical support; and other related elements of logistics and program services and support. The estimated total cost is USD 52.8 million," the agency stated.</p>

<p>This proposed sale will support US' foreign policy and national security objectives by helping to strengthen the United States-India strategic relationship and improving the security of a major defence partner that continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions.</p>

<p>The proposed sale will also improve India's capability to meet current and future threats by enhancing its capacity to conduct anti-submarine warfare operations from its MH-60R helicopters. India will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.</p>

<p>The agency further added that the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.</p>

<p>The principal contractor(s) will be Sparton Corporation, located in De Leon Springs, FL, or Undersea Sensor Systems Inc. (USSI), located in Columbia City, IN, or a combination of both. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale, it added.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Actor Mallika Sherawat applauded US Vice President Kamala Harris on her 'self-made' political career after she was named as the Democratic Party's official candidate for the US Presidential elections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor Mallika Sherawat applauded US Vice President Kamala Harris on her 'self-made' political career after she was named as the Democratic Party's official candidate for the US Presidential elections. "Coming from India, female politicians are so rare. If they are there, they come from a very dynastic or royal family. Here I was meeting a lady who had built everything with her own two hands," Sherawat told Vanity Fair in an interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 'Welcome' actor had incidentally hinted in 2009 that Kamala Harris could go on to become the US President, a post that has gone viral again.</p>

<p>"Having fun at a fancy event with a woman who they say could be US President, Kamala Harris. Chicks rule," Sherawat had posted on X (formerly Twitter) in 2009. It was a prescient remark, made well before Harris, then a San Francisco attorney, became the Democratic presidential nominee. Her resurfaced tweet has sparked a buzz on social media with some people calling Mallika Sherawat a clairvoyant.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Having fun at a fancy event with a woman who they say could be US President, Kamala Harris. Chicks rule!</p>
— Mallika Sherawat (@mallikasherawat) <a href="https://twitter.com/mallikasherawat/status/2288254299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2009</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The meeting between the two took place when Sherawat was playing a character inspired by Harris in an indie film 'Politics of Love' (2011).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sherawat, who attended a Beverly Hills fundraiser for Harris in 2009, recalled feeling out of place at the event. She said Harris made her feel comfortable, advising her to get out of her comfort zone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was feeling like a fish out of water. It was my first time in LA, and she really put me at ease. I remember her saying that getting out of your comfort zone is good to build character and it will make you a stronger person," she told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/kamala-harris-inspired-a-character-in-a-movie-youll-probably-never-see-politics-of-love" rel="no follow no index">Vanity Fair.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>"For want of a better term, she was like one of us-a normal person with inspiring goals," the 47-year-old actor added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris is now the Democratic Presidential candidate for the November 2024 US elections, following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race last month. This development has led to former President Donald Trump becoming the oldest candidate in the race, and has resulted in a series of personal attacks on Harris from Trump.</p>

<p>Mallika Sherawat has worked in several movies which hit commercial success in Bollywood. Her first hit was Anurag Basu's 'Murder' (2004). She was also seen in popular Bollywood hits such as 'Pyarr Ke Side Effects' (2006), 'Welcome' (2007), and 'Guru' (2007). She was last seen in a 2021 comedy-drama 'RK/RKay'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of the film 'Politics of Love' (2011), one of the producers Govind Menon said, "At that time, the Democrat-Republican divide wasn't as toxic and as horrible as it is now. I don't think that we would've made that movie now."</p>

<p>Mallika Sherawat played the character of a campaign worker for Barrack Obama in the film. This character was inspired by Kamala Harris serving as an interesting footnote in the trajectory of her political career from being a district attorney to vouching for a 'new America' while accepting the presidential nominee at the Democratic Convention on Thursday.</p>

<p>Mallika Sherawat also recalls "casually asking" of Harris, "Do you think, Kamala, you could be president one day?" To which Harris had confidently responded, "Why not?" &nbsp;If she wins, Kamala Harris will not only make history by becoming the first woman US President but also the first black woman to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Royal Bank of Canada said an employee it fired over an intimate relationship with its former chief financial officer was focused on leveraging that alleged romance for his own personal advancement within the firm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Royal Bank of Canada said an employee it fired over an intimate relationship with its former chief financial officer was focused on leveraging that alleged romance for his own personal advancement within the firm.</p>

<p>The bank filed a statement of defense and countersuit on Friday against Ken Mason, a former employee in RBC's treasury department, who was dismissed in April at the same time as then-CFO <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/royal-bank-of-canada-fires-cfo-over-undisclosed-close-relationship-with-another-employee-5403350" target="_blank">Nadine Ahn</a>.</p>

<p>Canada's biggest lender alleges that Mason and Ahn carried out a close personal relationship for more than a decade. That relationship crossed the line on a number of occasions, the bank says in its court documents - including when Ahn helped Mason get large raises that took his pay to almost C$1.2 million ($888,000) last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mason and Ahn are each suing RBC for wrongful dismissal. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To Mr. Mason's knowledge, and at his urging, Ms. Ahn misused her power as CFO to bestow significant compensation increases and, ultimately, an executive-level promotion upon Mr. Mason, as part of a 'Project Ken' the two were pursuing together while in an undisclosed close personal relationship," the bank said in its latest court filing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A week ago, the bank made similar claims against Ahn.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Mason and Ahn did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Friday afternoon. In their lawsuits, they said they did not have a romantic relationship and were just friends. Ahn said the bank subjected her to "palpable reputational harm" and "public humiliation" when it fired her. Mason has said the bank would not have handled the situation in the same fashion if the two were both men.</p>

<p>A representative for RBC declined to comment and referred back to its earlier statements on the cases. The bank has previously said it hired external legal counsel to conduct an investigation after receiving an anonymous complaint in March that Ahn and Mason had been seen together and were having a relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Compensation Increases</strong></h3>

<p>The bank alleges that Mason's total compensation for fiscal 2023 was C$1.18 million, up 70% from what he was making when Ahn was promoted to CFO in November 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Friday's filing includes many of the same allegations RBC has put forward in the Ahn lawsuit - including descriptions of how the two bankers regularly met outside of work for cocktails, called each other by pet names, swapped romantic poetry and sent text messages saying they loved each other.</p>

<p>When RBC confronted Mason with evidence of the undisclosed relationship on April 5, he denied they had an intimate relationship and said they were merely "work friends," the bank said in court documents. Mason went on to say he had been underpaid for his role and advocated for more money, often multiple times per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mason claimed his promotion to vice-president was "merit-based" and that Ahn had not influenced it, the bank stated in the court filing. "This was not true: in fact, Mr. Mason's promotion to Vice President was a centrepiece of 'Project Ken,' on which Mr. Mason and Ms. Ahn closely collaborated," RBC said.</p>

<p>Ahn is seeking almost C$50 million in pay and damages, while Mason is suing the bank for more than C$20 million in pay and damages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its counterclaims against both Ahn and Mason, RBC is seeking to claw back what it calls "excess compensation" paid to Mason as a result of Ahn's interventions on his behalf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is also looking to recover certain bonus payments made to them as well as other damages and costs. That could include compensation owed to another employee, who was allegedly fired by Ahn after that person raised concerns about Mason's pay.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tokyo-based television news anchor was fired from her job and faced online backlash after a controversial post on social media in which she criticised men's hygiene habits. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, Yuri Kawaguchi, 29, is a freelance announcer known for her feminist views. She also works as a lecturer on harassment prevention. She faced severe backlash online after she claimed that men's body odour was hard to endure and suggested they shower more often.</p>

<p>In a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), Ms Kawaguchi voiced her frustration about men's hygiene during the sweltering summer months, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/gender-diversity/article/3275405/feminist-japan-tv-anchor-fired-raising-stink-over-hard-endure-mens-body-odour" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>. "I'm really sorry if there's a personal situation, but the smell of men in the summer or the body odour of unsanitary people is so uncomfortable," she wrote, advising men to shower more frequently and use deodorant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I want to be clean, so I take several showers a day, use freshening wipes, and apply sweat inhibitors year-round. I think more men should do this," the 29-year-old added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kawaguchi's post, perceived as discriminatory against men, offended many online. "Only blaming men is infuriating and undoubtedly discrimination. Women, especially older women, can have body odour too. I'm really uncomfortable with this," one social media user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her post also prompted scrutiny of her private life, including her divorce. She was labelled as a "materialistic woman out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people".&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the controversy escalated, Ms Kawaguchi issued a public apology and removed the post. &nbsp;"This time, because of my careless remarks, many people were upset and hurt. I will deeply reflect on this. In the future, I will work hard not to hurt anyone with my remarks. I am really sorry," she said.</p>

<p>However, the apology did little to quell the uproar. VOICE, the agency that managed Ms Kawaguchi, announced that it was terminating her contract, citing "defamation of the honour of the opposite sex" as the reason. In a statement, the agency said it had received numerous complaints and emails, and stressed that it was against their principles for a professional to use language that harms others and causes discomfort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another firm which hired the anchor as a lecturer for harassment prevention education also terminated her contract. But the decision of these two companies was criticised by Japanese netizens as "too extreme". While some said that the 29-year-old's dismissal shows a mirror to the challenges faced by women in a male-dominated society in Japan, most were not kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A woman asks men to be tidy and maintain decorum, yet it triggers outrage. It just shows that Japan has been a male-dominated society for too long. No matter how dirty men are, as soon as a woman complains, they punish her," one person wrote.</p>

<p>"Why are Japanese men so sensitive? They cannot handle a bit of criticism. Women are expected to maintain beauty, cleanliness, and fitness without complaint, yet men face no such expectations. If that isn't gender bias, then what is?" said another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination, Kamala Harris vowed to resist the influence of authoritarian leaders, who she implied have allegedly manipulated Donald Trump's foreign policy by appealing to his autocratic tendencies. In a bid to position herself against Republican frontrunner Trump, Harris is stressing her resolve on national security, portraying the billionaire as a riskier alternative.</p>

<p>In her speech, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-donald-trump-race-to-us-election-photo-finish-6400682" target="_blank">Harris</a> made it abundantly clear that her presidency would mark a definitive break from the Trump era, particularly in foreign policy. "I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators," she declared.</p>

<p>As Dr Sweta Chakraborty, a Climate Surrogate for the Harris campaign, explains, Harris's approach to policy formation is rooted in a clear-eyed assessment of the threats facing the country, both from foreign adversaries and from within. Dr Chakraborty, who has been closely involved in the campaign and was present at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, noted that Harris's message is resonating strongly with Indian-Americans and other minority communities who see in her as their leader.</p>

<h3><strong>Indian-American Perspective</strong></h3>

<p>"Kamala Harris is polling a few points ahead of Donald Trump and will surely get a surge following the DNC. Indian-Americans like myself are banding together and supporting her through various efforts and speciality collaborations. For example, we are raising funds through 'South Asians in Climate' after the DNC and ahead of the 'Harris for President Climate Group' official launch this September. South Asians are in. Climate voters are in, and as a South Asian climate surrogate, I represent both voter groups that broadly support Kamala Harris for President," Dr Chakraborty told NDTV.</p>

<p>Born in Oakland, California in 1964, Harris's father is Donald Harris, a man of Afro-Jamaican descent while his mother is Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated to the US at the age of 19 to pursue her doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology.</p>

<p>"Having a President who shares ancestry with South Asians in America shows that South Asian immigrants and their offspring have a clear place in America. A daughter of India can make it to the highest elected office in the United States, which shows that the sky is the limit for the Indian diaspora in the US. Indians in the US already enjoy the status as the highest-earning demographic. An Indian will elevate that status and make history for minorities and women more broadly," Dr Chakraborty said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Usha Vance Factor</strong></h3>

<p>However, Harris is not the only Indian-American whose name and image are plastered across the US presidential campaign. Over at the Republican camp, Trump's Vice President pick JD Vance's wife is Usha Vance who traces her roots to Andhra Pradesh's Vadluru.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usha's father, Chilukuri Radhakrishnan, was brought up in Chennai but went to the US to pursue higher studies. Usha was raised in San Diego, California and she met JD Vance at Yale Law School before getting married in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Usha Vance and her husband are trading in their morals for power," Dr Chakraborty alleged. "It is clear they had authentically shared liberal values with friends and classmates from university, but edited and adjusted their stances to maneuver in the conservative party, which they perceived would be the easier route to power."</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Dr Chakraborty highlighted a stark contrast between Harris and Trump: where Trump has prioritised tax breaks for billionaires and deregulation of corporate polluters, Harris has pledged to hold the oil and gas industry accountable, invest in a clean energy economy, and ensure that the benefits of climate action are shared by all Americans, not just the wealthy elite.</p>

<p>When Harris ran for vice president in 2020, her climate plan was even more aggressive than what ultimately passed during Joe Biden's presidency as the Inflation Reduction Act - a landmark climate legislation in American history. Now, as she prepares to release her full climate agenda in September, Harris is positioning herself as the 'Climate President' for the United States, Dr Chakraborty said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As an Indian woman, she also represents members of American society that have been historically disenfranchised. She is physically the opposite of Biden and represents the ascendency of women and a future society that is more equitable and fair to all genders and races," she said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The report came hours after the arrest of Awami League leader ASM Firoz from his residence.</p>

<p>The BGB headquarters, in an SMS, informed reporters that they have detained former top appellate division judge of the Supreme Court Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik as he was trying to cross over to India through Sylhet's Kanaighat border.</p>

<p>Newspaper Prothom Alo said Manik was kept at a BGB outpost till midnight citing the camp's in-charge.</p>

<p>Bangladesh descended into chaos after ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's government collapsed and she fled to India on August 5 amid violent protests over quota for government jobs, while the Army stepped in to fill the power vacuum.</p>

<p>Before that, anti-government protests had killed more than 500 people since mid-July. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the Chief Adviser of the interim government on August 8.</p>

<p>Since August 5, a number of leaders of the deposed regime, including senior ministers, have been arrested -- many of them on murder charges.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Army has earlier said that several hundred leaders of Hasina's Awami League and others have been sheltered in cantonments as their lives were at risk.</p>

<p>Former law minister Anisul Huq and the ex-premier's private sector affairs adviser Salman F Rahman were the first to be arrested from Dhaka's main river port Sadarghat terminal area as they were allegedly trying to leave Dhaka on a boat.</p>

<p>A number of members of Hasina's cabinet, including former foreign minister Hassan Mahmud and former social welfare minister Dipu Moni, several lawmakers and leaders of Awami League and its allies, including pro-left Workers Party chairman Rashed Khan Menon, and a number of recently sacked military and civil officials have been arrested.</p>

<p>This included sacked major general Ziaul Hassan, who was serving as the head of the government's telecommunications system, and Chittagong Port Authority chairman rear admiral Mohammad Sohail, who once was the spokesman of the elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion.</p>

<p>A TV journalist couple Farzana Rupa and her husband Shakil Ahmed have also been arrested.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female intern in Vietnam recently resigned from her job after an older male colleague allegedly threatened to kiss her at a company team-building event. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, the woman, identified as Huynh Anh My, said that during an internship last year, she took part in a mandatory event with a company in Hanoi. However, after she was forced to play a "weird, perverted" game at the boozy event, she resigned from the firm, saying that the incident made her feel so anxious and terrified that she could not face anyone at the office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Huynh said that the team-building event was mandatory for all. Skipping the seaside trip would have resulted in penalties or extra work, she told a local Vietnamese news outlet, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3275417/shocked-vietnam-woman-resigns-after-kiss-threat-older-colleague-team-building-event" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>. She said that she and her colleagues were on the beach taking part in a water-carrying competition when she began to feel tired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The weather was scorching, and I was exhausted from hauling buckets of water. I noticed that a female colleague sat to rest but was playfully pushed into the sea by a male colleague. I could not help but think, this is torture, not team-building," Ms Huynh said.</p>

<p>After the competition, the intern said that her team leader suggested everyone play a drinking game. "A male colleague, about the same age as my father said if I did not finish three glasses of alcohol in one go, I had to kiss him," she said.</p>

<p>Ms Huynh was aghast and wondered to herself why there were such "weird, perverted games". She said that the male colleague then walked over to her, grabbed her hand, and insisted she drink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I burst into tears because he kept getting close to my face and I was so scared. It wasn't until I managed to drink all three glasses that he finally stopped and moved on to another girl," she continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"After this, I was terrified and anxious for days, and I could not face anyone at the company. Eventually, I resigned," the woman told the outlet. She also said that before resigning, she reported the incident to her supervisor but received no feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Huynh's story has gone viral online. "This is sexual harassment. Team-building activities should be gentle and respectful to all employees," wrote one user. "Not only young women, but people of any age and gender can experience workplace harassment," said another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In my previous company, I had to carry a female colleague in a princess-style during a group activity, and both of us felt very uncomfortable with it," shird a third user.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four jail staffers were killed after a group of prisoners staged a violent revolt at the high-security IK-19 Surovikino penal colony in Russia's Volgograd region on Friday. The prisoners, armed with knives and claiming allegiance to the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), took hostages and temporarily seized control of a section of the prison, leading to a dramatic and deadly standoff with Russian special forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crisis began during what was supposed to be a routine disciplinary commission meeting, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yp4gg0z5o">report </a>said. As the meeting was in progress, a group of inmates, later identified as Ramzidin Toshev (28) Rustamchon Navruzi (23), Nazirchon Toshov (28) and Temur Khusinov (29), launched their attack. All four men, hailing from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, slashed guards with knives, injuring several and taking eight prison employees and four fellow convicts hostage.</p>

<p>During the siege, an image circulated on social media, showing an inmate holding a knife over a bloodied prison guard. Another video showed the attackers in the prison yard where one of their hostages was in a sitting position with his face covered in blood. In videos released by the attackers, they declared their allegiance to ISIS and claimed the attack was an act of revenge for the persecution of Muslims.</p>

<p>As the situation escalated, Russian special forces, including heavily armed troops and elite snipers from the Rosgvardia National Guard, were deployed to the scene. The prison, located in the remote town of Surovikino, approximately 850 kilometres south of Moscow, became a battleground.</p>

<p>After hours of tense negotiations and strategic planning, the special forces stormed the facility. In the ensuing operation, all four attackers were shot dead by snipers, effectively ending the standoff. However, four prison employees lost their lives, with three killed on the spot and a fourth succumbing to injuries in the hospital. Additionally, several other guards and prisoners sustained injuries, some of which were severe.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Snipers of the special forces of the Russian National Guard in the Volgograd region, with four precise shots, neutralised four prisoners who had taken prison employees hostage. The hostages have been released," said state news agency RIA, quoting the national guard.</p>

<p>This marks the second such incident in recent months, following a similar hostage-taking event in June at a prison in the Rostov region, where ISIS-affiliated prisoners also attempted a revolt, resulting in the deaths of five prisoners and the capture of one.</p>

<p>In response to the Volgograd standoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed during a virtual meeting with security chiefs, where it was confirmed that the situation posed no immediate threat to the civilian population. "Everyone on our territory is obliged to respect and comply with the laws of Russia. We will not allow anyone to try to incite ethnic discord," said Volgograd's regional governor, Andrei Bocharov.</p>]]></content:encoded>

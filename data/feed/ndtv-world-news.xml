       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese organisation Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, in a warning to countries that have nuclear weapons not to use them.</p>

<p>Many survivors of the only two nuclear bombs ever to be used in conflict, who are known in Japanese as "hibakusha", have dedicated their lives to the struggle for a nuclear-free world.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee said in its citation the group was receiving the Peace Prize for "its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again".</p>

</div>

<p>"The hibakusha help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons," the committee said.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it's real," Nihon Hidankyo co-chair Toshiyuki Mimaki told a press conference in Hiroshima, site of the Aug. 6, 1945 atomic bombing during the closing stages of World War Two, as he held back tears and pinched his cheek.</p>

<p>Mimaki, a survivor himself, said the award would give a major boost to its efforts to demonstrate that the abolition of nuclear weapons was necessary and possible and faulted governments for waging wars even as their citizens yearned for peace.</p>

</div>

<p>"(The win) will be a great force to appeal to the world that the abolition of nuclear weapons and everlasting peace can be achieved," he said. "Nuclear weapons should absolutely be abolished."</p>

<p>In Japan, hibakusha, many of whom carried visible wounds from radiation burns or developed radiation-related diseases such as leukaemia, were often forcibly segregated from society and faced discrimination when seeking employment or marriage in the years following the war.</p>

<p>"They are a group of people delivering the message to the world, so as a Japanese I think this is truly wonderful," Tokyo resident Yoshiko Watanabe told Reuters, as she wept openly in the street.</p>

<p>There were 106,825 atomic bomb survivors registered in Japan as of March this year, data from the country's health ministry showed, with an average age of 85.6 years.</p>

<h2><strong>WARNING TO NUCLEAR NATIONS</strong></h2>

<p>Without naming specific countries, Joergen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, warned that nuclear nations should not contemplate using atomic weapons.</p>

<p>"In a world ridden (with) conflicts, where nuclear weapons is definitely part of it, we wanted to highlight the importance of strengthening the nuclear taboo, the international norm, against the use of nuclear weapons," Frydnes told Reuters.</p>

<p>"We see it as very alarming that the nuclear taboo ... is being reduced by threatening, but also how the situation in the world where the nuclear powers are modernising and upgrading their arsenals."</p>

<p>Frydnes said the world should listen to the "painful and dramatic stories of the hibakusha".</p>

<p>"These weapons should never be used again anywhere in the world ... Nuclear war could mean the end of humanity, (the) end of our civilisation," he said in an interview.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the West of potential nuclear consequences since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>He declared last month that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles, and that Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack.</p>

<p>This month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country would speed up steps towards becoming a military superpower with nuclear weapons and would not rule out using them if it came under enemy attack, while widening conflict in the Middle East has prompted some experts to speculate Iran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>SECOND JAPANESE WINNER</strong></h3>

<p>Next year will mark the 80th anniversary of the dropping of nuclear bombs by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945 that forced Japan's surrender.</p>

<p>With the award, the committee was drawing attention to a "very dangerous situation" in the world, according to Dan Smith, head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p>

<p>"If there is a military conflict, there is a risk of it escalating to nuclear weapons ... They (Nihon Hidankyo) are really an important voice to remind us about the destructive nature of nuclear weapons," he told Reuters. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Smith said the Committee had achieved "a triple strike": drawing attention to the human suffering of nuclear bomb survivors; the danger of nuclear weapons; and that the world has survived without their use for nearly 80 years.</p>

<p>The award body has regularly put focus on the issue of nuclear weapons, most recently with its award to ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, who won the award in 2017.</p>

<p>This year's award also echoes those to Elie Wiesel in 1986 and Russia's Memorial in 2022 by highlighting the importance of keeping the memory of horrific events alive as a warning to the future.</p>

<p>It is the second Nobel Peace Prize for a Japanese recipient in the prize's 123-year history, 50 years after former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato won it in 1974.</p>

<p>The Nobel Peace Prize, worth 11 million Swedish crowns, or about $1 million, is due to be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;The United States on Friday expanded sanctions against Iran's petroleum and petrochemical sectors in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel, the Treasury Department said.</p>

<p>"This action intensifies financial pressure on Iran, limiting the regime's ability to earn critical energy revenues to undermine stability in the region and attack U.S. partners and allies," the Treasury Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>It adds the petroleum and petrochemical sector to an existing executive order that targets key sectors of Iran's economy with the aim of denying the government financial resources to support its nuclear and missile program.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department is also designating 16 entities and identifying 17 vessels as blocked property, citing their involvement in shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products in support of the National Iranian Oil Company, according to the statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Union is expected to impose sanctions on Monday on people and organisations linked to Iranian transfers of ballistic missiles to Russia, two European diplomats and a high-ranking EU official said on Friday.</p>

<p>EU foreign ministers will approve sanctions on 14 individuals and organisations over the transfer, including airlines and other companies, according to one of the diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>EU officials did not identify the firms or individuals. Diplomats had previously said the EU was looking at measures that would curb the operations of national airline Iran Air.</p>

<p>Last month, the United States, citing intelligence it said had been shared with allies, said Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran for its war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Washington immediately imposed sanctions on ships and companies it said were involved in weapons transfers.</p>

<p>The EU then said it had received "credible information" on the transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia and foreign policy chief Josep Borrell proposed "a substantial set of decisive and targeted measures" against Iran in response.</p>

<p>Monday's package will be the first results of that proposal. As the 27-country EU requires unanimity to agree on sanctions, such decisions usually take some time.</p>

<p>Following the U.S. allegations, Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said his government had not transferred any weapons to Russia since it took office in August.</p>

<p>The high-ranking EU official said Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi had told Borrell that Iran had supplied "short- range rockets" to Russia that could fly up to 250 kilometers.</p>

<p>The Iranian minister insisted the rockets were not ballistic and did not specify when they had been transferred, according to the EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>EU officials also said discussions were continuing among EU countries over whether to list Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards military force as a terrorist organisation.</p>

<p>A decision by a German court has provided a legal basis for such a listing but EU members were still debating whether it was politically wise to make the designation, officials said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rare celestial lights are seen at Leh in Ladakh as the Sun is in an active phase, throwing out charged particles towards Earth in the form of an intense solar storm. This phenomenon usually throws up a kaleidoscope of lights seen near the north and south poles, but this year the solar activity has been so intense that these lights are seen as bright red skies and can be spotted as far south as Leh in Ladakh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru and the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai stationed in Ladakh have beautifully captured these Auroral lights in the skies in Hanle and Leh. NDTV's Pallava Bagla, who is also in Ladakh, witnessed this rare celestial spectacle.</p>

<p>"The Sun is currently active and there have been several intense flares in the last few months. These flares are so intense that we can witness aurora even in the lower northern latitudes such as Hanle," said Professor Annapurni Subramaniam, Director of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru.</p>

<p>In a statement issued by the Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), it said "For an extraordinary fourth time during the current solar cycle, intense red-coloured Auroral activity was seen from Ladakh, India, and was photographed by astronomers of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) from Hanle, Leh, and Merak on the night of 10-11 October &nbsp;2024. The aurora was captured by the all-sky cameras at Hanle and Merak throughout the night. The bright red emission in the northern sky was seen easily with the unaided eye and the Observatory staff photographed it with their cameras as well."</p>

<p>"The All-Sky cameras at our Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO) at Hanle as well as at the proposed site of the National Large Solar Telescope in Merak, in Ladakh, captured a beautiful time-lapse video of the aurora, which started by 10:45 PM and continued to be intense until dawn", said Dorje Angchuk, Engineer-in-charge of the Observatory, which is operated by IIA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our staff at Hanle could see the aurora easily with their unaided eyes and managed to photograph it as well", he added.</p>

<p>"It is extremely rare to spot auroras at such low latitudes unless there are very severe geomagnetic storms," said Professor Dibyendu Nandi, from the Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India (CESSI), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added the Space Weather Group had predicted this storm, and highlighted the possibility of widespread auroras, as well as the enhanced orbital decay of Low Earth Orbiting satellites.</p>

<p>Speaking to NDTV, Dr S Somanath, Chairman, of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Bengaluru confirmed that "All Indian satellites are safe and working smoothly and have not been impacted by this intense solar storm that hit Earth."</p>

<p>According to scientists from the Bhabha Atomic Research Center "On October 10, Earth experienced a G4-class geomagnetic storm, triggered by a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) that erupted from the Sun. Geomagnetic storms are significant disturbances in Earth's magnetic field caused by solar activity, particularly CMEs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The G-scale for geomagnetic storms ranges from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme) and a G4 storm is classified as severe. Upon arrival, the CME interacted with Earth's magnetosphere, leading to significant fluctuations in the magnetic field and resulting in a storm. The interaction between the CME's magnetic field and Earth's magnetic field facilitated enhanced Auroral activity. BARC has established the Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment (MACE) telescope at Hanle, Ladakh which monitors Gamma-ray bursts.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/87l68p7_aurora-lights-ladakh_625x300_11_October_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Indian Institute of Astrophysics and Bhabha Atomic Research Center</span></p>
</div>

<p>BARC said this storm resulted in the excitation of oxygen and nitrogen atoms in Earth's upper atmosphere. This process occurs when energetic solar wind particles-primarily electrons-are accelerated along magnetic field lines toward the poles, where they collide with atmospheric atoms and molecules. These collisions excite the atoms, causing them to emit light as they return to their ground states. The excitation of oxygen at higher altitudes (&gt;200 km) produces rare red auroras.</p>

<p>BARC says such storms can have severe consequences like high-frequency radio communications experiencing disruptions, affecting aviation and maritime operations. The increased particle flux also poses a radiation risk to satellite electronics. This event emphasizes the necessity for sustained monitoring and preparedness in the context of space weather phenomena. The impacts of solar storms, characterized by coronal mass ejections and solar flares, can transcend mere visual manifestations, leading to substantial disruptions in critical infrastructure and global communication systems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented an array of intricately crafted gifts, showcasing India's rich cultural heritage, to the leaders of Laos, Thailand, New Zealand, and Japan at the 21st India-ASEAN Summit, officials said.</p>

<p>Among the notable gifts, PM Modi gave New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon a pair of majestic silver lamps adorned with rubies from Maharashtra.</p>

<p>These gifts, which highlight India's artistry and craftsmanship, also included a vintage brass Buddha statue with mina (enamel) work for Lao President Thongloun Sisoulith, a Patan Patola scarf in a Sadeli box for Naly Sisoulith, the President's spouse, a Kadamwood embossed Buddha head for Lao Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, and a malachite and camel bone box featuring a Radha-Krishna theme for his spouse.</p>

<p>Kadamwood is known for its durability and intricate embossing.</p>

<p>The vintage brass Buddha statue, gifted to President Sisoulith, is a masterpiece of South Indian craftsmanship, originating from Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>Crafted by skilled artisans, it symbolises the deep-rooted influence of Buddhist philosophy across Asia.</p>

<p>Naly Sisoulith received a Patan Patola scarf, a fine double ikat textile woven by the Salvi family in Patan, Gujarat. Known for its vibrant colours and intricate design, the scarf is a timeless representation of India's ancient silk traditions, officials said.</p>

<p>For Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, PM Modi presented a low-height wooden table from Ladakh, a vibrant piece featuring intricate carvings that embody the cultural essence of the Himalayan region.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba received a silver peacock figurine, crafted with detailed nakkashi (carving) work from West Bengal.</p>

<p>Each gift, embodying Indian craftsmanship, highlighted the deep cultural ties between India and the ASEAN nations, celebrating centuries of artistic heritage, the officials said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has expressed grave "concern" over the abysmal conflict situation in West Asia as Israel intensifies its resolve targeting Hezbollah hideouts. New Delhi issued a statement today after UN peacekeepers stationed in south Lebanon came under fire from Israeli forces.</p>

<p>Among the UN peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon, there are approximately 900 Indian soldiers. It is important to note that they were not at the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon or UNIFIL headquarters at the time it was attacked by Israeli forces. Besides the soldiers, there are around 25 staff officers, including medical experts deployed there.</p>

<p>"We are concerned at the deteriorating security situation along the Blue Line," the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement, adding that "We continue to monitor the situation very closely."</p>

<p>New Delhi underscored the importance it attaches to United Nations' peacekeeping initiatives saying UN premises cannot be allowed to be targeted, and respecting its sanctity is a mandate.</p>

<p>"Inviolability of UN premises must be respected by all, and appropriate measures taken to ensure the safety of UN peacekeepers and the sanctity of their mandate," the foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>Israel however, has defended its actions, with the Israeli Defense Forces or IDF claiming that "Since the beginning of the war, Hezbollah has fired more than 130 rockets in close proximity" to 26 United Nations facilities."</p>

</div>

<p>The IDF also put out a map in which it has identified these places as being "less than 300 meters" from the UN facilities.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT THE UNITED NATIONS SAID - UNIFIL STATEMENT</strong></h2>

<p>The UN has said, "Recent escalation along the Blue Line is causing widespread destruction of towns and villages in south Lebanon, while rockets continue to be launched towards Israel, including civilian areas. In the past days we have seen incursions from Israel into Lebanon in Naqoura and other areas. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers have clashed with Hizbullah elements on the ground in Lebanon."</p>

<p>It further said that "UNIFIL's Naqoura headquarters and nearby positions have been repeatedly hit," adding that on Thursday "two peacekeepers were injured after an IDF Merkava tank fired its weapon toward an observation tower at UNIFIL's headquarters in Naqoura, directly hitting it and causing them to fall. The injuries are fortunately, this time, not serious, but they remain in hospital."</p>

<p>Speaking about the Israeli offensive, the UN statement asserted that "IDF soldiers also fired on UN position (UNP) 1-31 in Labbouneh, hitting the entrance to the bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering, and damaging vehicles and a communications system. An IDF drone was observed flying inside the UN position up to the bunker entrance."</p>

</div>

<p>It further highlighted that on Wednesday "IDF (Israeli) soldiers deliberately fired at and disabled the position's perimeter-monitoring cameras. They also deliberately fired on UNP 1-32A in Ras Naqoura, where regular Tripartite meetings were held before the conflict began, damaging lighting and a relay station."</p>

<p>Reminding Israeli forces that its attacks on UN facilities is a grave violation of international humanitarian law as well as UN Security Council resolution 1701, the UN said, "We remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times. UNIFIL peacekeepers are present in south Lebanon to support a return to stability under Security Council mandate. Any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and of Security Council resolution 1701."</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1701</strong></h3>

<p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 is a resolution that was adopted with an intention to resolve the 2006 Lebanon War.</p>

<p>The resolution has been the linchpin of peace between Israel and Lebanon for almost two decades and the 10,000 UN peacekeepers who are tasked with implementing it on the ground.</p>

</div>

<p>Adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council in 2006, the purpose of resolution 1701 continues to be about ending hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, with the Council calling for a permanent ceasefire to be based on the creation of a buffer zone.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS 'THE BLUE LINE'</strong></h3>

<p>The 'Blue Line' is a United Nations-recognised demarcation line to indicate that Israel had withdrawn its military from southern Lebanon. It separates Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights, but it is not an official international border.</p>

<p>Stretching for 120km along Lebanon's southern frontier and Israel's northern border, the so-called "Blue Line" is "a key to peace in the region" and one of the central elements of resolution 1701 since the war in 2006, with UNIFIL peacekeepers being its temporary custodian, according to UN Peacekeeping.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="UNIFIL and Lebanese officers operate one of the &quot;Blue Barrels&quot;, which determine the Blue Line, in southern Lebanon in 2010. (file)" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/kdgsvsi4_2006-blue-line-separating-israel-and-lebanon_625x300_11_October_24.jpg" title="UNIFIL and Lebanese officers operate one of the &quot;Blue Barrels&quot;, which determine the Blue Line, in southern Lebanon in 2010.

</div>

<p>Based on various historical maps, some dating back almost a century, the Blue Line is not a border, but a temporary "line of withdrawal" set by the UN in 2000 for the practical purpose of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Whenever Israeli or Lebanese authorities wish to undertake any activities close to the Blue Line, UNIFIL requests that they provide advance notice, allowing the UN mission to keep authorities on all sides informed, to minimise any misunderstandings that could lead to increased tensions.</p>

<h3><strong>ISRAEL'S LETTER TO THE UNITED NATIONS</strong></h3>

<p>Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs has written a letter to the United Nations clarifying its stance amid the ongoing and escalating crisis in the Middle East (West Asia), especially with regard to its operations in Lebanon.</p>

<p>In its letter, the minister wrote that "On Ictiber 8, 2023, Hezbollah, a terrorist, Iranian-backed organisation, launched an unprovoked attack on Israel, joining the war initiated by Hazas on October 7, 2023. Since then they have fired over 13,000 projectiles, 1500 anti-tank missiles and hundreds of explosive drones at Israeli communities, forcing more than 63,000 people to evacuate their homes."</p>

<p>The minister further said that "This war which was imposed on Israel has so far resulted in 51 casualties and over 372 injuries, besides causing severe damage ot Israeli towns and villages."</p>

<p>The minister said that as a result of Hezbollah's unilateral and unprovoked actions, "One year later, on October 1, 2024 the IDF initiated a targeted, limited raid operations in southern Lebanon aimed at Hezbollah military assets and infrastructure along the Blue Line, with a goal of dismantling them and neutralising the ongoing threat."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 54-year-old man in Brazil who has been accused of sexually abusing and imprisoning his wife, their seven children and his mother-in-law for two decades has been arrested. Citing Brazilian outlets, the <em>People </em>reported the alleged crimes came to light after one of the daughters escaped the home in Novo Oriente, Brazil. The man, who has not been named in the reports, allegedly held his 40-year-old wife captive for almost the entirety of their marriage. She only left the house to receive benefits and was usually accompanied by him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"None of the neighbours knew her, not even her relatives had access to her," police spokesperson Herika Ribeiro Sena said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/man-allegedly-held-captive-wife-children-mother-law-decades-sexual-abuse-8726522" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seven children, between the ages of 3 and 22, were also victimised by the man. He also allegedly sexually abused his now-deceased mother-in-law. Police allege the woman died after falling ill and not being given proper care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The daughters claim that the man drilled holes into the walls of the house so he could see them taking showers and getting dressed. He also allegedly raped them before forcing them to have abortions.</p>

<p>It was only when one of the daughters gave him a sleeping pill that she could escape and report him to the police. Authorities then carried out a month-long investigation before they carried out a raid at the home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <em>People</em>, the man is also accused of burying three fetuses on the property after forcing his wife to have three miscarriages by making her take medication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 54-year-old is being charged with false imprisonment, rape of a vulnerable person, psychological violence, abortion and concealment of a corpse. "What this daughter did is very important: bringing what was happening to the public so that action could be taken," Ms Sena said, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man is currently in custody and has denied all charges against him. The investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India today strongly rejected claims made by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau that "safety of Canadians" was discussed when he came face-to-face with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Laos, on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit. The two leaders exchanged greetings.</p>

<p>"There was no substantive discussion between PM Modi and Prime Minister Trudeau in Vientiane," government sources told NDTV, saying the two leaders only greeted each other when they came face-to-face in Laos.</p>

<p>Speaking about Khalistani activity being encouraged on Canadian soil, foreign ministry sources told NDTV that "India continues to expect that anti-India Khalistani activities will not be allowed to take place on Canadian soil and that firm action, which is lacking thus far, will be taken against those advocating violence, extremism and terrorism against India from Canadian territory."</p>

<p>Cautioning Canada about growing extremism in the north American country, the source said, "The growing nexus of such forces with organised crime, drug syndicates and human trafficking should be a concern for Canada as well."</p>

<p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation or CBC News said Justin Trudeau described the interaction with PM Modi as a "brief exchange". "I emphasised that there is work that we need to do," CBC News quoted Mr Trudeau as saying.</p>

<p>Speaking at a press conference in Laos, Mr Trudeau said, "I won't go into details about what we talked about but what I've said many times is that the safety of Canadians and upholding the rule of law is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any Canadian government and that's what I'll stay focused on."</p>

<p>The brief exchange between PM Modi and Justin Trudeau came almost a year after the Canadian PM accused India of involvement in the death of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Nijjar, who was taking refuge in Canada and was given citizenship in that country.</p>

<p>India has rejected the claims that such discussions happened during the brief exchange, saying, "India attaches importance to relations with Canada but these cannot be repaired unless the Canadian Government takes strict and verifiable action against those who actively pursue anti-India activities and have conspired to promote hate, disinformation, communal disharmony and violence in India as well as Canada."</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada are at an all-time low after Justin Trudeau's allegations in September of a "potential involvement" of Indian agents in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing outside a gurdwara in Surrey city on June 18, 2023.</p>

<p>India had designated Hardeep Singh Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020 and has strongly rejected Justin Trudeau's allegations as "absurd" and "motivated."<br />

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/r4gkka2_brics_625x300_11_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Among all BRICS leaders, it's perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin who is waiting for this year's summit, scheduled to be held on October 22-24 in Kazan, most eagerly.</p>

<p>Last year, he skipped the summit in South Africa for fear of being arrested. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin over alleged war crimes committed during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. South Africa, as a signatory to the Rome Statute, would have been obligated to arrest him had he entered the country. And so, Putin had to make do with virtual participation.</p>

<p>But this year's BRICS summit will be a significant moment for him as he will not only host the event on his own turf but he will also be keen to show to the Western world that despite their sanctions on Russia and attempts to diplomatically isolate him, he is still playing host to some of the world's most influential leaders, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. As a host, Putin's effort will be to highlight Russia's successful outreach to non-Western countries.</p>

<p>It is true that despite Western sanctions, Russia remains a pivotal member of this dynamic group, which represents 24% of the global nominal GDP and 41% of the world's population. Despite attempts to isolate Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Putin may also claim that Moscow remains a key player in reshaping the world order, drawing strength from its BRICS alliances. These ties illustrate how countries outside the G7 are increasingly seeking alternatives to Western-dominated institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank</p>

<h2><b>BRICS Is Here To Stay</b></h2>

<p>BRICS, the economic and political alliance comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has gained a lot of prominence since its inception 15 years ago. Political analysts, economists and academics in the West had long predicted its demise. For instance, Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, questioned BRICS' relevance in 2013, saying, "BRICS is a term that has lost its relevance... It's a grouping that doesn't have a lot of coherence, and it's not clear what they are trying to achieve together."</p>

<p>But it has not just endured but is expanding, defying initial Western scepticism. Its latest members are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. The bloc has attracted interest from nearly 40 other countries, including NATO member Turkey, which has now formally applied for its membership. Indonesia has been invited to join too, but it seems to be reluctant to become a part of the group, which, it views as anti-West.</p>

<h2><strong>India Should Carve Out Its Own Playing Field</strong></h2>

<p>Many years after the Indian National Congress was founded in 1885, it remained a petitioner to the British Raj. The assertion of its right to self-determination was weak until Mahatma Gandhi arrived on the national landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, India should not be seen to be petitioning for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The UN and UNSC, formed after the Second World War, are relics of the 20th century. The global landscape has dramatically changed since then, with emerging economies like India yearning to play a far more significant role in global affairs.</p>

<p>As the world's most populous country, the fifth-largest economy and a robust democracy to boot, Indians believe they should have a permanent voice in the decision-making processes that affect global peace and security. But the US, often in collaboration with its Western allies, has considerable sway within the UN system, which allows it to exert influence over its priorities and decision-making. The US is so powerful that it has managed to restrict BRICS's progress too. For example, many Chinese banks have ceased transactions with Russia to avoid US penalties, and BRICS's New Development Bank (NDB) has frozen its projects in Russia due to US sanctions.</p>

<p>The Indian government is not necessarily in favour of dismantling the existing US-led world order. It argues that the system has to be more inclusive; it wants what it believes are its rights in the existing system. It urges reforms in global financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which further highlights its desire for a more equitable distribution of power in the global system.</p>

<h2><strong>West 'Protecting' The Existing Order</strong></h2>

<p>The US, France and the UK, all three permanent members of the UNSC, have often openly supported India's stance on the reform of international bodies. But it's unclear how genuine their intentions are. With the war raging in Ukraine, West Asia engulfed in violence and China's rise as their global challenger, the US and its Western allies appear to have become more assertive to protect their dominance of the world order.</p>

<p>For India, the time for petitioning or expecting favours from the West without a quid pro quo is over. India should use BRICS as a platform for amplifying its voice in global governance. It should value BRICS as a platform to advocate for a multipolar world. This is not to suggest that New Delhi should allow BRICS to become an overtly anti-West group. But it should use the platform to its advantage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often talked about India's ambition to be a leading voice of the Global South. Global bodies, such as BRICS and G20, provide a means to achieve such goals.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Does China Have The Upper Hand</strong></h2>

<p>India has benefited economically from the group, particularly through discounted Russian energy imports amid Western sanctions. Being a founding member of BRICS, India should realise that global fora such as BRICS and the G20 are credible products of a new, multipolar international order. If you do not get your rightful place in the existing order, you help create a new one, a more just order, without disengaging yourself with the existing one. India's increasing engagement in BRICS and the G20 demonstrates its willingness to work within the existing global order while advocating for change</p>

<p>India should go a step further and be an agent of change. It should not allow China to control the BRICS agenda. But sadly, even though India is a founding member, it does not wield as much direct influence as China, mostly due to the latter's economic and geopolitical clout. Russia, despite sanctions, remains a key BRICS player, especially because it sees the group as a way to counterbalance Western influence. But India's importance within the group is undisputed in some areas. For example, it brings credibility to the bloc because of its democratic credentials. It is an established global player in the IT sector and a huge market for investment. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What The West Thinks Of BRICS</strong></h2>

<p>Many in the West now appear to take BRICS quite seriously as a counterbalance to the Western hegemony. But they suspect that the inherent division within the group could hamper its progress into a true alternative to the West-dominated world order. China and Russia are pushing BRICS to become a decidedly anti-West bloc. The recent inclusion of anti-West Iran, at their behest, is a case in point. Indeed, experts in the West believe that the alliance seeks alternative centres of power, frustrated with Western domination.</p>

<p>Under President Xi Jinping, China has been trying to create an alternative global financial and technological system to circumvent the US dollar dominance. Projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the creation of the New Development Bank (NDB) and efforts to internationalise the Yuan align with Chinese goals of establishing an alternative multipolar world order.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, India, South Africa and Brazil do not fully share China's ambitions. They favour reforming the existing global system rather than dismantling it. They aim for a multipolar world where they can balance relations between the US and China, without fully aligning with either.</p>

<p>The question of whether BRICS can maintain its cohesion amid internal divisions looms large over the Kazan summit. I will be keenly observing how the summit navigates its members' competing national interests. But what one can say with confidence is that the group's relevance as a counterweight to Western power is indisputable.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tatas, a brand that has for more than 150 years instilled a feeling of trust and reassurance, has always seen a line of succession where the people at the helm have set the very highest standards and ethics in the world of business. Their personalities cannot be separated from what the brand has evolved into.</p>

<p>Founded in 1868, Tatas have become one of largest and most diverse global conglomerates. It is a name heard in almost every home in India and tens of millions overseas.</p>

<p>Ratan Tata, the kind and graceful gentleman-industrialist and philanthropist, who is credited with taking brand Tata to over 100 countries under his leadership, died at a hospital in Mumbai earlier this week. His stewardship of the Tata behemoth has left a void that few can fill, or not - only time will tell.</p>

<p>Ratan Tata is being succeeded by his half-brother Noel Tata. Ratan Tata's parents Naval Tata and Soonoo Commissariat got divorced when Ratan and his younger brother Jimmy were very young. Years later their father married Simone Dunoyer, and the two had a son Noel.</p>

<h2><strong>THE TATA FAMILY ANCESTRY</strong></h2>

<p>Ancestors of the Tata family migrated to India from Persia, now Iran, in the 8th century AD. They were part of a large group of Parsis (people from Persia), a Zoroastrian ethnic community, who fled persecution during the Islamic Conquest of Persia.</p>

<p>According to the Tata Central Archives, the Tatas settled in Navsari in Gujarat and lived there for 25 generations before business took them to Bombay - then the Bombay Presidency under the British Raj. At the time Bombay Province included the western two-thirds of Maharashtra, northwestern Karnataka, all of Gujarat, all of Sindh (now in Pakistan), and Aden (in present-day Yemen).</p>

<p>The journey of the Tata family's business began with Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, who stated a trading company in Bombay in 1868, which has today become the Tata Group. The Tatas have always believed in the concept of country and society - building and uplifting the people and the community over personal gains - and right from the very beginning, Jamsetji and his two sons - Sir Dorabji Tata and Sir Ratan Tata - left most of their estate and shares in the company to charitable trusts.</p>

<p>Today, there are 14 different trusts run by the Tatas which work in different sectors, each independent of the other in the nature and field of work they do. All of these however, come under an umbrella organisation called Tata Trust. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ratan-tatas-journey-from-mumbai-boy-to-the-global-icon-a-timeline-of-his-life-6756202" target="_blank">Ratan Tata was the Chairman of the Tata Trusts</a> and Chairman Emeritus of the Tata Group. After his demise, his half-brother Noel Tata has become the Chairman of Tata Trusts while Natarajan Chandrasekaran is Chairman of the Tata Group, whose largest stakeholder is the Tata Trust.</p>

<h3><strong>NOEL TATA - NEW CHAIRMAN - TATA TRUSTS</strong></h3>

<p>Born in December 1957, Noel Tata is twenty years younger than his half-brother Ratan Tata. He is the son of Naval Tata and Simone Dunoyer, a French-Swiss Catholic and businesswoman from Switzerland.</p>

<p>Noel Tata holds a degree from Sussex University (UK) and has completed the International Executive Programme (IEP) at INSEAD.. He is an Indian-Irish businessman and has been appointed as the Chairman of the Tata Trust. He is married to Aloo Mistry, who is Cyrus Mistry's sister and Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry's granddaughter. They have three children - Neville, Maya, and Leah - all of whom are actively involved in the Tata conglomerate. Leah Tata is the Vice President at the Indian Hotels Company. While Maya Tata is associated with Tata Capital, Neville Tata is part of Trent and leadership team at Star Bazaar.</p>

<p>Noel Tata's most prominent role before this new appointment was as Managing Director of Tata International Ltd, the group's trading and distribution arm. Under his leadership from 2010 to 2021, the company grew from a turnover of $500 million to over $3 billion. As Managing Director of Trent Ltd, Tata's retail arm, he expanded its operations from a single store in 1998 to over 700 stores across various formats.</p>

<p>Till his appointment as Chairman - Tata Trusts, Noel Tata has been chairman of Trent, Tata International Limited, Voltas and Tata Investment Corporation. He is also vice chairman of Tata Steel and Titan Company Limited. He also serves as a trustee on the board of Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, which together comprise over 50 per cent of the ownership of Tata Sons.</p>

<p>Noel Tata has now become the sixth chairman of Sir Ratan Tata Trust and 11th chairman of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nuclear weapons never bring peace, said the co-chair of Nihon Hidankyo, a group of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki that won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo awarded the group the Nobel prize on Friday "for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again".</p>

<p>Toshiyuki Mimaki, co-chair of Nihon Hidankyo, broke down in tears at a press conference after the award was announced, saying "never did I dream this could happen".</p>

<p>"It has been said that because of nuclear weapons, the world maintains peace. But nuclear weapons can be used by terrorists," Mimaki told reporters.</p>

<p>"For example, if Russia uses them against Ukraine, Israel against Gaza, it won't end there. Politicians should know these things."</p>

<p>He added that members of the group -- which was founded in 1956 -- were the "average age of 85".</p>

<p>"I hope that the second-generation (of atomic bomb survivors) and the general public participate in peace activities, for peace without nuclear weapons," he said.</p>

<p>Mimaki also said the situation for children in Gaza is similar to what Japan faced at the end of World War II.</p>

<p>"In Gaza, bleeding children are being held (by their parents). It's like in Japan 80 years ago," he said.</p>

<p>"(Children in Japan/Hiroshima Nagasaki) lost their fathers in the war and mothers in the atomic bomb. They became orphans."</p>

<p>The 20th century brought Japan's brutal rampage across Asia and World War II, which ended in 1945 after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>

<p>The first nuclear bomb hit Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and killed 140,000 people.</p>

<p>Three days later, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing 74,000 people including many who survived the explosion but died later from radiation exposure.</p>

<p>Japan announced its surrender in World War II on August 15, 1945.</p>

<p>The mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, denounced nuclear weapons as an "absolute evil".</p>

<p>"Hibakusha (survivors) are fast ageing and there are fewer and fewer people able to testify to the meaninglessness of possessing atomic bombs and their absolute evil," he told reporters Friday.</p>

<p>"People in coming generations must know that what happened is not just a tragedy for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but one that concerns all humanity that must not be repeated."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also hailed the awarding of the prize to Nihon Hidankyo.</p>

<p>"The fact that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to this organisation, which has spent many years working toward the abolition of nuclear weapons, is extremely meaningful," Ishiba told reporters.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A case report in the BMJ details the first known case of the “breakdance bulge” – a benign tumour on the scalp, caused by the repeated friction and pressure exerted during headspins.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Months after breakdance made its Olympic debut in Paris this year, researchers in Denmark have shed light on a lesser-known risk associated with one of the sport's most iconic moves: the headspin. Danish researchers recently published a case report in the <a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/17/9/e261854 ">BMJ</a>&nbsp;detailing the first known case of what they call “breakdance bulge” – a benign tumour on the scalp, caused by the repeated friction and pressure exerted during headspins. The patient, a man in his early 30s, was a breakdancer for nearly 20 years and developed a tumour more than an inch thick on the top of his head.</p>

<p>Though not life-threatening, the bump caused discomfort and made the patient self-conscious. He reported feeling uneasy in public without wearing a hat. He later underwent surgery to remove the growth. “It's great to be able to go out in public without a cap or hat,” he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/10/health/headspin-hole-breakdancers/index.html">CNN</a>. “Many people tell me they don't notice the bump anymore and that my head looks completely normal.”</p>

<p>The continuous strain on the patient's scalp led to inflammation, bleeding and ultimately the formation of thickened skin and scar tissue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Dr Christian Baastrup Sondergaard, a neurosurgery specialist at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, “the condition results from repeated friction between the head and the floor, combined with the weight-bearing nature of headspins, accumulated over years of breakdancing.”</p>

<p>Known as “headspin hole” within the breaking community, the injury typically starts with hair loss but can progress into a noticeable bump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this being an acknowledged issue in the community, especially among long-time practitioners, the medical literature on headspin-related injuries remains scarce. Breakers online, including users of Reddit's boy forum, have shared their own experiences with bald spots and offered tips like wearing padded beanies or using gel pads under hats to reduce friction while performing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers have observed a spectacular cosmic event where a massive black hole is disrupting two celestial objects, one of which was a star. The discovery, made with NASA's observatories, including Chandra, NICER and Hubble, alongside India's AstroSat, provides insights into the behaviour of stellar debris around supermassive black holes.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>Back in 2019, astronomers observed a star venturing too close to a supermassive black hole. The star was shredded by the intense gravitational forces, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). The remnants of the star formed an accretion disk - a swirling graveyard of stellar material around the black hole. For several years, this disk remained relatively stable, but recently, astronomers noted something extraordinary. The disk expanded and began interacting with a second object, either a star or possibly a smaller black hole previously orbiting at a safe distance.</p>

<p>Now, this second object is colliding with the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Indias_AstroSat_and_NASAs_Space_Observatories_Capture_Dramatic_Eruptions.html">stellar debris</a> disk every 48 hours, creating dramatic eruptions of X-rays each time it passes through. "Imagine a diver repeatedly entering a pool and causing a splash each time," said Matt Nicholl of Queen's University Belfast. "The star here is like the diver, while the disk acts as the pool, creating a cosmic 'splash' of gas and X-rays."</p>

<p>Astronomers have long documented TDEs, where a single star is destroyed by a black hole in one intense burst of energy. More recently, however, a puzzling phenomenon known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) has also been observed. These are bright X-ray flashes from the centres of galaxies that appear in regular intervals but were poorly understood - until now.</p>

<p>"There had been feverish speculation that these phenomena were connected, and now we've discovered the proof that they are," said Dheeraj Pasham from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It's like solving two cosmic mysteries at once," said Mr Pasham.</p>

<p>The event, now named AT2019qiz, was first identified in 2019 by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory. As the accretion disk expanded and began interacting with the second object, NASA's Chandra Observatory captured three separate sets of X-ray data over several hours, providing clear evidence of repeated eruptions.</p>

<p>NICER, another NASA instrument aboard the International Space Station, continued monitoring AT2019qiz and confirmed the X-ray eruptions occurred every 48 hours. Complementary observations from NASA's Swift observatory and India's AstroSat telescope further reinforced these findings. AstroSat's unique capability to observe both X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) light provided critical data that helped astronomers confirm the size of the accretion disk and the repetitive nature of these eruptions.</p>

<p>Gulab Dewangan, a co-author from the Inter-University Center for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, talked about AstroSat's role. "India's AstroSat mission provides unique UV/X-ray capability for studying such events," he said, as per an ISRO report. "AstroSat's Soft X-ray Telescope and the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) both detected the source AT2019qiz, but the eruptions were only seen in X-rays. Future sensitive simultaneous X-ray and UV observations of similar eruptions will enable a deeper investigation into their nature."</p>

<p>"This is a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the origin of these regular eruptions," said Andrew Mummery of Oxford University. "We now realise we need to wait a few years for the eruptions to 'turn on' after a star has been torn apart because it takes some time for the disk to spread out far enough to encounter another star."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese organisation Nihon Hidankyo has been conferred with the Nobel Peace Prize 2024 for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>The organisation is a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, also known as Hibakusha, which strives to "achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again".</p>

<p>While announcing this year's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-is-the-nobel-peace-prize-decided-6764236">Peace Prize</a>, the Norwegian Nobel Committee honoured the&nbsp;atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki for cultivating hope for peace through&nbsp;"their costly experience". "They help us to describe the indescribable, to think the unthinkable, and to somehow grasp the incomprehensible pain and suffering caused by nuclear weapons," the committee stated on X.</p>

<p>The committee also highlighted that no nuclear weapon has been used in war in nearly 80 years. Acknowledging&nbsp;Nihon Hidankyo's efforts towards the establishment of a nuclear taboo, the Nobel Committee also aid that the same is under pressure.</p>

<p>By&nbsp;drawing on personal stories, creating educational campaigns based on their own experience, and issuing urgent warnings against the spread and use of nuclear weapons, the organisation has helped consolidate opposition to nuclear weapons, said a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/press-release-peace-2024/">Nobel Committee press release</a>.</p>

<p>"The nuclear powers are modernising and upgrading their arsenals, new countries appear to be preparing to acquire nuclear weapons, and threats are being made to use nuclear weapons in ongoing warfare. At this moment in human history, it is worth reminding ourselves what nuclear weapons are: the most destructive weapons the world has ever seen," a press release stated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 2024 <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-goes-to-scientists-david-baker-demis-hassabis-john-jumper-6751373">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> went to scientists David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, while the&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2024-nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-us-scientists-victor-ambros-and-gary-ruvkun-6735227">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> went to&nbsp;Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for the discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation.</p>

<p>South Korean writer Han Kang, was awarded 2024 the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nobel-prize-in-literature-goes-to-south-korean-author-han-kang-6759706">Nobel Prize in Literature,</a> "for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life."</p>

<p>American John Hopfield and British-Canadian Geoffrey Hinton won the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-the-nobel-prize-for-physics-co-winner-fears-6744406">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for pioneering work in the development of artificial intelligence. Shortly after the award's announcement,&nbsp;Hinton raised concerns about the technology he has created.</p>

<p>The prize comes with a gold medal, a diploma and a prize sum of $1 million (913,000 euro).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media platform TikTok is laying off hundreds of employees from its global workforce, including a large number of staff in Malaysia, the company said on Friday, as it shifts focus towards a greater use of AI in content moderation.</p>

<p>Two sources familiar with the matter earlier told Reuters that more than 700 jobs were slashed in Malaysia. TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, later clarified that less than 500 employees in the country were affected.</p>

<p>The employees, most of whom were involved in the firm's content moderation operations, were informed of their dismissal by email late Wednesday, the sources said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to media.</p>

<p>In response to Reuters' queries, TikTok confirmed the layoffs and said that several hundred employees were expected to be impacted globally as part of a wider plan to improve its moderation operations.</p>

<p>TikTok employs a mix of automated detection and human moderators to review content posted on the site.</p>

<p>ByteDance has over 110,000 employees in more than 200 cities globally, according to the company website.</p>

<p>The technology firm is also planning more retrenchments next month as it looks to consolidate some of its regional operations, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>"We're making these changes as part of our ongoing efforts to further strengthen our global operating model for content moderation," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The company expects to invest $2 billion globally in trust and safety this year and will continue to improve efficiency, with 80% of guidelines-violating content now removed by automated technologies, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The layoffs were first reported by business portal The Malaysian Reserve on Thursday.</p>

<p>The job cuts occur as global technology firms face greater regulatory pressure in Malaysia, where the government has asked social media operators to apply for an operating licence by January as part of an effort to combat cyber offences.</p>

<p>Malaysia reported a sharp increase in harmful social media content earlier this year and urged firms, including TikTok, to step up monitoring on their platforms.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Japanese actor who was the voice of "Doraemon", a cartoon cat robot beloved by children in Japan and other countries has died, her agency said Friday. Nobuyo Oyama was 90.</p>

<p>For a quarter of a century until 2005, Oyama lent her endearingly hoarse voice to the titular blue feline from the 22nd century with his "magic pocket" and its supply of fantastical gadgets, including a door that lets you travel anywhere.</p>

<p>She "passed away on September 29 due to old age", her talent agency told AFP. Her funeral was attended by close relatives, it said.</p>

<p>"Doraemon" is still on air as one of the longest-running Japanese anime series, popular across Asia and farther afield.</p>

<p>While Oyama's successor has played the role for nearly two decades, her voice remains the definitive sound of the robot for many who grew up hearing it.</p>

<p>In "Doraemon", the cuddly robot cat with its huge smile travels back in time to help a lazy schoolboy called Nobita overcome the trials of everyday life.</p>

<p>Created by the artist Fujiko F. Fujio, the character first appeared in manga strips in 1969, making the transition to the small and big screen over the following decades.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris said on Thursday that Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 election race this summer was "one of the most courageous" any president has made.</p>

<p>"President Biden made a decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous that a president could make, which is he decided to put country above his personal interest," Harris said during the Las Vegas event sponsored by Univision, a Spanish-language television network, according to press pool reporters. Her remarks were dubbed into Spanish on television.</p>

<p>"I believe that the stakes right now are extraordinarily high, and potentially, some might say, historians have said unprecedented."</p>

<p>The Democratic presidential nominee made the remarks when pressed by a voter who said he was leaning towards Trump and expressed concern about how Biden exited the race. The voter said he wanted clarity on why Harris became the nominee without going through a competitive primary.</p>

<p>Biden ended his re-election bid on July 21, after facing weeks of pressure from prominent Democratic elected officials and donors concerned about his age and fitness. Biden immediately endorsed Harris, who locked down the support of enough Democratic delegates to secure the party's nomination.</p>

<p>Harris said in an interview on ABC News' "The View" on Tuesday that there is "not a thing" she would have done differently from Biden as president. The remark was seized upon by Donald Trump's campaign, which wants voters to see the Republican ex-president as the 2024 candidate of change.</p>

<p>Harris said Biden, who is not making regular campaign appearances on her behalf, has been a key partner and supporter and that his decision to leave the race marked a sharp contrast with Trump, who never conceded his 2020 election loss.</p>

<p>"We are literally having a choice as the American people about choosing a path either that is about rule of law, democracy or something that is about admiring dictators," she said, according to the pool reporters.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[International Day Of Girl Child 2024: The report highlights that when "non-contact" forms of abuse - such as online harassment or verbal assault - are factored in, the number rises to 650 million, or 1 in 5.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new UNICEF report reveals that over 370 million women and girls - or 1 in 8 globally - have experienced sexual violence, including rape and assault, before the age of 18. The figures were released ahead of the International Day of the Girl Child on October 11, marking the first-ever comprehensive global and regional data on childhood sexual violence.</p>

<p>The<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/over-370-million-girls-and-women-globally-subjected-rape-or-sexual-assault-children"> report highlights </a>that when "non-contact" forms of abuse - such as online harassment or verbal assault - are factored in, the number rises to 650 million, or 1 in 5. The staggering statistics underscore the critical need for urgent and comprehensive strategies to prevent and address the widespread violation of children's rights.</p>

<p>"Sexual violence against children is a stain on our moral conscience," stated UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. "It inflicts deep and lasting trauma, often by someone the child knows and trusts, in places where they should feel safe."</p>

<p>The pervasive nature of childhood sexual violence spans across cultural, geographical, and economic divides. The report highlights Sub-Saharan Africa as the region with the highest number of victims, accounting for 79 million affected women and girls. Other affected regions include Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (75 million), Central and Southern Asia (73 million), Europe and Northern America (68 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (45 million).</p>

<p>In regions marred by conflict and political instability, the situation is even more dire. Girls in fragile settings, such as refugee camps or areas under UN peacekeeping missions, face a higher risk, with sexual violence affecting more than 1 in 4 girls. "We are witnessing horrific sexual violence in conflict zones, where rape and gender-based violence are often used as weapons of war," Russell added.</p>

<p>The report points to a disturbing trend: most sexual violence against children occurs during adolescence, with a significant spike between ages 14 and 17. Victims are more likely to experience repeated abuse, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to break the cycle of trauma.</p>

<p>The long-term impacts of sexual violence can be devastating. Survivors often struggle with mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, and are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, and difficulty forming healthy relationships. The trauma is further compounded when survivors delay disclosing their abuse, or never report it at all.</p>

<p>While girls and women make up the majority of victims, the report also notes that boys are similarly affected. Between 240 and 310 million boys and men have experienced sexual violence during childhood, with the number rising to 530 million when non-contact forms of abuse are included.</p>

<p>As the Global Ministerial Conference on Violence Against Children approaches next month, UNICEF calls for urgent international action. Key recommendations include changing harmful social norms, equipping children with information to report abuse, ensuring victims have access to support services, and strengthening legal frameworks to protect children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two US officials told Reuters.</p>

<p>The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program.</p>

<p>"We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003," said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>The intelligence assessment could help explain US opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>US officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so.</p>

<p>"We're all watching this space very carefully," the Biden administration official said.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program.</p>

<p><strong>Key Iran ally weakened</strong></p>

<p>In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month.</p>

<p>The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself.</p>

<p>Beth Sanner, a former US deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is "higher now than it has been" and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>That would still take time, however.</p>

<p>"They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months," said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.</p>

<p>Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN watchdog.</p>

<p>The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to "a week or a little more," according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president.Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Israeli attack</strong></p>

<p>Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the US military.</p>

<p>The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat.</p>

<p>The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel.</p>

<p>Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: "That's the thing you wanna hit, right?"</p>

<p>Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead.</p>

<p>"The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity," he said.</p>

<p>"They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

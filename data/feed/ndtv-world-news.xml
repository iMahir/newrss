       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company behind a massive global IT outage, is a leader in its sector, known for building software defenses for the cloud computing age and exposing Russian and North Korean threats.</p>

<p>Based in Austin, Texas, the company was founded in 2011 by George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston.</p>

<p>Both Kurtz and Alperovitch had extensive backgrounds in cybersecurity, working at companies like McAfee.</p>

<p>Two years after its founding, CrowdStrike launched its signature product, the Falcon platform.</p>

<p>- Top player -</p>

<p>Crucially, the company embraced a "cloud-first" model to reduce big computing needs on customers and provide more effective protection.</p>

<p>Rather than just focusing on malware and antivirus products, the founders wanted to shift attention to identifying and stopping the attackers themselves and their techniques.</p>

<p>"CrowdStrike is one of the best known cybersecurity companies around," said Michael Daniel, who worked as the White House cybersecurity coordinator during Barack Obama's administration.</p>

<p>"It provides typically what we think of as sort of endpoint protection, meaning that it's actually got software running on a server, or on a particular device, like a laptop or a desktop and it's scanning for potential malware connections to bad domain names," he said.</p>

<p>"It's looking for behavior that might be unusual, that sort of thing," said Daniel who now runs the Cyber Threat Alliance.</p>

<p>The company's share price was down by about 9 percent in morning trading on Wall Street.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike became a publicly traded company in 2019 and the company's total revenue in the last quarter was $921 million with projections of brining in about $4 billion in the current fiscal year.</p>

<p>The company's main competitor is Palo Alto Networks as well as SentinelOne, which are standalone cybersecurity firms.</p>

<p>Cloud computing giants Microsoft, Amazon and Google also provide their own cybersecurity software and are rivals.</p>

<p>- North Korea hack -</p>

<p>But CrowdStrike is also a cyber intelligence company and made headlines when it was involved in investigating several high-profile cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Most famously, in 2014, CrowdStrike discovered evidence linking North Korean actors to the hack of servers at Sony Pictures.</p>

<p>The hackers stole large amounts of data and threatened terrorist acts against movie theaters to prevent the release of "The Interview," a comedy about North Korea's leader.</p>

<p>The studio initially canceled the movie's theatrical release, but reversed its decision after criticism.</p>

<p>Sony estimated the direct costs of the hack to be around $35 million for investigating and remediating the breach.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike also helped investigate the 2015-2016 cyber attacks on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the United States and their connection to Russian intelligence services.</p>

<p>In December 2016, CrowdStrike released a report stating that a Russian government-affiliated group called Fancy Bear had hacked a Ukrainian artillery app, potentially causing significant losses to Ukrainian artillery units.</p>

<p>However, this assessment was later disputed by some organizations and CrowdStrike rolled back some of the claims.</p>

<p>- Criticism of Microsoft -</p>

<p>In recent months, CrowdStike has criticized Microsoft for its lapses on cyber security as the Windows maker admitted to vulnerabilities and hackings by outside actors.</p>

<p>Among other criticisms, CrowdStrike slammed Microsoft for still doing business in China.</p>

<p>"You're telling the public they can't use Huawei, and they can't let kids watch dance videos on TikTok because China is going to collect intelligence," Shawn Henry, chief security officer at CrowdStrike said last year.</p>

<p>"Yet the most ubiquitous software, which is used throughout the government and throughout every single corporation in this country and around the world, has engineers in China working on their software," Henry told Forbes.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eleven people were killed when a bridge in northern China collapsed amid torrential rains, state news agency Xinhua reported Saturday.</p>

<p>The bridge in Shaanxi province's Shangluo collapsed at around 8:40 pm Friday (1240 GMT) "due to a sudden downpour and flash floods", Xinhua said, citing the provincial public relations department.</p>

<p>Rescue operations were under way Saturday morning, according to Xinhua, with five vehicles so far recovered from the water.</p>

<p>Images on state television CCTV showed a partially submerged section of the bridge with the river rushing over it.</p>

<p>Large portions of northern and central China have been battered since Tuesday by rains that have caused flooding and significant damage.</p>

<p>On Friday, state media reported at least five people dead and eight missing after the rains sparked flooding and mudslides in Shaanxi's Baoji city.</p>

<p>China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains across the east and south coming as much of the north has sweltered in successive heat waves.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catastrophic computer outages caused by a software update from one company have once again exposed the dangers of global technological dependence on a handful of players, experts warned on Friday.</p>

<p>A flawed update sent out by the little-known security firm CrowdStrike brought airlines, TV stations, and myriad other aspects of daily life to a standstill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outages affected companies or individuals that use CrowdStrike on the Microsoft Windows platform: when they applied the update, the incompatible software crashed computers into a frozen state known as the "Blue Screen of Death."</p>

<p>"Today CrowdStrike has become a household name, but not in a good way, and this will take time to settle down," said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.</p>

<p>The breakdown quickly fueled discussions about internet giants' power over the increasingly digital world economy, with more activity now taking place in the computing "cloud" or on a few apps or platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Just 'a taste'</strong></p>

<p>When those platforms have flaws -- or are deliberately attacked -- the world seems to collapse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent months, entire healthcare systems and industries have been paralyzed after hackers infiltrated their systems, leaving consumers at their wits' end and companies at a loss.</p>

<p>"I think we're just getting a taste of some potential effects of real reliance by the financial sector and sectors across the economy on a handful of cloud companies and other key systems," Rohit Chopra, director of the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CNBC.</p>

<p>"There are just a handful of big cloud companies where so much of the economy is now resting."</p>

<p>The world has seen a major shift to cloud computing, where companies use servers offered by big tech giants for their computing needs instead of their own infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon, through its AWS company, is the world leader, followed by Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Friday's breakdown was caused by a malfunctioning software update fed to Microsoft Windows users by CrowdStrike, which specializes in cybersecurity for cloud-based companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're deeply sorry for the impact we've caused to customers, travelers, and anyone affected by this," CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show.</p>

<p>Microsoft blamed the problems on CrowdStrike, but industry insiders warned that the issue stems from entrusting the digital world to just a few key companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's going to continue to raise issues for systems or businesses wholly dependent on Microsoft -- this issue of concentration risk," Michael Daniel, former White House cybersecurity coordinator and current head of the Cyber Threat Alliance told AFP.</p>

<p>"How do you balance the benefits of having everybody on the same operating system with the concentration risk that poses?"</p>

<p>Callie Guenther, senior manager of cyber threat research at Critical Start, warned that the shift to big players amplifies the impact of any system failure or vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One error, like CrowdStrike's on Friday, threatens society's smooth functioning worldwide, she said.</p>

<p><strong>No contingency plan&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Andrius Minkevicius, co-founder of Cyber Upgrade, a cybersecurity company, said that businesses must fight the complacency often associated with outsourcing technology to the big vendors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today, we're seeing an example of those who relied mostly on vendor-offered cyber protection without additional contingency plans and are now suffering reputational and financial damage," he said.</p>

<p>Experts warn that this incident will likely invite scrutiny from regulators and officials.</p>

<p>"CrowdStrike will probably have to let some outside people come in and examine how this happened," said Cyber Threat Alliance's Daniel.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Businesses and services around the world are slowly recovering after a massive IT outage affected computer systems worldwide on Friday. Experts, however, said full recovery from the huge crash would take "some time."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Airlines, banks, TV channels and financial institutions were thrown into turmoil for hours by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus program.</li>
	<li>The breakdown was caused by a malfunctioning software update fed to Microsoft Windows users by CrowdStrike, which specializes in cybersecurity for cloud-based companies.</li>
	<li>The outages affected companies or individuals that use CrowdStrike on the Microsoft Windows platform. When they applied the update, the incompatible software crashed computers into a frozen state known as the "Blue Screen of Death."</li>
	<li>In India, several airports issued handwritten boarding passes to passengers. Many IndiGo flights in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Hyderabad airports were cancelled and rescheduled.&nbsp;Airlines today said departures and arrivals were gradually resuming, but delays are expected even now.</li>
	<li>Media companies were also struggling, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its morning news broadcasts and Australia's ABC similarly reporting major difficulties.</li>
	<li>CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem and the firm's boss, George Kurtz said in a statement his teams were "fully mobilised" to help affected customers. Kurtz, however, said it could be "some time" before all systems are back up and running</li>
	<li>The global nature of the software failure prompted some commentators to question the reliance on a single provider for such a variety of services.</li>
	<li>Security experts said CrowdStrike's routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients' computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Microsoft said the underlying cause has been fixed and all impacted services have been restored.</li>
	<li>CrowdStrike - which previously reached a market cap of about $83 billion - is a major cybersecurity provider, with close to 30,000 subscribers globally.&nbsp;Over half of Fortune 500 companies and many government bodies such as the top US cybersecurity agency use the company's software.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden pledged to stay in the White House race Friday, defying a growing Democratic party revolt that raised speculation he could bow out as soon as this weekend.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden pledged to stay in the White House race Friday, defying a growing Democratic party revolt that raised speculation he could bow out as soon as this weekend.</p>

<p>"The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win," the 81-year-old said in a statement from the Delaware beach home where he is in Covid isolation.</p>

<p>"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week," Biden added, as his doctor said the president was bouncing back from the symptoms of the disease.</p>

<p>But Biden's political health appeared to be in far worse shape, with ten more House Democrats and two senators joining the list of lawmakers publicly calling on him to quit November's election clash with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>A disastrous debate performance against Trump three weeks ago triggered panic about Biden's age and health. More than 30 House Democrats and four senators have now called on him to drop out.</p>

<p>A key donor, Silicon Valley investor Michael Moritz, also joined other supporters such as actor George Clooney who want Biden to make way.</p>

<p>"Sadly, President Biden has a choice -- vanity or virtue," the New York Times quoted Moritz as saying.</p>

<p>With reports that top Democrats have also expressed concerns, polls showing Trump on course for a return to the Oval Office, and fundraising drying up, the walls appeared to be closing in.</p>

<p>NBC News reported that some of Biden's family had "discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like" although there was no final decision to do so.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner to succeed him as the Democratic presidential candidate if Biden does drop out, was holding an emergency call with donors on Friday.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign however pushed back against reports that he would bow out, saying that while there had been some "slippage" in support, he was still the best candidate.</p>

<p>"Absolutely the president's in this race," campaign chairwoman Jen O'Malley Dillon told MSNBC's Morning Joe program. "Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p><strong>'Dark vision'</strong></p>

<p>Biden's statement blasted his rival's speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, saying that "Donald Trump's dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans."</p>

<p>But the split-screen between the two campaigns has been stark, with Trump receiving a triumphant reception from newly unified Republicans after surviving an assassination attempt on Saturday.</p>

<p>The pressure on Biden has soared in the last 48 hours, with reports that former president Barack Obama, ex-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party's congressional leaders had all expressed concerns behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries was evasive on Friday, saying that the "ticket that exists right now is the ticket we can win on" but saying it was Biden's "decision to make."</p>

<p>The scene could now be set for the most crucial weekend of Biden's presidency, with media speculation that the US leader is using his time hunkered down in Rehoboth Beach to consult family members and mull over the path ahead.</p>

<p>The NBC report said it could involve a "carefully calculated plan" to step aside based on his own timing, to give some dignity to what would be a historically late decision by a sitting US president not to run.</p>

<p>Any decision by Biden to step aside less than four months from the election would also have to try to avoid chaos in the Democratic Party over his successor as nominee.</p>

<p>Biden beat Trump in 2020, becoming the oldest president in US history in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But a series of polls have shown him trailing Trump in the 2024 race despite his rival being a convicted felon, while some polls show Harris as more competitive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some external vendors that police content on Facebook owner Meta's platforms were affected by the global tech outage that crippled airports, banks and hospitals on Friday, a Meta spokesperson said in response to a Reuters query.</p>

<p>The social media giant experienced a SEV1 as a result of the disruptions, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, using Meta's term for a "code red"-style alert involving high-stakes problems with its systems that require urgent attention.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Meta spokesperson acknowledged the issues and said they had been resolved earlier in the day.</p>

<p>"The global CrowdStrike outage earlier today temporarily impacted several of the tools used by some of our vendors. While this caused a small impact to some of our support operations, there was minimal to no impact on our content moderation efforts," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Like most social media companies, Meta relies on a mix of artificial intelligence and human review to moderate the billions of posts made to its platforms, which also include Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.</p>

<p>Some of that human review is performed by Meta staffers, but most is outsourced to business services vendors employing armies of low-paid workers who assess whether the posts contain hate speech, violence and other violations of the company's rules.</p>

<p>Friday's alert involved vendor access to two of the systems Meta uses to route content flagged for review to moderators, called SRT and HumanOps, the source told Reuters.</p>

<p>Key vendors affected were Teleperformance and Concentrix, the person said.</p>

<p>Teleperformance did not respond to a request for comment and Concentrix said it had been monitoring and addressing impacts from the outage and that operations were continuing at expected levels.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From fearmongering about a looming "World War III" to false narratives linking a cabal of global elite to a cyberattack, a torrent of online conspiracy theories took off Friday after a major IT crash.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From fearmongering about a looming "World War III" to false narratives linking a cabal of global elite to a cyberattack, a torrent of online conspiracy theories took off Friday after a major IT crash.</p>

<p>Airlines, banks, TV channels and financial institutions were engulfed in turmoil after the crash, one of the biggest in recent years that was the result of a faulty software update to an antivirus program operating on Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>The proliferation of internet-breaking conspiracy theories on social media platforms -- many of which have removed guardrails that once contained the spread of misinformation -- illustrates the new normal of information chaos after a major world event.</p>

<p>The outage gave way to a swirl of evidence-free posts on X, the Elon Musk-owned site formerly known as Twitter, that peddled an apocalyptic narrative: The world was under attack by a nefarious force.</p>

<p>"I read somewhere once that ww3 (World War III) would be mostly a cyber war," one user wrote on X.</p>

<p>The IT crash also stirred up an unfounded theory that the World Economic Forum -- long a magnet for wild falsehoods -- had plotted a global cyberattack.</p>

<p>To make that theory appear credible, many posts linked an old WEF video that warned about the possibility of a "cyberattack with Covid-like characteristics."</p>

<p>The video, available on the WEF's website, had cautioned that the only way to stop the exponential spread of the cyber threat would be to disconnect millions of vulnerable devices from each other and the internet.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Sad testament' -</strong><br />
&nbsp;The WEF has long been a target for conspiracy theorists pushing the idea of a shadowy cabal of elites working for private gain under the garb of solving global issues.</p>

<p>Also gaining rapid traction online were conspiratorial posts using the hashtag "cyber polygon," a reference to a global training event aimed at preparing for potential future attacks.</p>

<p>"The proliferation of conspiracy theories in the wake of major global events such as the outage is a sad testament to the volatile nature of the information ecosystem," Rafi Mendelsohn, vice president at the disinformation security company Cyabra, told AFP.</p>

<p>"What is unique to events like these is how social media platforms, forums, and messaging apps facilitate the rapid dissemination of content, allowing theories to gain traction quickly and reach a global audience."</p>

<p>The trend demonstrates the ability of falsehoods to mutate into viral narratives on tech platforms, which have scaled back content moderation and reinstated accounts that are known purveyors of misinformation.</p>

<p>During fast-developing news events, confusion now often reigns on major tech platforms, with users scrambling to obtain accurate information in what appears to be a sea of false or misleading posts that rapidly gain traction.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Nefarious motives' -</strong></p>

<p>"This poses the larger question of combatting mis- and disinformation," Michael W. Mosser, executive director of the Global Disinformation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The level of trust that is required to accept information from reputable sources has declined to such an extent that people are more willing to believe wild conspiracies that 'must be true' rather than the factual information relayed to them."</p>

<p>The global outage, which brought myriad aspects of daily life to a standstill and sent US stocks falling, was linked to a bug in an update to an antivirus program for Windows systems from American cybersecurity group CrowdStrike.</p>

<p>Assurances by the Austin-based company's chief executive, George Kurtz, that CrowdStrike had rolled out a fix and was "actively working" to resolve the crisis did little to stem the spread of online conspiracies.</p>

<p>"Combatting this misinformation with factual rebuttals is difficult, because the issue is so technical," Mosser said.</p>

<p>"Explaining that the fault was in an improperly configured system file and that a fix is in process may be accurate, but it is not believed by those who are predisposed to see nefarious motives behind failures."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Friday he had spoken by telephone with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky, and pledged to end the European country's war with Russia.</p>

<p>"I appreciate President Zelensky for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>Zelensky confirmed the call, adding: "We agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting."</p>

<p>"I noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation's freedom and independence," he said in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>A Trump victory in the November US elections would put into question Washington's continued support for Ukraine, as the country struggles through a third year of fighting against Russian forces.</p>

<p>Trump, who on Thursday formally accepted the Republican Party's presidential nomination, has repeatedly claimed he would end the war very quickly, without offering details as to how.</p>

<p>Last week, the ex-president hosted at his Florida estate Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month.</p>

<p>Trump's frequent praise for Putin and reluctance to outright criticize the Russian invasion have stirred concerns among Ukraine's allies that he would force the country into accepting partial defeat.</p>

<p>He has also repeatedly suggested backing away from NATO. His running mate J.D. Vance leads the isolationist wing of congressional Republicans, who argue the United States should drop aid to Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Incumbent President Joe Biden is the best person to take on Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate in the November elections, his campaign said on Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Incumbent President Joe Biden is the best person to take on Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate in the November elections, his campaign said on Friday.</p>

<p>"The president's in this race. You've heard him say that time and time again," chair of the Biden-Harris Campaign, Jen O'Malley Dillon, told MSNBC in an interview, a day after Trump accepted his nomination to be the Republican presidential candidate for the November general elections.</p>

<p>Many Democrats at the highest levels want Trump to bow out of the 2024 election to make way for a new nominee and try to prevent widespread party losses in November.</p>

<p>Dillon insisted that Biden is committed to fighting against Trump.</p>

<p>"I think we saw on display last night exactly why. Because Donald Trump is not going to offer anything new to the American people. He's the same person he was in 2020. He's the same person he was at the debate stage. He's the same person he is — about himself and not about the American people. Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump," Dillon said.</p>

<p>"We believe in this campaign. We are built for the close election that we are in, and we see the path forward. The president is the leader of our campaign and of the country, and he is clearly in our impression, what we've built, and in our engagement with voters, he's the best person to take on Donald Trump and prosecute that case and present his vision versus what we saw last night," Dillon said.</p>

<p>"The president has the delegates. He has the support. He was elected in this process by 14 million voters. In 2020 by 81 million, more than anyone before him. The broad coalition of people that stand with the president is bigger and wider than the people who don't want him to run, and those are the people that are doing the work in the states that really matter, and I am confident when we get back to being able to go take the case to Donald Trump, we have the time to do it, and we can bring home the people that have some concerns or a little undecided today because when they see those two ahead and the visions they have for this country, there's no doubt in my mind that the American people are going to be with Joe Biden," Dillon said.</p>

<p>This is definitely a hard period for the campaign, Dillon said.</p>

<p>"But when the president has been out there talking to voters and being with voters when they have seen him, seen him lay out the contrast, shown that he is doing the job of leading this country and his [candidacy], they see in him the person that's going to win," Dillon said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air passengers around the United States faced delays, while some airlines halted flight operations as Microsoft-based computers ceased to work after a global outage on Friday.</p>

<p>Many airports across the US experienced unexpected disruption with over 1,100 flights getting cancelled and over 1,700 flights operating behind schedule on Friday morning (local time) after certain cloud services of Microsoft were disrupted.</p>

<p>These disruptions gave a hard time to people flying to and from different airports across the US, with many of them expressing their frustration over the unexpected delays and cancellations of flights.</p>

<p>"No one here knows anything, the gate agents said we all know as much as they do," a United Airlines passenger told ANI, saying his flight from Milwaukee to Washington was delayed for hours first at the gates and then hours on the tarmac.</p>

<p>Another passenger, Mack, said, "I am on my way home...I did not know that the internet was out. It is a global outage."</p>

<p>A passenger named Giane said, "I did not hear anything from the airline that I am travelling from. I just saw a news pop up on my phone...I am tired, I want to get home."</p>

<p>CrowdStrike -- an American cybersecurity technology firm that provides cloud workload protection, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services - said the outage, which sparked chaos for many, was not a 'cyberattack'. Instead, there was an issue with software and a fix had been deployed.</p>

<p>Several US carriers, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, issued ground stops for all their flights early on Friday due to communication problems, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p>

<p>The FAA told air traffic controllers to tell airborne pilots that airlines are currently experiencing communication issues. There were over 1,100 flights cancelled and more than 1,700 delays as of 8:05 am ET (Eastern Time), according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.</p>

<p>"A third-party software outage is impacting computer systems worldwide, including at United," United Airlines said in a statement on Friday morning. "While we work to restore those systems, we are holding all aircraft at their departure airports. Flights already airborne are continuing to their destinations."</p>

<p>"We're aware of a technical issue with CrowdStrike that is impacting multiple carriers. American is working with CrowdStrike to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and apologize to our customers for the inconvenience," American Airlines said in a statement.</p>

<p>The outage also affected industries ranging from banks to media companies.</p>

<p>"We're investigating an issue impacting users' ability to access various Microsoft 365 apps and services," Microsoft said in a statement released on social media Friday morning.</p>

<p>After various businesses across the world reported IT outages on Friday, which included seeing the 'Windows blue screen of death', CrowdStrike, the security firm linked to a software update that caused the outage said earlier in the day, that the issue has been isolated and a fix deployed.</p>

<p>George Kurtz, President and CEO of CrowdStrike, said the cybersecurity company was working with customers on the issues they faced while giving reassurance that the issue was "not a security incident or cyberattack."</p>

<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also reacted to the outage and said Microsoft is working closely with CrowdStrike to provide technical guidance and support to the customers.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally. We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online," Nadella posted on X.</p>

<p>On Friday the outage affected companies across various sectors, from airlines, banks, food chains and brokerage houses, to news organisations and railway networks. The travel industry was greatly affected, causing significant delays in flights across the world.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's elusive wife Melania made a rare appearance at the Republican National Convention in support of Donald Trump's third bid for the White House, but broke with decades of tradition by not speaking at the event.</p>

<p>Wearing Republican red, Melania, 54, walked, alone, into the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday accompanied by classical music.</p>

<p>She has kept a low profile during her husband's 2024 White House bid. She had not been spotted in Milwaukee since the convention kicked off on Monday.</p>

<p>Last week, Melania issued a statement calling for unity following an assassination attempt against Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realise this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again," she said in a statement.</p>

<p>It is traditional at party conventions for the candidates' spouses to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump's newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. But Melania skipped delivering a speech.</p>

<p>Ever since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.</p>

<p>In the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests.</p>

<p>And since her husband left office, she has not been seen by her husband's side on many occasions.</p>

<p>She wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.</p>

<p>The former first lady spoke in both 2020 and 2016 during Trump's presidential nomination. She was accused of borrowing from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech in her first appearance in 2016.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran is capable of producing fissile material for use in a nuclear weapon within "one or two weeks," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday.</p>

<p>News of Iran's capabilities follows the recent election of President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has said his goal is to "get Iran out of its isolation," and who favors reviving the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and global powers.</p>

<p>Blinken said that "what we've seen in the last weeks and months is an Iran that's actually moving forward" with its nuclear program.</p>

<p>The United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal, which was designed to regulate Iran's atomic activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.</p>

<p>Speaking at a security forum in Colorado, Blinken blamed the collapse of the nuclear deal for the acceleration in Iran's capabilities.</p>

<p>"Instead of being at least a year away from having the breakout capacity of producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon, (Iran) is now probably one or two weeks away from doing that," Blinken said.</p>

<p>He added that Iran had not yet developed a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri told CNN earlier this week that his country remained committed to the deal, known as the JCPOA.</p>

<p>"We are still a member of JCPOA. America has not yet been able to return to the JCPOA, so the goal we are pursuing is the revival of the 2015 agreement," he said. "We are not looking for a new agreement."</p>

<p>Bagheri added that: "Neither I nor anyone else in Iran has not talked and will not talk about a new agreement. We have an agreement (signed) in 2015."</p>

<p>Blinken made the statement just days after reports emerged that the US Secret Service increased security for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump weeks ago, after authorities learned of an alleged Iranian plot to kill him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's office on Friday announced the imposition of a nationwide curfew and the deployment of military forces to keep order after days of deadly student protests.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh on Friday announced the imposition of a curfew and the deployment of military forces after police failed to quell days of deadly unrest that has spread throughout the country.</p>

<p>This week's clashes between student demonstrators and police have killed at least 105 people, according to an AFP count of victims reported by hospitals, and pose a momentous challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office.</p>

<p>"The government has decided to impose a curfew and deploy the military in aid of the civilian authorities," Hasina's press secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan told AFP.</p>

<p>He added that the curfew would take immediate effect.</p>

<p>Police in the capital Dhaka earlier took the drastic step of banning all public gatherings for the day -- a first since protests began -- in an effort to forestall more violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We've banned all rallies, processions and public gatherings in Dhaka today," police chief Habibur Rahman told AFP, adding the move was necessary to ensure "public safety".</p>

<p>That however did not stop another round of confrontations between police and protesters around the sprawling megacity of 20 million people, despite an internet shutdown aimed at frustrating the organisation of rallies.</p>

<p>"Our protest will continue," Sarwar Tushar, who joined a march in the capital and sustained minor injuries when it was violently dispersed by police, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We want the immediate resignation of Sheikh Hasina. The government is responsible for the killings."</p>

<p>Student protesters stormed a jail in the central Bangladeshi district of Narsingdi and freed its inmates before setting the facility on fire, a police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"I don't know the number of inmates, but it would be in the hundreds," he added.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Shocking and unacceptable' -</strong></p>

<p>At least 52 people were killed in the capital on Friday, according to a list drawn up by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital and seen by AFP.</p>

<p>Police fire was the cause of more than half of the deaths reported so far this week, based on descriptions given to AFP by hospital staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UN human rights chief Volker Turk said the attacks on student protesters were "shocking and unacceptable".</p>

<p>"There must be impartial, prompt and exhaustive investigations into these attacks, and those responsible held to account," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The capital's police force earlier said protesters had on Thursday torched, vandalised and carried out "destructive activities" on numerous police and government offices.</p>

<p>Among them was the Dhaka headquarters of state broadcaster Bangladesh Television, which remains offline after hundreds of incensed students stormed the premises and set fire to a building.</p>

<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain told AFP that officers had arrested Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed, one of the top leaders of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- 'Symbol of a rigged system' -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Critics say the scheme benefits children of pro-government groups that back Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>Her administration this week ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police stepped up efforts to bring the deteriorating law and order situation under control.</p>

<p>"This is an eruption of the simmering discontent of a youth population built over years," Ali Riaz, a politics professor at Illinois State University, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The job quotas became the symbol of a system which is rigged and stacked against them by the regime."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Nation-scale' internet shutdown -</strong></p>

<p>Students say they are determined to press on with protests despite Hasina giving a national address earlier this week on the now-offline state broadcaster seeking to calm the unrest.</p>

<p>Nearly half of Bangladesh's 64 districts reported clashes on Thursday, broadcaster Independent Television reported.</p>

<p>London-based watchdog NetBlocks said Friday that a "nation-scale" internet shutdown remained in effect a day after it was imposed.</p>

<p>"Metrics show connectivity flatlining at 10% of ordinary levels, raising concerns over public safety as little news flows in or out of the country," it wrote on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla halted some production lines due to the global IT outage, Business Insider reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The automaker sent some production employees home early during the night shift at its Austin, Texas and Sparks, Nevada facilities, the report added.</p>

<p>The tech outage crippled industries from travel to finance before services started coming back online after hours of disruption due a content update by CrowdStrike for Microsoft Windows hosts.</p>

<p>"We just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems, so no rollouts at all," Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X, without specifying which of his companies had taken action or elaborating on the impact of the outage.</p>

<p>"This gave a seizure to the automotive supply chain," Musk said in a reply to a post by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the outage.</p>

<p>"Users are seeing a blue screen on their devices," the report said, citing an internal notice, adding that the automaker was impacted by a Windows host outage, which caused issues with servers, laptops, and manufacturing devices.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike said it was working with customers impacted by a defect found "in a single content update for Windows hosts."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg said that former President Donald Trump's immediate reaction after being shot was "badass" and inspiring, and helps explain his appeal to voters.</p>

<p>"Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life," the Meta Platforms Inc. chief executive officer said Thursday during an interview at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. "On some level as an American, it's like hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that's why a lot of people like the guy."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg, 40, declined to endorse Trump or his presumed opponent, President Joe Biden, adding that he's "not planning" to be involved in the election in any way. Still, his comments add to a growing chorus of Silicon Valley leaders, including Tesla Inc. billionaire Elon Musk and venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who are warming to the former president, some pledging donations to his campaign. Zuckerberg made the comments during a wide-ranging discussion about the future of AI, social media and more for The Circuit with Emily Chang. The full episode is set to air on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said Meta is making changes that he hopes will mean Facebook is not as much of a flashpoint in elections going forward. "The main thing that I hear from people is that they actually want to see less political content on our services because they come to our services to connect with people." Meta is already recommending less political content to its users, he added. "I think you're going to see our services play less of a role in this election than they have in the past."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg's relationship with Trump has been complicated by Trump's use of Meta's products to reach his followers. The former president's posts have routinely contained misinformation or challenged Meta's rules. The company suspended Trump from both Facebook and Instagram for two years in the wake of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riots. At the time, Zuckerberg posted that Trump was using his account to "undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor."</p>

<p>While the accounts have since been reinstated, Trump indicated he hasn't forgiven Meta or Zuckerberg, and recently suggested that he plans to retaliate. He called Facebook the "enemy of the people" in March. Earlier this month, Trump also appeared to warn Zuckerberg. "All I can say is that if I'm elected President, we will pursue Election Fraudsters at levels never seen before, and they will be sent to prison for long periods of time," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "We already know who you are. DON'T DO IT! ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!"</p>

<p>Trump has reversed policy positions in the name of punishing Meta. While he was president, Trump pushed for a ban of the Chinese-owned video app, TikTok. Trump has since changed his stance, arguing in Businessweek that a ban would be too beneficial to Meta's business.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said he welcomes competition. "It's good," he said on The Circuit. "I think we're doing pretty well here. We're gaining market share. So I don't know. They'll go do what they need to do but I think we're gonna be fine and we're gonna continue doing well in this space either way."</p>

<p>When asked if he thought TikTok should be banned, Zuckerberg demurred. "That's above my pay grade," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The general secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party Nguyen Phu Trong -- considered the country's top leader -- died on Friday aged 80, his party said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The general secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party Nguyen Phu Trong -- considered the country's top leader -- died on Friday aged 80, his party said.</p>

<p>In a statement, it said Trong, who had led the party since 2011, died "due to old age and serious illness" at a military hospital in Hanoi.</p>

<p>The announcement came a day after the party announced Trong would hand the reins of power to the country's president and former public security minister To Lam, long seen as jockeying for the top job.</p>

<p>At the time, the party said Trong would be focusing on treatment for an undisclosed medical condition, the first time it had referenced longstanding speculation about the ageing leader's health.</p>

<p>There were no further details about Trong's illness on Friday, and the party said it would later make "a special statement on the organisation of the funeral at the national level".</p>

<p>Trong is the first party general secretary to die in office since the death in 1986 of Le Duan, a brother-in-arms of Ho Chi Minh.</p>

<p>He is also the first leader to have held three consecutive mandates at the head of the party, after the liberalisation of the economy in 1986.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden called Trong a "champion of the deep ties" between the American and Vietnamese people, and said both countries were more secure because of the bilateral friendship fostered by the late leader.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Trong as a "true friend" of Russia.</p>

<p>China's communist party sent a message of condolences to its Vietnamese counterpart, Chinese state media said.</p>

<p>Vietnam's communist regime, which is in the midst of a complete overhaul, has undergone a series of upheavals in recent months, with ministers, business leaders and two presidents all falling from grace as part of a vast anti-corruption campaign.</p>

<p>On Thursday, when it was announced Trong was handing over his duties, the politburo called "on the entire party, people and army to have absolute trust in the party's leadership and state management".</p>

<p>Lam was voted in as president in May by Vietnam's rubber-stamp parliament after his predecessor was forced to resign as part of the anti-graft drive.</p>

<p>Analysts said at the time that Lam, who was deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption matters, had weaponised investigations to take down his political rivals.</p>

<p>- 'Astonishing efficiency' -</p>

<p>Trong's poor health had fuelled widespread speculation that he would not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress, which is expected to appoint a successor.</p>

<p>He enjoyed remarkable longevity in office, during a mandate that rights groups say has coincided with increasing authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Known for being a technocrat and on good terms with Beijing, he structured the party around himself, benefiting from a decade of economic growth that strengthened his legitimacy.</p>

<p>"He restructured and reorganised the party around him" through his anti-corruption drive, said Benoit de Treglode, research director at the Institute for Strategic Research at France's military academy in Paris.</p>

<p>"Since 2011, he has cleaned up with astonishing efficiency."</p>

<p>The anti-corruption drive, which analysts say is also linked to political infighting, has swept through the party, police, armed forces and business community.</p>

<p>More than 3,500 people have been indicted since 2021, official figures show, while those sent to prison include a former health minister and two previous mayors of Hanoi.</p>

<p>Following a scandal related to the Covid-19 pandemic last year, President Nguyen Xuan Phuc resigned and two deputy prime ministers were removed from their positions.</p>

<p>Many other prominent officials working across a wide range of sectors, from environment and energy to healthcare and banking, are under investigation.</p>

<p>But the campaign has had unintended consequences. With many fearful of being caught in its crosshairs, everyday transactions within the business sector and the state apparatus have slowed.</p>

<p>Trong would like to be remembered "as a populist, someone very close to the people, who listens to the people", said Linh Nguyen, lead analyst for Control Risks on Vietnam.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The families of hostages grabbed by Hamas gunmen on October 7 noisily agree they want the captives home but are split on how best to achieve it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The families of hostages grabbed by Hamas gunmen on October 7 noisily agree they want the captives home but are split on how best to achieve it.</p>

<p>"There is no unity among the families," said Dani Miran, whose 47-year-old son, Omri, was taken at gunpoint from the Nahal Oz kibbutz in Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>"There are people on the left, on the right, religious people, secular and Bedouins. We have to find common ground," added the father.</p>

<p>Some direct their frustrations toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of sacrificing the captives in pursuit of "total victory" over Hamas.</p>

<p>Others back the government's stance that only increased military force in Gaza will return the remaining captives.</p>

<p>For almost 300 days, the families have tried to set their differences aside to join the solemn rallies staged at least once a week in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"The common point between us is that we want the hostages back. But everyone fights in his own way and I don't know which is the right one," said Miran.</p>

<p>The 79-year-old has sworn not to cut his long white beard until his son is returned. He also speaks at the rallies where families have been pushing Netanyahu to reach a truce deal before he visits the United States next week.</p>

<p><strong>Agreement now</strong></p>

<p>On Wednesday night, hundreds of families and their supporters gathered for a last-ditch push before the Israeli leader's departure.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu, without a deal, there is no travelling," read one man's sign.</p>

<p>Another warned, "Time is running out".</p>

<p>Netanyahu will speak before the US Congress on July 24 and is also expected to meet with President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The visit comes after several months of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel, reinvigorating some families' hopes for a ceasefire agreement that would see hostages exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p>Omri Shtivi, whose brother Idan is a captive in Gaza, said pushing for the deal was not political so much as "moral".</p>

<p>"We demand the return of our loved ones, we don't want to dismantle the government," he said.</p>

<p>At a gathering nearby, fellow hostage relative Yifat Kalderon disagreed, calling on the government to step down.</p>

<p>"We demand an end to the war immediately and an agreement now. That's the only way to bring them home," said Kalderon, whose French-Israeli cousin Ofer Kalderon was taken from the Nir Oz kibbutz.</p>

<p>"No heroic operation will bring them all back. In nine months, military operations have only saved seven people."</p>

<p>More than 100 hostages were freed during a week-long truce in November, leading many families to believe better odds lie with another deal.</p>

<p>During the October 7 attacks that sparked the war, Palestine's Hamas group seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>The surprise Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza</p>

<p><strong>'Until victory'</strong></p>

<p>Yaron Or, the father of hostage Avinatan, represents a minority camp that sees a ceasefire agreement as jeopardising Israel's future by putting it at risk of another attack.</p>

<p>"Fight until victory and bring back Avinatan," read his sign at Wednesday night's rally.</p>

<p>Avinatan was kidnapped from the Nova music festival with his girlfriend Noa Argamani, who was among four hostages rescued in June during an Israeli military raid.</p>

<p>"Only if the army takes control of the whole Gaza Strip and the inhabitants understand that Hamas is defeated will they free the hostages," said Or, who is part of a group of families who reject negotiations with Hamas.</p>

<p>Despite their divergent approaches, the hostage families are still coming together to push their shared goal: bring them home.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, central Tel Aviv was again filled with their shouts.</p>

<p>"Achshav," they chanted, "now".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York City council member has been accused of biting a New York Police Department (NYPD) officer during a protest in Brooklyn. According to the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/17/us-news/irate-nyc-councilwoman-busted-in-scream-filled-clash-with-cops-at-homeless-shelter-protest/"> <em>New York Post</em></a>, Susan Zhuang was protesting the construction of a new homeless shelter at the corner of 25th Avenue and 86th Street in Bensonhurst on Wednesday. In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1813915101914644833">viral video of the incident,</a> New York City Councilwoman Ms Zhuang is allegedly seen biting Officer Frank DiGiacomo, the NYPD Chief of Patrol, when he tried to pull her away from the barriers.</p>

<p>Mr DiGiacomo's arm was left with teeth marks and broken skin, as evidenced <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/yuhline/status/1813770911268339996">by a photo</a> and detailed in the criminal complaint. He was treated with an "anti-viral cocktail" and given a tetanus shot.</p>

<p data-v-3808eee7="">"We are disappointed, disappointed in councilmember&nbsp;Susan Zhuang like she is a great partner, but we will not tolerate it. This is what she did to the officer. Bit the officer on the arm, as you can see the bite wound," NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations, Kaz Daughtry said.</p>

<p data-v-3808eee7="">Meanwhile, the councilwoman said she supports the NYPD but that there should be no double standard for conduct.&nbsp;She claimed she was protecting an elderly woman while protesting the homeless shelter. Ms&nbsp;Zhuang further said she informed the police that a woman was trapped under the barricade and needed assistance, but the officers did not respond to her request.</p>

<p>"Mistreatment by our NYPD, who I always support, must be stopped, AAPI hate and Asian hate in any form must end. I was approached from behind, two police officers handcuffed me, one police officer pulled my hair, and another officer grabbed my neck...the issue is not unique to me, as many members of the Asian community have been subject to this excessive enforcement and mistreatment by our NYPD'', she told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-councilwoman-susan-zhuang-accused-biting-officer-speaks/15068420/">ABC7NY.</a></em></p>

<p>She has been charged with felony assault, obstruction of governmental administration and resisting arrest.&nbsp;She was released following an arraignment Wednesday evening and is scheduled to appear in court on October 15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A council source told The Post that Zhuang's behaviour is "disqualifying for a council member."</p>

<p>"Violence is never acceptable and it is always important to respect city workers doing their jobs. We have seen the public footage circulating of today's incident and will be seeking to learn more about the details.

<p>X CEO and Tesla Founder Elon Musk was quick to take a swipe at Mr Nadella's update and said, "This gave a seizure to the automotive supply chain."</p>

<p>Mr Musk has been posting memes and reacting to posts on X on the global outage. He reposted his 2021 post on X in which he said, "Macrohard &gt; Microsoft".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CrowdStrike On Outage</strong></p>

<p>In a statement on X, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said that the company is working with customers who have been impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts, adding that Mac- and Linux-based systems have not been affected.</p>

<p>Emphasising that the outage is not a security incident or cyberattack, he wrote, &nbsp;"The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website."</p>

<p>"We further recommend organizations ensure they're communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers," he added.</p>

<p>Speaking to the 'Today' programme on NBC News later, Mr Kurtz said his company would make sure every customer is "fully recovered".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are deeply sorry for the impact that we have caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this, including our company," he was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Outages In India</strong></p>

<p>In India, almost all air carriers -- Vistara, IndiGo, SpiceJet and Akasa Air -- faced technical issues that affected booking, check-in, and flight updates. The airlines were checking in passengers manually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu said the ministry and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are actively managing the situation using manual methods to ensure minimal disruption. "Passengers are advised to cooperate with airport staff during this period of disruption. We have instructed all airlines and airport authorities to keep passengers informed about their flight status and provide necessary assistance," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

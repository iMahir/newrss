       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said Monday that it had struck "several terrorists" in central Gaza who were allegedly using a school in the Nuseirat area as "cover".</p>

<p>"A short while ago, based on intelligence and using precise munition, the IAF struck several terrorists who were conducting terrorist activities, using the structures of a school in the area of Nuseirat as cover," the army said in a statement, referring to the Israeli Air Force.</p>

<p>A source at the Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat told AFP that it had received several wounded people for treatment after an attack against a school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.</p>

<p>Israel's army said Hamas and Islamic Jihad "systematically violate international law, exploiting civilian structures and population as human shields for terror attacks against the State of Israel".</p>

<p>On Saturday the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said 16 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school housing displaced people in Nuseirat.</p>

<p>At the time, the army said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school in Nuseirat, which is run by UNRWA.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza entered its 10th month on Sunday.</p>

<p>The conflict erupted with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,193 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;US President Joe Biden has vowed he will be "running this race to end "of the November election, despite private calls from Democrats to drop out.</p>

<p>Biden stood firm and told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday that he would continue his election bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness.</p>

<p>Biden said that he wouldn't be running again, "if I did not absolutely believe that I could beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>"I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump," he added.</p>

<p>Further, he also stated, "We have 42 days to the Democratic convention and 119 days to the general election," Biden said in the letter distributed by his reelection campaign</p>

<p>In the letter, Biden calls for unity among his party, emphasising the need for a collective effort to defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>"Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It's time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump," said Biden.<br />
The letter comes after a group call with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, in which four congressmen were explicit in urging Biden to step aside some deep-pocketed donors have also reportedly expressed discomfort, with Hollywood's Rob Reiner, who regularly donates to Democratic candidates, saying he thinks Biden should step aside "we lose our democracy if Trump wins."</p>

<p>At the same time, some of the president's biggest supporters are re-doubling the fight for Biden's presidency, insisting there is no better way to beat Trump in what many see as among the most important elections of a lifetime.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a leadership call was organised by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, where several top House Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Biden also will host an event on Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the NATO summit, which is taking place this week in Washington, national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>Biden plans to "underscore the importance of continuing to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom" in his meeting with Starmer, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.</p>

<p>She said the two leaders would have the opportunity to discuss U.S.-UK cooperation across a range of issues from Ukraine to the Israel-Gaza war, and ensuring that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons, as well as confronting Iranian-backed Houthi threats to commercial shipping.</p>

<p>The leaders also will discuss furthering cooperation in areas such as protecting advanced technologies and developing climate and clean energy solutions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is not being treated for Parkinson's disease, the White House said on Monday, after reports surfaced that a doctor specializing in the malady had visited the White House eight times over the past year.</p>

<p>Concerns that the president might be suffering from an undisclosed illness have risen since Biden's stumbled in his June 27 debate with Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The New York Times said White House visitor logs show that Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders and recently published a paper on Parkinson's, visited the White House eight times from last summer through the spring of this year.</p>

<p>During an acrimonious briefing, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to confirm Cannard's visit, saying she wanted to respect the privacy of all involved for security reasons.</p>

<p>She said Biden had seen a neurologist three times connected to Biden's annual physical exams.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's president-elect Masoud Pezeshkian on Monday reaffirmed the Islamic republic's support for Lebanon's Hezbollah group and condemned Israel's actions against Palestinians.</p>

<p>The statement, issued to Hezbollah's chief Hassan Nasrallah on the IRNA official news agency, was one of the first foreign policy comments from Pezeshkian since his victory in Friday's presidential election runoff.</p>

<p>Tehran provides financial and military support to Hezbollah, which was created at the initiative of Iran's Revolutionary Guards after arch-foe Israel overran Beirut in 1982 during Lebanon's civil war.</p>

<p>In a reference to Hezbollah and allied groups, Pezeshkian said: "The support of the resistance is rooted in the fundamental policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran."</p>

<p>He said he was confident the "resistance movement" would stop its arch-foe Israel's "warmongering and criminal policies" in Gaza, where Israel has for nine months been at war with Hezbollah's Palestinian ally, Hamas.</p>

<p>Since the war in Gaza began, Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged near-daily fire over Lebanon's border, triggering global alarm about the potential for all-out war as fighting escalates.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said Tehran "will not hesitate to support the Lebanese nation" and Israel "must be aware of the consequences of any adventurous action in the region, especially towards Lebanon."</p>

<p>Reformist Pezeshkian defeated ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, in the election which was brought forward after the death of president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.</p>

<p>After the vote, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the election result was a "clear message of demand for change and opposition" from the Iranian people.</p>

<p>On Saturday Nasrallah congratulated Pezeshkian on his election victory and emphasised Tehran's role as a "strong" supporter of regional "resistance" groups.</p>

<p>The Shiite Muslim movement is a key part of the Axis of Resistance -- an alliance of pro-Iran armed movements that oppose Israel and the United States.</p>

<p>The alliance also includes Yemen's Huthi rebels and fighters in Iraq, as well as Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States called Monday on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to emphasize Ukraine's territorial integrity as he met in Russia with President Vladimir Putin on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington.</p>

<p>"We would urge India, as we do any country which engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN Charter with respect to Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>"India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in a full and frank dialogue, and that includes on our concerns about the relationship with Russia," he said.</p>

<p>Miller said, however, that he was unaware of specific conversations with India about PM Modi's visit to Russia.</p>

<p>The United States has built strong relations with India, seeing it as a powerful partner in the face of the rise of China, with President Joe Biden inviting PM Modi for a state visit a year ago.</p>

<p>India has a longstanding relationship with Moscow dating to the Cold War and has refused to join Western sanctions over the Ukraine war, instead turning to Russia for discounted energy imports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month was the hottest June on record, the EU's climate change monitoring service said on Monday, continuing a streak of exceptional temperatures that some scientists said puts 2024 on track to be the world's hottest recorded year.</p>

<p>Every month since June 2023 - 13 months in a row - has ranked as the planet's hottest since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin.</p>

<p>The latest data suggest 2024 could outrank 2023 as the hottest year since records began after human-caused climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon both pushed temperatures to record highs in the year so far, some scientists said.</p>

<p>"I now estimate that there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s," said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at U.S. non-profit Berkeley Earth.</p>

<p>The changed climate has already unleashed disastrous consequences around the world in 2024.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 people died in fierce heat during the haj pilgrimage last month. Heat deaths were recorded in New Dehli, which endured an unprecedentedly long heatwave, and amongst tourists in Greece.</p>

<p>Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute, said there was a "high chance" 2024 would rank as the hottest year on record.</p>

<p>"El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon that will always come and go. We can't stop El Nino, but we can stop burning oil, gas, and coal," she said.</p>

<p>The natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, tends to raise global average temperatures.</p>

<p>That effect subsided in recent months, with the world now in neutral conditions before cooler La Nina conditions are expected to form later this year.</p>

<p>C3S' dataset goes back to 1940, which the scientists cross-checked with other data to confirm that last month was the hottest June since the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.</p>

<p>Despite promises to curb global warming, countries have so far failed collectively to reduce these emissions, pushing temperatures steadily higher for decades.</p>

<p>In the 12 months ending in June, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for any such period, at 1.64 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average, C3S said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tropical Storm Beryl's howling winds and torrential rain killed at least two people, closed oil ports, grounded hundreds of flights and knocked out power to more than 2 million homes and businesses in southeast Texas on Monday.</p>

<p>Beryl, the season's earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, weakened from a hurricane after pounding the coastal Texas town of Matagorda with dangerous storm surges and heavy rain before moving across Houston, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.</p>

<p>The storm, which was expected to rapidly weaken as it moved inland, swept a destructive path through Jamaica, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines last week. It has killed at least 12 people in the Caribbean and Texas.</p>

<p>In Texas, a 53-year-old man and a 74-year-old woman were killed in two incidents by trees that fell on their homes in the Houston area on Monday, according to Harris County officials.</p>

<p>The state's energy industry, the nation's biggest producer of US oil and natural gas, braced for Beryl's impact as the powerful storm slowed refining activity and prompted the evacuation of some production sites.</p>

<p>"Life-threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall is ongoing across portions of Texas. Damaging winds ongoing along the coast, with strong winds moving inland," the NHC said even as Beryl began to lose strength.</p>

<p>Following warnings that it could be a deadly storm for communities in its path, residents had rushed to board up windows and stock up on fuel and other essential supplies.</p>

<p>Before daybreak, strong gusts and torrential rain lashed cities and towns such as Galveston, Sargent, Lake Jackson and Freeport, television footage showed. By late morning, many fallen trees blocked roads in Houston as the worst of the storm passed, with persisting winds and some road flooding, rendering lanes on major freeways impassable. The city barricaded flooded areas.</p>

<p>In video posted on social media by Houston's local ABC station, crews using a life jacket and ladder fire truck rescued a man from a truck on a flooded stretch of freeway.</p>

<p>In a late morning press conference, Houston Mayor John Whitmire urged people to shelter in place. He noted that flood waters exceeded 10 inches (25 cm) across most of the city.</p>

<p>"We're literally getting calls across Houston right now asking for first responders to come rescue individuals in desperate life safety conditions," Whitmire said.</p>

<p>The storm had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it crossed the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall. But the NHC said it was now expected to weaken rapidly as it moves across land, as hurricanes typically do, before becoming a tropical depression on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Beryl was expected to barrel over eastern parts of the state through the day before moving into the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday, the NHC said.</p>

<p>"People in the path of Beryl's track should not let their guard down this week," Accuweather said in a statement, warning of possible tornadoes as far away as Ohio and possible flash flooding as far north as Detroit.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden is being regularly updated about the storm while administration officials remain in close contact with state and local counterparts, a White House official said.</p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the US Coast Guard had prepositioned staff to assist with search and rescue efforts, with FEMA also readied with water, meals and generators to boost local response efforts, according to the Biden administration.</p>

<p>Schools said they would close as the storm approached. Airlines canceled more than 1,300 flights, and officials ordered a smattering of evacuations in beach towns. Small businesses in Houston, including package delivery services and chiropractors, delayed openings or were closed on Monday.</p>

<p>More than 2 million homes and businesses in Texas have lost power, according to local utilities and PowerOutage.us data.</p>

<p>Several counties in southeastern Texas - including Houston, where many US energy companies are headquartered - are under a flash-flood warning as thunderstorms unleashed up to nearly 12 inches (30 cm) of rain in some areas.</p>

<p>Resident Gary Short said he was most concerned about possible flooding, which the NHC warned was expected across parts of Texas into Monday night.</p>

<p>"I'm more worried about the rain than anything," he said as he filled up cans with gasoline at a service station on Sunday. "Other than that, not too concerned. Just getting ready."</p>

<p>Closures of major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston and Houston ahead of the storm could disrupt crude oil exports, along with shipments of crude to refineries and motor fuel from the plants.</p>

<p>Some oil producers, including Shell and Chevron, evacuated personnel from their Gulf of Mexico offshore production platforms ahead of the storm.</p>

<p>Marathon Petroleum Corp's refinery in Texas City, Texas was hit by a power interruption on Monday amid the storm, the company said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US aviation regulators said Monday that more than 2,600 Boeing 737 airplanes would need to be inspected, due to concerns that passenger oxygen masks could fail in emergencies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing confirmed on Monday that it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, with court documents showing the planemaker set to plead guilty to fraud.</p>

<p>The agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.</p>

<p>"We have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department," Boeing said in a statement.</p>

<p>Families of crash victims immediately filed an objection to the deal, arguing that it "unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive."</p>

<p>Catherine Berthet, who lost her daughter Camille in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash -- involving a 737 MAX 8 -- said the deal reflects "weakness and manifest contempt for the victims' families and public interest."</p>

<p>Court papers filed in Texas on Sunday said the company had agreed to plead guilty to "conspiracy to defraud the United States" during the certification of MAX airplanes.</p>

<p>The plea deal would see Boeing avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to a series of terms that includes a fresh $243.6 million fine.</p>

<p>The company will also be required to make a minimum investment of $455 million in "compliance and safety programs."</p>

<p>Such changes at the firm will be overseen by an independent monitor appointed by the government for a three-year term.</p>

<p>The company's board of directors will also be required to meet the families of crash victims.</p>

<p>The high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.</p>

<p><strong>- Families reject 'generous' deal -</strong></p>

<p>The families of victims will ask the court to reject the plea deal at an upcoming hearing.</p>

<p>"The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises," said the objection filed by their legal team Sunday.</p>

<p>In a statement shared by her lawyers, Berthet added that the agreement shows the DOJ's "deafness" despite an alarming rise in incidents.</p>

<p>The original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded US aviation regulators.</p>

<p>That agreement required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.</p>

<p>But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.</p>

<p>The incident launched a new wave of scrutiny into Boeing's manufacturing and safety practices, with formal probes initiated by US regulators and Congress.</p>

<p>In a May 14 letter to the court overseeing the MAX case, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."</p>

<p>The conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it had not violated the 2021 agreement.</p>

<p>DOJ representatives briefed families in late June on the proposed plea deal and the company was given until July 5 to accept the offer, or face a possibly damaging trial.</p>

<p>Boeing was meanwhile met with fresh negative news on Monday, with the US Federal Aviation Administration announcing that over 2,600 737 jets would need inspections, amid concerns that passenger oxygen masks could fail in emergencies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwanese semiconductor titan TSMC briefly joined a rarefied club of companies valued at more than $1 trillion on Monday.</p>

<p>Here are five things to know about the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company:</p>

<p><strong>'Godfather'</strong></p>

<p>MIT and Stanford graduate Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987 after an extensive tech industry career in the United States.</p>

<p>Taiwan's government was trying to set up a semiconductor industry that would compete with the countries, such as Japan, that led the sector at the time.</p>

<p>TSMC has become one of the world's most important companies in the nearly four decades since -- a leader in producing the chips that help run everything from smartphones to advanced robots.</p>

<p>Chang, who was born in mainland China in 1931, retired from TSMC in 2018. He was revered in Taiwan by then and often described as the "godfather" of the island's chip industry.</p>

<p>Taiwan awarded him one of its highest medals of honour in April.</p>

<p><strong>AI boom</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence sparked by the success of ChatGPT, TSMC has been riding a massive wave of demand for the advanced semiconductors needed to train and run AI apps.</p>

<p>It works closely with AI leader Nvidia, which became the world's most valuable traded company in June with a market capitalisation of around $3.3 trillion.</p>

<p>TSMC also supplies Nvidia competitors Qualcomm and AMD, among others, and such is the demand for its chips that production has been reportedly booked for years in advance.</p>

<p>Arguably its best-known client is Apple, which relies on TSMC chips for the latest iPhones and MacBooks.</p>

<p>"We have established a research pipeline for technology to enable leading-edge AI devices, circuits, and systems for decades to come," TSMC says on its website.</p>

<p><strong>Fears about China</strong></p>

<p>Taiwan is one of the most important links in the supply chain for semiconductors, the lifeblood of the modern global economy, and TSMC is its crown jewel.</p>

<p>However, China claims the self-ruled island as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei in recent years, including with large-scale military drills, sparking worries in capitals and boardrooms around the world about its chip industry.</p>

<p>US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told a Congressional hearing in May that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and seizure of TSMC would be "absolutely devastating".</p>

<p>"Right now, the United States buys 92 percent of its leading-edge chips from TSMC in Taiwan," she said.</p>

<p><strong>US, Japan expansion</strong></p>

<p>TSMC has faced pressure to diversify away from Taiwan, where the bulk of its factories are based, to guard against any further escalation of the tussle between Washington and Beijing.</p>

<p>It is building two "fabs" -- manufacturing plants -- in the United States and announced plans for a third in April, bringing its total investment in the state of Arizona to $65 billion.</p>

<p>But its US projects have faced obstacles in the past year, which the company attributed to a lack of human resources because making chips requires highly specialised skills.</p>

<p>TSMC also launched an $8.6 billion plant in Japan this year -- a coup for the country as it vies with the United States and Europe to woo top chip firms with huge subsidies.</p>

<p>With "strong" Japanese government support, TSMC has announced a second factory to make more advanced chips. The firm is also planning a new factory in Germany -- its first in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Quake threat</strong></p>

<p>Geopolitics is not the only worry for TSMC and Taiwan's chip industry.</p>

<p>The island is prone to natural disasters, too.</p>

<p>It sits on the "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity along the Pacific Rim, and -- much like neighbouring Japan -- has a long history of catastrophic quakes.</p>

<p>TSMC was one of the firms that halted production because of a 7.4-magnitude earthquake in April this year, the most severe to hit Taiwan in decades.</p>

<p>It told customers the impact from the quake was minimal.</p>

<p>TSMC has invested in a number of seismic resistance features at its facilities to reduce damage and casualties, including an earthquake early warning system, according to its website.<br />

<p>It is an occasion for the two leaders to cherish &amp; celebrate India-Russia friendship, it said.</p>

<p>In his first trip since the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Prime Minister Modi on Monday travelled to Russia to hold summit talks with President Putin on Tuesday -- a visit that is being seen as having a wider geopolitical context and signalling.</p>

<p>Shortly after landing in Moscow, PM Modi said he is looking forward to deepening bilateral partnership in futuristic areas and that stronger ties between India and Russia will "greatly benefit our people".</p>

<p>India seeks to play a "supportive role" for a peaceful and stable region, the prime minister said in his departure statement.</p>

<p>PM Modi was received at the Vnukovo-II airport by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov. The Russian first deputy minister also accompanied the Indian prime minister to his hotel from the airport, officials said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Rawalpindi court on Monday rejected Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former Prime Minister Imran Khan's plea for a weekly WhatsApp call with his sons, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>Notably, Imran Khan had filed a petition and sought permission to have a conversation with his sons via WhatsApp once a week.</p>

<p>However, the jail administration asserted that there is no legal provision that allow prisoners to communicate with their relatives through WhatsApp. The court had earlier said that Imran be allowed to talk with his children twice a month, who currently reside in the UK with their mother Jemima Khan, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>Earlier, the former Pakistan Prime Minister had submitted an application to Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) after he was denied a telephonic conversation with his sons from Adiala Jail. In the petition, the PTI founder had argued that he has been denied to speak with his sons despite being allowed to do so by law.</p>

<p>The ATC, presided over by Judge Malik Aijaz Asif, had sought a response from the jail administration, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court, a day earlier, reserved its decision on Imran Khan's interim bail requests in cases associated with the May 9 incidents in 2023, including the Jinnah House and two other cases, Pakistan-based The Express Tribune reported.</p>

<p>During the hearing on Saturday, Imran lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, argued that the PTI founder was being targeted for political reasons.</p>

<p>"In my entire career, I have never seen so many cases against a single individual. Those who were actually inciting against institutions at the scene were not arrested," Safdar alleged."How could a case be filed against him when he was in custody at the time of the crime?" PTI chief's lawyer questioned.</p>

<p>In response, the government's lawyer argued that according to a special branch report, Imran Khan had asked his followers to target civil and military installations if he got arrested.The prosecutor said, "The directive to attack military installations across Pakistan resulted in the events that transpired." After hearing arguments from both sides, the court reserved its verdict on the PTI founder's interim bail requests, The Express Tribune reported.</p>

<p>On May 9 last year, violent clashes broke out across Pakistan after former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested. The protests were held in remote and major cities as the party workers were agitated due to Mr Khan's arrest, with Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad summoning the armed forces to ensure law and order, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>Army installations, including the Corps Commander's house in Lahore, had come under attack during the protests by PTI workers. Notably, the PTI founder was named as the main accused in all the May 9 riots cases.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France was plunged into political turmoil on Monday three weeks before hosting the Olympics, while a call for strikes at Paris airports added fresh uncertainty to the already tense build up.</p>

<p>The run-up to the world's biggest sporting event is usually fraught for host nations, but French President Emmanuel Macron added unexpected complexity last month by calling snap parliamentary elections.</p>

<p>A second round of voting for the National Assembly on Sunday delivered a hung parliament, making it hard to know who will be in key government positions when the Games open on July 26.</p>

<p>"Our country is facing an unprecedented political situation and is getting ready to host the world in a few weeks," Prime Minister Gabriel Attal stressed on Sunday evening as he offered his resignation.</p>

<p>Macron has asked the ambitious 35-year-old to remain at his post "for the time being to ensure the stability of the country", a statement from the presidency said.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the head of state will seek to keep a caretaker government in place until the Paris Games close on August 11, but a left-wing alliance that topped Sunday's vote is already pushing to name a candidate to replace Attal.</p>

<p>The fate of Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who has overseen security preparations for the Games, is also in the balance.</p>

<p>"What organisers worry about the most are things like delinquency and crime, and of course terrorism, as well as traffic conditions," Paul Dietschy, a history and sports professor at the Universite of Franche-Comte in France, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The interior minister is the most important position."</p>

<p>Darmanin said last week that if the far-right National Rally or hard-left France Unbowed party formed a government, then he would resign immediately.</p>

<p>"The Olympic Games have been very well-prepared. Everyone knows it and everyone welcomes it," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>Disruption threat</strong></p>

<p>Elsewhere on Monday, unions representing workers at ADP, which runs the capital's two main airports, said they had called for a strike next week to demand Olympics bonuses for all staff and a "massive" recruitment plan.</p>

<p>Paris's airports will be the main gateway into France for foreign visitors to the Olympics, with up to 350,000 people expected to transit there daily, as well as most athletes and their equipment.</p>

<p>The strike on July 17 will occur just before athletes are set to arrive to take up residence in the newly built Olympic village in northern Paris.</p>

<p>ADP has built new temporary over-sized baggage terminal at Charles de Gaulle airport to handle specialised sports equipment such as kayaks and bikes.</p>

<p>Ahead of the 1998 football World Cup in France, the last time the country hosted such a major sporting event, pilots at national carrier Air France went on strike on the eve of kick-off along with taxi drivers and other transport workers.</p>

<p>Police, air traffic controllers, rubbish collectors, central government employees, metro and train drivers as well as firefighters have all made pay demands ahead of the Olympics, seeking to use the leverage.</p>

<p>Chief Olympics organiser Tony Estanguet has called for a "truce" between unions and employers during the competition.</p>

<p>"I want us to welcome the world in the best possible conditions and we don't want to spoil the party," he told French television in February.</p>

<p><strong>Excitement?</strong></p>

<p>Estanguet and the International Olympic Committee were both blindsided by Macron's election gamble so close to the start of the Paris Games -- as were most government ministers and voters.</p>

<p>The prospect of the far-right taking power was seen by many observers as a risk that would undermine France's image -- and the themes of diversity and openness stressed by Paris 2024.</p>

<p>Estanguet "must be feeling very happy since last night," said David Roizen, an Olympics specialist at the left-leaning Jean-Jaures Foundation think-tank in Paris.</p>

<p>Paris 2024 figures have also sought to stress that senior civil servants with responsiblity for Games-related issues like security and transport will remain in place even if the cabinet changes.</p>

<p>The Games can count on "the continuity of the state", the Paris organising committee told AFP, adding they had worked "night and day in previous weeks to be ready."</p>

<p>In France, the election has entirely overshadowed the build-up to the sporting extravaganza, with the local media paying more attention to the political manoeuvrings than the new sports facilities nearing completion around the capital.</p>

<p>"If Macron hadn't dissolved the parliament, then there would be a bit more passion for the Games," Dietschy said. "You don't really feel excitement building. Most French people have been focused on the election."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden urged Democratic lawmakers Monday to either back his reelection campaign or challenge him at the party convention next month as the US president's reelection bid entered a critical week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden urged Democratic lawmakers Monday to either back his reelection campaign or challenge him at the party convention next month as the US president's reelection bid entered a critical week.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old doubled down on his defiance of calls to step aside, after a disastrous debate against Republican rival Donald Trump last month turbocharged fears that he is too old to serve a second term.</p>

<p>Biden will be under extra scrutiny this week as he hosts a summit of NATO leaders in Washington, with many allies seeking reassurance amid polls forecasting that the isolationist Trump will win in November.</p>

<p>Biden called in to MSNBC's "Morning Joe" television program to say that he was "confident" the "average voter out there still wanted Joe Biden."</p>

<p>Sounding angry in the telephone interview, Biden said he was "getting so frustrated by the elites... in the party."</p>

<p>"Any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. announce for president, challenge me at the convention," he added.</p>

<p>In a blitz of action to start the week, Biden also penned a lengthy letter to Democratic Party lawmakers that saying "I decline" to stand down.</p>

<p>"I am firmly committed to staying in the race," Biden wrote.</p>

<p>"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end."</p>

<p><strong>NATO summit</strong></p>

<p>Biden must overcome concerns sparked by the debate, during which repeatedly lost his train of thought, mangled his syntax and spoke with a raspy voice.</p>

<p>He has blamed jetlag and a cold.</p>

<p>But on Sunday four senior congressmen said on a call with party lawmakers that it was time for Biden to bow out, according to US media.</p>

<p>Democrats this week return from a brief recess to Capitol Hill under pressure to either fall in line behind the president or urge him to step aside.</p>

<p>Tuesday, when the NATO summit begins, could prove a turning point: party lawmakers are expected to hold their regular caucus meeting, which could coalesce any bid to force him out.</p>

<p>Biden's performance at the summit marking the 75th anniversary of the NATO alliance will also be closely watched. He is due to attend several meetings and give his first press conference since the debate debacle.</p>

<p>Many European countries are fearful of a return of Trump, as the 78-year-old has long criticized the defense alliance, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>Busy schedule</strong></p>

<p>After a barnstorming day of campaign events in swing state Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden has no public events scheduled for Monday, which he is expected to spend preparing for the summit.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden, a fierce defender of the president, is scheduled to campaign for him instead in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.</p>

<p>On Friday the president picks up the campaign trail once more, heading for the battleground state of Michigan, before going to his beachside home in Rehoboth, Delaware.</p>

<p>With election day just four months away and the party convention in mid-August, the clock is ticking on any move to replace Biden as the nominee.</p>

<p>Biden and his team appear determined to dig in for the siege, with the campaign unveiling an intense schedule for later in July, including an avalanche of TV spots and trips to key states.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams is safe and continues helping with research and maintenance of the International Space Station, said American space agency NASA after her return to Earth was delayed, which sparked fears about the safety of the crew that flew on board the Boeing Starliner spacecraft to the space station on June 5. She will discuss the crew's mission in a live address from the space station on July 10 at 8.30 pm.</p>

<p>Ms Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore have already spent over a month in the space station on a trip that was originally supposed to be 10 days long due to a series of technical glitches in the Boeing Starliner.</p>

<p>Currently, the ISS is hosting nine crew members who are continuing their planned activities, said NASA. Ms Williams, in the last four weeks on the ISS, has helped disassemble and empty racks for future missions and also assessed air flow in the filters. Her crewmate, Mr Wilmore, joined another NASA astronaut Tracy Dyson on July 2 to load trash and discarded gear inside the Cygnus spacecraft, said NASA. Cygnus, built by Northrop Grumman, is scheduled to be released from the ISS's Unity module later this month for disposal over the South Pacific Ocean, ending its five-and-a-half-month stay at the orbiting lab. On the same day, the crew also checked up on the quiescent Boeing Starliner awaiting its return to Earth.</p>

<p>The crew's work on the ISS, which is like a mini city the size of a football field in space, is of immense significance. The space station, which weighs 419 tonnes and costs over $150 Billion, has been hosting astronauts since 2000. The crew there experiences 16 sunrises daily in its orbit, making the upkeep of the space station a crucial and challenging task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riding atop the Boeing Starliner on its first crewed mission, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore reached the ISS on June 6. She was supposed to return on June 14, however, the return trip was delayed till June 26 due to some technical glitches on the spacecraft. Failing to return on June 26 as well, no new date has been disclosed by NASA.</p>

<p>The space agency and Boeing, while announcing the delay in a statement, said, "NASA and Boeing leadership are adjusting the return to Earth of the Starliner Crew Flight Test spacecraft with agency astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams from the International Space Station. The move off Wednesday, June 26, deconflicts Starliner's undocking and landing from a series of planned International Space Station spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data."<br />
The delay has been attributed to five helium leaks on the Starliner and technical issues in five of its 28 thrusters. Experts say a minimum of 14 thrusters are required for a safe trip back.</p>

<p>While Ms Williams' trip to the ISS has faced an indefinite extension, NASA says the crew is not pressed for time to leave the station since there are plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.</p>

<p>However, Boeing is facing heat for the unexpected obstruction technical glitches in its spacecraft's maiden {test} mission. According to some experts, the same problems that beset the Boeing Company in its aviation business may be plaguing its space business as well. Recently, Boeing CEO David Calhoun was grilled by US Senators regarding the aviation giant's safety culture and transparency during his first appearance before the US Congress.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British prime minister Rishi Sunak spent the weekend calling the Conservative Party candidates who lost their seats in the general election last week to apologise for the party's worst performance at the ballot box, with just 121 seats in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Several former members of Parliament told 'The Daily Telegraph' about the "very sympathetic call" they received from the British Indian MP, who won his own seat of Richmond and Northallerton in Yorkshire and remains the Leader of the Opposition until the Tories elect his successor.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old had apologised to his party colleagues and the nation in his farewell speech at 10 Downing Street on Friday, when he also announced his resignation as Tory leader after the Labour Party won a landslide victory with 411 MPs in a 650-seat Commons.</p>

<p>"He took the time to ring me on a Saturday night and I think he's taken the time to ring other MPs. He was ringing to say that he was incredibly sorry that I'd lost my seat," an unseated Tory MP was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>"To all the Conservative candidates and campaigners who worked tirelessly but without success, I am sorry that we could not deliver what your efforts deserved," Sunak said in his speech last week.</p>

<p>Frontrunners to replace him as party leader are working behind-the-scenes to shore up their support. Former home secretary Suella Braverman, who has been openly critical of Sunak's leadership, is among the contenders but her campaign received an early blow as one of her supporters switched loyalties to her former home office colleague, Robert Jenrick.</p>

<p>Others lining up for the race include two more former home secretaries Priti Patel and James Cleverly and former business secretary Kemi Badenoch. Further former ministers from the Sunak Cabinet, Victoria Atkins and Tom Tugendhat, are also likely to throw their hat in the ring when the contours of the contest are devised by the party's 1922 Committee - which will be electing its new chair after the election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, spent his first weekend in office travelling to different parts of the United Kingdom starting with Scotland. He will then embark on his first foreign visit as PM for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) meeting in Washington to set the tone for his Labour government's relations with US President Joe Biden's administration and other international allies.</p>

<p>On Saturday, he spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leaders agreed to meet at the "earliest opportunity".</p>

<p>"Discussing the Free Trade Agreement, the prime minister said he stood ready to conclude a deal that worked for both sides. The leaders hoped to meet at the earliest opportunity," a Downing Street spokesperson said about the call.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) on Monday approved 16 species of insects including various species of crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, locusts and silkworms for human consumption. The announcement has&nbsp;delighted industry players who have been gearing up for this long-awaited moment.</p>

<p>''With immediate effect, SFA will allow the import of insects and insect products belonging to species that have been assessed to be of low regulatory concern. These insects and insect products can be used for human consumption or as animal feed for food-producing animals,'' the agency said in a circular addressed to processed food and animal feed traders.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sfa-approves-16-insect-species-for-food-companies-gear-up-to-offer-new-dishes-and-products">Straits Times</a></em>, suppliers and caterers in Singapore have been gearing up to source insects from regulated farms in China, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>

<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">SFA guidelines mandate that imported or locally farmed insects must adhere to strict food safety controls, ensuring they are not harvested from the wild. Insects that are not on SFA's list of 16 will have to undergo an evaluation to ensure that the species are safe to consume, the agency said.</p>

<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">Further, companies selling pre-packaged food containing insects will also be required to label their packaging as such. Those that are found to be non-compliant with its food safety regulations will not be allowed for sale.</p>

<h2 data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component"><strong>Restaurants gearing up</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, several restaurants and cafes are gearing up to prepare new dishes made of insects that they hope will increase their sales and attract customers. House of Seafood restaurant's chief executive Francis Ng said he is cooking up a menu of 30 insect-infused dishes.&nbsp;The insects will be added to some of its seafood dishes, such as salted egg crab, for example.</p>

<p>Mr Ng said that his&nbsp;restaurant had been getting five to six calls daily inquiring about its insect-based dishes, and when customers can start ordering them.</p>

<p>"Many of our customers, especially young people who are under 30 years old, are very daring. They want to be able to see the whole insect in the dish. So I'm giving them many options to choose from," he said.</p>

<p>He anticipates that sales from insect-based dishes will increase his revenue by around 30 per cent.</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/insects-food-singapore-grasshopper-cricket-locust-worm-sfa-import-4464861">Channel News Asia</a></em>, crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms, are rich in protein. These insects also contain plenty of antioxidants and minerals including iron, zinc, copper and magnesium. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of people, including from the vibrant Indian community in Russia, lined up on both sides of the road as Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled from the airport to his hotel in Moscow, on Monday.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi arrived to a ceremonial welcome at the Vnukovo-II International Airport in what is his first visit to the Russian capital since 2015. He was received by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov.</p>

<p>Members of the Indian community, waiting to catch a glimpse of PM Modi, were seen gathered in huge numbers as the PM's motorcade drove through the Red Square.</p>

<p>At the hotel, the Indian community gave a rousing reception to PM Modi who last visited Russia for the 20th India-Russia Bilateral Summit held on the sidelines of the 5th Eastern Economic Summit - where he was the guest of honour - at Vladivostok in September 2019.</p>

<p>As people danced and waved the Indian flag, Prime Minister Modi interacted with a few in the gathering while getting inside the building.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will be hosting a private dinner for PM Modi later in the evening with the two leaders expected to discuss a range of issues of regional and global importance of mutual interest.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, PM Modi will interact with the Indian community in Russia, lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Kremlin and thereafter visit the Rosatom pavilion at an exhibition venue in Moscow.</p>

<p>These engagements will precede a restricted-level talk between PM Modi and President Putin, which will then be followed by delegation-level talks.</p>

<p>"I look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues," PM Modi said in his departure statement before leaving New Delhi.</p>

<p>He spotlighted that the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia has advanced over the past 10 years, including in the areas of energy, security, trade, investment, health, education, culture, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[There is no limitation on the quantity of ammunition customers can purchase and the vending machines would be restocked every two to four weeks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid increasing gun violence in the United States, some grocery stores around the country now have vending machines that are stocked with ammunition. A company has installed automated kiosks in grocery stores, allowing gun owners in three US states to purchase rounds from these devices, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/07/07/bullets-ammunition-vending-machines-three-american-states/"><em>The Telegraph.</em></a></p>

<p>In certain stores in Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama, people can now obtain ammunition for their firearms by just scanning their ID on a machine that resembles a drinks vending machine. The machines' manufacturer, American Rounds, claims that operating them is just like using an ATM. "Our automated ammo dispensers are accessible 24/7, ensuring that you can buy ammunition on your own schedule, free from the constraints of store hours and long lines," the company said on its website.</p>

<p>These vending machines, according to the firm, contain "built-in AI technology, card scanning capability, and facial recognition software." According to American Rounds, the software can confirm the buyer's identity and ascertain if the machine matches the identity scanned. Customers use a touchscreen to pick the ammunition they want to purchase, then the machine scans their ID to retrieve it through a hole in the bottom.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/ammunition-vending-machines-grocery-stores-1921976"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, "there are eight machines installed or in the process of being installed across four states." The first machine was installed at a Pell City, Alabama, Fresh Value grocery shop. Since then, four have been placed at Super C Marts in Oklahoma and one in Canyon Lake, Texas, at Lowe's Market. Another is being placed at LaGrees Food Stores in Buena Vista, Colorado, and another is scheduled to be installed shortly in a Lowes Market in Canyon Lake, said CEO of American Rounds, Grants Magers.</p>

<p>He told the outlet, "We have over 200 store requests for AARM (Automated Ammo Retail Machine) units covering approximately nine states currently and that number is growing daily," he told Newsweek. Mr Magers stated that the company supported "law-abiding, responsible gun ownership."</p>

<p>"Currently ammunition is sold off the shelf or online. These environments lead to inadvertent sales to underaged purchasers and or, in the case of retail stores, a high theft rate. What we loved about this concept is the AARM units use state-of-the-art ID scanners combined with facial recognition before a transaction can be made," he added.</p>

<p>Further, as per Oklahoma TV station KOCO-TV, there is no limitation on the quantity of ammunition customers can purchase and the vending machines would be restocked every two to four weeks.</p>

<p>However, a machine in Alabama was recently removed after its legality was debated.</p>

<p>Tuscaloosa City Council President Kip Tyner said that he initially thought the machines were a joke after he received calls about them. President of the Tuscaloosa City Council Kip Tyner stated that when he first started receiving calls regarding the machines, he assumed they were a prank. "I got some calls about ammunition being sold in grocery stores, vending machines. "I thought it was a lie. I thought it was a joke-but it's not," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, the machines are authorised by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and are lawful, according to Tuscaloosa Police Chief Brent Blankley.</p>

<p>Discussing the same, Mr Magers told Newsweek: "American Rounds made the business decision to relocate the Fresh Value Automated Ammo Retail Machine located in Tuscaloosa to another store location. This was strictly a business decision based on sales at that specific store."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived here on Monday on a two-day high-profile visit to Russia during which he will hold summit talks with President Vladimir Putin to review all aspects of bilateral ties and explore opportunities to further boost cooperation in sectors like trade, energy and defence.</p>

<p>It is PM Modi's first trip to Russia in nearly five years. His last visit to Russia was in 2019 when he attended an economic conclave in the Far East city of Vladivostok.</p>

<p>During the 22nd India-Russia annual summit on Tuesday, PM Modi and Putin are expected to explore ways to further expand bilateral relations in diverse areas, including trade, energy and defence.</p>

<p>"We seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region," he said without making any specific references.</p>

<p>The annual summit between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Russia is the highest institutional dialogue mechanism in the strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>So far, 21 annual summits have taken place alternatively in India and Russia.</p>

<p>The last summit was held on December 6, 2021, in New Delhi. President Putin had visited India to attend the summit. Putin, as head of the Russian state, has visited India nine times.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi and President Putin last held bilateral talks on the margins of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) at Samarkand in Uzbekistan on September 16, 2022.</p>

<p>In the meeting, PM Modi had famously pressed Putin to end the conflict in Ukraine saying, "Today's era is not of war".</p>

<p>Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, PM Modi has held several telephonic conversations with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>In reflection of its strong friendship with Russia, India has not yet condemned Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and it has been maintaining that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue.</p>

<p>In Russia, the prime minister will also meet the vibrant Indian community.</p>

<p>From Russia, PM Modi will travel to Austria on Tuesday in the first visit by an Indian prime minister to that country in over 40 years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

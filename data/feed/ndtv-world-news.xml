       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violent clashes erupted between students and Ansar members near the Secretariat in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka on Sunday night. The confrontation left several people from both sides injured, the Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>The clash broke out after 9 pm, with both sides engaging in a series of chases. During the turmoil, police intervened in an attempt to restore order.</p>

<p>Earlier, students from various dorms of Dhaka University began gathering at the Raju Memorial Sculpture to march to the Secretariat to confront Ansar members, whom they were calling "agents of autocracy," according to Dhaka Tribune.</p>

<p>This escalation followed reports that a group of Ansar members were detaining Nahid Islam, an adviser in the interim government and coordinator of the Students Against Discrimination movement, along with coordinators Sarjis Alam, Hasnat Abdullah, and others, at the Secretariat.</p>

<p>Student Protest Coordinator Hasnat Abdullah in a Facebook post blamed former director general of Ansar, Maj Gen AKM Aminul Haque, for a continued blockade of the Secretariat, even after the demands of protesting Ansar members were met. Hasnat also urged everyone to gather in front of the Raju Memorial Sculpture at Dhaka University, Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>AKM Aminul Haque is the elder brother of former deputy minister of water resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim.</p>

<p>Hasnat Abdullah on his Facebook wrote, "Everyone, come to Raju. The autocratic forces are trying to make a comeback through the Ansar force. Even after their demands were met, we were kept locked in the Secretariat."</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Ansar members ended their protest after receiving assurances from Lt Gen (Retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, the interim government's adviser for home affairs. The members had been demonstrating for two days, calling for the nationalization of their jobs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli Air Force (IAF) on Sunday conducted a series of precision strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, thwarting what Israeli officials described as a large-scale attack. The strikes, which began at 5 am local time, were part of a military campaign aimed at neutralising Hezbollah's growing threat along Israel's northern border.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a video showcasing the operation, stating, "Our operation in Lebanon targeted the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah planned to use against us, protecting Israeli families and homes."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">WATCH how the IAF acted precisely today to stop a large-scale terrorist attack from Hezbollah.<br />
<br />
Our operation in Lebanon targeted the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah planned to use against us, protecting Israeli families and homes. <a href="https://t.co/2J3sqAnFWB">pic.twitter.com/2J3sqAnFWB</a></p>
â€” Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1827765497695211850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing his cabinet later that day, warned that the military action was far from over. "We are striking Hezbollah with surprising, crushing blows," Netanyahu said. "This is another step towards changing the situation in the north and safely returning our residents to their homes. And, I repeat, this is not the final word."</p>

<p>Netanyahu highlighted the success of the operation, noting that the military had destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were intended to harm civilians and forces in the Galilee region of Israel. He also confirmed that the IDF had intercepted all the drones that Hezbollah launched at a strategic target in central Israel, which Israeli media reported to be the headquarters of its spy agency Mossad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over 100 Israeli warplanes participated in the preemptive assault, targeting thousands of Hezbollah missile launchers across southern Lebanon. The strikes were based on what Israeli officials described as "precise intelligence" indicating that Hezbollah was on the verge of launching a massive missile barrage at northern Israel, as well as drone attacks on key intelligence centres.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, Israel declared a 48-hour state of emergency and temporarily shut down its main airport, leading to the cancellation of several flights. Despite Hezbollah's retaliation, which involved firing over 300 projectiles into Israel, the damage was minimal. Israeli officials reported that one soldier was killed by falling debris, while three fatalities were reported in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the broader conflict in the region continued. Negotiations in Cairo, aimed at establishing a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, proceeded as planned. However, the talks faced challenges, with Hamas accusing Israel of setting new conditions and prolonging the cease-fire negotiations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More and more Londoners are purchasing homes further away from the capital in a bid to get a better bang for their buck.</p>

<p>The average person moving from the city bought a home a record 39 miles outside the city between January and June, according to a report from broker Hamptons International. That's six miles further than in 2019 and 65% more than the typical first-time buyer.</p>

<p>"Four years on from the pandemic and many city workers have settled into a new normal when it comes to going into the office," said Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons. "In a bid to make their equity stretch further, movers continue to make longer distance moves out of the capital."</p>

<p>UK households are facing a mix of cost pressures triggered by higher interest rates and a cost-of-living squeeze. While home loan rates are steadily declining from the 15-year high they reached in 2023, the number of UK mortgaged properties taken into possession rose 8% in the second quarter of this year.</p>

<p>Over 25% of households trading a London home for one outside the capital moved more than 100 miles away in the first half, significantly higher than the 17% average recorded between 2015 and 2019. On average, London leavers are moving 50% further than they were a decade ago, with high transaction costs reducing the number of shorter, more frequent moves, Hamptons said.</p>

<p>Gedling and North Somerset - two local authorities based in the Midlands and western England, respectively - have seen those looking to leave London more than double in the first half of 2024 compared with the same period last year. London leavers accounted for 48% of people buying a home outside the capital between January and June.</p>

<p>Still, a long-running rise in first-time buyers leaving London was restricted in the first half of the year, as a steady decline in mortgage costs and lower house prices encouraged more prospective homeowners to buy in the capital. First-time buyers purchased a record 48% of homes sold in London between January and June, up from 41% in 2023 and 28% a decade ago, the report said.</p>

<p>What's more, first-time buyers leaving the capital are increasingly seeking out more affordable areas closer to London rather than moving further afar. The share of first-time buyers leaving London for the countryside has halved from its 6% peak in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Lower mortgage payments have pulled the cost of buying back below renting, bringing relief to those looking for their first home in the capital," Hamptons' Beveridge said. "First-time buyers with deeper pockets are looking again at London, choosing Clapham over Crawley and Wembley over Wycombe."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A wounded Palestinian prisoner has died in an Israeli hospital, two Palestinian organisations said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wounded Palestinian prisoner has died in an Israeli hospital, two Palestinian organisations said.</p>

<p>Zaher Raddad, 19, from the town of Saida in Tulkarm, northern West Bank, died in the Israeli Meir Hospital, according to a statement by the Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs Authority, part of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, along with the Palestinian Prisoners Club.</p>

<p>Raddad was arrested on July 23, after the Israeli army shot him and "used him as a human shield during the military operation by placing him on the front of one of the Israeli military vehicles in the city," the statement said on Sunday.</p>

<p>With Radad's death, the number of prisoners who died in Israeli prisons since October 7, 2023, has risen to 23, according to the statement.</p>

<p>There has been no Israeli statement on the death of Raddad, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Since October 2023, Israel has been waging a large-scale war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, after the movement carried out an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns adjacent to the Strip, which resulted in the killing of about 1,200 people.</p>

<p>The statement further detailed that Raddad had been held at Meir Hospital under critical and unstable health conditions, reliant on artificial respiration after undergoing several surgeries. Despite his grave condition, the Israeli authorities continued his detention until his death on Sunday.</p>

<p>The two Palestine organisations condemned the Israeli occupation's actions as a compounded crime, starting from the moment of Raddad's arrest and shooting, his use as a human shield, and the continued detention despite his severe health condition.</p>

<p>They described this incident as part of the unprecedented scale of crimes committed by the Israeli occupation since the onset of its genocidal campaign against the people of Gaza and its ongoing aggression against Palestinians across all occupied territories.</p>

<p>Tensions have been running high across the West Bank since Israel launched a military offensive against the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 40,400 Palestinians since last October.</p>

<p>At least 641 Palestinians have since been killed and nearly 5,400 others injured in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.</p>

<p>In a landmark advisory opinion on July 19, the International Court of Justice declared Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian land unlawful and demanded the evacuation of all existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after 100 Israeli warplanes swooped over southern Lebanon, taking out thousands of Hezbollah missile launchers in what was called a preemptive strike, the Middle East braced for an expanded conflagration that could involve Iran and its allied militias.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The assault started at 5 am local time and was based, Israeli officials said, on precise intelligence that Hezbollah was about to fire thousands of missiles at northern Israel as well as drones at a key intelligence centre just north of Tel Aviv in retaliation for the killing of its commander in July.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel declared a 48-hour state of emergency and shut its main airport for several hours, with numerous foreign airlines cancelling flights. Hezbollah responded by firing more than 200 projectiles, according to Israel, although officials said very limited damage was caused. One Israeli soldier was killed by falling debris, while three deaths were reported in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Hezbollah had successfully executed an attack on targets in central Israel, the tit-for-tat fighting that's been simmering on the border area for 10 months may have exploded into wider warfare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our hope is that the events of last night do not spill out into an escalation that leads to regional war," US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters on Sunday evening during a visit to Canada.</p>

<p>For the time being, at least, a relative calm held.</p>

<p>"It was a huge success that we detected the plans and now there is the possibility for both sides not to escalate this very complex situation," said retired Brigadier General Ilan Biton, a former chief of defense for Israel's air force. Both Israel and Hezbollah announced that for the moment, their operations were over - despite ongoing low-level fighting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel reopened its airport and eased restrictions on public gatherings imposed earlier in the day. Israel's military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said there was no damage to any Israeli military base. The Israeli army didn't reimpose safety restrictions on the population on Sunday night, indicating it didn't expect another attack imminently.</p>

<p>Significantly, negotiations in Cairo aimed at establishing a cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militia Hamas commenced as planned on Sunday.</p>

<p>But after a Hamas delegation left Cairo on Sunday evening, Osama Hamdan, a spokesman and leader of the group, said Israel has "set new conditions for a cease-fire" and "is still procrastinating," according to a statement posted on the group's Telegram account. In a dig at President Joe Biden's administration, he said it's "planting false hope by talking about an imminent agreement for electoral purposes."</p>

<p>The talks are set to continue at lower levels in the coming days in an effort to bridge gaps between the parties, the Associated Press reported, citing a US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official said the recent talks have been constructive and the parties are working to reach an implementable agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Underscoring 'Consequences'</strong></h2>

<p>The Israeli exchange with Hezbollah "is more likely to aid than complicate the cease-fire talks," said Mike Singh, managing director at the Washington Institute. "By sending a message that Israel is willing and able to escalate, and that Washington will back it when it does so, the US and Israel have underscored the consequences for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran of continuing to refuse a deal."</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its attack on Israel was planned as the start of retaliation for the killing of its commander Fuad Shukr on July 30 in Beirut's southern suburbs. The group said it fired more than 320 missiles, followed up by drones, to target 11 army barracks and military sites in northern Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mossad intelligence service's base in Glilot was the main target of the attack, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah said Sunday.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a security cabinet meeting Sunday and said he was "determined to do everything to defend our country, to return the residents of the north securely to their homes, and to continue upholding a simple rule: Whoever harms us - we will harm them."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, noted that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke by phone over the weekend. He declined to say whether the US was given advance warning of Sunday's attack, adding, "This was an Israeli operation."</p>

<h2><strong>US Support</strong></h2>

<p>The US has stepped up its naval and air defense presence in the region as a warning to Iran and its allies not to increase hostilities. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked if Israel had informed the US in advance of its plans to hit at Hezbollah, Sullivan, the national security adviser, sidestepped the question. "I can't speak directly to the conversations that unfolded yesterday, other than to say there was continuous communication, and we have been tracking the threat of Hezbollah attacks against Israel for some time now," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But despite fresh US statements Sunday affirming support for Israel's right to defense, the attack on Hezbollah is a setback for "American diplomacy, which has been laser-focused on de-escalation" and on the search for a cease-fire in Gaza, according to Merissa Khurma, director of the Middle East program at the Wilson Center in Washington. "In private, the past ten-plus months have showcased various ebbs and flows in US-Israeli relations, and certainly a significant rise in tensions."</p>

<p>She said it raises doubts among regional allies about "whether the US still has leverage over Israel."</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire along the border since October, when the Lebanese organization entered the fray in support of Hamas in Gaza. Israeli strikes have killed at least 500 people since then, most of them Hezbollah fighters. In Israel, roughly 30 soldiers and 18 civilians have been killed by Hezbollah attacks.</p>

<p>Preventing the skirmishes from escalating even further has been at the heart of international diplomatic efforts to ease tension across the Middle East.</p>

<p>Hours after an Israeli airstrike on July 30 killed Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, Iran blamed Israel for killing the head of Hamas' political office, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran. Iran has vowed to retaliate but it has also said it would do so on its own timetable. Israel has repeatedly warned it not to do so.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Netanyahu warned Hezbollah and Iran that the latest attack isn't "the end of the story," and was "another step on the way to changing the situation in the north, and return our residents safely to their homes."</p>

<h2><strong>Evacuations</strong></h2>

<p>The US has been trying to mediate between Lebanon and Israel to reach a compromise over border disputes. Tens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese have been evacuated from the border area due to the fighting, and Israel wants Hezbollah to move its fighters away from the border to allow its citizens to return. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and designated a terrorist organization by the US, says it will continue hostilities with Israel until the country agrees to a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas, also designated a terrorist group by the US and others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The war in the Palestinian enclave began on Oct. 7 after Hamas militants, supported by Iran, invaded Israel and killed 1,200 people and abducted others. Israel's retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 40,000 people, according to Hamas health officials in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crew of a Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) ship was evacuated due to heavy flooding, following a collision with an underwater object off the coast of Johor state.</p>

<p>All the crew had been recovered safely while the partially submerged ship was being salvaged, the RMN said on Sunday in a statement.</p>

<p>"A leak was first detected at 12 p.m. ... It is believed to have been caused by the vessel colliding with an underwater object. It (the leak) was initially detected in the ship's engine room before spreading uncontrollably. The crew was safely recovered after efforts to control the situation and stabilise the vessel did not succeed," it added.</p>

<p>RMN said the ship partially sank in the incident, which occurred at noon two nautical miles southeast of Tanjung Penyusop while it was conducting an operation in the area, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>It said all 39 crew members were rescued after efforts to stem the leak and stabilise the ship failed.</p>

<p>The focus now is on conducting a salvage operation to save the ship.</p>

<p>RMN will establish a special investigative board immediately to determine the cause of the incident, it said.</p>

<p>The Navy said several parties responded to the incident, including the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, the police and the maritime community in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The public is advised not to speculate on the incident. Please refer to official RMN sources for the latest developments and accurate information, it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is gearing up for a substantial increase in iPhone production for the upcoming year, with a particular emphasis on its Pro and Pro Max models.</p>

<p>According to recent reports by GSM Arena, the tech giant plans to manufacture approximately 90.1 million iPhones in 2024, a slight increase from last year's target of 86.2 million units.</p>

<p>This year's production strategy reveals a notable shift in focus towards higher-end models.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to make up a significant portion of this total, with plans to produce 33.2 million units, which represents 37 per cent of the total production mix.</p>

<p>This marks a considerable increase from last year's production of 24.2 million iPhone 15 Pro Max units, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>Similarly, the production of iPhone 16 Pro models is set to rise to 26.6 million units, accounting for 30 per cent of the total iPhone 16 production.</p>

<p>This is an increase from the 21.8 million units of the iPhone 15 Pro produced last year.</p>

<p>In contrast, the non-Pro variants will see a more modest production increase.</p>

<p>The standard iPhone 16 will see a rise to 24.5 million units, up from 21.8 million last year, while the iPhone 16 Plus will see a reduction, with only 5.8 million units planned for production.</p>

<p>This represents a decline from the 8.5 million units of the iPhone 15 Plus produced last year, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>This shift in production focus towards the Pro and Pro Max models underscores a growing consumer preference for higher-end smartphones, which typically offer higher profit margins for Apple.</p>

<p>As the iPhone 16 series is anticipated to debut on September 10, 2024, these production adjustments highlight Apple's strategic response to evolving market demands and consumer trends.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your boss texting you on the weekend? Work email pinging long after you've left for home?</p>

<p>Australian employees can now ignore those and other intrusions into home life thanks to a new "right to disconnect" law designed to curb the creep of work emails and calls into personal lives.</p>

<p>The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours.</p>

<p>Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work.</p>

<p>"Before we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day," said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology.</p>

<p>"Now, globally it's the norm to have emails, SMS, phone calls outside those hours, even when on holiday."</p>

<p>Australians worked on average 281 hours of unpaid overtime in 2023, according to a survey last year by the Australia Institute, which estimated the monetary value of the labour at A$130 billion ($88 billion).</p>

<p>The changes add Australia to a group of roughly two dozen countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America, which have similar laws.</p>

<p>Pioneer France introduced the rules in 2017 and a year later fined pest control firm Rentokil Initial 60,000 euros ($66,700) for requiring an employee to always have his phone on.</p>

<p>Rachel Abdelnour, who works in advertising, said the changes would help her disconnect in an industry where clients often have different working hours.</p>

<p>"I think it's actually really important that we have laws like this," she told Reuters. "We spend so much of our time connected to our phones, connected to our emails all day, and I think that it's really hard to switch off as it is."</p>

<p><strong>Refusals Must Be Reasonable</strong></p>

<p>To cater for emergencies and jobs with irregular hours, the rule still allows employers to contact their workers, who can only refuse to respond where it is reasonable to do so.</p>

<p>Determining whether a refusal is reasonable will be up to Australia's industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission (FWC), which must take into account an employee's role, personal circumstances and how and why the contact was made.</p>

<p>It has the power to issue a cease and desist order and, failing that, levy fines of up A$19,000 for an employee or up to A$94,000 for a company.</p>

<p>But the Australian Industry Group, an employer group, says ambiguity about how the rule applies will create confusion for bosses and workers. Jobs will become less flexible and in doing so slow the economy, it added.</p>

<p>"The laws came literally and figuratively out of left field, were introduced with minimal consultation about their practical effect and have left little time for employers to prepare," the group said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Michele O'Neil said the caveat built into the law meant it won't interfere with reasonable requests. Instead, it will stop workers paying the price for poor planning by management, she said.</p>

<p>She cited an unidentified worker who finished a shift at midnight, only to be texted four hours later and told to be back at work by 6 a.m.</p>

<p>"It's so easy to make contact, common sense doesn't get applied anymore," she said.</p>

<p>"We think this will cause bosses to pause and think about whether they really need to send that text or that email."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 people have died and more than 5.2 million have been affected in Bangladesh by floods caused by relentless monsoon rains and overflowing rivers, officials said on Sunday.</p>

<p>The floodwaters have left many people isolated and in urgent need of food, clean water, medicine, and dry clothes, particularly in remote areas where blocked roads have hampered rescue and relief efforts.</p>

<p>Government Chief Adviser Mohammad Yunus said in a televised address that the administration has adopted all necessary measures to ensure a swift return to normality for flood victims.</p>

<p>Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, is leading the interim government that was sworn in after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country following a student-led uprising this month.</p>

<p>Abdul Halim, a 65-year-old farmer from a village in the Comilla district, said his mud hut was swept away by a 10-foot-high surge of floodwater in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>"There are no goods and no water. Barely anyone has come with the relief (aid) deep inside the villages. You have to physically go close to the main road to collect it," he told Reuters television.</p>

<p>Some people in Bangladesh have alleged that the floods were caused by the opening of dam sluice gates in neighbouring India, an assertion New Delhi has rejected.</p>

<p>"We have begun discussions with neighbouring countries to prevent future flood situations," Yunus said.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Meteorological Department has warned that flood conditions could persist if the monsoon rains continue, as water levels are receding very slowly.</p>

<p>More than 400,000 people have taken refuge in around 3,500 shelters in the 11 flood-hit districts, where nearly 750 medical teams are on the ground to provide treatment, with the army, air force, navy, and Border Guard Bangladesh assisting in rescue operations, authorities said.</p>

<p>An analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.</p>

<p>"The impact of this year's monsoon rains has been widespread and devastating," said Kabita Bose, Country Director of Plan International Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"Entire communities have been completely inundated, and there are now millions of people, including children, in need of safe shelter and lifesaving humanitarian assistance," she said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched attacks on northern, eastern and southern Ukraine, killing at least four people and injuring 37, Ukrainian military and local authorities said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Overnight attacks targeted Ukraine's frontline regions of Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Donetsk, Ukraine's air force said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Russia has been pummelling Ukrainian border regions with strikes, and Kyiv said its surprise incursion earlier this month into Russia's Kursk region aimed to hinder Moscow's ability to stage such attacks.</p>

<p>"Most of the missiles did not reach their targets," the air force said, adding that Russia launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile, an Iskander-K cruise missile and six guided air missiles. It did not specify how many were destroyed.</p>

<p>A missile attack on the northern region of Sumy killed one person, injuring at least 16 more, including three children, local authorities said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Oleh Sinehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region in the east, posted that at least 13 people were injured in the Russian attacks, including a 4-year-old child.</p>

<p>Ihor Terekhov, mayor of Kharkiv city, said a gas pipeline was damaged in the city and at least two houses were destroyed and 10 damaged.</p>

<p>The air force said Russia launched nine attack drones, with Ukraine's air defence systems destroying eight of them over the Mykolaiv region.</p>

<p>Russian attacks continued throughout the day in the southern region of Kherson, killing one person and injuring six more, according to Roman Mrochko, head of Kherson city's military administration.</p>

<p>Regional prosecutors in Sumy said an aerial bomb attack on Sunday afternoon struck a residential neighbourhood in the Svesa village, killing two people and injuring two more.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Russia.</p>

<p>Both sides deny targeting civilians in the war that Russia launched with a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hamas official said on Sunday the group's delegation left Cairo after meeting with Egyptian and Qatari mediators trying to negotiate a ceasefire in the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>"The Hamas delegation left Cairo tonight, after meeting with Egyptian and Qatari mediators who briefed them on the results of the latest negotiations," Izzat al-Rishq, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and avert a wider war intensified following the killings of two senior Iran-backed militants last month that sparked threats of reprisals from Tehran and its allies, who blamed Israel.</p>

<p>The basis of the talks has been a framework that US President Joe Biden outlined in late May, which he described as an Israeli proposal.</p>

<p>"Hamas reiterates its readiness to implement" the Biden plan, Rishq said on Sunday.</p>

<p>While the United States, which is also acting as a mediator, said Friday that progress had been made during the latest round of Gaza talks, previous optimism during the months-long negotiations has proved unfounded.</p>

<p>Hamas had earlier said a delegation would go to Cairo, but only to meet with mediators rather than participate in the discussions.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Rishq reiterated several of Hamas's long-standing demands for any ceasefire agreement, in particular the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel launched air strikes into Lebanon on Sunday, saying it destroyed "thousands" of Hezbollah rocket launchers and thwarted a major attack, while the Lebanese group insisted it had been able to deliver a drone and rocket barrage of its own.</p>

<p>The result was perhaps the biggest exchange of fire in 10 months of a war which began with a Hamas attack launched from Gaza and has triggered both new violence on the Lebanon-Israel border and fears of a broader conflagration in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said around 100 of its fighter jets had struck more than 270 targets, "90 percent" of which "were short-range rockets aimed at northern Israel".</p>

<p>Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese armed group, denied that thousands of launchers had been destroyed or that Israel had thwarted a larger attack. It said its own operation "was completed and accomplished".</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet the strikes were "not the final word" in the campaign against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>A soldier in the Israeli navy was killed in combat and two more wounded, the military said, with an official telling AFP their boat may have been hit by one of their own side's air-defence interceptors.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces throughout the Gaza war, in what Hezbollah says is support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p>But fears of a wider regional conflagration soared after attacks in late July, blamed on Israel, killed Iran-aligned leaders including the Hamas political chief and a top Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, which prompted vows of revenge.</p>

<p>Britain and Jordan were among those to appeal on Sunday for an end to the escalation and a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also called for the UN Security Council to take "deterrent" and "effective" measures against Netanyahu and his ministers who "kill all chances of achieving peace".</p>

<p><strong>Homes damaged</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said its operatives launched "a large number of drones" and "more than 320" Katyusha rockets targeting "enemy positions" across the border.</p>

<p>The group's leader Hassan Nasrallah named the "main target" as the Glilot military intelligence base near Tel Aviv, which Israeli media reported is home to the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency.</p>

<p>Israel's military said there were "no hits" on the base.</p>

<p>A secondary target, said Nasrallah, was Ein Shemer, a military airport used by Israeli drones.</p>

<p>He also appeared to suggest Hezbollah's retaliation for Shukr's killing was over, saying "if the result is satisfactory" then its response "has been accomplished".</p>

<p>An AFP photographer in Acre, an Israeli city 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the border, reported damage to three homes from a Hezbollah rocket that struck a roof, with shrapnel smashing windows and destroying a bed.</p>

<p>"There were explosions in the area of Haifa," said Abigail Levy, a resident of the coastal city further south. "I was stopped and was told not to go to the beach."</p>

<p>AFPTV footage from early Sunday showed dozens of interceptor rockets being launched into dense clouds above the Upper Galilee in northern Israel.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer saw a Hezbollah drone exploding into a huge fireball as it was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force.</p>

<p>Hezbollah announced two of its fighters had been killed, while its ally the Amal movement also reported the death of a member. No casualties were immediately reported in Israel.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel "was aware" of six operativess "killed in the strikes".</p>

<p>Another military spokesman, Nadav Shoshani, said Hezbollah's strikes were "part of a larger attack that was planned and we were able to thwart a big part of it this morning".</p>

<p>The fighting disrupted air travel in Israel and Lebanon, with both British Airways and Air France among those suspending flights to Tel Aviv.</p>

<p><strong>'Stop the escalation'</strong></p>

<p>Yemen's Huthi rebels, one of several Iran-backed groups that have been drawn into the Gaza war's periphery, hailed the Hezbollah attack and declared that their own retaliation was "definitely coming".</p>

<p>The fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah has killed hundreds, mostly in Lebanon, and displaced tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati told an emergency cabinet meeting he was in contact with "Lebanon's friends to stop the escalation".</p>

<p>General Charles Brown, the most senior officer in the US military, arrived in Israel on Sunday evening to meet his Israeli counterpart Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's top military supplier.</p>

<p>A US defence official said Washington had helped track the Hezbollah barrage although it was not involved in shooting down any drones or rockets or in the strikes on Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Flightradar24 tracking website on Sunday afternoon showed a US Navy surveillance drone had been flying over nearby Mediterranean waters.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza talks</strong></p>

<p>Hamas hailed Hezbollah's Sunday attack as "a slap in the face" for Israel, and the Palestinian movement on Sunday night said it fired a rocket toward Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it landed in an "open area" south of the city.</p>

<p>In the leadup to Sunday's major exchange, Western and Arab diplomats had sought to head off regional retaliation, stressing the urgency of reaching a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

<p>Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whose officials have been mediating Gaza truce talks for months alongside the US and Qatar, "warned of the dangers of a new front opening in Lebanon" and called for progress in the talks to enable a "path to calm and stability in the region" his office said.</p>

<p>A Hamas official said on Sunday the group's delegation had left the Egyptian capital after meeting with mediators.</p>

<p>In Gaza, witnesses said battles raged in the area of Deir al-Balah, in the territory's central region.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,405 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not break down civilian and militant deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian Hamas operatives in their attack, 105 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French judicial authorities on Sunday extended the detention of the Russian-born founder and chief of Telegram Pavel Durov after his arrest at a Paris airport over alleged offences related to the popular but controversial messaging app.</p>

<p>His arrest at the Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday is the latest extraordinary twist in the career of one of the world's most influential tech icons.</p>

<p>The detention of Durov, 39, was extended beyond Sunday night by the investigating magistrate who is handling the case, according to a source close to the investigation. This initial period of detention for questioning can last up to a maximum of 96 hours.</p>

<p>When this phase of detention ends, the judge can then decide to free him or press charges and remand in further custody.</p>

<p>Russia has accused France of "refusing to cooperate" and fellow tech mogul Elon Musk swept to his defence. Durov holds a French passport in addition to other nationalities.</p>

<p>Durov had arrived in Paris from Baku, Azerbaijan, and was planning to have dinner in the French capital, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a bodyguard and a personal assistant who always accompany him, added the source, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, another source said.</p>

<p>Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>Telegram said in response that "Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe."</p>

<p>"Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards," it added. "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform."</p>

<p><strong>'Assault on basic human rights'</strong></p>

<p>Durov founded Telegram in 2013 after his first project, the Russian social network VKontakte (VK), ran into ownership difficulties he blamed on the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Telegram has become hugely popular partly due to the ease of viewing and posting videos on its messaging "channels".</p>

<p>But critics accuse it of hosting often illegal content ranging from extreme sexual imagery, disinformation and also services for buying drugs.</p>

<p>Russia's embassy to Paris said it had demanded access to Durov but had had no response from France, saying "the French side is refusing to cooperate".</p>

<p>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow had asked for consular access, but since Durov also had French citizenship "France considers that it is his main nationality".</p>

<p>Musk, who leads the Tesla car group and the X social media, formerly Twitter, posted the hashtag #FreePavel on X and commented in French, "Liberte Liberte! Liberte?" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).</p>

<p>US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who took asylum in Russia, blasted "an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association", saying he was saddened Paris had "descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications."</p>

<p><strong>'Independence, privacy, freedom'</strong></p>

<p>A source close to the case expressed surprise that Durov had flown to France with a warrant against him. "Perhaps he had a feeling of impunity," said the source.</p>

<p>Le Bourget is now used by private planes rather than regular commercial traffic. It is also famed as the place the Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev defected to the West in 1961.</p>

<p>Telegram, an encrypted messaging app based in Dubai, has positioned itself as an alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.</p>

<p>Telegram has committed to never disclosing information about its users.</p>

<p>In a rare interview given to right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in April, Durov said he got the idea to launch an encrypted messaging app after coming under pressure from the Russian government while working at VK.</p>

<p>He said he then tried to settle in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco before choosing Dubai, which he praised for its business environment and "neutrality".</p>

<p>People "love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram," Durov told Carlson.</p>

<p>He said at the time that the platform had more than 900 million active users.</p>

<p>By basing itself in the United Arab Emirates, Telegram has shielded itself from moderation laws at a time when Western countries are pressuring large platforms to remove illegal content.</p>

<p>Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally, as well as for users to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content.</p>

<p>Competitor messaging service WhatsApp introduced worldwide limits on message forwarding in 2019 after it was accused of enabling the spread of false information in India that led to lynchings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said Friday it rejected "new conditions" in a Gaza ceasefire proposal that US-led mediators presented during two days of talks in Qatar.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to alleviate the suffering endured over more than 10 months of war, but US President Joe Biden insisted after the latest round of talks that "we are closer than we have ever been".</p>

<p>He is sending US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel this weekend to push the latest proposal, the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators have been seeking to finalise details of a framework initially outlined by Biden in May, which he said Israel had proposed.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the mediators said they had presented both sides with a proposal that "bridges remaining gaps" and will continue working in the coming days to hash out the specifics on humanitarian provisions and the hostage-prisoners swap.</p>

<p>Talks aiming to secure a rapid deal are set to resume in Cairo "before the end of next week".</p>

<p>Hamas, which did not attend the Doha talks, swiftly announced its opposition to what it called "new conditions" from Israel in the latest plan.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on mediators to "pressure" Hamas to accept Biden's framework.</p>

<p>Threats by Iran and its proxies to attack Israel have added renewed urgency to the efforts to hammer out a Gaza ceasefire, with mediators seeking a deal in the hopes of dousing a wider regional conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"No one in the region should take actions to undermine this process," Biden warned, later telling reporters, "There's just a couple more issues, I think we've got a shot."</p>

<p>- 'Cataclysmic' consequences -<br />
An informed source told AFP Hamas had objected to conditions about keeping Israeli troops on Gaza's border with Egypt and terms related to the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>Western ally Jordan, however, put the blame squarely on Netanyahu for blocking a deal, with Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi urging pressure "by everyone who wishes to see this through to completion".</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and his French counterpart Stephane Sejourne held talks in Israel on Friday to press the deal.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told his visiting counterparts he expects foreign support if Iran seeks to avenge the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sejourne replied that it would be "inappropriate" to discuss responding to any attack while diplomacy to stop it from happening is in high gear.</p>

<p>A senior US official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Iran would face "cataclysmic" consequences if it strikes Israel.</p>

<p>A deadly attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank late Thursday drew international condemnation and calls for sanctions, including against government ministers, over the surge in settler violence against Palestinians since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "dozens of Israeli civilians, some of them masked", entered the village of Jit and "set fire to vehicles and structures in the area, hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails". A Palestinian man was shot dead.</p>

<p>The West Bank-based Palestinian foreign ministry described the attack as "organised state terrorism".</p>

<p>The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he would propose sanctions against Israeli government "enablers" of Jewish settler violence.</p>

<p>Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a proponent of West Bank settlements, was quick to join other Israeli leaders in condemning Thursday's attack by "criminals".</p>

<p>First polio case recorded</p>

<p><br />
Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign topped 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant casualties.</p>

<p>The war has devastated the besieged territory's healthcare infrastructure, prompting repeated warnings from the World Health Organization about the risk of preventable diseases.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Palestinian health ministry reported an unvaccinated 10-month-old child in Gaza had been diagnosed with polio, the territory's first case in 25 years, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>The announcement came hours after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children against type 2 poliovirus, which was first detected in the territory's wastewater in June.</p>

<p>As truce talks were underway, thousands of civilians were on the move again inside the Palestinian territory after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders ahead of imminent military action.</p>

<p>The UN estimated the orders affect more than 170,000 people, forcing them to pack into the shrinking remnants of an area declared a humanitarian safe zone.</p>

<p>The area where people have been told to relocate to makes up just 11 percent of Gaza, according to the UN.</p>

<p>"During each round of negotiations, they exert pressure by forcing evacuations and committing massacres," Issa Murad, a Palestinian displaced to Deir al-Balah, said of the Israeli forces.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British woman on Sunday celebrated her 102nd birthday by skydiving out of a plane and said she hoped her daredevil antics might inspire other elderly people to stay active.</p>

<p>Manette Baillie said it was "a bit scary", adding "I must admit I shut my eyes very firmly."</p>

<p>Baillie told BBC radio she just wanted "other people who are getting towards 80 and 90 not to give up anything. Just keep going".</p>

<p>It's not the first time the centenarian from the village of Benhall Green in eastern England has taken on a daredevil challenge.</p>

<p>She drove around the Silverstone motor racing circuit in a Ferrari at 210 kilometres per hour (130 miles per hour) to mark her 100th birthday two years ago.</p>

<p>The skydive at Beccles Airfield involved Baillie jumping from a height of more than 2,100 metres (6,900 feet), with an assistant strapped into the harness with her.</p>

<p>Baillie said earlier she had been spurred into action after hearing about a friend's 85-year-old father who had done a skydive.</p>

<p>"If an 85-year-old man can do it, so can I," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Britain's biggest mobile network operators said on Sunday it will warn parents they should not give smartphones to children under the age of 11.</p>

<p>The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents about the potential pitfalls of smartphone access for young people.</p>

<p>A recent study by the UK communications regulator found around a quarter of British children aged between five and seven-years-old now had a smartphone.</p>

<p>EE will say in new guidance that children should only be given phones with "limited capability devices" allowing them only to text and call.</p>

<p>It will also advise enabling parental control features for teens under the age of 16 and restrictions on social media for the under-13s.</p>

<p>UK parents have increasingly started to push back against the trend of giving children one of the devices when they transfer from primary to secondary school at the age of 11.</p>

<p>Widely justified on safety grounds in case of an emergency on the way to or from school, parents fear the phones also potentially open children up to online predators, bullying, social pressure and harmful content.</p>

<p>"While technology and connectivity have the power to transform lives, we recognise the growing complexity of smartphones can be challenging for parents and caregivers," said Mat Sears, EE corporate affairs director.</p>

<p>"They need support, which is why we are launching new guidelines on smartphone usage for under 11s, 11 to 13-year-olds, and 13 to 16-year-olds to help them make the best choices for their children through these formative years."</p>

<p>US author Jonathan Haidt -- whose recent book "The Anxious Generation" argued that smartphones have rewired children's brains -- has urged parents to act together on smartphone access so it becomes the norm for children not to have one.</p>

<p>A child "breaks our heart" by telling us they are excluded from their peer group by being the only one without a phone, he said earlier this year.</p>

<p>Mr Haidt advocates for no smart phones before the age of 14 or social media before 16.</p>

<p>"These things are hard to do as one parent. But if we all do it together -- if even half of us do it together -- then it becomes much easier for our kids," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people including a police officer were injured in a stabbing attack in Sydney early on Sunday, police said, the latest in a series of knife assaults in Australia's biggest city this year.</p>

<p>A man who ran from the scene has been taken into custody, police said in a statement. There is no ongoing threat to people in Sydney, said New South Wales state Police Minister Yasmin Catley.</p>

<p>Police said no one was killed in the attack, which came after a "domestic-related" incident in a car that collided with another vehicle in the southern suburb of Engadine.</p>

<p>The attacker "was armed with what we believe to be a boxcutter," police superintendent Donald Faulds said in a televised press conference.</p>

<p>Aerial footage of the scene by the Australian Broadcasting Corp showed two crashed cars cordoned off with police tape.</p>

<p>Sydney, a city of 5 million, has seen a spate of knife attacks this year, prompting the New South Wales government to toughen its knife laws. The state parliament passed laws in June giving police electronic metal-detecting scanners to check people without a warrant at shopping centres, sporting venues and public transport stations.</p>

<p>In April, six people were killed and 12 injured in a knife attack at a mall in Sydney's Bondi area.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin doctor was shot in US in Tuscaloosa, a city in Alabama, on Friday. The victim, identified as Dr Ramesh Babu Peramsetty, died on the spot. He was a renowned physician who operated several hospitals in America.</p>

<p>Dr Ramesh, who was from Andhra Pradesh's Tirupati district, was one of the founders and medical director of a group of local medical officers operating as the Crimson Network. He was known for his contributions in the field of healthcare and also practiced as a physician in Tuscaloosa.</p>

<p>"As many are aware at this moment, we have been informed of Dr. Ramesh Peramsetty's passing. The Peramsetty family ask for us to give them privacy as they grieve his passing. They have received abundant outpouring of love and faith. We will continue to honor him as he would want us to do. Thank you for your understanding," the Crimson Care Network Team said in a Facebook post. (sic)</p>

<p>The Crimson Care Network said its team "is prepared to make more statements within the next few days."</p>

<h3><strong>Who Was Dr Ramesh Babu Peramsetty?</strong></h3>

<p>Dr Peramsetty graduated from the Medical College of Wisconsin, Sri Venkateswara Medical College in 1986, according to his Wedmd page. He had 38 years of experience.</p>

<p>He worked in Tuscaloosa and four other locations and was specialised in Emergency Medicine and Family Medicine, it says. He was also affiliated with Diploma in Child Health (DCH) Regional Medical Center.</p>

<p>As per local reports, a street in Tuscaloosa was named after him due to his significant contributions in the medical profession. He also did extensive work during the Covid-19 pandemic and also received awards for the same, reports suggest. He is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters and all are settled in the US, as per reports.</p>

<p>He donated Rs 14 lakh to Menakuru High School in Andhra Pradesh where he studied and also for the construction of a Sai temple in his village, according to reports.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Macklemore has announced he is cancelling an upcoming show in Dubai over the UAE's involvement in the conflict in Sudan, charges the Gulf state has denied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rapper best known for hits like 2012's "Thrift Shop" made the announcement in a post on social media on Saturday.</p>

<p>"I have decided to cancel my upcoming show in Dubai this October," he said.</p>

<p>"Over the last several months I've had a number of people reach out to me, sharing resources and asking me to cancel the show in solidarity with the people of Sudan," he said.</p>

<p>"Until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform there," Macklemore added, referring to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that have been battling the Sundanese army.</p>

<p>War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army, under the country's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, which is commanded by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For months, the army has accused the UAE of supporting the RSF.</p>

<p>In June, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed called Abu Dhabi's financial and military support for the RSF the "main reason behind this protracted war".</p>

<p>The UAE has denied allegations of RSF support as "disinformation", saying that it's efforts are focused exclusively towards de-escalation and alleviating Sudan's humanitarian suffering.</p>

<p>Macklemore has released socially aware music in the past, supporting LGBTQ+ rights while also criticising ills including poverty and consumerism.</p>

<p>In his latest track released in May, Macklemore voices support for Palestinians and also praises students across the United States protesting against Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The song, "Hind's Hall", is named after a building at Columbia University that students recently occupied and renamed after Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

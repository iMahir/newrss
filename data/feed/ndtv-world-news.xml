       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100 students were injured across Bangladesh on Monday in clashes between those protesting to end a quota system for government jobs and others loyal to the ruling party, police and witnesses said.</p>

<p>The protests mark the first significant demonstrations that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has faced since she won a fourth straight term in an election in January boycotted by the main opposition.</p>

<p>Thousands of anti-quota protesters and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League hurled rocks and fought each other with sticks and iron rods at universities across the country, including Dhaka, police and witnesses said.</p>

<p>Students were injured on several campuses, police officials said.</p>

<p>The protesters called for marches and rallies to continue across the country to press their demands.</p>

<p>"This is more than just a student movement. To suppress this movement, incitement from the highest levels of government has been made. So, common people have to come to the streets," said Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests.</p>

<p>The protests began earlier this month after the High Court ordered the government to restore 30% job quotas for the descendants of freedom fighters. They have continued despite Bangladesh's top court suspending that order for a month last week.</p>

<p>The protests intensified on Sunday night after Hasina refused to meet the students' demands, stating that the issue was now before the court.</p>

<p>Hasina said those who oppose job quotas for relatives of freedom fighters are the 'Razakar', which collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 War of Independence. Her comments led thousands of students to leave their dormitories on the Dhaka University campus at midnight to protest.</p>

<p>"An attempt is being made to transform the anti-quota movement into an anti-state one using the emotions of young students," said Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud. "The government will not allow an unstable situation to develop."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government on Monday hiked the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil to Rs 7,000 per tonne, from Rs 6,000 per tonne.</p>

<p>The tax is levied in the form of Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED).</p>

<p>The SAED on the export of diesel, petrol and jet fuel or ATF, has been retained at 'nil'.</p>

<p>The new rates are effective from July 16, an official notification said.</p>

<p>India first imposed windfall profit taxes on July 1, 2022, joining a host of nations that tax supernormal profits of energy companies. The tax rates are reviewed every fortnight based on average oil prices in the previous two weeks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a "top pick," citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.</p>

<p>In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.</p>

<p>Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.</p>

<p>"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments," Morgan Stanley analysts said.</p>

<p>The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.</p>

<p>The stock has an average rating of "buy" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.</p>

<p>Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.</p>

<p>Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have found evidence for an accessible cave conduit beneath the moon's surface. The location of the underground cave is not far from Apollo 11's landing site. It's 250 miles (400 kilometers) from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago.</p>

<p>Researchers analysed radar measurements by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and compared the results with lava tubes on Earth. Their findings appeared in the journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02302-y.epdf?sharing_token=DmQt9tO2f0EhQ_htee77wdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NM3XCoO8qqQAVpZqycEJ41v-Y1i8jue3aIH5QvXVkwNKM1VU1zJ66l13rexlhrvWyR1SrF_fl-osl851IG6owAa0mBcJWiYLUEFsYJHaDQToCmPmK9-zmmu3ISDRCd_-bbjc6mWGjLESX0dlosaOO6ajSxqNLEsAwtOYQWjRSDZUas1FsiA_ba07AU0JoJn7TrUFfzNVCqnuk84kIxwY2jwOTbMazxswZY2EG7dQTfD1SvRhx_8EIghgsSVe7Iq-gYPofeRd77R9YDcYTXaGQVnz2CpWIxs9d3_oHWLfgaj9TrjR1kBhEgeYbu-Ocy8JU%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com">Nature Astronomy</a>.</p>

<p>The finding suggests that the cave is a "promising site for a lunar base" as it offers shelter from the harsh surface environment and could support long-term human exploration of the Moon.</p>

<p>The cave is accessible from the deepest known pit on the moon. It's located at the Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility)</p>

<p>The pit, like the more than 200 others discovered up there, was created by the collapse of a lava tube.</p>

<p>NASA is aiming to build a semi-permanent crewed base on the moon, China and Russia have also announced interest in creating lunar research outposts. But, a permanent lunar base can only be set up in environments protected from cosmic radiation and with stable temperatures.</p>

<p>Such caves could form an emergency lunar shelter because the astronauts would be naturally shielded from harmful cosmic rays, solar radiation and micrometeorites.</p>

<p>Lunar orbiters first spotted pits on the moon more than a decade ago. Many are thought to be "skylights" that connect to underground caves such as lava tubes, giant underground tunnels that form through volcanic processes, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/15/underground-cave-found-on-moon-could-be-ideal-base-for-explorers">The Guardian</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan police said they arrested on Monday a suspected serial killer who confessed to murdering 42 women, including his wife, and discarding their dismembered bodies in a Nairobi rubbish dump.</p>

<p>Since Friday, nine butchered bodies trussed up in plastic bags have been hauled from the site of an abandoned quarry in the Mukuru slum, a gruesome discovery that has horrified the nation.</p>

<p>Acting Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja said the 33-year-old suspect, named as Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, was arrested at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) near a Nairobi bar where he had been watching the Euro 2024 football final.</p>

<p>"We are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life," the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Mohamed Amin told reporters. "We are dealing with a vampire, a psychopath."</p>

<p>Amin said Khalusha claimed the murders took place between 2022 and July 11 this year.</p>

<p>"The suspect confessed to have lured, killed and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site," he added.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, and this is very sad, the suspect alleged that his first victim was his wife... who he strangled to death, before dismembering her body and disposing it at the same site."</p>

<p>Police said Khalusha would appear in court Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>'Luring another victim'</strong></p>

<p>The suspect was tracked down after analysis of one of the victim's mobile phones, Amin said, in a joint operation by the DCI and the National Police Service.</p>

<p>As officers swooped, "he was in the process of luring another victim", Amin said.</p>

<p>Khalusha had confessed to having had "carnal knowledge" with some of his victims, he added.</p>

<p>Officers searched his one-room house, located just 100 metres (300 feet) from where the bodies were found, discovering a machete, nylon sacks, rope, a pair of industrial rubber gloves -- as well as a "pink female handbag", and "two female panties".</p>

<p>The areas will remain "active crime scenes", Amin said, promising a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Nine mutilated and dismembered bodies have so far been retrieved from the crime scene, according to police, with Kanja saying autopsies on the victims would be carried out on Monday. Eight have been confirmed to be female.</p>

<p>A second suspect who was caught with a phone belonging to one of the victims has also been arrested, Amin said.</p>

<p>After the discovery of the bodies, Kenya's State Department For Gender and Affirmative Action on Sunday condemned the "horrific act" and urged more action against gender-based violence.</p>

<p>In 2022 the East African country recorded 725 femicide cases according to a UN report, the highest number since data collection began in 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Police under spotlight</strong></p>

<p>The dumped bodies have thrown yet another spotlight on Kenyan police and added more pressure on President William Ruto, who is struggling to contain a crisis over widespread anti-government protests that saw dozens of demonstrators killed.</p>

<p>Kenya's police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA), said Friday it was looking into whether there was any police involvement in the bodies found in the dump, noting the dumpsite was just 100 metres from a police station.</p>

<p>IPOA was also investigating if there had been a "failure to act to prevent" the grisly killings.</p>

<p>Kanja told reporters on Sunday that all officers at the nearby police post had been transferred.</p>

<p>Still, tensions ran high at the crime scene over the weekend, as volunteers combed through the vast piles of rubbish in search of more victims with officers briefly firing tear gas to disperse the crowds.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings or running hit squads, but few have faced justice.</p>

<p>The Mukuru killings follow the so-called "Shakahola forest massacre" when the bodies of some 400 members of a doomsday cult were discovered in mass graves near the coast last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 35 people were killed and 230 injured on Monday after heavy rain in eastern Afghanistan, a local official said.</p>

<p>"On Monday evening, rain caused by thunderstorms killed 35 people and injured 230 others in Jalalabad and certain districts of Nangarhar" province, Quraishi Badloon, head of the department of information and culture, told AFP.</p>

<p>The casualties were caused by heavy storms and rains that collapsed trees, walls and roofs of people's houses, Badloon said.</p>

<p>"There is a possibility that casualties might rise," he went on, adding that the wounded as well as victims' corpses were brought to Nangarhar regional hospital and Fatima-tul-Zahra hospital.</p>

<p>The tragedy comes after flash floods killed hundreds of people in Afghanistan in May and swamped agricultural lands in the country, where 80 percent of the population depends on farming to survive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new "high efficacy" malaria vaccine co-developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and the University of Oxford was officially rolled out on Monday when Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa became the first country to begin administering R21/Matrix-M.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new "high efficacy" malaria vaccine co-developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and the University of Oxford was officially rolled out on Monday when Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa became the first country to begin administering R21/Matrix-M.</p>

<p>The vaccine, which was granted World Health Organisation (WHO) approval last year, is said to have undergone a rigorous regulatory process and clinical assessment and was found to be highly effective and affordable. As a low-dose vaccine, it can be manufactured at speed and scale which is seen as critical to stemming the spread of the mosquito-borne disease.</p>

<p>"Reducing the malaria burden is finally within sight. Today's start of the R21/Matrix-M vaccine roll-out marks a monumental milestone after years of incredible work with our partners at Oxford and Novavax," said SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.</p>

<p>"At Serum, we believe that it is every person's right to have access to affordable and essential disease prevention. That's why we have committed to producing 100 million doses of R21, which will protect millions of lives and alleviate the burden of this deadly disease for future generations," he said.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the roll-out, SII said it has manufactured 25 million doses of the vaccine and is committed to scaling up to 100 million doses annually. In keeping with its aim of delivering vaccines at scale and low cost, the Pune-headquartered company said it is offering the vaccine at less than USD 4 per dose.</p>

<p>"The roll-out of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine marks the start of a new era in malaria control interventions with the high efficacy vaccine now accessible at a modest price and very large scale to many countries in greatest need. We hope that this vaccine very soon can be provided to all African countries who wish to use it," said Professor Adrian Hill, Director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University.</p>

<p>R21/Matrix-M was co-developed by the university and SII leveraging Novavax's Matrix-M adjuvant technology. In December 2023, WHO granted it prequalification status after trials demonstrated that the vaccine was well tolerated, with a good safety profile, with injection site pain and fever as the most frequent adverse events.</p>

<p>Although the number of malaria-related deaths has fallen from 3,222 in 2017 to 1,316 in 2020 in Cote d'Ivoire, the deadly disease still kills four people a day, mostly small children, and "remains the leading cause of medical consultations", according to the country's Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>A total of 656,600 doses have been received, which will initially vaccinate 250,000 children aged between 0 and 23 months across 16 regions of Cote d'Ivoire. The R21/Matrix-M vaccine has also been authorised by Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic.</p>

<p>R21 is the second malaria vaccine available in Sub-Saharan Africa following RTS,S and wide implementation of the malaria vaccines, in conjunction with existing prevention methods like bed nets, is expected to save tens of thousands of young lives each year. In total, 15 African countries are expected to introduce malaria vaccines with Gavi support in 2024, and countries plan to reach around 6.6 million children with the malaria vaccine in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>Dr Sania Nishtar, Chief Executive Officer of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said: "Africa has borne the brunt of malaria for far too long, and Cote d'Ivoire has suffered more than most. With two safe and effective vaccines now available alongside other interventions, we can finally turn the tide against this killer disease." John Jacobs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax, added: "The introduction of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine in Cote d'Ivoire marks a breakthrough in the fight to protect vulnerable children against a leading cause of death across the region while reinforcing our mission to create innovative vaccines that improve public health."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Under growing pressure for a massive security failure, the US Secret Service on Monday vowed to cooperate with an independent review after a shooter was allowed to open fire on Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was injured but survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania Saturday, a brazen attack that shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November vote.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service is working with all involved Federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again," the agency's director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President Biden yesterday and will participate fully. We will also work with the appropriate Congressional committees on any oversight action," Cheatle added.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when multiple bangs rang out. He clutched his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek, then ducked to the floor as Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounding him and rushing him to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>The shooter and a bystander were killed, and two spectators injured.</p>

<p>Biden ordered a full review of security at the rally, as well as at this week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump will be crowned the party's presidential nominee.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has been under growing pressure over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was allowed to take position on a roof some 500 feet (150 meters) from one of the most protected political figures on the planet.</p>

<p>And the questions grew louder when phone footage emerged of people sighting the gunman on the roof and trying to warn security before he opened fire.</p>

<p>With Trump set to appear at the convention Monday, Cheatle said the agency was working to toughen security at the event.</p>

<p>The Secret Service "designs operational security plans for National Special Security Events (NSSE) to be dynamic in order to respond to a kinetic security environment and the most up-to-date intelligence from our partners," her statement said.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Secret Service said it was "fully prepared" for the convention.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romania's parliament on Monday approved the culling of almost 500 bears this year in a bid to control the protected species' "overpopulation" after a deadly hiker attack sparked nationwide outcry.</p>

<p>Romania is home to Europe's largest brown bear population outside of Russia with 8,000, according to the environment ministry.</p>

<p>Bears have killed 26 people and severely injured 274 others over the last 20 years in the southeastern European country, the ministry said earlier this year.</p>

<p>After a young hiker was mauled to death on a popular trail in Romania's Carpathian Mountains, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu summoned lawmakers back from their summer recess to attend an emergency session of parliament.</p>

<p>As well as adopting legislation to control the brown bear population, the parliament held a moment of silence in the 19-year-old hiker's memory.</p>

<p>The law adopted Monday authorises the culling of 481 bears in 2024, more than twice last year's total of 220.</p>

<p>Lawmakers argued that the bears' "overpopulation" had led to an increase in attacks, while admitting that the law will not prevent attacks in the future.</p>

<p>But environmental groups have denounced the measure.</p>

<p>"The law solves absolutely nothing," World Wildlife Fund biologist Calin Ardelean told AFP, arguing that the focus should be shifted towards "prevention and intervention" as well as so-called "problem bears".</p>

<p>According to WWF Romania, culls will not remedy the problem unless measures are put in place to keep bears away from communities, such as better waste management or preventing people from feeding animals.</p>

<p>In 2023, about 7,500 emergency calls to signal bear sightings were recorded, more than double the previous year, according to data presented last week by Romanian authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the criminal case against the former president on charges of mishandling top secret documents, saying the way that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed was improper.</p>

<p>The decision is a huge victory for Trump, who had been accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>Judge Aileen Cannon made her ruling after lawyers for the 78-year-old argued for a partial stay of proceedings to allow for an assessment of a Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>"Former President Trump's Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on the Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith is GRANTED," Aileen wrote in her order.</p>

<p>"The Superseding Indictment is DISMISSED because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."</p>

<p>It comes as Trump is set to be anointed as his party's champion at the Republican National Convention, days after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In the Florida case, Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>

<p>He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.</p>

<p>Trump allegedly kept classified documents -- which included records from the Pentagon and CIA -- unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home and thwarted efforts to retrieve them.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that Russia should be represented at a second summit aiming to secure lasting peace with the Kremlin, after more than two years of war.</p>

<p>Dozens of world leaders voiced support for a just peace in Ukraine after a high-level summit convened by Zelensky last month in Switzerland, to which Russia was not invited.</p>

<p>"I believe that Russian representatives should be at the second summit," Zelensky told a press conference in Kyiv, where he laid out preparatory work for a follow-up summit.</p>

<p>Zelensky announced separate meetings on key issues, including energy security, to be held in Qatar and on food security in Turkey ahead of a second summit.</p>

<p>Leaders and top officials from more than 90 states gathered at a Swiss mountainside resort on June 15 for the two-day summit dedicated to resolving the largest European conflict since World War II.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said that any discussions around ending the conflict that did not include Russia were "absurd."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An anti-terrorism court here on Monday charged top Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a case involving the burning down of a police station during the May 9 violence last year.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi, 68, who was brought to Kot Lakhpat jail here from Adiala jail in Rawalpindi under tight security, has several cases related to May 9 violence, including arson, filed against him at the Shadman police station.</p>

<p>The court had summoned Mr Qureshi to initiate indictment proceedings against him and ordered the prosecution to present witnesses in the next hearing scheduled for July 22.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi, who was produced before ATC Judge Khalid Arshad, however, denied the charges.</p>

<p>"As Mr Qureshi was presented before the ATC judge, charges were framed against him for his alleged abetment in torching Lahore's Shadman police station. Mr Qureshi pleaded not guilty and maintained that a fake case has been instituted against him for being loyal to Imran Khan," a court official told Press Trust of India after the hearing.</p>

<p>The indictment of Mr Qureshi, who is also the vice-chairman of PTI, came hours before the Pakistan government announced its decision to ban Khan's PTI for its alleged involvement in anti-state activities.</p>

<p>The Lahore police had registered a case against several leaders and activists of the PTI on the charges of attacking and burning down the Shadman police station during the May 9 riots following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan by the Rangers in an alleged corruption case.</p>

<p>Besides this case, multiple cases related to the May 9 violence have been lodged against Mr Qureshi in Lahore alone.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi has been in prison since he and Mr Khan, 71, were sentenced by a Pakistani court to 10 years in jail for violating the Official Secrets Act by making a diplomatic cable public when the PTI founder was in power.</p>

<p>Though the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on June 3 acquitted Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi in the Cipher case, suspending their 10-year sentence, the two remain in jail as they are named in multiple cases in connection with the May 9 violence across Pakistan.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi was earlier this year indicted in eight more cases related to the May 9 violence.</p>

<p>The May 9 riots were triggered across the country after Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the 190-million-pound corruption case. He is currently facing over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.</p>

<p>Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were put behind bars for their involvement in violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, last year on May 9.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stating that terrorism is a major challenge faced by the world today, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has to play a major role in the region's security.</p>

<p>In an interview with Kazinform News Agency in Astana, Kazakhstan, the EAM said that SCO's priority is to fight against the three evils -- Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that the major challenge faced by the world today is terrorism. It has become a threat to regional and global peace, and it demands urgent action from all of us. In this aspect, I am happy that Kazakhstan during their Chairmanship have negotiated an updated program to combat terrorism, separatism, and extremism, which was adopted in Astana Summit," he said.</p>

<p>"Fight against the three evils- Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism- is a priority in SCO," EAM Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>He further said that some joint statements were adopted on theme during India's presidency of SCO last year.</p>

<p>Stating that Kazakhstan has also carried forward the spirit of that Joint Statement, Jaishankar also laid emphasis on the importance of implementation of these statements.</p>

<p>"During the New Delhi Summit last year, one of the two Joint Statements adopted was on 'Countering Radicalization leading to Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism'. The statements included various elements of radicalization -- including ideology, media campaigns, as well as radical and terrorist content on internet," the Foreign Minister said.</p>

<p>"Kazakhstan, during their Chairmanship, carried forward the spirit of that Joint Statement. The updated program to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism is critical and timely. But I want to emphasize that what is more important is the actual implementation of the program that we have now successfully drawn up, which includes unambiguous commitment by all the Member States in getting rid of all forms and manifestations of terrorism in the region, including cross-border terrorism," he further stated.</p>

<p>Jaishankar, represented India at the SCO Council of Heads of State (SCO Summit) held under Kazakhstan's Presidency in Astana.</p>

<p>He delivered remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The EAM also held several bilateral meetings and engagements with counterparts and other global leaders.</p>

<p>Emphasising SCO's role in the region's security, Jaishankar said SCO as an organization should be allowed to fully utilize its potential, and also highlighted the theme of SCO Summit 'Towards a SECURE SCO' in 2023 under India's presidency.</p>

<p>"In fact, India's priorities for the Chairmanship last year were on the theme 'Towards a SECURE SCO' -- with SECURE being an acronym which stands for Security, Economic cooperation, Connectivity, Unity, Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Environment," the Foreign Minister said.</p>

<p>"When we say regional security in the context of SCO, the most important issues that stand out is terrorism, including cross-border terrorism. Today, after decades of taking measures against terrorism in global forums, including through the UNSC, terrorism continues to be a threat to the region. The UN designated terror outfits are still functioning in the region," he added.</p>

<p>He further said that combating terrorism requires a very comprehensive approach, not just against the perpetrators of heinous acts of terrorism, but also against the facilitators, financiers and sponsors of terrorism.</p>

<p>"They all need to be identified and punished," he said.</p>

<p>Jaishankar said Regional Anti-Terrrorist Structure (RATS) has a reasonable standing to propose measures against terrorism in the region.</p>

<p>"We stand ready to strengthen SCO mechanisms in this front. I hope that the proposed Universal Centre to be established within the RATS in Tashkent, along with the other specialized centers under the Universal Centre, will grow to become foremost anti-terrorist structure in the region," he said.</p>

<p>Stressing on the need to build consensus, the Foreign Minister said any security related initiative or paradigm should be formulated taking into consideration territorial integrity and sovereignty of all the countries that will be involved</p>

<p>The Foreign Minister also elaborated on the threat of drug trafficking. He said there is a consensus on the establishment of Anti-Drug Centre in Dushanbe, Tajikistan and along with Universal Centre, it will be an effective weapon to combat drug trafficking.</p>

<p>"Drug Trafficking is another issue that we need to combat together, and is very closely related to two other issues in the region -- terrorism and stability in Afghanistan. There is a consensus on the establishment of Anti-Drug Centre in Dushanbe. This is a welcome move and is much needed. The Anti-Drug Centre, together with the proposed Universal Centre, will be an effective weapon in combating drug trafficking," Mr Jaishankar said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday said he was not concerned at the prospect of another Donald Trump presidency in the United States, despite indications his administration could be more sympathetic to the Kremlin.</p>

<p>A Trump victory in the US November elections would put into question Washington's continued support for Ukraine as the country struggles through a third year of fighting against Russian forces.</p>

<p>"I think that if Donald Trump becomes president, we will work together. I'm not worried about this," Zelensky said during a press conference in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The Republican Party candidate has suggested that he would end the conflict very quickly if he won back the presidency, which Kyiv fears would mean it would be forced to negotiate with Moscow from a weakened position.</p>

<p>Zelensky said that during his recent trip to the US for a NATO defence alliance summit he had met Republican governors and was assured of the party's backing.</p>

<p>"There are hawks whose messages are more right-wing or more radical," Zelensky told reporters.</p>

<p>"But I want to tell you that the majority of the Republican Party supports Ukraine and the people of Ukraine," he added.</p>

<p>Trump previously said during a debate with President Joe Biden that if elected, he would have the Ukraine conflict "settled" before he took office in January 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US researchers have decoded an element that could destroy cancerous cells, and advance treatment options for the deadly disease that claims millions of lives globally.</p>

<p>The element, actinium, was first discovered by French scientist Andre-Louis Debierne in 1899 and is number 89 on the Periodic Table.</p>

<p>Now after 125 years of its existence, there is a bright chance it could improve cancer treatments, as found by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>

<p>Even after 125 years, actinium remains an enigmatic element of science because to date it is found in extremely small quantities, and special facilities are needed to work with it, not just any ordinary radioactive lab.</p>

<p>The team of scientists tried growing it and while elements can behave very similarly to their lightweight counterparts, actinium behaved differently than its counterpart lanthanum.</p>

<p>From nuclear energy to medicine, these elements can serve the purpose admirably, for both are radioactive and earthy minerals, it is not actinium itself that saves the day, it is an isotope -- a distinct nuclear species of any element -- named actinium 225 that has shown promise in a method called targeted alpha therapy (TAT).</p>

<p>The TAT technique transports radioactive elements to the cancer site via biological delivery mechanisms such as peptides or antibodies.</p>

<p>When actinium decays, it emits energetic particles that travel a short distance, killing local cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue further away.</p>

<p>"If we can engineer proteins to bind the actinium with a high affinity, and either be fused with an antibody or serve as the targeting protein that would really enable new ways to develop radiopharmaceuticals." said Rebecca Abergel, Associate Professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California- Berkeley.</p>

<p>Researchers employed a revolutionary way to create the crystals with only 5 micrograms of pure actinium, which is about one-tenth the weight of a grain of salt and unnoticeable to the naked eye.</p>

<p>They initially refined the actinium using a complicated filtration method that removed other elements and chemical contaminants.</p>

<p>They next attached the actinium to a metal-trapping molecule known as a ligand and encased the bundle inside a protein identified and purified by Roland Strong's team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre, resulting in a "macromolecular scaffold."</p>

<p>The crystals, which grew for a week inside the Heavy Element Research Laboratory, were then cryocooled in liquid nitrogen and irradiated with X-rays at Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source.</p>

<p>X-rays revealed the compound's three-dimensional structure and demonstrated how this elusive element works with other surrounding atoms.</p>

<p>This study used the longest-living isotope of actinium, Actinium 227 although Actinium 225 is the preferred one for the Targeted Alpha method (as it has been used for prostate cancer as well with positive results).</p>

<p>The final word has not yet been said but the initial prose is the melodious beginning of a future scientific opera which would herald a new era of cancer treatment, the researchers said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Record immigration caused the population of England and Wales to rise by 610,000 to 60.9 million in mid-2023, the largest annual increase in 75 years, official data showed on Monday.</p>

<p>What statisticians term 'natural' population growth - the difference between births and deaths - fell to just 400, the lowest since 1978, while net international migration rose to 622,000, up from 548,500 in the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>A net 13,800 people also moved from England and Wales to Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Britain's Office for National Statistics said the population increase in England and Wales was the largest since 1948 when a post-World War Two baby boom and the return of British military personnel serving overseas caused a rise of 1.5 million.</p>

<p>The population for the whole United Kingdom was 67.6 million in mid 2022. Data for 2023 is not yet available.</p>

<p>Economic output has not kept up with the rising population. Based on provisional population figures, gross domestic product per head in 2023 was 0.7% lower than a year earlier.</p>

<p>Net migration to the United Kingdom hit a record 764,000 in 2022 and fell 10% to 685,000 in 2023, but is more than double its level in 2015, just before the Brexit referendum.</p>

<p>Reducing immigration was a key goal of many Britons who voted to leave the European Union.</p>

<p>Britain's previous Conservative government said it wanted to reduce net immigration, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party pledged in the election campaign to do so too by making the economy less reliant on foreign workers.</p>

<p>Post-Brexit changes to visas sharply reduced the number of EU migrants to Britain, but new work visa rules led to a surge in immigration from India, Nigeria and Pakistan, often to fill health and social care vacancies.</p>

<p>At the end of last year the government tightened rules to stop low-paid social care workers from bringing dependents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Stories created with help of ChatGPT are more creative compared to those by writers not using the tool, according to research. However, diversity in stories suffered with the use of AI.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stories created with help of ChatGPT are more creative, engaging their audience with more plot twists, compared to those by writers not using the tool, according to research.</p>

<p>However, researchers also found that diversity in stories by writers using generative artificial intelligence's (GenAI) suffered, therefore increasing the risk of "collective novelty".</p>

<p>GenAI can create content -- text, image, audio or video -- and is based on large language models, which are trained on massive amounts of text data and can, therefore, process, interpret and respond to requests in the natural language that humans use to communicate.</p>

<p>The authors of the study, published in the journal Science Advances, found that writers inherently more creative benefitted the least from ideas generated by ChatGPT, while those less creative became more creative due to ideas suggested by the GenAI model.</p>

<p>Therefore, AI "effectively equalised creativity" among all the writers, the team of researchers said.</p>

<p>"While these results point to an increase in individual creativity, there is risk of losing collective novelty. If the publishing industry were to embrace more generative AI-inspired stories, our findings suggest that the stories would become less unique in aggregate and more similar to each other," said study author Anil Doshi, assistant professor at the University College London's School of Management, UK.</p>

<p>For the study, 300 participants were tasked with writing a short, eight-sentence story (a 'microstory') for a target audience of young adults, of whom 600 were recruited to judge the writers' work.</p>

<p>The writers were divided into three groups. The first was allowed no help from AI, while the second was allowed to take one idea, along with the first three sentences of the story, created by ChatGPT for inspiration. The third group was allowed to choose from up to five AI-created story ideas.</p>

<p>The authors found that the work of writers taking the AI's help were over 8-9 per cent more novel, compared to that of writers not relying on the AI. Along with novelty, the microstories were judged for "usefulness" -- were they engaging enough for the audience, and could they be developed and potentially published?</p>

<p>The team also found that the less creative writers 'became' more so, with AI making their stories more novel by 10.7 per cent and more useful by 11.5 per cent, compared to the stories of writers not taking AI's help.</p>

<p>The AI made the work by less creative writers up to 26.6 per cent better, 22.6 per cent more enjoyable and 15.2 per cent less boring, the authors found.</p>

<p>The inherent creativity of the writers was measured using a psychological test -- Divergent Association Task (DAT).</p>

<p>Divergent thinking, which allows one to think of multiple solutions to a problem spontaneously, is known to be important to creativity.</p>

<p>Further, the authors found that among the writers using GenAI's ideas, the stories they produced were 10.7 per cent more similar, compared to the writers not using AI.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service is under fire over its most stunning failure in decades following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and several witnesses claiming that they had flagged the shooter to the officials before he took the shot are only adding to the crisis.</p>

<p>The questions facing the authorities are how a 20-year-old lone shooter was able to spot an exposed rooftop barely a football field away from the former president, assume the position, and take the shots, and why did officials not act despite several attendees pointing out the "shooter" on the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One "citizen journalist" Grant Godwin posted a video filmed by supporters at the Trump rally that showed the alleged shooter getting in position.</p>

<p>"Officer! Officer!" a person is heard calling out to the security officials posted nearby and another saying, "Yeah, someone is on the roof", and pointing to the alleged shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p>The "shooter" is seen climbing the roof of a shed, approximately just 400 ft, or less than 150 metres, from the stage where Trump was. He tries to stay down, crawling his way forward after getting on the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Someone's on top of the roof... Right there... You see him? He's laying down... Yeah, he is laying down," a person is heard saying. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Yeah, look, there he is..." said another.</p>

<p>Sharing the video on Instagram, Godwin wrote: "HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?! The amount of time the Secret Service and law enforcement had to neutralise this threat is ridiculous. I cannot wrap my head around this. You're telling me rally attendees noticed this guy way ahead of time, informed law enforcement, and still they didn't take this guy out before a shot was taken? Extremely concerning."</p>

<p>Reacting to the video, a user wrote: "I've seen better security at Foot Locker."</p>

<p>"So some random 20-year-old kid just is lucky enough to access the one spot to be able to have a clear shot of Trump? The only place they needed to secure? It makes no sense," said another.</p>

<p>"Walmart security could've taken that dude out," noted a third.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man, 52, from Wisconsin and his 23-year-old daughter died after getting lost in Utah's Canyonlands National Park and running out of water in extreme heat. They two were hiking at 100-degree Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius), according to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/utah-canyonlands-national-park-hikers-die-after-getting-lost-running-out-of-water-in-100-degree-heat/"><em>New York Post.</em></a></p>

<p>National Park Service rangers reported that on Friday afternoon, someone in Canyonlands' Island of the Sky neighbourhood texted 911 to San Juan County dispatchers. After receiving the emergency call, the officials of the Bureau of Land Management's Moab District Helitack searched for the father and daughter.</p>

<p>However, by the time the pair was found, they were already dead, according to the National Park Service.</p>

<p>The tragedy marks the most recent deaths in National Parks this summer. In Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, several hikers who were unprepared for temperatures in the triple digits died. A motorcyclist in California lost his life in Death Valley when the mercury reached 128 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Rangers from the National Park Service encourage people to hike with plenty of water and to avoid hiking in the afternoon when temperatures are at their highest.</p>

<p>A severe heat wave swept central to eastern parts of the United States in June, with several cities recording their highest temperatures in decades, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Experts warn that this heat wave could turn into a deadly weather event, labelling it the "silent killer."</p>

<p>Kristie Ebi, a public health scientist at the University of Washington who contributed to a United Nations special report on extreme weather, told PBS that in recent years, the heat "seems like it is coming faster and more severe than we expected."</p>

<p>The heat wave sweeping across much of the US is driven by what meteorologists call a "heat dome." This phenomenon involves a high-pressure system in the atmosphere that causes hot air to sink and compress, resulting in soaring temperatures at ground level. Approximately 80 million people across the US are experiencing sweltering conditions, with heat advisories or excessive heat warnings in place. Residents are urged to take precautions, stay hydrated and avoid prolonged exposure to the heat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

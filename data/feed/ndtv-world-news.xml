       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Hong Kong spent Rs 76 lakh ($90,028) earlier this year on a competition to rename two giant pandas, gifted by China, but ended up retaining the original names despite spending the huge sum. According to a report in the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3290596/hong-kong-spent-hk700000-panda-naming-contest-was-it-waste-money?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article" rel="noindex, nofollow">South China Morning Post </a>(SCMP)</em>, the giant panda renaming competition started in October where the public was invited to come up with fresh names for "An An" and "Ke Ke" -- the two bears, who arrived from Sichuan.</p>

<p>As per the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the taxpayer's money was spent to build a website for the activity, recruit staff, post advertisements on internet and Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations in addition to offering prizes to the winners.</p>

<p>The winner of the competition was awarded prizes worth Rs 5.16 lakh which included a tourbillon watch, valued around Rs 4 lakh and membership and vouchers for Ocean Park where the pandas are kept. Despite offering the prizes, the judges, who did not take any pay for their services, announced that the pandas would keep their original names.</p>

<p>Quizzed about the wastage of funds, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui said the authorities were not to know that the public would prefer keeping the original names.</p>

<p>Notably, the giant pandas in Hong Kong are usually named either after seeking suggestions from the public, or by keeping the names given to them while breastfeeding, or by adopting the names that were given to them by the authorities.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/giant-pandas-bao-li-qing-bao-flown-to-us-from-china-aboard-panda-express-6800580" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Giant Pandas Flown To US From China Aboard 'Panda Express'</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Giant pandas arrive</strong></h3>

<p>Male "An An" and female "Ke Ke" are both aged five, the equivalent of 15 in human years. The pair arrived in the country amid much fanfare in September when Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki and Tourism Minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung welcomed them at the Hong Kong International Airport in a glittering ceremony.</p>

<p>As per Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong, An An and Ke Ke could help bring in customers and generate revenue. “It is difficult to put a number on [costs] as it is more than just about the income or the park, or the profit or losses. We believe our social responsibility is strong,” Mr Pong <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3279984/hong-kongs-2-new-giant-pandas-and-ke-ke-touch-down-city-soon?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article" rel="noindex, nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>“Most importantly we want to bring people to the park, to buy tickets or annual passes to maintain a steady income flow,” he added.</p>

<p>The pandas were unveiled to the public last week with the park anticipating huge rush in the days leading up to Christmas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Undercover FBI agents were not present during the 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Donald Trump supporters, a Justice Department watchdog said Thursday in a report debunking a popular right-wing conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>"We found no evidence in the materials we reviewed or the testimony we received showing or suggesting that the FBI had undercover employees in the various protest crowds, or at the Capitol, on January 6," Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz said in an 88-page report.</p>

<p>Thousands of Trump supporters rushed in the US Capitol on January 6 in a bid to prevent congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's election victory.</p>

<p>Right-wing media and even some Republican lawmakers have spuriously claimed that undercover FBI agents provoked the attack on Congress, which followed a fiery speech by Trump in which he falsely claimed the election had been stolen.</p>

<p>The inspector general said that while no undercover FBI agents were present at the Trump rally or the Capitol, 26 FBI informants known as confidential human sources (CHS) were in Washington at the time.</p>

<p>Three of the informants had been tasked with reporting on domestic terrorist suspects while the others were there on their own.</p>

<p>"None of these FBI CHSs were authorized to enter the Capitol or a restricted area, or to otherwise break the law on January 6, nor was any CHS directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6," the report said.</p>

<p>The inspector general also said there had been an intelligence-gathering failure by the FBI ahead of the January 6 attack.</p>

<p>"While the FBI undertook significant efforts to identify domestic terrorism subjects who planned to travel to the Capital region on January 6," the report said, "the FBI did not take a step that could have helped the FBI and its law enforcement partners with their preparations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Specifically, the FBI did not canvass its field offices in advance of January 6, 2021, to identify any intelligence, including CHS reporting, about potential threats to the January 6 Electoral Certification," it said.</p>

<p>FBI deputy director Paul Abbate was quoted as saying this was a "basic step that was missed" in "understanding the threat picture prior to January 6."</p>

<p>Trump was impeached by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives following the attack on the Capitol, but acquitted by the Senate.</p>

<p>He is to return to the White House on January 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election.</p>

<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the assault on Congress. Trump has lauded them as "patriots" and "political prisoners" and pledged to pardon many of them when he returns to the White House.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[NASA's Perseverance Rover first landed in the Jezero Crater in February 2021.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover on Thursday (Dec 12) climbed atop Jezero Crater's rim at what the scientists have described as the "Lookout Hill" to reveal the mysteries of the Red Planet. Since first landing at the crater in February 2021, this is the first time that the rover has ventured outside to explore a region that is unlike anywhere it has investigated on the Red Planet. The rover took a little over three months and climbed 500 metres to reach the crater's rim where it is expected to analyse rocks that were deep inside the Martain surface.</p>

<p>"Status update: I've reached the rim of Jezero Crater! The ascent took 3.5 months and included 1,640 feet (500 m) of vertical climb. It was steep and slippery - but I'm built to do hard things," read a post by the rover on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>“During the Jezero Crater rim climb, our rover drivers have done an amazing job negotiating some of the toughest terrain we've encountered since landing,” <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/perseverance-rover/nasas-perseverance-rover-reaches-top-of-jezero-crater-rim/" rel="noindex, nofollow">said </a>Steven Lee, deputy project manager for Perseverance.</p>

<p>“They developed innovative approaches to overcome these challenges — even tried driving backward to see if it would help — and the rover has come through it all like a champ."</p>

<p>The Jezero Crater was formed 3.9 billion years ago due to a massive impact which meant Perseverance only examined rocks that were left there after the impact. However, outside the crater, the rocks buried under the Martain surface were thrown out, making them much older and suitable for potential life.</p>

<p>Since landing on Mars, Perseverance has completed four science campaigns viz., the "Crater Floor", "Fan Front", "Upper Fan" and "Margin Unit. Perseverance's fifth campaign is called the "Northern Rim" and in its first year, the rover will visit as many as four sites of geologic interest, collect samples and drive around 6.4 kilometres.</p>

<p>"The Northern Rim campaign brings us completely new scientific riches as Perseverance roves into fundamentally new geology," said Ken Farley, project scientist for Perseverance at Caltech in Pasadena.</p>

<p>After leaving Lookout Hill, Perseverance will slide down the other side of the rim called "Witch Hazel Hill". After the steep descent, the rover will turn towards "Lac de Charmes" -- a region located on the plains beyond the rim which is less likely to have been significantly affected by the formation of Jezero Crater.</p>

<h3><strong>Sign of life on Mars</strong></h3>

<p>In July this year, the rover discovered an intriguing rock sample, nicknamed "Cheyava Falls," which contains organic molecules and structures that could have been formed by microbial life.</p>

<p>''The rock exhibits chemical signatures and structures that could possibly have been formed by life billions of years ago when the area being explored by the rover contained running water,'' NASA said at the time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's new leadership said Thursday it was searching for missing US journalist Austin Tice and had secured the release of another American it said had been held by the ousted government.</p>

<p>In 2022, US President Joe Biden accused Syria of holding Tice, a freelance photojournalist detained near Damascus a decade earlier, and demanded that the government of Bashar al-Assad release him.</p>

<p>The transitional government, which took the helm in Syria after Assad's ouster on Sunday, said that "the search for American citizen Austin Tice is ongoing".</p>

<p>"We confirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the US administration to search for American citizens disappeared by the former Assad regime," the transitional government's department of political affairs added in a statement on Telegram.</p>

<p>In recent days, Syrian residents and armed men have broken into government prisons, freeing inmates, some of whom have spent decades behind bars.</p>

<p>The political department's statement said that another US citizen, Travis Timmerman, "has been released and secured".</p>

<p>Residents of the Al-Zyabiyeh neighbourhood of Damascus said they had found Timmerman wandering around without shoes.</p>

<p>"The municipality guard Mousa Rifai found him, so we brought him to our house and fed him and he slept for about an hour," said Ziyad Nedda.</p>

<p>"He was held in the Palestine Branch, he wouldn't stop saying it. 'I was held in the Palestine Branch in Damascus'," he said.</p>

<p>The "Palestine Branch", also known as Branch 235, was a prison operated by the Syrian intelligence services under Assad.</p>

<h3><strong>Release 'huge Christmas present'</strong></h3>

<p>According to US media reports, 29-year-old Timmerman was last seen in Budapest, Hungary, in early June.</p>

<p>His sister Pixie Rogers described his release as a "huge Christmas present" and said she "can't wait for that day" she is reunited with her brother.</p>

<p>Timmerman's mother "is very, very ecstatic...overwhelmed, and just beyond super excited with this information that we got today," Rogers told the US network CBS.</p>

<p>Tice was working for Agence France-Presse, McClatchy News, The Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets when he was detained at a checkpoint in Daraya, a suburb of Damascus, on August 14, 2012.</p>

<p>Last week, the missing journalist's mother, Debra, told reporters her son is believed to be alive and is being "treated well," without providing further details.</p>

<p>The rebel forces, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), appointed an interim prime minister on Tuesday to lead Syria until March.</p>

<p>Assad fled the country over the weekend, ending a half-century of his family's iron-fisted rule.</p>

<p>Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments including the United States, though it has more recently sought to moderate its rhetoric.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Space enthusiasts are in for a major cosmic event on Friday as NASA said that two aeroplane-sized asteroids -- 2024 XW15 and 2024 XC16 -- are all set to fly past Earth. Although the distances of the two asteroids were called "near misses," scientists at the US Space Agency said there was no risk to the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Asteroid 2024 XW15</strong></p>

<p>Measuring 210 feet, the asteroid 2024 XW15 is said to be similar to a large aeroplane. It was expected to approach the planet on Friday at 9:42 AM IST, travelling at a massive speed of 25,859 miles per hour.</p>

<p>It was to pass within 4,010,000 miles of the Earth, around 16 times the distance between the planet and the Moon. Experts said there was nothing to worry about.</p>

<p><strong>Asteroid 2024 XC16</strong></p>

<p>Another asteroid confirmed to fly past the Earth is 2024 XC16, which measures roughly 100 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>It's expected to move past the planet at the speed of 46,269 miles per hour, while its closest approach will be within 3,280,000 miles of the planet. While this distance is less compared with the asteroid 2024 XW15, it is considered far enough to ensure the safety of the planet.</p>

<p>Asteroids, like the 2024 XW15, are relics of the early solar system that dates back to 4.6 billion years. These space rocks help researchers and scientists understand the Earth's history and the cosmos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The potential risk posed by these asteroids is not hypothetical. There have been instances when their collision has led to devastating consequences. Among the highly popular examples is the asteroid which is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Such major events underscore the need to monitor these space rocks and keep track of their movements to understand their trajectories. Advanced monitoring plays a valuable role in the timely implementation of mitigation strategies, should any of these asteroids pose a risk.</p>

<p>Tracking the orbits of these asteroids gives critical data for planetary defence efforts.</p>

<p>Over the years, NASA has developed advanced tools to track near-Earth objects (NEOs). NASA-backed Jet Propulsion Laboratory has employed cutting-edge radar systems to analyse the path of asteroids. Missions such as OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 have been highly successful in bringing asteroid samples back to Earth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is donating $1 million to US President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund and the company will air the event on its Prime Video service, an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Prime Video represents an in-kind donation worth another $1 million, the spokesperson said. The donations were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>Amazon joins another tech giant, Meta Platforms, in donating to the January 20 Trump inauguration. Meta will also give $1 million, a company spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and executive chairman, will meet with Trump next week, the president-elect said on Thursday in an interview with CNBC.</p>

<p>Trump has criticized the coverage of his first term as president by the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos.</p>

<p>The Post decided not to endorse a candidate in the November presidential election. The decision blocked an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, according to National Public Radio.</p>

<p>Bezos defended the move not to issue an endorsement, saying in an opinion piece in the paper that "most people believe the media is biased" and the Post and other newspapers needed to boost their credibility.</p>

<p>Trump raised a record $106.7 million for his 2017 inauguration festivities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US couple was shot dead in the violence-plagued western Mexican state of Michoacan, state prosecutors said on Thursday, just after the country's president had wrapped up a meeting with security officials aimed at addressing a wave of violence.</p>

<p>Identified as Gloria A, 50, and Rafael C, 53, the couple was traveling in a pickup in the municipality of Angamacutiro when they were shot on Wednesday night, the attorney general's office in Michoacan said in a statement.</p>

<p>While the woman died at the scene, the man died shortly afterward of his wounds in the hospital, the statement added. It was not clear why the couple, who were married, had been targeted and investigations are ongoing.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman added that the woman, who had obtained US citizenship, and the man, who was born in the US to Mexican parents, had family and a home in Angamacutiro.</p>

<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October, has promised to replicate nationally the success she had as mayor of Mexico City in bringing down the sprawling capital's murder rate.</p>

<p>But her first two months in office have been marked by an outbreak of cartel violence in several hot spots.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Baba Vanga's 2025 predictions include a catastrophic war between the East and West, alien contact leading to a potential crisis, advancements in telepathy and nanotechnology, and significant scientific breakthroughs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Baba Vanga's 2025 Predictions: </strong>Vangelia Pandeva Gushterova, also known as Baba Vanga, was a blind Bulgarian mystic who died in 1996 at the age of 85. Even after her death, people all across the world are still fascinated by her prophecies. Called the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans,' Baba Vanga claimed that she lost her sight at the age of twelve and then developed the gift of prophecy. One of her most prominent forecasts was the September 11, 2001, attack on the Twin Towers in New York.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/baba-vanga-and-nostradamus-have-made-the-same-chilling-prediction-for-2025-war-in-6883428">Baba Vanga </a>made several chilling predictions for 2025, many of which suggest death and destruction. Her 2025 prophecies, which continue to intrigue people, include warnings of catastrophic global events. These forecasts are concerning because they appear to predict global unrest that might affect the entire planet. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/baba-vangas-predictions-for-2024-and-when-the-world-might-end-5368311">Baba Vanga</a>'s predictions are a subject of constant interest and concern due to her capacity to predict such occurrences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are a few of the Nostradamus of the Balkans' extremely outrageous but believable prophecies.</p>

<h3><strong>The destruction of Europe</strong></h3>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/baba-vangas-2025-predictions-warn-34290956?int_source=nba"><em>the Daily Star,</em></a> the mystic predicted war and the absolute destruction of the West-oh joy. She said, "As soon as Syria falls, expect a great war between the West and the East. In the spring, a war in the East will begin, and there will be a Third World War. A war in the East that will destroy the West." And in another prediction, she claimed, "Syria will fall at the feet of the winner, but the winner will not be the one." It's hard to argue about this one, given it's clearly happening in front of our own eyes.</p>

<h3><strong>Alien contact</strong></h3>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/baba-vangas-2025-predictions-warn-34290956?int_source=nba"><em>news portal, </em></a>Vanga warned: "Humanity will make contact with extraterrestrial life, possibly leading to a global crisis or apocalypse."</p>

<p>With the promise of Donald Trump releasing all files the United States Government holds on aliens when he gets into power, it's possible that this prediction is far more accurate than we'd like to believe.</p>

<h3><strong>Telepathy is not far off</strong></h3>

<p>Baba Vanga predicted that humanity would develop telepathy by 2025, allowing for direct mind-to-mind communication. This advancement, she believed, would revolutionise human interaction.Elon Musk's brain chip has already been making waves with a form of telepathy where a person controls technology, but could he finally crack a human-to-human version?</p>

<h3><strong>A year of scientific breakthroughs</strong></h3>

<p>Baba Vanga predicted 2025 would bring major scientific and medical breakthroughs, including advancements in telepathy and nanotechnology. However, she also cautioned about the potential dangers of misusing these technologies for destructive purposes, though her exact quotes are now unavailable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is working to get an American citizen found on Thursday in Syria out of the country and bring him home, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Jordan, where he held meetings to discuss the political transition of Syria.</p>

<p>In media reports, the man was identified as Travis Timmerman.</p>

<p>"In terms of American citizen who was found just today, I can't give you any details on exactly what's going to happen, except to say that we're working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria," Blinken told reporters in Aqaba, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But for privacy reasons, I can't share any more details about this," Blinken added.</p>

<p>CBS News reported that Timmerman identified himself as an American from Missouri and that he was freed from a prison earlier in the week after Syrian rebel groups ousted the country's longtime president Bashar al-Assad over the weekend.</p>

<p>Assad fled to Russia after a 13-year civil war and more than five decades of his family's autocratic rule, during which Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Following his ouster, Syrians flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees.</p>

<p>Blinken added that the efforts to locate Austin Tice, another US citizen who was abducted in Syria over a decade ago was still continuing.</p>

<p>"No update on Austin Tice, except to say that every single day, we are working to find him and to bring him home, making sure that the word is out to everyone that this is a priority for the United States," Blinken said.</p>

<p>Tice, a former US Marine and a freelance journalist, was 31 when he was kidnapped in August 2012 while reporting in Damascus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said on Sunday the US government believes Tice is alive. He has tasked his team with doing whatever it takes to bring Tice home, according to people familiar with the directive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forbes has unveiled its 21st annual list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women, a ranking of influential figures from industries such as business, entertainment, politics, philanthropy and policymaking. Among these global changemakers are three Indian women who have made remarkable strides in their respective fields.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at their profiles and achievements.</p>

<p><strong>Nirmala Sitharaman (#28)</strong></p>

<p>The number 28 on the list is Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman. In May 2019, Ms Sitharaman became the first woman to hold these roles full-time. She was reappointed after the general elections in June 2024. Tasked with managing India's nearly $4 trillion economy — the fifth largest globally — Sitharaman projects that the nation's GDP will soon surpass Japan and Germany, positioning India as the third-largest economy by 2027. An advocate for women's financial empowerment, she has championed initiatives supporting entrepreneurship, access to credit and financial literacy among women. Before entering politics, Ms Sitharaman held positions at the Agricultural Engineers Association in the UK and BBC World Service. She also served as a member of India's National Commission for Women.</p>

<p><strong>Roshni Nadar Malhotra (#81)</strong></p>

<p>Ranked 81st on the list, Roshni Nadar Malhotra is the Chairperson of HCL Technologies, one of India's leading IT services firms, and CEO of HCL Corporation. She oversees strategic decisions for the $12 billion enterprise founded by her father, Shiv Nadar, in 1976. Apart from her corporate achievements, Ms Malhotra is a trustee of the Shiv Nadar Foundation, focusing on transformative education and establishing some of India's premier institutions. She also founded The Habitats Trust, an initiative dedicated to conserving natural habitats and indigenous species. She has a background in journalism and holds an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management.</p>

<p><strong>Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (#82)</strong></p>

<p>Ranked 82nd in Forbes' Power Women list and 91st among India's richest individuals in 2024, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has earned her place as a trailblazer in biotechnology. She is the founder and chairperson of Biocon, a biopharmaceutical company she established in 1978. Over the years, Biocon has expanded into international markets, including the US, and operates one of Asia's largest insulin manufacturing facilities in Malaysia. Mazumdar-Shaw's accomplishments include Biocon Biologics' acquisition of Viatris' biosimilars business for $3.3 billion in 2022 and the IPO of Biocon-backed Bicara Therapeutics, which raised $362 million on Nasdaq in September 2024. Despite her initial aspiration to become a doctor, Ms Mazumdar-Shaw pursued a different path and emerged as one of India's most successful entrepreneurs. In 2019, she and her late husband, John Shaw, donated $7.5 million to the University of Glasgow to advance cancer research. Her company is also collaborating on antibody therapy for coronavirus variants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has slammed the US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over probes into Neuralink - a neurotechnology firm owned by the world's richest man - and the purchase of Twitter shares. His lawyer Alex Spiro has flagged over "six years of harassment" by the Commission and its staff and demanded to know from the chief of the SEC, Gary Clenser, who had directed these actions - him or the White House.</p>

<p>"These tactics and misguided scheme will not intimidate us. We reserve all rights," said a letter sent via Musk's lawyer to Clenser, who has already been facing Team Trump's wrath over his anti-crypto wrath. Sharing the letter on X, Musk said sarcastically, "Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?"</p>

<p>The letter said Musk had been served a settlement demand by the SEC staff, asking him to accept a monetary payment or face charges on numerous counts. It said the demand followed a directive from their superiors and that the charges would be brought imminently unless Musk accepted the demand.</p>

<p>The letter, however, did not mention what the charges may be and how they may impact companies owned by Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Musk said the SEC recently summoned him to record his testimony and threatened him with a process server if he did not cooperate. He said he "categorically refused".</p>

<p>This week, a probe was opened into Neuralink, the letter said.</p>

<p>"This series of events makes (it) clear that the Commission is not motivated to seek the truth but instead is engaged in an improperly motivated campaign against Mr Musk and the individuals associated with him," the letter said.</p>

<p>Clenser will step down as the SEC chief on January 20 with Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump had earlier said he would fire Clenser on his first day as President and end his administration's "anti-crypto crusade".</p>

<p>Musk, who earlier said he does not respect the SEC, has had a long history with the market regulator. In 2018, after Musk said he would take Tesla private but then admitted it would remain public, the SEC sued him over an online post stating he had "funding secured" to continue with the ownership move. Musk had paid $20 million to settle the case with the agency.</p>

<p>He had also stepped down as the chair of the Tesla board and agreed to have a lawyer supervise his posts on Twitter - a microblogging site that was later bought by him and went private.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Athos Salome, the self-proclaimed "Living Nostradamus," predicts an imminent World War III, fueled by a "global system collapse."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Athos Salome, known as the 'Living Nostradamus,' who has claimed in the past that four of his forecasts have become reality in 2024, including a looming asteroid threat. Now This 36-year-old Brazilian parapsychologist has predicted that he thinks World War Three is coming sooner than we think-but perhaps not in the way we'd expect, according to Daily Star.</p>

<p>Athos, who clearly predicted the Covid-19 pandemic, Elon Musk buying Twitter (now X), and the death of Queen Elizabeth II, has made a few predictions regarding the ongoing tensions around the world. He has previously suggested there might be a war coming over the next year. With conflicts in the Middle East and Russia and growing Western participation, the world now seems to be edging closer to war. However, Salome has hinted towards a battle of technology, rather than on the field.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/living-nostradamus-claims-four-prophecies-fulfilled-predicts-more-unforeseen-events-6564988"><strong>Also Read | 'Living Nostradamus' Claims Four Prophecies Fulfilled, Predicts More Unforeseen Events</strong></a></p>

<p>According to Salome's earlier forecasts, there would be numerous signs of war by the end of 2024. However, this might be more online than initially thought.</p>

<p>Salome told Daily Star, "This is not just a war of men, but of machines, and in this aspect what comes next. Russia has reached new levels of aggression towards Ukraine, firing an Oreshnik supersonic missile towards the city of Dnipro. At the same time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is ready to protect itself 'by any measure.'</p>

<p>"Loose talk and the employment of high-technology equipment to engage in the conflict are therefore without a doubt raising the sentiments of escalating the war."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of IndiGo passengers flying to or from Turkey are stranded for 24 hours due to what the airline has said an operational delay. These include passengers on at least four flights connecting Istanbul with Delhi and Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a press statement, the airline said apologised for the "inconvenience caused to the customers".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are aware of the delays on the IndiGo flight connections to Istanbul. We accord the highest priority towards customer convenience and out teams are available at all contact points to assist customers. IndiGo apologises for the inconvenience caused to the customers," the airline said.</p>

<p>Passengers took to social media platform X and LinkedIn to claim that the flight was first delayed and then cancelled without notice. One of the fliers Anushri Bhansali said the flight was delayed twice by and hour, then cancelled and finally rescheduled 12 hours later, leaving passengers stranded. While complaining of exhaustion and a fever, she also said fliers were not given any accommodation, meal vouchers or even approached by an IndiGo representative at the airport.</p>

<p>Another passenger Rohan Raja said that after the 6.40 am flight from Delhi was cancelled, people struggled amid the chilly weather as the airline provided no transport to the accommodations they were allegedly provided.</p>

<p>Scheduled to travel to Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Parshwa Mehta wrote the 8.15 pm was delayed to 11 pm and then pushed to 10 am the next day. Further, chaos ensued as there was no IndiGo announcement and the information was received from the Turkish Airlines crew.</p>

<p>"We were told we'd get lounge access at Istanbul airport as compensation. But the lounge was far too small to accommodate the huge number of stranded passengers. Many of us were left standing for hours without proper facilities. No alternative flights were offered, no proper communication was made, and to top it all off-no plans for reparations were shared," he wrote in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Mr Mehta, we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and will connect with you. ~Poulami</p>
— IndiGo (@IndiGo6E) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiGo6E/status/1867335198083625274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Hitting out at the airline's "blatant failure of basic customer service", Mr Mehta said every passenger is owed an apology and fair compensation.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the AirHelp Score report 2024 placed IndiGo among the world's worst airlines, ranking it 103rd among the 109 analysed. The report also ranked Air India at 61st and AirAsia at 94th.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luigi Mangione, who was arrested for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was never a client of the medical insurance company, a New York Police Department (NYPD) official said. According to the police, the 26-year-old Ivy League graduate may have killed the CEO due to the "size and influence" of the company, reported NBC.</p>

<p>Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fingerprints-shell-casings-new-evidence-links-luigi-mangione-to-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompsons-murder-7228754" target="_blank">Mangione</a> was aware of the company holding its annual investor conference at a Manhattan hotel on December 4 - the day of the crime.</p>

<p>"We have no indication that he was ever a client of United Healthcare, but he does mention that it is the fifth largest corporation in the US, which would make it the largest healthcare organisation in the country. So that's possibly why he targeted the company...He had prior knowledge that the conference was taking place on that date, at that location," Kenny told NBC.</p>

<p>Mangione shot the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-luigi-mangione-killed-unitedhealthcare-ceo-a-chronic-back-pain-link-7221725" target="_blank">UnitedHealthcare</a> CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 and was since then on the run. The University of Pennsylvania grad led the police on a five-day manhunt, following which he was arrested from a McDonalds in Pennsylvania. He is currently in custody and is facing multiple charges, including murder. Mangione was denied bail at an extradition hearing at the Blair County Courthouse in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The suspect was reportedly arrested with a manifesto where he accused health insurance companies of putting corporate greed over the well-being of people - which led to theories that he may have killed the CEO over disappointment with the insurance provider. The police also reportedly found some of Mangione's writings about wanting to use a gun to target a CEO of a big corporation.</p>

<p>The NYPD found a 3D-printed gun from Mangione - which matched three shell casings found at the crime scene. The 9mm shell casings reportedly had the words "delay", "deny" and "depose" written across them on each bullet - which were the title of a book criticising the insurance industry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Thursday released a long-awaited strategy for countering anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hate, up sharply since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, calling for urgent, continued work to reduce discrimination and bias.</p>

<p>The 64-page document comes weeks before the inauguration of former President Donald Trump, who imposed a travel ban on people from some majority Muslim countries during his first term that Biden rescinded on his first day in office.</p>

<p>It mirrors a comprehensive strategy to fight antisemitism released by the White House in September 2023, and comes more than a year after death of six-year-old boy Wadea Al-Fayoume, stabbed by a man who targeted him and his mother because they were Palestinian-American.</p>

<p>In a foreword to the strategy, Biden called the attacks on the Chicago boy and his mother "heinous acts" and noted a spike in anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hate crimes, discrimination and bullying that he called wrong and unacceptable.</p>

<p>"Muslims and Arabs deserve to live with dignity and enjoy every right to the fullest extent along with all of their fellow Americans," Biden wrote. "Policies that result in discrimination against entire communities are wrong and fail to keep us safe."</p>

<p>The Council on American Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, called the strategy "too little, too late" and faulted the White House for not ending a federal watchlist and "no-fly" list that includes many Arab and Muslim Americans.</p>

<p>The Trump transition team had no immediate comment on the strategy or whether it would support it.</p>

<p>Trump, who won support from some Muslim voters angry about Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza, has said he will ban entry to the US of anyone who questions Israel's right to exist and revoke visas of foreign students who are "antisemitic."</p>

<p>Tensions between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups surged on some US campuses after the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel, with human rights advocates warning of rising antisemitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Arab hate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi were indicted in a new corruption case on Thursday. The case, which is the third graft reference against them, revolves around the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set at a throwaway price, Dawn reported.</p>

<p>This development comes just a week after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and other leaders of his party were charged in connection with the attack on the army's General Headquarters in Rawalpindi during last year's May 9 protests.</p>

<p>Although Khan was granted bail in the case by the Islamabad High Court last month, he remains in prison due to multiple charges, dating back to his arrest on August 5 last year, as per Dawn.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Special Court Central-I Judge Shahrukh Arjumand presided over the proceedings at Adiala Jail, where Imran was presented. Bushra Bibi, who is on bail in the case, appeared with her counsel.</p>

<p>PTI founder and his wife, Bushra Bibi, have denied corruption charges brought against them. Subsequently, the court summoned the prosecution witnesses on December 18 to record their testimonies.</p>

<p>According to Dawn, this is Imran Khan's seventh indictment, the previous being on May 10, 2023 in the first Toshakhana case against him, in January in a second Toshakhana reference; in February in the Pakistan currency (PKR) 190 million corruption case; and recently over the GHQ attack.</p>

<p>While Khan's sentences in the previous two Toshakhana cases were suspended. He was also indicted in the cipher case on December 13, 2023 and the Iddat case in January, but was later acquitted in both cases.</p>

<p>The trial of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi in the PKR 190 million case has reached its final stage, with the couple testifying before an accountability court this week.</p>

<p>Notably, in the most recent case, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bulgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader including a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings at a low price, saying it caused significant loss to the exchequer.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday that Syrian civilians need to be protected after Ankara-backed Islamists overthrew the Damascus government.</p>

<p>The top US diplomat met late Thursday for more than an hour with Erdogan at a lounge at the airport of the capital Ankara, moments after the Turkish leader saw off Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban.</p>

<p>Blinken "reiterated the importance of all actors in Syria respecting human rights, upholding international humanitarian law, and taking all feasible steps to protect civilians, including members of minority groups", State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Turkey has emphasised its security concerns following the upheaval in Syria, where it has been fighting a Kurdish-led force that Washington backs as a key player in the fight against Islamic State (IS) group jihadists.</p>

<p>After years of stalemate, the Islamist movement Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group last weekend toppled Syria's iron-fisted leader Bashar al-Assad, a secular-oriented member of the minority Alawite community.</p>

<p>Blinken told Erdogan of "the need to ensure the coalition to defeat ISIS (IS) can continue to execute its critical mission", Miller said.</p>

<p>Speaking before his departure to Turkey on a stop in Jordan, Blinken acknowledged "real and clear interests" by Turkey about the PKK, the Kurdish fighters that Ankara links to Syrian Kurdish guerrillas.</p>

<p>"At the same time, again, we want to avoid sparking any kinds of additional conflicts inside of Syria," Blinken told reporters in Aqaba, Jordan.</p>

<p>"And part of that also has to be ensuring that ISIS doesn't rear its ugly head again. And critical to making sure that doesn't happen is the so-called SDF, the Syrian Democratic Forces, that we've been supporting," he said, referring to the Kurdish-led forces.</p>

<p>Blinken, who leaves office next month following Donald Trump's election victory, has called for an "inclusive" process to form Syria's next government, with respect for all communities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh and the United States will hold the Bangladeshi interim government accountable for ensuring the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, the White House has said.</p>

<p>"The security situation in Bangladesh has been difficult following the ouster of the former prime minister. And we have been working closely with the interim government to enhance the capability of their law enforcement and security services to deal with the challenge," White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said at a news conference on Thursday.</p>

<p>"We have been very clear in our engagement with all Bangladeshi leaders that protection of religious and ethnic minorities … security to all Bangladeshis regardless of religion or ethnicity. We want to hold them to that," Kirby said in response to a question.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, Indian Americans have held peaceful protests and marches in several cities, including in front of the White House, in Chicago, New York, SFO, Detroit, Houston and Atlanta, urging Biden to help stop alleged brutalities against the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi urged members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to address the issue of violence against minorities, primarily Hindus, in Bangladesh during the confirmation hearing of Senator Marco Rubio for the position of secretary of state.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Senator Rubio for the top diplomatic position. The date of his confirmation hearing has not been announced yet.</p>

<p>"As targeted violence against Hindus and other minorities continues amid the disorder in Bangladesh, I urge the members of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations to address this crisis directly during the upcoming hearings to confirm Senator Rubio as the next US secretary of state," Krishnamoorthi said.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, a large number of Indian-Americans held a march from the White House to the US Capitol over alleged attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Raising slogans like "We want Justice" and "Protect Hindus", the demonstrators urged the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration to ask the new government in Bangladesh to take steps to protect Hindus and also initiate action against those responsible for this.</p>

<p>"The Bangladeshi Hindu community and the larger Hindu diaspora from the Indian subcontinent have come in support of the Bangladesh Hindu community because there is continuing violence going on in Bangladesh, specifically in Chittagong and Rangpur area, as well as in some other parts of the country," said Utsav Chakrabarti of HinduACTion.

       <description><![CDATA[This week India crossed a major milestone as a top global investment destination. Latest data reveals that Foreign Direct Investment into India crossed a thousand-billion-dollar mark since the turn of the century.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week India crossed a major milestone as a top global investment destination. Latest data reveals that Foreign Direct Investment into India crossed the thousand-billion-dollar mark since the turn of the century, showing how India has been the favoured destination for foreign investors.</p>

<p>The data released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade or DPIIT showed that the cumulative amount of FDI, including equity, reinvested earnings and other capital, stood at USD 1,033.40 billion (or $1 trillion) between April 2000 and September 2024.</p>

<p>To get a perspective of just how gigantic a trillion dollars really is, let's take this simple example - If a person was to earn one dollar (Rs. 84) per second (i.e. a trillion dollars in trillion seconds) - then it would take the person 11.5 days to earn a million dollars. But here's where is gets interesting. Continuing to earn a dollar a second, it would take the person 31.7 years to reach the billion-dollar mark, and a staggering 31,709 years to reach the trillion-dollar figure.</p>

<p>Another thought-provoking way to look at this is that India, which is the fifth largest global economy, has an overall GDP of around $3.89 trillion in 2024. It used to be around $2 trillion in 2014. Now compare that to the FDI inflow of $1 trillion in the last two decades.</p>

<h2><strong>SOURCE OF THE FDI</strong></h2>

<p>So, where did all this investment come from? Which are the countries from which these investments flowed in? One might assume that the top spot would be either the US, which is the largest economy in the world, or perhaps China, which is the second-largest economy globally. But it's neither.</p>

<p>The country which has contributed the most in terms of FDI in India during this period is Mauritius - a massive 25 per cent of all FDI inflows came via this route. Mauritius was closely followed by Singapore at 24 per cent. The United States of America came a distant third with 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Other countries which have invested significantly in India include The Netherlands at 7 per cent, Japan at 6 per cent, The UK at 5 per cent, UAE at 3 per cent, and the Cayman Islands, Germany, and Cyprus all accounting for 2 per cent each.</p>

<h2><strong>SECTORS WHICH SAW BIG INVESTMENT</strong></h2>

<p>The sector which saw the highest investment was the services and allied sector. There was significant investment in computer software and hardware, telecommunications, trading, construction, infrastructure development, automobile, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.</p>

<h2><strong>FDI INFLOWS ON THE RISE</strong></h2>

<p>Of the 1,033 billion dollars, USD 667.4 billion came in the last ten years between 2014 and 2024 showing a 119 per cent uptick in investment when compared to the previous decade. The data also revealed that FDI inflows have come for nearly 60 sectors across 31 states and union territories in India.</p>

<p>To attract more investment over time, India has also made its investment policies liberal and lucrative. Reforms have resulted in most sectors, barring ones of strategic importance, see 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.</p>

<p>Giving impetus to the 'Make in India' initiative, the manufacturing sector has seen a 69 per cent rise in FDI in the last ten years as compared to the prior ten.</p>

<h2><strong>WHICH SECTORS ARE OPEN AND WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE</strong></h2>

<p>FDI is allowed through the automatic route in most of the sectors, while in areas like telecom, media, pharmaceuticals and insurance, government approval is required for foreign investors.</p>

<p>Under the government approval route, a foreign investor has to get a prior nod from the ministry or department concerned, whereas, under the automatic route, an overseas investor is only required to inform the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after the investment is made.</p>

<p>At present, FDI is prohibited in some sectors. They are lottery, gambling and betting, chit funds, Nidhi company, real estate business, and manufacturing of cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes using tobacco.</p>

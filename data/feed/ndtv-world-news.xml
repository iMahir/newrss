       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The killing of Hezbollah's powerful leader Hassan Nasrallah a month ago has marked a fundamental shift for the Iran-backed Lebanese movement and revived calls for it to surrender its vast weapons arsenal.</p>

<p>"The death of Nasrallah marked the end of an era," said analyst Sam Heller of the US-based think tank Century Foundation.</p>

<p>After decades at the helm, Nasrallah's death "will necessarily mark a shift for the organisation", Heller added.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's influence extended far beyond his loyal Shiite Muslim support base in Lebanon.</p>

<p>He was a key pillar in Iran's "axis of resistance" against the United States and Israel, which includes other armed groups in the Middle East as well as Syria.</p>

<p>Israel dealt Hezbollah a seismic blow when it assassinated Nasrallah on September 27 in a huge air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs that has thrust the movement into a new age.</p>

<p>Hezbollah was already mired in a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with Israel, which it began in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas after the October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>Last month, Israel ramped up strikes on Hezbollah strongholds and sent in ground forces while killing one member of the group's top leadership after another.</p>

<p>Nasrallah, who had led the group since 1992, spearheaded operations against Israel for decades, and gained cult status among his supporters during the 2006 war.</p>

<p>According to Heller, "he was the foremost decision-maker in the organisation as it rose to prominence in Lebanon and regionally."</p>

<p>The group's governing Shura Council has yet to appoint a successor.</p>

<p>Hashem Safieddine, a cleric tipped for the post, was killed by Israel just days after Nasrallah.</p>

<p><strong>Home turf</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah is now run by a group of leaders, according to its deputy head Naim Qassem.</p>

<p>Lebanese officials, including Prime Minister Najib Mikati, have said that their contact with the group has been cut off for weeks.</p>

<p>Nabih Berri, Lebanon's parliament speaker who heads the Hezbollah-allied Amal Movement, is tasked with speaking on the group's behalf, Qassem said in a recent speech.</p>

<p>Berri is believed to be pushing for a ceasefire, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had long linked a ceasefire in Lebanon to an end to fighting in Gaza, a position it has yet to formally reverse.</p>

<p>Even with the group appearing on the back foot, its fighters continue to fire dozens of rockets daily into Israel, some reaching major cities like Haifa and Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>This week, Hezbollah claimed a drone strike on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in the coastal town of Caesarea.</p>

<p>The group says Israeli forces have not been able to take full control of any village in Lebanon, weeks into a ground invasion.</p>

<p>Israeli forces operating in Lebanon "face very fierce resistance and are forced to retreat under heavy blows", said a source close to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The maximum depth the Israelis have reached is estimated at about two kilometres (1.2 miles)," said the source, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, he said, has the advantage because it is fighting on its own terrain, knowing which "trees and rocks" to hide behind.</p>

<p><strong>'Disarm'</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah is widely believed to be better armed than Lebanon's national military, and remains the only group that did not surrender its weapons after the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

<p>After years of dominating political life in Lebanon, Hezbollah is facing new calls from its critics within the country to change.</p>

<p>Lebanese computer engineer Elie Jabbour told AFP he believes the only way forward is for Hezbollah to give up its weapons.</p>

<p>"The war cannot end before Hezbollah is disarmed," he said.</p>

<p>"When that happens, it can join state institutions as a political party only," said the 27-year-old.</p>

<p>A ceasefire in Lebanon has been tied to the implementation of a UN resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.</p>

<p>UN Security Council Resolution 1701 states that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should deploy in areas south of the Litani River -- an area Hezbollah has long operated in.</p>

<p>But Lebanon is grappling with a prolonged crisis, leaving the country rudderless until a president is elected after a two-year void.</p>

<p>Many in Lebanon blame Hezbollah for blocking the vote.</p>

<p>Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces party and a longtime Hezbollah opponent, said any new president must not "leave any group or weapon outside the framework of the state".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Thursday that only the state should carry weapons.</p>

<p>But in a country long wracked by division, attempts to "marginalise Hezbollah politically will... invite a violent response" from the group, Heller said.</p>

<p>It "will end in intra-Lebanese conflict," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Ukraine launched a ground assault into Russia's Kursk region in August, President Vladimir Putin promised to quickly "dislodge" Kyiv's forces and return normality to local residents.</p>

<p>But nearly three months later, signs of the conflict are still found everywhere in the region's capital, despite Russia claiming it is clawing back ground from Ukrainian troops.</p>

<p>School buildings in Kursk have been fortified with sandbags, while many windows are sealed with tape due to the risk of Ukrainian attacks.</p>

<p>Displaced people fleeing fighting near the border are regularly seen gathering at aid centres and some residents say they live in fear of aerial bombardment.</p>

<p>"You cannot show fear to your children. Because if you are afraid and they realise it... they become scared," said 36-year-old Margarita Kotova.</p>

<p>The mother of three said her daughter's school lessons were often interrupted by air raid sirens, and that state media was glossing over the impact of the conflict.</p>

<p>"If you watch Russian and Kursk news, we are doing well, everything is great, everything is going according to some plan you don't understand," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"We were not told for a long time what was happening on our border," she said, adding that she now used social media to find out "how things really are".</p>

<p>Russia says it is "achieving the goals" of its two-and-a-half-year offensive in Ukraine, but this statement rings hollow for many in a city home to thousands of internally displaced people.</p>

<p><strong>'Everyone is fed up'</strong></p>

<p>At an aid centre in Kursk, Oksana Barsukova appeared glum as she queued for supplies.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old nursing assistant was told she could return to her home near the border within "three days" of fleeing Ukraine's offensive.</p>

<p>But like thousands of others, she remains displaced by fighting, with little idea of when she can go back.&nbsp;"We left everything, and came here in the clothes we were wearing," the mother of three said.</p>

<p>When she and her family tried going back home, they found its windows were shattered and "everything was broken".</p>

<p>They quickly left after hearing shooting.</p>

<p>In the city, many residents go about their day as usual and passers-by give no reaction when an air alert sounds.</p>

<p>Residents said they had adapted to the grim reality of the conflict.&nbsp;"At school during a missile threat, they sit in the corridors, or go down to a shelter if the school has one," Kotova said.</p>

<p>School principal Marina Starikova said pupils had become "used to the sirens".&nbsp;"Everyone is fed up," said 27-year-old gym teacher Vladimir Kuroptev, who was displaced by Kyiv's offensive.</p>

<p>He hopes the conflict will be over soon, but does not know when.&nbsp;"Not this year, of course, but in a year or two, everything will be over."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Friday said the international community must speed up efforts for a political solution to end the fighting in Lebanon and prevent a "conflagration".</p>

<p>In a statement released the day after a conference on aid for Lebanon in France, Borrell said the first step needed was a "ceasefire" between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"We are currently engaged in a race against time between the possible start of a political process in Lebanon and a generalised conflagration with incalculable consequences," Borrell said.</p>

<p>"Without a suspension of hostilities, nothing will be possible," he said.</p>

<p>Borrell said once fighting was halted, Lebanon needed to organise long-postponed presidential elections "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>He said the Lebanese Armed Forces must become the "only military force present" in the south of the country, where Israel is engaged in ground battles with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>A UN peacekeeping mission in the area must also be strengthened, he said.</p>

<p>International calls for an end to fighting have so far failed to end the fighting in the region.</p>

<p>The Paris conference on aid for conflict-stricken Lebanon raised around $800 million for humanitarian aid but saw little diplomatic progress.</p>

<p>Israel has been at war with Hezbollah in Lebanon since late last month, in a bid to secure its northern border after nearly a year of cross-border fire from the Iran-backed armed group.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began low-intensity strikes on Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, the deadliest in its history.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of war in Gaza sparked by the attack, Israel expanded its focus to Lebanon and last month launched a massive bombing campaign targeting mainly Hezbollah strongholds across the country, sending in ground troops on September 30.</p>

<p>The war in Lebanon has killed at least 1,580 people, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[North Korea has been accused of sending thousands of troops to Russia, potentially to take part in the war in Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has been accused this week of sending thousands of troops to Russia, potentially to take part in the war in Ukraine, in a step that could bring the isolated country's first large-scale military deployment overseas since the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>Here is what we know about Pyongyang's past military co-operation with other countries:</p>

<p><strong>Vietnam</strong></p>

<p>North Korea sent more than 1,000 soldiers to North Vietnam between 1966 and 1972, including hundreds of pilots who flew MiG-17s in combat, according to a book published in 2017 by the South Korean defence ministry's Institute for Military History.</p>

<p>The North's air force shot down at least 26 U.S. planes and lost 14 of its own personnel from 1967 to 1969, a retired Vietnamese air force official told the country's People's Police newspaper.</p>

<p>Another team of North Korean psychological warfare specialists was also deployed to support North Vietnam's propaganda and abduction operations targeting South Korean troops in South Vietnam, while dozens of Vietnamese guerrillas were trained in North Korea, the South Korean book said.</p>

<p>But relations have cooled since Vietnam began embracing the West, launching political and economic reforms in the late 1980s and establishing diplomatic ties with South Korea in 1992.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt</strong></p>

<p>During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, North Korea sent a group of about 1,500 military advisers and some 40 air force personnel to Egypt, following a military assistance pact between its late leader Kim Il Sung and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, said Niu Song, a professor at Shanghai International Studies University.</p>

<p><strong>Libya</strong></p>

<p>North Korea fostered military exchanges with Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, clinching a 10-year alliance treaty in 1982, which called for either to render military aid if the other was attacked and threatened by a third country.</p>

<p>A declassified 1982 CIA cable said Pyongyang might have been seeking to turn Libya into an "out-of-country storehouse" for its military, citing past reports about North Korean pilots and training on MiG-23s there, while laying the groundwork to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Syria</strong></p>

<p>Syria is a longtime friend of North Korea, working jointly on missiles and chemical weapons. The North also built a plutonium reactor there, destroyed by an Israeli strike in 2007.</p>

<p>In 2013, Israeli media said several North Korean helicopter pilots and artillery officers were operating in Syria, though Pyongyang's state news agency denied providing military aid.</p>

<p>In 2016, Russia's TASS state news agency said two North Korean military units were fighting in Syria's civil war for President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p><strong>Iran</strong></p>

<p>Both subject to U.N. sanctions, North Korea and Iran have also been suspected of co-operating on nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, exchanging technical expertise and components.</p>

<p>In 2015, an exiled Iranian dissident group that exposed the country's Natanz nuclear facility in 2002, said a delegation of seven North Korean nuclear and missile experts visited a military site near Tehran, their third such exchange that year.</p>

<p>U.N. monitors in 2021 revealed that the countries had resumed co-operation to develop long-range missiles, transferring critical parts.</p>

<p>North Korea has also been accused of supplying weapons to Iran's proxies, including Hamas, whose fighters were seen using its grenade launchers in their 2023 attack on Israel, which was denied by Pyongyang.</p>

<p><strong>Africa</strong></p>

<p>North Korea has had longstanding ties with authoritarian regimes in Zimbabwe, Uganda and elsewhere in Africa since the Cold War era, engaging in arms sales and military training.</p>

<p>In 2011, a South Korean lawmaker said North Korea had more than 100 rounds of arms sales talks between 1999 and 2008 with countries such as Angola, Congo, Libya, Tanzania and Uganda, citing confidential government data.</p>

<p>The transactions aimed at earning dollars to buy newer weapons and parts from Russia by selling old, cheap conventional ones in Africa, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy of South Korea's national intelligence agency.</p>

<p>But North Korea's relations with many African partners have waned over the past decade since facing tighter U.N. sanctions, with Botswana severing diplomatic ties in 2015 and Uganda and Ethiopia halting security exchanges in 2016.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hailed the strengthening ties between India and Germany, citing recent collaborations as evidence of their deepening friendship.</p>

<p>Speaking at the 18th Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business 2024, PM Modi said, "On one hand, the CEO Forum meeting is being held here, on the other hand, our navies are practising together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>German naval ships are on a port call in Goa. And in a short while from now, the seventh inter-governmental consultations between India and Germany are also to be organized.</p>

<p>"That is, the friendship between India and Germany is deepening at every step, on every front," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that this year marks the completion of 25 years of India-Germany strategic partnership and added that the next 25 years are going to take this partnership to new heights.</p>

<p>"This year is the 25th year of India-Germany Strategic Partnership. The next 25 years are going to take this partnership to new heights. We have prepared a roadmap for a developed India in the coming 25 years," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi welcomed the release of the "Focus on India" document by the German Cabinet, which outlines how two strong democracies and leading economies can cooperate for global good.</p>

<p>"I am happy that at such a crucial time, the German Cabinet has released the Focus on India document. The Focus on India document is a blueprint of how the world's two strong democracies, the world's two leading economies, can together become a force for global good. It clearly reflects the approach and commitment to take the strategic partnership forward in a holistic manner. The trust that Germany has shown in India's skilled manpower is especially amazing," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi also expressed confidence that Germany's decision to increase visas for skilled Indians will boost its growth.</p>

<p>"Germany has decided to increase the number of visas given to skilled Indians every year from 20 thousand to 90 thousand. I am confident that this will give a new impetus to Germany's growth," he said.</p>

<p>"Our mutual trade has reached a level of more than 30 billion dollars. Today, on one hand, hundreds of German companies are in India, while Indian companies are also rapidly increasing their presence in Germany. Today, India is becoming the biggest centre of diversification and de-risking. India is also becoming a hub of global trade and manufacturing. In such a situation, this is the most appropriate time for you to Make in India, Make for the World," PM Modi said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the strategic partnership between India and Germany has emerged as a strong anchor at a time when the world is faced with tensions, conflicts and uncertainty.</p>

<p>Participating in the Seventh Inter-Governmental Consultations with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Prime Minister Modi said India-Germany ties were a transformational partnership of two capable and strong democracies and not a transactional relationship.</p>

<p>"The world is passing through times of tensions, conflicts and uncertainty. In the Indo-Pacific region, there are serious concerns about the rule of law and freedom of navigation. In times like this, the strategic partnership between India and Germany has emerged as a strong anchor," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>The prime minister recalled that this was Chancellor Scholz's third visit to India and marked the "triple celebration" of the friendship between India and Germany.</p>

<p>"In the last IGC in Berlin in 2022, we took important decisions for our bilateral cooperation. In two years, there has been encouraging progress in various sectors of our strategic relations. There has been increasing cooperation in areas such as defence, technology, energy, green and sustainable development that have become symbols of mutual trust," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>The prime minister also welcomed the 'Focus on India' strategy announced by Germany.</p>

<p>"I am delighted that to expand and elevate our partnership, we are taking several new and important initiatives and moving from the 'Whole of Government' to the Whole of Nation approach," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>The IGC framework was launched in 2011 and allows for a comprehensive review of cooperation and identification of new areas of engagement between the two countries across various sectors.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former adult film actor Mia Khalifa has come under fire on social media for mocking US military service members. In a video posted to her X account, Ms Khalifa said she hoped that US Army members get "their little brains all scrambled up" for fighting war overseas. "Good morning to everyone who is not in the US military," she starts the clip. "Good morning to everyone who is sitting at home and not on soil that doesn't belong to them, fighting a war for a country that doesn't care about them," she adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I hope you go over there and get your little brain all scrambled up with PTSD and come back here and see how much the United States cares about you, pookie!" <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/miakhalifa/status/1848707600591778102">Ms Khalifa mockingly says</a> in a baby voice, adding, "See how much they care about you when you come back."</p>

<p>The former film star then adopts a tone of fake crying, adding, "'Oh, I'm so sad, I p****** my pants every time I see a falafel stand in Manhattan.'"</p>

<p>"Let's see how much the VA cares about you. Let's see what they tell you to do with your little broken brain from going over to fight a war that's not yours. They're going to try to tell you to do breathing exercises because the US government does not give a f*** about you, once you cannot die for them. Once you're done, once you're a shell, they don't care about you," she concludes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Khalifa shared the video a few days back. Since then it has amassed more than 1 million views and over 23,000 likes. In the comments section, several users criticised her for mocking the US military service members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People don't care about you for what COMES OUT of your mouth," wrote one user. "Like they care about what a former camgirl thinks. They'll be busy watching you embarrass yourself on their spare time. It really sucks that you made those choices, you could've been in advocacy or something that would've stopped this war," commented another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Stick to what you know.. Leave the wartime decisions to the adults," said a third user. "It's fair to have an opinion on any violent conflict in the history of the world. &nbsp;Wishing PTSD upon U.S. soldiers is sick and disgusting," expressed another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, last year, the former adult star came under fire for saying the US army is "worse than OnlyFans". &nbsp;She made the comparison in July 2022 during an appearance on the late-night talk show Ziwe in the US, and then reshared the clip in November last year on Veterans Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has also been outspoken on social media defending Palestinians and making jokes about the October 7, 2023 attacks. On that day, as the terrorist attacks against Israel were still unfolding, Khalifa wrote, "Can someone please tell the freedom fighters in Palestine to flip their phones and film horizontal?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Khalifa's posts sparked a wave of outrage on social media, resulting in her getting fired from both the adult magazine Playboy and a business deal with Canadian broadcaster and radio host Todd Shapiro.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US election takes a detour from the swing state circuit to decamp to Texas on Friday as Kamala Harris rallies with pop superstar Beyonce and Donald Trump sits down with the world's biggest podcaster.</p>

<p>Solidly Republican Texas makes an unorthodox stop just days before November 5, especially for Harris who could be working to revive her momentum in the battleground states set to decide the vote.</p>

<p>But the Democratic team is gambling that its star-studded show -- also featuring country legend Willie Nelson -- will highlight Republican restrictions on abortion, a key part of Harris's platform against Trump.</p>

<p>Beyonce's backing for Harris comes on top of an endorsement from Taylor Swift and campaign appearances from artists including Lizzo, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Eminem and Usher.</p>

<p>The "Crazy in Love" singer will appear alongside Harris in Houston, while Trump will be in Austin, taping an interview with Joe Rogan, who hosts the most listened-to podcast globally.</p>

<p>November's presidential election will be the first held after a 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned nationwide protection of abortion.</p>

<p>In her campaign, Harris has repeatedly linked Trump -- who took credit for the abortion ruling after reshaping the court -- to shocking stories of women who have been denied vital reproductive health care.</p>

<p>Texas now prohibits all abortions except in rare cases.</p>

<p><strong>Viral moments</strong></p>

<p>Friday's show will mark Beyonce's first appearance with Harris, although the 32-time Grammy Award-winner has performed for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Harris got permission to use the singer's anthem "Freedom" and it has been the leading soundtrack of her push for the White House.</p>

<p>Both election candidates have sought to broaden their support by sidestepping traditional media in favor of podcasts and YouTube shows consumed by uncommitted young voters who could make all the difference in a tight vote.</p>

<p>Trump will woo Rogan's massive audience, seeking viral moments that tap into his everyman appeal similar to his recent photo-op at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.</p>

<p>"The Joe Rogan Experience" was the world's most listened-to podcast on streaming giant Spotify in 2023, for the fourth year running. It has 17.5 million subscribers on YouTube, and the most popular episode has been viewed 61 million times.</p>

<p>The final night of the Republican National Convention -- featuring Trump's keynote speech -- was televised by 14 networks and yet didn't get close to half that figure, notching 25 million viewers.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said he would also deliver remarks to the press in Austin on border security and migrant crime before heading to a rally back in the swing states, in closely watched Michigan.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's financial leaders are gathered in Washington, ostensibly to discuss technical stuff: debt, inflation, interest rates. What's really on their minds is Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The ex-president's potential return to the White House has loomed large over this week's annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. At public seminars and panels, or behind closed doors at steak-house dinners, discussion kept turning to the vote that's less than two weeks away.</p>

<p>“Everybody is talking about the US election and waiting with bated breath,” Malaysia's second finance minister Amir Hamzah Azizan said in an interview.</p>

<p>That's because of the starkly different visions the two candidates are offering for the world's biggest economic power, which some officials speak of alongside top risks to global stability such as wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a modal window.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris mostly represents continuity, while Trump is threatening to upend global trade even more than he did in his first term, by slapping tariffs of 60% on China and as much as 20% on everyone else.</p>

<p>The outcomes for policy are far enough apart as to be a source of “high uncertainty,” in the words of one top IMF official, at a time when the world economy is otherwise on track for a soft landing and investors are generally upbeat.</p>

<p>“Markets hate uncertainty, and the biggest uncertainty of them all is hanging over these meetings: Who will be the next president of the United States?” said Josh Lipsky, director of the Washington-based Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center. “It matters for everyone.”</p>

<p><strong>Kamala Harris, Donald Trump</strong></p>

<p>On the meeting's sidelines, there were plenty of events for attendees absorbed by the election guessing game.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hosted a client dinner keynoted by star pollster Nate Silver. The Institute of International Finance had Mike Pompeo, who served as Trump's secretary of state, among its dinner guests. At a JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. investor seminar, with one session titled “Is a Trump Win Inevitable?”, speakers on the agenda included Jim Messina, deputy chief of staff in the Obama administration, and senior Trump adviser Scott Bessent.</p>

<p>Financial diplomats were generally careful not to sound like they favored one candidate over the other. And most tried to avoid even mentioning Trump by name.</p>

<p>Still, some sought to paint a sanguine picture regardless of who's elected — highlighting the resilience of the US economy and the fact that Trump's first term already offered guidance about how to negotiate with him.</p>

<p><strong>Pakistan's Muhammad Aurangzeb</strong></p>

<p>Pakistan Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said his nation will ensure the US remains a major trade partner regardless of happens with policy.</p>

<p>That's been the case under “various administrations which have come in,” he said in an interview. “So all hands on deck from our side to ensure that it remains so.”</p>

<p>The Washington-based IMF and World Bank symbolize an era of barely-contested American supremacy in the world economy. That faces new challenges now, including from the BRICS group of emerging markets. Its leaders met in Russia this week, where host Vladimir Putin hailed a new “multipolar world.”</p>

<p>Although Trump has been skeptical of Western-led multilateral institutions in the past, World Bank President Ajay Banga expressed optimism that the GOP candidate — if elected — would see the value of the lender's ability to leverage resources, rather than opting for the US to go it alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Let's wait to see what comes out of the elections,” said Banga, who was nominated by President Joe Biden. “Let's engage with the presidency with the respect it deserves.”</p>

<p><strong>ECB's Christine Lagarde</strong></p>

<p>European Central Bank Chief Christine Lagarde said whoever wins the election should tread carefully with trading partners.</p>

<p>“Periods of restrictions and barriers have not been periods of prosperity and strong leadership around the world,” she said at an event in the US capital. Whoever becomes the next US president “should at least bear that in mind.”</p>

<p>Across town at a Morton's steakhouse on Wednesday night, Gavekal Research – a China-focused advisory firm – hosted a discussion that revolved around trade policy and tariffs if Trump wins. The vibe among speakers, and an audience largely made up of finance-industry executives, was that he's in pole position right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“People have told us that he's still really mad because of Covid and Xi Jinping costing him the last election,” said the firm's head of research, Arthur Kroeber. “So he's going to come in with a very negative view.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden said Thursday he will issue a formal apology for the treatment of Native American children who were forcibly removed from their families by the US government and put into an abusive boarding school system.</p>

<p>For over 150 years, the schools sought to forcibly assimilate Native Americans, with a recent government report detailing numerous cases of physical, mental and sexual abuse, as well as the deaths of over 950 children.</p>

<p>"I'm heading to do something that should have been done a long time ago," the president said as he left the White House. "To make a formal apology to the Indian nations for the way we treated their children for so many years."</p>

<p>Biden is scheduled to make the official apology Friday on a visit to the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, one of the states with the highest Native American populations in the country and a key battleground in the US election.</p>

<p>The boarding schools, which were run by the US government, were in operation from the early 19th century until the 1970s.</p>

<p>The report found at least 973 children died at these schools, many of which were far from their original homes.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history, was a major force behind the investigation that produced the report.</p>

<p>"For more than a century, tens of thousands of Indigenous children as young as four years old, were taken from their families and communities and forced into boarding schools," Haaland told reporters. "This includes my own family."</p>

<p>"For decades, this terrible chapter was hidden from our history books," she continued. "But now our administration's work will ensure that no one will ever forget."</p>

<p>The apology follows formal declarations in Canada, where thousands of children died at similar boarding schools, and other countries around the world where historic abuses of Indigenous populations are increasingly being recognized.</p>

<p>In a statement, the White House said the apology was being issued in order to "remember and teach our full history, even when it is painful."</p>

<p>"That the president is taking that step tomorrow is so historic, I'm not sure I could adequately put its impact into words," Haaland said.</p>

<p>Biden's visit to Arizona, a state he narrowly won in 2020, comes in the midst of an extremely close presidential campaign between Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first dinosaur fossils found in Hong Kong, likely from a large dinosaur, were put on display on Friday after they were found on a small, uninhabited outlying island, providing new evidence for research on palaeoecology in the financial hub.</p>

<p>The fossils, confirmed to be dated to the Cretaceous period some 145 million to 66 million years ago, need further study to confirm the dinosaur species, authorities said, but it was clear they were large vertebrate animals.</p>

<p>They were found on Port Island, located in the northeast of Hong Kong and known for its red rock formations.</p>

<p>The city's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said in March the sedimentary rock on Port Island may contain fossils.</p>

<p>China's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) this week signed an agreement to conduct further research.</p>

<p>In addition to Argentina, Canada and the United States,&nbsp;China is one of the four main countries in the world for both finding and researching dinosaur fossils, said Michael Pittman, an assistant professor in the School of Life Sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>“This extremely exciting discovery now adds local dinosaur fossils to Hong Kong's strong&nbsp;existing&nbsp;track record of dinosaur research. I hope it inspires greater interest in science and nature in our community and will lead to notable scientific outcomes,” Pittman said.</p>

<p>At the Heritage Discovery Centre inside Hong Kong's Kowloon Park, eager fans gathered early on Friday to catch a glimpse of the fossils.</p>

<p>Chong Got, 66, was one of the first to arrive.</p>

<p>"It's shocking because I never thought there would be dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From assisting doctors with diagnoses to suggesting advanced treatments, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming health and medicine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From assisting doctors with diagnoses to suggesting advanced treatments, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming health and medicine. But AI has predominantly been developed by men, based on data sets that prioritise men's bodies and health needs. That means many AI models are riddled with gender and sex biases - posing a health risk to women, as well as nonbinary patients.</p>

<p>With these biases in medicine coming under the spotlight in recent years, will AI widen existing healthcare inequities - or can it be harnessed to help bridge the gap?</p>

<p><strong>Biased data</strong></p>

<p>The calibre of AI totally depends on the quality of the large data sets that are fed into the underlying machine learning algorithms within its software programs.</p>

<p>If data either excludes or under-represents relevant sectors of the global population, ill-informed AI can pose serious health risks - from missed diagnoses, to compromising the interpretation of medical imaging, to incorrect intervention recommendations.</p>

<p>Problems start with gender biases underlying the very coding of the AI software language.</p>

<p>Infiltration of masculine stereotypes into AI have emerged - from the apparently unconscious default to the male pronoun "he" when options are ambiguous, to alarming healthcare applications that threaten diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>For example, in the field of psychiatry, when men describe trauma symptoms, they are more likely to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while women describing the same symptoms are at higher risk of receiving a personality disorder diagnosis.</p>

<p>This kind of gender bias can (and often does) influence a women's access to health care or her management within the healthcare system - and it appears this bias is replicated in AI models.</p>

<p>A 2020 study from the US found that Natural Language Processing AI models used in psychiatry demonstrate significant gender biases.</p>

<p>The research paper, published in PLos One, warned that AI models that screen for psychopathology or suicide will make mistakes if they are trained predominantly on data written by white men, because language is shaped by gender. Men and women express suicidal distress differently, for example.</p>

<p>Crucially, awareness of these types of issues is gathering and initiatives to avert bias are emerging - often driven by women, such as Bioinfo4women-B4W, a program of the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre.</p>

<p>This example also reminds us that considerations around bias and gendered language in AI must extend beyond the English language, in order to be relevant to AI development around the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Opportunities for inclusive design</strong></p>

<p>But concerns don't stop at the level of language. What if something so basic as our body build is not considered when AI is being developed?</p>

<p>As the use of AI expands into safety product design, we have an unprecedented opportunity to build better products by crafting in features that adequately cater to our human bodies - female and male.</p>

<p>Average female and male bodies have proportionality differences; we can't simply scale from one to the other.</p>

<p>This point was driven home during the COVID pandemic, when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) became mandatory.</p>

<p>Despite around 70 percent of global healthcare workers being women, PPE has been designed around a male body. A Canadian survey identified that ill-fitting PPE was not only responsible for a failure to offer adequate protection, but also that oversized and ill-fitting gear posed a significant accident risk.</p>

<p>More studies are needed on this topic, but researchers have already proposed building AI-designed PPE. Ensuring that sex traits are considered in PPE design could be expected to improve safety.</p>

<p><strong>Moves in the right direction</strong></p>

<p>The accuracy of AI-assisted clinical diagnoses is completely reliant on the robustness of the underpinning data sets. Without actively accounting for sex and gender bias in historical data sets, AI may contribute to missed or mis-diagnoses.</p>

<p>Fortunately, adjusting for such biases appears to lead to better healthcare outcomes for women.</p>

<p>For example, the traditional risk assessment score for heart attacks, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE), was updated in 2022 to incorporate AI predictive models that account for sex-specific disease characteristics.</p>

<p>This update has revolutionised the performance of this assessment tool. The success stems from separate analysis of male and female data- which guides more female patients to lifesaving early intervention, helping overcome structural biases in patient management.</p>

<p>A practical example of an AI model designed to address and reduce gender bias is SMARThealth Pregnancy GPT. This tool, developed by The George Institute for Global Health, aims to improve access to guideline-based pregnancy advice for women living in rural and remote communities in India.</p>

<p>The concept was to develop a large language model chatbot that would be contextually sensitive and clinically accurate - and avoid entrenching harmful stereotypes.</p>

<p>The George Institute team worked closely with community health workers, clinicians and women living in rural communities, to co-create and refine the tool's algorithm. Clinicians also scored AI-generated answers on accuracy, appropriateness for community health workers, completeness and risk of bias, which helped improve the chatbot's responses.</p>

<p>The chatbot showcases AI's potential in building healthcare worker capacity and enhancing health education in resource-limited settings - while avoiding bias and promoting women's rights.</p>

<p>Gender-sensitive AI development could similarly improve countless other medical technologies that rely on data diversity and integrity for accuracy: for example, tailoring personalised treatments; predicting treatment responses; performing certain robot-assisted surgeries; monitoring patients remotely; virtual health care; and acceleration of drug discovery.</p>

<p>Initiatives to advance improved sex and gender equity in healthcare have begun to emerge in recent years, too. They include the newly launched Australian Centre for Sex and Gender Equity in Health and Medicine and the UK Medical Science Sex and Gender Equity.</p>

<p>These programs are actively advocating for routine consideration of sex and gender from discovery to translational research, including AI applications, to ensure scientific rigour as a robust foundation for advancing health and medical care.</p>

<p>AI is the future of healthcare, and we can't afford to replicate the past mistakes of health inequities perpetrated by ignoring sex and gender. It is time to program AI to chart our course toward an ethical destiny.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For eight years now, the global economy has been weathering a succession of shocks - from trade conflicts and a pandemic to bloody wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. That's led to a new era of geopolitics and fragmentation, one that's driving investment and trade flows in new ways.</p>

<p>Indeed, a remarkable consequence of how the global economy is being reorganized is that companies and countries are reallocating capital and building fresh relationships. We reveal how more than 100 countries across the globe are taking advantage of this shifting landscape.</p>

<p>Some contend this new state of affairs signals the end of globalization. But that's arguably too simplistic. Instead, globalization is just rapidly changing shape. Emerging alongside rival blocs-one US-led and pro-Western and the other Chinese- and Russia-led-is a large family of economies that are refusing to pick sides-and profiting as a result.</p>

<p>Last year, Bloomberg introduced you to "the Connectors," a small band of countries like Mexico and Vietnam that are exploiting trade links with both rival blocs while serving as a bridge between them.</p>

<p>This year, we'd like you to meet a bigger group of countries, the 101 economies we're calling the "New Neutrals." These countries are the ones that consistently opt out of the geopolitical fray, at least as measured by their stance on United Nations votes that many economists are starting to monitor as a gauge of geopolitical alliances.</p>

<p>As a group, they are consequential in that they make up more than half of the world's population and almost a fifth of its economic output. The key point though is that these New Neutrals are benefiting economically from their hedging stance. Above all, they're seeing a significant increase in foreign investment in new factories and other projects that amount to long-term bets by companies and investors.</p>

<p>There are qualifications and questions, for sure. Thanks to China's exports and Russia's energy resources, a growing share of the New Neutrals' trade is with the pro-China and Russia bloc. An inward-looking US is also drawing more foreign investment, too, thanks to industrial subsidies and trade barriers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Meta Platforms Inc., Google, TikTok and Snap will have to face lawsuits brought by school districts in federal court blaming their "addictive" apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among students.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms Inc., Google, TikTok and Snap will have to face lawsuits brought by school districts in federal court blaming their "addictive" apps for contributing to a mental health crisis among students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ruling Thursday by US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, follows a contrasting June 7 decision by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in favor of the companies. The split leaves the platforms potentially on the hook for damages in more than 150 cases before Rogers even as they're poised to dodge liability for claims in more than 600 other cases filed in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Rogers generally denied a request for dismissal of negligence claims, but narrowed the scope of allegations that will proceed. She concluded that some claims are barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a longstanding federal law shielding internet companies from lawsuits.</p>

<p>Google and Meta spokespersons denied wrongdoing, saying their companies have taken steps to keep young users safe on the platforms. Snap also cited its safety initiatives and pointed to research showing that its Snapchat has a positive impact on the well-being of users. TikTok didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The ruling comes just over a week after Rogers ruled that Meta must face a lawsuit by dozens of state attorneys general alleging it knowingly hooked kids on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. TikTok faces similar claims by a coalition of states. Both companies have denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The companies also face significant exposure from hundreds of personal injury suits accusing them of designing their platforms to encourage youths to spend unhealthy amounts of time on screens. But the school cases may carry bigger potential monetary damages because each district seeks to recoup institutional costs from the negative repercussions of having hundreds of individual students hooked on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The school districts alleged that the companies engineered their platforms to addict kids by using algorithms and features such as the "like" button, in ways that hurt society - akin to cigarette manufacturers that designed their products to be addictive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Compulsive Use'</strong></p>

<p>Rogers said the schools' core legal theory was viable: the social media companies "deliberately fostered compulsive use of their platforms which foreseeably caused" the school districts to spend resources on combating the mental health crisis among students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement that the allegations aren't true.</p>

<p>"In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls," Castaneda said.</p>

<p>A Meta spokesperson said in a statement that the company disagrees with the court's decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We've developed numerous tools to support parents and teens, and we recently announced that we're significantly changing the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts, a protected experience for teens that automatically limits who can contact them and the content they see," according to the statement.</p>

<p>Lexi Hazam and Previn Warren, lead lawyers for the plaintiffs, hailed the ruling as a victory "for schools, teachers, and administrators who are on the front lines of the nation's youth mental health crisis."</p>

<p>"Because of the addictive design of Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube, students are struggling," they said in a statement. "That means schools are struggling - their budgets are stretched and their educational missions are diverted as they shoulder the added responsibility of supporting kids in crisis."</p>

<p><strong>Public Nuisance</strong></p>

<p>The judge said claims by school districts based on legal theory of public nuisance - successfully employed against nicotine vape pen sellers - will be addressed separately.</p>

<p>University of Florida law professor Clay Calvert said the big payouts in the Juul litigation might have prompted plaintiffs lawyers to pursue similar theories in the social media cases.</p>

<p>"I think they see there's potential out there from large settlements," he said.</p>

<p>But the professor also there are fundamental differences between vape pens and social media, including First Amendment protections for the content posted on social media.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles and Oakland judges are overseeing separate batches of personal injury suits by youths and families alleging that the social media companies are responsible for causing widespread psychological distress and even suicides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The federal case is In Re Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, 22-md-03047, US District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer says Britons who get additional income from stock holdings don't count as 'working people,' suggesting he's willing to raise taxes on investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked by Sky News if someone who works but also gets income from shares or property is a working person, Starmer said "they wouldn't come within my definition." His government has repeatedly promised not to raise taxes on who he considers to be working people, including ruling out raising income tax, national insurance on employees and value added tax.</p>

<p>"People will know whether they're in that group or not, those people who work hard and are anxious about whether they can make ends meet and know that should something happen to them and their family, they can't write a cheque to get out of the problem," Starmer said, when asked for his definition.</p>

<p>His spokesman Dave Pares later clarified that a person who holds a small amount of savings in stocks and shares still counts as a working person, despite Starmer's earlier comments. He said that Starmer was referring to someone who primarily gets their income from assets.</p>

<p>Starmer's new government has sought to demonstrate its commitment to wealth creation in the run-up to this budget, including hosting a summit earlier this month for businesses and investors designed to raise billions of private money for the UK. Earlier this week, he said there's "no reason" for entrepreneurs to leave Britain, despite the prospect of tax rises.</p>

<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves has conceded that she's looking at other taxes to ensure "the sums add up," leading to widespread expectation that employers will pay more national insurance and that capital gains and inheritance taxes will go up. An increase in capital gains tax is likely to impact people selling property as well as shares.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reeves is under pressure to increase public spending despite the limited fiscal room she inherited from her Conservative predecessors preventing her from offering large giveaways. She confirmed on Thursday that she will change the fiscal rules underpinning the UK's spending plans in order to boost government investment, a move that could allow Britain to borrow as much as &amp;#163;70 billion ($91 billion) more over the next five years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The National Indian Film Festival of Australia (NIFFA) will be held across seven cities in Australia from February 13-16 2025.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Centre for Indian Cinema has announced an initiative to create the biggest celebration of Indian cinema in Australasia with Australia's first and only National Indian Film Festival of Australia (NIFFA). The festival will be held across seven cities in Australia from February 13-16 2025, with Australia cinema chain Dendy Cinemas, major Indian news media company NDTV and cinema advertising company Val Morgan, coming on board as stakeholders.</p>

<p>The festival is the brainchild of filmmaker and Australia's leading expert on Indian cinema, Anupam Sharma, who will head the festival with industry veteran Peter Castaldi serving as festival director.</p>

<p>"Australia was craving for a professional national celebration of Indian cinema, and it is an absolute honour to receive the support of mainstream Australia with Dendy as our major partner and NDTV as media partner. This will be one of the rare film festivals which will be produced by filmmakers," Mr Sharma said.</p>

<p>"One of the most important and exciting aspects of the festival will be the programming coverage on NDTV about Australia-India cultural and artistic ties, which will reach a potential audience of over 350 million across NDTV platforms. Money cannot buy such exposure for Australian cultural links with India," he added.</p>

<p>Sanjay Pugalia, NDTV's Director and Editor-in-Chief, said, "As NDTV expands globally and the Indian diaspora flourishes across Australasia, partnering with this premier celebration of Indian cinema felt like a perfect fit. We at NDTV are happy to amplify the festival's spirit worldwide, bringing it to Indian communities across the globe and celebrating the ever-growing impact of Indian filmmaking on the international stage."</p>

<p>Sharon Strickland, the CEO of Dendy Cinema, said, "Dendy Cinema is honoured to partner with the National Indian Film Festival of Australia, bringing the best of Indian cinema to audiences across Australia. With a resurgence of Indian films making a strong impact at the global box office, this collaboration highlights our commitment to showcasing diverse and culturally significant stories. We are excited to support this festival, celebrating the vibrant creativity and growing influence of Indian filmmaking on the world stage."</p>

<p>Festival Director, Peter Castaldi, said, "I am delighted to have been invited to take such an important role in this vital Indo-Australian cultural and business initiative. On the back of the co-production treaty, sparking a resurgence of film links and high box office revenue in Australasia for pan-Indian films, it makes sense to offer a national audience the opportunity to enjoy a professionally curated taster of the vitality of the amazingly rich and diverse Indian production sector. I look forward to working with the NIFFA to deliver exciting, informative and entertaining experiences for all Australians."</p>

<p>The NIFFA will see a weekend of celebrations and screenings around Australia in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, the Gold Coast, Darwin and Hobart.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The first units of North Korean troops trained in Russia have been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area, Ukraine's military intelligence service said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first units of North Korean troops trained in Russia have been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces staged a major incursion in August, Ukraine's military intelligence service said this week.</p>

<p>The United States joined Ukraine and South Korea to accuse North Korea of dispatching the troops, estimated to number in the thousands, to aid Russia in the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has previously dismissed reports about the North's troop deployment as "fake news". But Russian president Vladimir Putin on Thursday did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia and said that it was Moscow's business how to implement a partnership treaty with Pyongyang.</p>

<p>Here is what we know so far:</p>

<p><strong>What Are The Reports?</strong></p>

<p>The Ukrainian intelligence agency said a total of around 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia, and training was taking place on five military bases.</p>

<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said North Korea had previously deployed officers in Russian-occupied territory within Ukraine.</p>

<p>“I believe they sent officers first to assess the situation before deploying troops,” Zelenskiy told reporters.</p>

<p>South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it had tracked around 3,000 troops, including special forces, shipped by Russian naval vessels to the country's Far East for training and acclimatising at military bases there, probably to be deployed for combat in the war.</p>

<p>The South also said it had used AI facial recognition technology to identify a delegation of dozens of North Korean officers visiting frontline areas in Ukraine, to give guidance on North Korea-made KN-23 ballistic missiles fired at targets there.</p>

<p>The delegation included a key figure in the North's missile development, identified by analysts at Seoul-based NK PRO as Ri Song Jin, glimpsed in photographs last year while accompanying leader Kim Jong Un to factories that turn out missiles.</p>

<p>The troops have been supplied with Russian military uniforms, weapons and false identification documents ahead of being deployed for combat, it said.</p>

<p><strong>Why Would North Korea Help Russia?</strong></p>

<p>Putin has said a treaty he signed with Kim Jong Un during a visit to Pyongyang in June included a mutual assistance clause for each side to help the other repel external aggression.</p>

<p>Analysts say North Korea could benefit from providing weapons and troops by gaining experience and insight from operating on a battlefield.</p>

<p>Pyongyang, heavily sanctioned for its nuclear weapons programme, also appears to be gaining major imports of oil and other products from Russia, according to foreign intelligence agencies and commercial satellite imagery examined by analysts.</p>

<p>A report by a think tank affiliated with South Korea's NIS estimated that the cash-strapped North earned about $540 million last year from arms sales to Russia.</p>

<p><strong>What Has The Reaction Been?</strong></p>

<p>A North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York called the reports "groundless rumours."</p>

<p>On Monday, South Korea said it had protested the deployment to Russia's ambassador.</p>

<p>Seoul has also said it is considering phased countermeasures, including possible changes to its stance against directly providing weapons to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Germany and Austria summoned North Korea's top envoys in their countries on Wednesday to register their concerns.</p>

<p>The leaders of Britain and Finland have said Russia's use of North Korean troops would be a sign of desperation.</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry said on Thursday it was not aware of North Korean troops being in Russia and it hoped "all parties will promote a de-escalation of the situation and commit themselves to a political solution" in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>What Challenges Do North Korean Troops Present To Ukraine?</strong></p>

<p>Russia has fired dozens of North Korea-made ballistic missiles and has received large numbers of artillery shells and anti-tank rockets, say South Korea, Ukraine, the United States and independent researchers.</p>

<p>Military analysts say there are questions on how Russia would incorporate North Korean troops on the ground, and that, like the weapons, an infusion of troops would be unlikely to be a game changer but could help prolong the conflict.</p>

<p>"Russia's war zone has expanded significantly, and with Ukrainian forces making advances even into Russian territory, North Korean troops could play role in defending against such incursions," said Kim Yong-hyun, of South Korea's Dongguk University. "While North Korea's involvement may not be decisive for Russia, it could still provide meaningful support."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella received a pay package worth $79.1 million for fiscal 2024, a 63% increase from the prior year as the software maker worked to extend its strong position in artificial intelligence tools.</p>

<p>About 90% of Nadella's compensation for the year ended in June was in Microsoft shares, the company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. It's the largest award he has received in any year since he was paid $84 million in 2014, the year he became Microsoft's third chief executive.</p>

<p>Nadella's pay would have been about $5 million higher had he not requested a pay cut "to reflect his personal accountability" for changes the company is making to reflect cybersecurity risks, Microsoft's board compensation committee wrote in the filing on Thursday. The company has faced mounting scrutiny in recent years, including from the US Cyber Safety Review Board, for a series of embarrassing hacks of its software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The board reviewed the company's performance and strongly believes that Mr. Nadella provided exceptional leadership and was both critical in achieving both the extremely strong performance of the company and personally responsible for the ongoing repositioning of its investments and priorities," Microsoft's board compensation committee wrote.</p>

<p>Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood's pay package for the year rose to $25.8 million, an increase of 30% from a year earlier, according to the filing. President Brad Smith got a 29% bump to $23.4 million.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yum! Brands Inc. and Burger King removed onions from some of their locations as the restaurant industry investigates an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/e-coli-outbreak-whats-is-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-causes-and-symptoms-6852562">E. Coli outbreak</a> first traced to McDonald's Corp.</p>

<p>Yum withdrew fresh onions from some Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC locations "out of an abundance of caution," the company said Thursday in a statement to Bloomberg News, without disclosing which stores and regions were affected or naming suppliers.</p>

<p>"We will continue following supplier and regulatory guidance to ensure the ongoing safety and quality of our food," the company said.</p>

<p>Burger King said Thursday that it gets some of its onions from a Colorado facility run by Taylor Farms, which supplied the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/slivered-onions-likely-culprit-says-mcdonalds-as-it-tackles-e-coli-crisis-6861191">McDonald's restaurants</a> that have been impacted by the outbreak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taylor Farms issued a recall of some its yellow onion batches despite finding no traces of E. coli as of Wednesday. Restaurant distributors US Foods Holding Corp. and Sysco Corp. have also notified customers of the recall.</p>

<p>"Despite no contact from health authorities and no indications of illness, we proactively asked our 5% of restaurants who received whole onions distributed by this facility to dispose of them immediately two days ago and we are in the process of restocking them from other facilities," Burger King said.</p>

<p>Fat Brands Inc., owner of restaurants including Johnny Rockets, said it pulled all of Taylor Farms' fresh onion products.</p>

<p>"We have identified an extremely limited number of Buffalo's Cafe locations and Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses that are currently utilizing Taylor Farms as a supplier for onions," the company said in a statement Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The restaurant industry is on alert after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that an E. coli outbreak likely tied to pre-slivered onions served on McDonald's Quarter Pounders sickened dozens of people in the US and killed one. Burger King said it buys whole onions that are cut, peeled and sliced in its restaurants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>McDonald's pulled the popular product from about 20% of its more than 13,000 US restaurants, and it's working with health authorities to confirm the source of the contamination.</p>

<p>Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said in a statement Thursday that it doesn't source onions from Taylor Farms or any ingredients from the Colorado facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inspire Brands Inc., which owns Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, Jimmy John's, Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin', said its onions don't come from the facility. It hadn't pulled onions or any other ingredients from restaurants as of Thursday evening in New York.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mother of Liberty “Libby” German broke down when a video showing the final moments of her daughter's life was played in the courtroom during the Delphi murder trial. The bodies of Libby, 14, and Abby, 13, were found on February 14, 2017, after they went missing during a hike.</p>

<p>During the <a href="http://https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/delphi-murders-trial-examination-of-physical-evidence-recovered-at-crime-scene-a-focus-of-day-4 " rel="nofollow,noindex">court proceedings on Tuesday</a>, the 43-second video was shown to the jury. In the clip, recorded on February 13, 2017, Libby and her friend Abigail “Abby” Williams were seen walking on the Monon High Bridge in Delphi, Indiana, before a man, later identified as the "Bridge Guy," appeared to follow them. This chilling video became one of the key pieces of evidence in the years-long investigation.</p>

<p>This was also the first time the complete footage was displayed publicly outside of law enforcement.</p>

<p>Libby's mother got emotional as the girl in the video said, "There's no path. The trail ends here so we have to go down here?" Moments later, a man's voice chillingly instructed, "Guys, down the hill." These were the final known moments of the girls before their bodies were discovered the next day.</p>

<p>The case went cold for years before a breakthrough came in October 2022 with the arrest of Richard Allen, a 52-year-old local man. Allen was charged with murder and kidnapping. During the trial, prosecutors argued that Allen forced the girls off the trail before slitting their throats. The video of Allen allegedly approaching the girls, recorded by Libby on her phone, was retrieved and has since become a central piece of evidence.</p>

<p>On the day of the murders, several eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a man fitting the description of "Bridge Guy" on the same trail. Railly Voorhies, one of the witnesses who testified in court, recalled passing a man who seemed “unhappy” on the trail. She later identified him as the man shown in the footage.</p>

<p>The trial now focuses on whether Allen was responsible for the killings.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have presented forensic evidence, including a shoe, fibres and a cartridge found near the crime scene. The trial is ongoing, with more witnesses expected to testify. If convicted, Allen could face life in prison.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

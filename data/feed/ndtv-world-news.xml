       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck the northern Philippines on Wednesday, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) said, as authorities warned of damage and aftershock from the tremor.</p>

<p>The quake was at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), GFZ said.</p>

<p>Philippine seismology agency PHIVOLCS said the quake struck the northern town of Bangui in Ilocos province and warned of aftershocks and damage from the quake.</p>

<p>There were no immediate reports of damage from the tremor.</p>

<p>Earthquakes are common in the Philippines, which lies on the "Ring of Fire", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is prone to seismic activity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military on Tuesday said it killed three Hamas members in an air strike near the occupied West Bank city of Tubas, after the Palestinian health ministry reported two dead.</p>

<p>"Three Hamas terrorists who planned an imminent terrorist attack were eliminated" when the Israeli air force struck vehicles in the Aqaba area near Tubas, the military said.</p>

<p>Following the strike, "soldiers conducted a targeted raid in the vicinity of the strike, locating four weapons," it added.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry had earlier said an Israeli strike on a vehicle in Aqaba killed two Palestinians and wounded one.</p>

<p>All three Palestinians were transported to a hospital in Tubas, it added, but later said Israeli forces raided the same hospital, which the army denied in a statement to AFP.</p>

<p>The Israeli military had earlier told AFP that the air force, "acting on intelligence, struck a terror cell that was about to carry out an attack" in the Aqaba area.</p>

<p>It said an army unit "was then dispatched to collect the bodies and operated in the area of the Turkish Hospital in Tubas".</p>

<p>However, it added, "they did not enter the hospital."</p>

<p>Israel often seizes the bodies of Palestinians killed during operations, particularly those who belonged to militant groups, although an AFP journalist present near the hospital at the time of the operation did not see soldiers carrying bodies.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry said the Israeli army besieged the hospital, before breaking into it, shooting inside, "assaulting staff and patients, and arresting a number of them".</p>

<p>The AFP journalist in Tubas saw Israeli armoured vehicles stationed outside the hospital and soldiers deployed around it.</p>

<p>The journalist saw Israeli soldiers exiting the hospital and detaining staff, some of them wearing scrubs or doctor's gowns, before loading them into the armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank has soared since the war in Gaza erupted on October 7 last year after Hamas's attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 787 Palestinians in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry.</p>

<p>Palestinian attacks on Israelis have also killed at least 24 people in the West Bank in the same period, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I want this and it is possible. It depends on the MPs... I think it is possible that there is this reflex of responsibility where -- beyond political differences, divergences, the normal contradictions in a democracy -- we tell ourselves that there is a higher interest," Barnier told French television when asked if there was a chance his government could survive Wednesday's vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Within six hours of announcing a martial law in the country, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said he will withdraw it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Within six hours of announcing a martial law in the country, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said he will withdraw it.</p>

<p>In a 4:30 am (local time) special address to the nation, President Yoon said, "Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations. We will accept the National Assembly's request and lift the martial law through the Cabinet meeting."</p>

<p>South Korean MPs had voted unanimously against the imposition of martial law at a midnight session of the National Assembly to denounce the President's decision.</p>

<p>The President then agreed to honour the vote, as did the army chief. Shortly after the President withdrew the order and addressed the nation, the South Korean cabinet convened for a 5 am (local time) meeting to approve a motion to officially lift what turned out to be one of the shortest-ever martial laws in history.</p>

<p>As events unfolded in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday in Korea, President Yoon's decision for a national emergency and martial law was vehemently opposed by parliamentarians who rejected the decision to ban political activity and censor the media.</p>

<p>Explaining his move, President Yoon had said that the decision was taken to crush "anti-state forces". This was the first time in nearly five decades that South Korea had imposed a martial law - the last one being in 1980.</p>

<p>Politicians and protesters had assembled outside the National Assembly (Parliament) shouting slogans in defiance of the martial law that was in place at the time. Security forces had to fire tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. The country's currency also went on a downward spiral. However, the situation improved after President Yoon agreed to the vote in Parliament and said he will announce the withdrawal shortly.</p>

<p>South Korea is one of the major economies of Asia and is a key ally of the United States. It has also been a democracy for more than four decades. The move to enforce a martial law had therefore caused international alarm.</p>

<p>Though South Korea is under a constant threat from its northern nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea, President Yoon did not suggest any specific threat from Kim Jong-Un that could have led to this sudden decision.</p>

<p>President Yoon has been under pressure in domestic politics after his party - People Power Party - suffered a massive defeat in the general election held in April this year. The result left the opposition with more than two-thirds majority in Parlaiment. President Yoon has also been rather unpopular in recent times, with his national rating falling to just around 20 per cent.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 'urgent' issue was tabled today in the House of Commons in UK's parliament over the worrisome situation in Bangladesh. Members of Parliament raised concern over the recent attacks on the Hindu minority in the south Asian nation and also discussed the religious crackdown on Hindu monks by the interim government in the country.</p>

<p>Labour Party MP Barry Gardiner, had on Monday, asked for an urgent session in the British parliament to discuss the situation in Bangladesh which London has been monitoring closely.</p>

<p>Informing the House about initiatives taken by Britain so far, the foreign office in-charge for the Indo-Pacific region, Catherine West said she had visited Bangladesh last month and held meetings with the leadership of the interim government in the country. She said that UK was among the first countries to take up the issue with Dhaka and was given verbal assurances by Bangladesh's chief adviser Mohamed Yunus.</p>

<p>Ms West also mentioned concerns raised by New Delhi over the happenings in Bangladesh. "We are aware of the statement of concern from the Indian government following the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das, a well-known Hindu leader, on sedition charges. The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) desk is closely monitoring those developments," said Ms West.</p>

<p>She went on to say that "The UK government will continue to monitor the situation, including making representations from this House, and will engage with the interim government in Bangladesh on the importance of freedom of religion or belief specifically as it affects the Hindu community."</p>

<p>Conservative MP Priti Patel, who is the Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs called the situation in Bangladesh "deeply, deeply concerning".</p>

<p>Referring to the surge in incidents of violence, vandalism, and desecration targeting Hindu minorities, Ms Patel said, "The degree of escalation in violence is deeply concerning. What we are witnessing now is uncontrolled violence in many quarters. We are watching with horror and shock as further violence spreads in Bangladesh. The thoughts of all of us in the House are with the diaspora community here and those affected in Bangladesh. These are deeply disturbing reports."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am deeply concerned by the awful violence we have seen in Bangladesh, and my thoughts are with those affected.<br />
<br />
In Parliament this afternoon, I called on the Government to set out how they are engaging with the Bangladeshi Government on this pressing and important issue.… <a href="https://t.co/jRXciBQIKH">pic.twitter.com/jRXciBQIKH</a></p>
— Priti Patel MP (@pritipatel) <a href="https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1863663152723870010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>She went on to ask the British government to delve into what is being done about the release of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, who has been arrested in Bangladesh. "We have a religions<br />
leader who has now been arrested. We need to know effectively what is being done to secure his release, due process in particular. But at the same time, can the Minister give details of the government's engagement with Bangladesh on this particular matter. What discussions have taken place so far, and have we been robust in pursuing the right to protect life, the prevention of violence, and persecution, and importantly, tolerance for religious belief."</p>

<p>Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent West in London, which has a large British Hindu population, described the situation as being "clearly on a knife edge".</p>

<p>Another MP, Bob Blackman, who is the chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for British Hindus, said "Hindus are suffering with their houses being burned and their businesses ransacked. Priests have been arrested, and I understand that two more were arrested over the weekend, and 63 monks have been denied access to the country. The clear issue is an attempt at the ethnic cleansing of Hindus from Bangladesh. We want to hear not just words of piety, but absolute condemnation of what is going on. Religious minorities are being deliberately persecuted because of their religion."</p>

<p>Since Sheikh Hasina was forced to step down as prime minister, the new military-backed interim administration, led by Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus, has faced criticism for failing to control violence against minorities. This includes instances of vandalism and desecration at temples, damage of Hindu businesses and properties, and homes of Hindus being attacked.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Teenage girls have been unable to access education since 2021 despite the Taliban promising they would restart their education once the curriculum has been ensured as "Islamic".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Midwifery and nursing were the last two educational avenues for women in Afghanistan which have now been padlocked by the Taliban government, according to the BBC.<br />
<br />
This poses serious questions as the United Nations said in 2023 that Afghanistan needs an additional 18,000 midwives to meet the needs of the country.</p>

<p>Women training in these avenues have said that they were ordered not to return to classes in the morning and while their statements have been corroborated by institutions in Afghanistan, the Taliban government's health ministry has not issued a response.</p>

<p>The institutes say that the Taliban has instructed them to close until further notice.</p>

<p>Teenage girls have been unable to access education since 2021 despite the Taliban promising they would restart their education once the curriculum has been ensured as "Islamic".</p>

<p>The only other way to seek some education was through midwifery or nursing - an important field since male doctors are not allowed to treat women unless a male guardian is present.</p>

<p>17,000 women are estimated to be training on these courses but what's to happen next is unclear.</p>

<p>Trainees can be heard weeping in the videos sent to the BBC. "Standing here and crying won't help. The Vice and Virtue officials [who enforce Taliban rules] are nearby, and I don't want anything bad to happen to any of you," a student tells others in one of the videos.</p>

<p>Another student said, "They even told us not to stand in the courtyard because the Taliban could arrive at any moment, and something might happen. Everyone was terrified. For many of us, attending classes was a small glimmer of hope after long periods of unemployment, depression, and isolation at home."</p>

<p>Amu TV, an independent satellite television channel, quotes a 22-year-old who was studying midwifery, "I wanted to study law and become a judge or prosecutor in my country, but when schools and universities were shut to us, I turned to midwifery. Now, they've even taken that away. I'm watching my dreams die before my eyes," she said.</p>

<p>According to the World Health Organisation, Afghanistan has one of the worst mortality rates in the world with 620 women dying per 100,000 live births.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four months after Ukraine's offensive on the Russian region of Kursk, text messages from soldiers the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4x9gz4ylwo" rel="noindex,nofollow">BBC</a> has been receiving, paints a bleak picture.</p>

<p>The soldiers are encumbered with fatigue and strained with sleeplessness because of terrifying 3,000 kg glide bombs. And now, as the winter stings, the only silver lining they can see amidst the grey - Donald Trump's inauguration.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian soldiers have lost their morale and the war isn't even about capturing anymore. It is about holding, and the soldiers say, "we're struggling a bit with that."</p>

<p>While both Russia and Ukraine await the president-elect Trump taking office, the latter is trying to hold maximum territory until Trump's inauguration. "The main task facing us is to hold the maximum territory until Trump's inauguration and the start of negotiations," Dmytro said. "In order to exchange it for something later. No-one knows what."</p>

<p>The one thing that remains constant apart from the immense pressure from the enemy is the loss of motivation.</p>

<p>With the war having been escalated, now the US, UK and France have all permitted Ukraine to use long-range weapons inside Russia, but that didn't do much for their spirits. "We live and fight here and now. And missiles fly somewhere else", Dmytro added.</p>

<p>The soldiers said that even if Atacms and Storm Shadow missiles proved effective somewhere, these successes hardly mean anything in the trenches. "We don't talk about missiles. In the bunkers we talk about family and rotation. About simple things", Marko said.</p>

<p>Regarding the North Korean troops set to join the Russian side, the soldiers BBC spoke with seemed to have no contact with. "I haven't seen or heard anything about Koreans, alive or dead," Andriy said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The soldiers have been told to capture at least one North Korean soldier with documents. Apparently, there are rewards such as drones and leaves for anyone who successfully captures a North Korean soldier.</p>

<p>Ukrainian soldiers will hold out at Kursk for "as long as it is feasible from the military point of view", since it is reaping military and political rewards for them and also since the situation in Kursk and heavy losses for Russia "annoys Putin".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite widespread concern that generative AI could interfere with major elections around the globe this year, the technology had limited impact across Meta Platforms' apps, the tech company said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Coordinated networks of accounts seeking to spread propaganda or false content largely failed to build a significant audience on Facebook and Instagram or use AI effectively, Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, told a press briefing. The volume of AI-generated misinformation was low and Meta was able to quickly label or remove the content, he said.</p>

<p>The snapshot from Meta comes as misinformation experts say AI content has so far failed to significantly sway public opinion, as notable deepfake videos and audio, including of President Joe Biden's voice, have been quickly debunked.</p>

<p>Coordinated networks of accounts attempting to spread false content are increasingly shifting their activities to other social media and messaging apps with fewer safety guardrails, or are operating their own websites in order to stay online, Clegg said.</p>

<p>Even as Meta said it was able to take down about 20 covert influence operations on its platform this year, the company has retreated from more stringent content moderation it employed during the previous U.S. presidential election in 2020.</p>

<p>The company heard feedback from users who complained that their content had been removed unfairly, and Meta will aim to protect free expression and be more precise in enforcing its rules, Clegg said.</p>

<p>"We feel we probably overdid it a bit," he said. "While we've been really focusing on reducing prevalence of bad content, I think we also want to redouble our efforts to improve the precision and accuracy with which we act on our rules."</p>

<p>The move is also in response to push-back from some Republican lawmakers who have questioned what they say is censorship of certain viewpoints on social media. In an August letter to the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he regretted some content take-downs the company made in response to pressure from the Biden administration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian presidential aircraft and funds were used in a program that took children from occupied Ukrainian territories, stripped them of Ukrainian identity and placed them with Russian families, according to a report by Yale's School of Public Health.</p>

<p>The US State Department-backed research, published on Tuesday, identified 314 Ukrainian children taken to Russia in the early months of the war in Ukraine as part of what it says was a systematic, Kremlin-funded program to "Russify" them.</p>

<p>Reuters was unable to confirm the report's findings independently.</p>

<p>In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his child rights' commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the alleged war crime of deportation of Ukrainian children.</p>

<p>At the time, Lvova-Belova said her commission acted on humanitarian grounds to protect children in an area where military action was taking place. Lvova-Belova's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Kremlin said it could not respond to questions sent on Monday, citing a lack of time.</p>

<p>The new report, shared with Reuters, offers details of the alleged deportation programme and individuals involved, including what its lead researcher said were new links to Putin.</p>

<p>The researcher, Nathaniel Raymond, Executive Director of Yale's Humanitarian Research Lab, said he was scheduled to present the findings to the UN Security Council on Wednesday. The United States holds the rotating presidency of the 15-member body this month.</p>

<p>Raymond said the research offers evidence that would support additional charges by the ICC against Putin of "forcible transfer" of people from one national and ethnic group to another.</p>

<p>He further said the report proved "the deportation of Ukraine's children is part of a systematic, Kremlin-led program" to make them citizens of Russia.</p>

<p>Forcible transfer is a crime against humanity under international law. Because they must be widespread and systematic, crimes against humanity are generally considered more serious than the war crimes Putin is currently charged with for alleged deportation of Ukrainian children.</p>

<p>In response to Reuters questions, the ICC office of the prosecutor said the Yale report was useful "in our continued activities in this case." It said it could not provide further information about charges or actions that may arise from its investigative activities in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian president's office did not respond to requests for comment. Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said it had no immediate comment.</p>

<p>In response to the ICC charges last year, Lvova-Belova said Russia had not moved anyone against their will or that of their parents or legal guardians, whose consent was always sought unless they were missing.</p>

<p>She said children were placed with temporary legal guardians and were not given up for adoption.</p>

<p>Russia, which does not recognise the ICC, has said the court's warrants are meaningless. Court decisions could nonetheless limit travel by charged individuals because its 124 member states have an obligation to execute warrants.</p>

<p><strong>CHILDREN IDENTIFIED</strong></p>

<p>The research is based on data mined from three Russian government adoption databases over 20 months. Yale's investigation then mapped out the alleged program's logistics and funding and confirmed the identities of the 314 children, Raymond said.</p>

<p>The research is part of an initiative led by the State Department under President Joe Biden to document potential violations of international law and crimes against humanity by Russia and Russia-aligned forces in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The report said Ukrainian children brought to Russia had been subjected to "pro-state and militarised propaganda," noting it had documented such "patriotic re-education" at all the facilities where the children were processed.</p>

<p>Reuters has documented the transfer of thousands of children to Russian camps, the forced naturalisation of Ukrainians and the involvement of Belarus in the program.</p>

<p>Stephen Rapp, the US ambassador-at-large for war crimes under former president Barack Obama and formerly a prosecutor at the international tribunals for Rwanda and Sierra Leone, reviewed the report and told Reuters that "it proves their direct involvement, making changes to law and practice to allow and accelerate coercive adoptions that would have been illegal under Russia's own law in February 2022."</p>

<p>Kyiv estimates around 19,500 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied Crimea since the invasion. Lvova-Belova has challenged Kyiv's numbers and asked it to provide evidence.</p>

<p>She previously said 380 orphans and children not in the custody of parents were placed with Russian foster families between April and October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>FLIGHTS</strong></p>

<p>Russia began taking Ukrainian children from occupied Ukrainian territories in the days before the invasion in February 2022, according to the report.</p>

<p>Russia's Aerospace Forces and aircraft under the direct control of Putin's office transported multiple groups of children from Ukraine on Russian Federation-flagged military transport planes between May and October 2022, the report said.</p>

<p>The report said at least two groups of children flew on aircraft managed by the Presidential Property Management Department within the Presidential Administration in May and October 2022.</p>

<p>Children taken to the Chkalovsky military airfield just outside Moscow on Sept. 16, 2022 had been transported from the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk to the Russian city of Rostov, not far from Ukraine's border, then flown on a plane with tail number RA-85123, the report said.</p>

<p>The aircraft is a TU-154M operated by the 223rd Flight Squad of the Russian Defence Ministry, it said. Flight tracking data on website Flightradar24.com also confirmed this.</p>

<p>Of the 314 Ukrainian children identified, 166 were placed directly with Russia citizens, the report said. The other 148 were listed in Russia's child placement databases, with about a third of those now placed with Russian citizens. The remaining children were last known to be located at Russian institutions, the report said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin man who was recently involved in a confrontation with several people in a lift lobby in Singapore has come forward to share his side of the story. In a Facebook video, that has since been deleted, the man, identified as Suresh Vanaz, was seen shouting and being restrained by several men. The clip showed him falling over and hurling a backpack at another man. It suggested that the fight started when the man tried to help a wheelchair user enter the lift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, Mr Vanaz took to Instagram to share his side of the story. In a video, he claimed that the Facebook video was edited for virality instead of showing his family's perspective. He explained that the altercation began when he was helping his wheelchair-bound brother out of the lift. He said that people did not give way when he began backing out of the lift and instead berated him. He also said that one man challenged him to a fight after he knocked into him on the way out, but backed down and fled the scene when he squared up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, Mr Vanaz admitted that he got angry due to the other party's inconsiderate behaviour and that he had a similar experience when taking the lift with his wheelchair-bound brother. In the caption of his post, he also raised issues with the "keyboard warriors" who left unkind comments online without knowing his side of the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Be mindful people, caregivers are going through stress in this Singapore situation here," he said.</p>

<p>In the comments section, users shared messages of encouragement and support and praised Mr Vanaz for standing up for his brother. Some users also shared their own experiences, highlighting the need for better etiquette while taking the life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"i totally agree with u bro.. i am a caregiver myself with 2 wheelchair bound family members.. truely understsnd you.. and on behalf of the malay family, we are sorry.. God bless u bro," wrote one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Firstly, I think Singapore should be passing out a rule that lifts has priority for wheelchair and prams and not for the normal people who can use the escalator to travel through the floors. Then this sort of problems will be curbed," suggested another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hope your Brother was ok during the whole ordeal and not hurt in any way. A good reminder to everyone to always look at the bigger picture. Sending you greetings and gd vibes. It's def not easy being a caregiver- everyone needs to practice a little grace and kindness," committed a third user.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 41-year-old woman has been arrested in the hit-and-run death of an Indian student in Connecticut last year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old woman has been arrested in the hit-and-run death of an Indian student in Connecticut last year.</p>

<p>Jill Augelli was arrested on November 18 in the October 2023 death of Priyanshu Agwal 23, an international student at the University of New Haven.</p>

<p>She has been charged with one count of evading responsibility resulting in death, according to a report in the Hartford Courant.</p>

<p>Agwal was just a few months shy of finishing graduate school and was applying for jobs when the hit-and-run incident took his life, the report added.</p>

<p>The New Haven Police Department announced the arrest of the driver allegedly involved in the incident during a news conference on Monday.</p>

<p>At the news conference, Agwal's brother, Aman, spoke about how he missed him every day for the past year since the accident.</p>

<p>"I just want to say I miss my brother every day," he said. The report quoted him as saying that he still has dreams about his brother. He said he teeters between having good memories of his sibling and feeling guilty.</p>

<p>Aman said the driver did not stop after the crash. "I feel like she didn't try to stop and it led to a major injury," he said.</p>

<p>The Courant report quoted New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker as saying that Priyanshu Agwal's family described him as a person with a "big smile" whose "outgoing, charismatic personality" led to him having lots of friends.</p>

<p>He was "loved by many" and had "his whole life ahead of him", Elicker said, adding that he was applying for jobs at the time of his death and had "big dreams" of a life in the United States.</p>

<p>Elicker added that "thanks to Priyanshu Agwal and his family deciding to donate his heart," he was able to save someone else's life.</p>

<p>"And so that heart is beating in someone else's body now," Elicker said. "So even though he lost his life, part of his life is giving someone else a life today and that we're grateful for as well." New Haven Police Chief Karl Jacobson said authorities at the time did not have enough evidence to charge Augelli and "had to work to put her behind the driver's seat during the crash".</p>

<p>This involved obtaining GPS data from her cell phone carrier that allegedly showed she was "in the vicinity" of the collision when it happened, police said, according to the Courant report. Forensic testing also allegedly showed Agwal's DNA was on Augelli's car.</p>

<p>According to police, Agwal was driving an electric scooter on October 18, 2023, around 11 pm when he entered an intersection and was hit by a motorist. The driver did not stop and instead continued, the report said.</p>

<p>Agwal was taken to Yale New Haven Hospital where he was pronounced dead about a week later.</p>

<p>Investigators found the car involved in the crash the next day in Naugatuck. According to police, investigators found that Augelli was the registered owner of the vehicle, the report said.</p>

<p>Augelli remains held on a USD 100,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in New Haven Superior Court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to the University of New Haven, Priyanshu Agwal, 23, was pursuing a master's degree in business analytics after coming to the US in 2022 from Deoli, Rajasthan. He had served as a business analyst intern with an IT company.</p>

<p>Elicker said he hopes Priyanshu Agwal's story can help underline the importance of safe driving and the critical need to stop and help when crashes happen. "If you flee we will track you down and hold you accountable," Elicker said in the report.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China has banned exports to the United States of items related to the minerals gallium, germanium and antimony that have potential military applications, it said on Tuesday, a day after Washington's latest crackdown on China's chip sector.</p>

<p>A commerce ministry directive on dual-use items with both military and civilian applications cited national security concerns. The order, which takes immediate effect, also requires stricter review of end-usage for graphite items shipped to the US.</p>

<p>"In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted," China's commerce ministry said.</p>

<p>The curbs strengthen enforcement of existing limits on exports of the critical minerals that Beijing began rolling out last year, but apply only to the U.S. market, in the latest escalation of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies ahead of President-elect Donald Trump taking office.</p>

<p>Chinese customs data show there have been no shipments of wrought and unwrought germanium or gallium to the US this year through October, although it was the fourth and fifth-largest market for the minerals, respectively, a year earlier.</p>

<p>Gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells.</p>

<p>Similarly, China's overall October shipments of antimony products plunged by 97% from September after Beijing's move to limit its exports took effect.</p>

<p>China accounted last year for 48% of globally mined antimony, which is used in ammunition, infrared missiles, nuclear weapons and night-vision goggles, as well as in batteries and photovoltaic equipment.</p>

<p>This year, China has accounted for 59.2% of refined germanium output and 98.8% of refined gallium production, according to consultancy Project Blue.</p>

<p>"The move is a considerable escalation of tensions in supply chains where access to raw material units is already tight in the West," said Project Blue co-founder Jack Bedder.</p>

<p>Prices of antimony trioxide in Rotterdam had soared by 228% since the beginning of the year to $39,000 a metric ton on Nov. 28, data from information provider Argus showed.</p>

<p>"Everyone will dig in their backyard to find antimony. Many countries will try to find antimony deposits," said a minor metals trader in Europe, declining to be named.</p>

<p>China's announcement comes after Washington launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry on Monday, curbing exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group.</p>

<p>Trump, whose first White House term was marked by a bitter trade war with China, has said he will implement 10% tariffs on Chinese goods and threatened 60% tariffs on Chinese imports during his presidential campaign.</p>

<p>"It comes as no surprise that China has responded to the increasing restrictions by American authorities, current and imminent, with its own restrictions on the supply of these strategic minerals," said Peter Arkell, chairman of the Global Mining Association of China.</p>

<p>"It's a trade war that has no winners," he said.</p>

<p>Separately, several Chinese industry groups called on Tuesday for their members to buy domestically made semiconductors, with one saying U.S. chips were no longer safe and reliable.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian entrepreneur Kuldeep Dhankar recently shared how he survived a car crash with the help of his Apple Watch. Taking to X, Mr Dhankar, the founder of Last9.io, shared a photo of his crashed car on a US highway and a police officer inspecting the accident site. In his post, he said that he got rear-ended by a car while he was in standstill traffic. He revealed that his Apple Watch immediately detected the crash and automatically called the cops. This prompt response from the device's crash detection feature and the California Highway Patrol played a vital role in ensuring Mr Dhankar's safety, allowing him to continue his journey with minimal delay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Got rear ended by a car while we were at standstill in traffic, on the I-5 yesterday. the car behind was probably a total loss. (we are perfectly safe) Apple watch detected that we were in a crash and auto called 911 and there was an officer on the scene with in minutes. we were able to leave in 30 minutes and got to our destination safe. so impressed by Apple watch and california highway patrol. Also thankful. very thankful," Mr Dhankar wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Dhankar shared the post a few hours back. Since then it has accumulated more than 41,000 views.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reacting to the post, one user wrote, "Glad to know that you and the others are safe. Take care!" "Glad you are safe! Apple Watch did its job well" commented another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Damn, that sounds horrible. Glad you are okay," wrote a third user. "This looks so scary! So glad you guys are all ok!" expressed a fourth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this is not the first time an Apple Watch saved a person's life. Back in October, the device proved to be a lifesaver for an elderly woman by detecting an irregular heartbeat, leading to timely medical intervention. Renowned for its advanced health-tracking capabilities beyond just monitoring steps, sleep, and blood oxygen levels, the Apple Watch's ECG (electrocardiogram) feature identified a condition called atrial fibrillation, prompting the woman to seek immediate medical attention.</p>

<p>Nikias Molina shared this incident on X, revealing that his Apple Watch Series 10 detected his grandmother's irregular heartbeat. "My Apple Watch Series 10 detected my grandmother's atrial fibrillation today using the ECG feature. She's now at the hospital and receiving the care she needs. I still can't believe it," he wrote while sharing a picture of the watch alert.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen appears to be betting her future on ousting President Emmanuel Macron before his term ends in 2027, lawmakers and analysts say. To do so, she has helped trigger France's second political crisis in six months.</p>

<p>It's a decision that may haunt her.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Monday chose to ram through parliament a key component of the 2025 budget bill after Le Pen and her National Rally (RN) party rejected a last-minute concession aimed at securing their support.</p>

<p>Barnier's minority government is almost certain to lose the resulting no-confidence motion on Wednesday, brought down by the far right and the left combined.</p>

<p>The RN's decision to wield the knife underlines the power of a once-fringe party that became the largest parliamentary force after this summer's snap election.</p>

<p>But it is a risky play at a complex domestic and geopolitical moment from a party seeking to portray itself as a stable government in waiting.</p>

<p>And even if Le Pen's gambit brings the RN to power sooner than expected, she will inherit the same fiscal mess that humbled Barnier, with investors increasingly alarmed by France's 6% budget deficit.</p>

<p>"The RN is wrong to vote to topple the government because it will bear the responsibility," Eric Woerth, a former minister and lawmaker from Macron's camp, told Reuters. "It is they who will have pressed the button and no-one else... The RN has shown that it is not a party of government."</p>

<p>Paul Molac, a centrist lawmaker, told Reuters the RN may be vulnerable to Barnier's claims it seeks to "heap disorder atop disorder," making it harder to win support from the moderate conservatives it needs to win the Elysee.</p>

<p>"Marine Le Pen wants to be president and she's organising chaos?" said centre-right lawmaker Yannick Neuder.</p>

<p>The RN cannot topple the government alone and will need to join forces with the left, a group she has often described as a grave danger to France. That, too, could weaken her standing among more moderate conservatives.</p>

<p>Le Pen appeared aware of that danger, writing on X on Tuesday that critics alleging "collusion between the National Rally and (the hard-left) France Unbowed" were spreading "disinformation." She has previously rejected accusations the RN are "artisans of chaos" as "fake news."</p>

<h2><strong>EARLY ELECTION?</strong></h2>

<p>Le Pen on Monday said Barnier should have done more to incorporate the RN's concerns given its strong showing in the election.</p>

<p>She said the constitution provided three ways out of the crisis. Two of them - a reshuffle or another dissolution of parliament - were currently unviable, leaving a third and final option: Macron's resignation.</p>

<p>"This is the decision and the responsibility of the President of the Republic," she said.</p>

<p>RN spokesman Philippe Ballard told Reuters Macron's resignation "could be a way out" of the crisis.</p>

<p>Patrick Weil, a historian of the far right, said Le Pen had made a risky move but her reasons for doing so were clear.</p>

<p>"She wants an early election," he said, predicting Le Pen would reject all Macron's proposed prime ministers, forcing him into resigning. "It'll be checkmate. If all the governments he names are rejected, what can he do?"</p>

<p>RN lawmaker Thomas Menage told Reuters any future government that failed to incorporate the party's budgetary red lines "will very quickly face a no-confidence motion."</p>

<p>Observers say a Macron resignation is unlikely but not impossible. Should he step down, the Senate president would step in until a new presidential election for a full term can be held.</p>

<p>As part of the budget negotiations, the RN had called for the scrapping of an electricity tax hike, to raise pensions in line with inflation, to scrap cuts to medication reimbursements, freeze a gas tax hike and cut France's EU contributions.</p>

<h2><strong>TRYING TIMES</strong></h2>

<p>Le Pen's political future may also be influencing her decision-making. She is on trial for embezzling EU funds, with a verdict due on March 31. Prosecutors have sought an obligatory five-year ban from public office that would prevent her from running for president in 2027.</p>

<p>Le Pen denies the allegations, and that her legal woes are influencing her calculations. Still, her attacks against Barnier's budget intensified after the prosecutors made their request, and people close to Barnier said they thought the trial had forced her to change tack.</p>

<p>Ultimately, her hopes of reaching the Elysee may rest on winning an early election.</p>

<p>She's not the only political figure to bet on a pre-2027 vote: Macron's former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe in September announced his candidacy for "the next presidential election" and his allies said he wasn't ruling out a presidential election as soon as 2025.</p>

<p>Macron, who can only be impeached by a two-thirds majority in both houses, has already rejected resigning early.</p>

<p>"But as we have seen before, Macron can surprise and shift from previous positions," EuroIntelligence said in a note.</p>

<p>The crisis is unlikely to please investors who this week pushed French borrowing costs above those of Greece.</p>

<p>"The RN says 'I don't have the solution to plug the hole, it's up to the government to plug the hole,'" said Woerth, the Macronista lawmaker. "It's an incomprehensible, irresponsible position."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles police have classified Hannah Kobayashi, a 30-year-old who vanished after arriving from Maui, as a voluntary missing person.</p>

<p>New video evidence shows Kobayashi entering Mexico on foot at the San Ysidro port of entry on November 12th.</p>

<p>"As the family is aware, late yesterday after traveling to the US-Mexico border we reviewed video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico," said LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell during a press conference.</p>

<p>"She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed," he added.</p>

<p>Kobayashi's family reported her missing on November 11th after she failed to board her connecting flight to New York from Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Security footage captured her at various locations in LA between November 8th and 11th. &nbsp;Investigators also determined she retrieved her luggage at LAX and used public transportation to reach the border.</p>

<p>"To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity," McDonnell emphasised. "We respect her right to privacy but understand her family's concern."</p>

<p>Prior to leaving Maui, Kobayashi expressed a desire to disconnect from technology, according to police.</p>

<p>Authorities interviewed individuals Kobayashi interacted with in LA, including someone who met her at LAX. Their statements corroborated with the new video evidence.</p>

<p>The LAPD is urging Kobayashi to contact her family, law enforcement, or a US embassy to confirm her well-being.</p>

<p>"We've basically done everything we can do at this point, she's left the country, and in another nation now," Chief McDonnell said. He also added that the investigation will not be carried forward to Mexico. If Kobayashi returns to the U.S., law enforcement will be notified, he said.</p>

<p>The announcement comes after the tragic passing of Kobayashi's father, Ryan, who died by suicide on November 24th while searching for his daughter. He was found dead because of multiple blunt force traumatic injuries according to the LA medical examiner.</p>

<p>A GoFundMe established by the family has raised nearly $47,000 to support search efforts and funeral expenses.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia has executed more than 300 people this year, a record tally based on official figures, after state media said four more people were put to death on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The latest executions were carried out against three people convicted of drug smuggling and another for murder, the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing the interior ministry.</p>

<p>It brings the total number of executions for the year so far to 303, according to an AFP tally based on state media reports.</p>

<p>The Gulf monarchy had enacted the death penalty 200 times by the end of September, according to the same tally of official data, indicating a rapid rate of executions in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia executed the third highest number of prisoners in the world in 2023 after China and Iran, according to Amnesty International.</p>

<p>Previously the record number of executions in a single year in the country had stood at 196 in 2022, said the London-based human rights group, which began compiling the annual figures in 1990.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia carried out 170 executions in 2023, according to an AFP tally of official data.</p>

<p>Taha al-Hajji, legal director of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights (ESOHR), condemned the "rocket speed" of executions in 2024, calling it "incomprehensible and inexplicable".</p>

<p><strong>'Unprecedented'</strong></p>

<p>Human rights activists had previously warned Saudi Arabia could exceed 300 executions this year, with one execution being recorded almost every day.</p>

<p>Lina al-Hathloul, head of communications for the London-based ALQST human rights organisation, said the number of executions was "unprecedented".</p>

<p>"This grim milestone shows the Saudi authorities' flagrant disregard for the right to life and contradicts their own pledges to limit use of the death penalty," she said.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of oil, has faced consistent criticism over its use of the death penalty, which rights groups have condemned as excessive and in marked contrast to the kingdom's efforts to present a modern image to the world.</p>

<p>In 2022, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told The Atlantic the kingdom had eliminated the death penalty with the exception extreme cases.</p>

<p>But the ESOHR's Hajji said the kingdom's de facto ruler "will address this issue and say that execution is used for the most serious crimes such as murder... but the reality and numbers do not lie and completely contradict these statements".</p>

<p>Although figures before 1990 are unclear, The Washington Post reported that 63 people were beheaded in 1980 after the previous year's seizure by Islamist militants of Islam's holiest place, the Grand Mosque in Mecca.</p>

<p>Riyadh has previously said the death penalty is necessary to "maintain public order" and sentences are only carried out if "the defendants have exhausted all levels of litigation".</p>

<p><strong>Drug-related charges</strong></p>

<p>This year's executions included 103 people convicted on charges related to drug smuggling and 45 people in cases related to terrorism, according to the AFP tally including Tuesday's announcements.</p>

<p>The kingdom ended a three-year moratorium on the execution of drug offenders at the end of 2022, putting 19 to death in a month.</p>

<p>In 2022, the United Nations said imposing the death penalty for drug crimes "contradicts international norms and standards", calling on the Saudi authorities to "halt the implementation of death sentences for drug crimes".</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia also executed 113 foreigners, another record, most of them on drug-related charges.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has carried out more than 1,000 executions since King Salman bin Abdulaziz came to power in 2015, according to a joint report by the London-based anti-death penalty organisation Reprieve and ESOHR published early last year.</p>

<p>Among them, 81 people were executed in a single day for terrorism convictions in March 2022, sparking widespread international condemnation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 27-year-old woman in the US who killed and ate a cat has been sentenced to one year in jail after a furious judge slammed her for the stomach-turning act. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, Allexis Ferrell committed the gruesome act in August outside her home in Ohio. A bodycam footage from police officers who reached her house showed the 27-year-old on all fours outdoors eating the cat as horrified neighbours looked on. "What did you do? Why did you kill the cat?" a police officer is heard asking the woman in the clip. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, Stark Country Common Pleas Judge Frank Forchione called Ferrell a national embarrassment. "You've embarrassed this county. You've embarrassed this nation. More importantly, you've embarrassed yourself," the judge said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/02/us-news/disgusted-judge-puts-away-woman-who-ate-cat-in-stomach-turning-video-youve-embarrassed-this-nation/" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To me, you present quite a danger to our community. This is repulsive to me. I mean, that anyone would do this to an animal. And an animal's like a child. I don't know if you understand that or not. I can't express the disappointment, shock, disgust that this crime has brought to me. I don't know what could prompt anyone to want to eat a cat," Mr Forchione continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The judge sentenced Ferrell to one year in jail after she pleaded guilty to a felony charge of animal cruelty. According to the <em>Post</em>, her one-year sentence will be added to a separate 18-month sentence she is facing for two previous crimes including a theft in 201 and a child endangerment case from last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stark County Prosecutor Chelsea Small called the cat incident disturbing. "It's one of the most disturbing cases that I've seen as a prosecutor," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ferrell's attorney Stephen Kandel, however, said that that shocking video makes it clear that the 27-year-old "has an issue with drugs and alcohol, through her evaluation, through her past history". He added that he has arranged for his client to undergo inpatient treatment after her release.</p>

<p>Notably, Ferrell's case became a part of online presidential campaign chatter after Donald Trump and JD Vance claimed that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were eating local pets. Later, officials clarified that Ferrell is not an immigrant and her case is not tied to that claim. She was born in Ohio and graduated from Canton McKinley High School in 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

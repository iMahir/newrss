       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A joint operation by American and Iraqi forces killed 15 members of the Islamic State group in western Iraq, with seven US troops injured during the operation, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said Friday.</p>

<p>The raid targeted Islamic State leaders and was carried out early Thursday morning, resulting "in the death of 15 ISIS operatives" with "no indication of civilian casualties," CENTCOM said on the social media platform X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces and Iraqi Security Forces conducted a partnered raid in Western Iraq in the early hours of Aug. 29, resulting in the death of 15 ISIS operatives. The ISIS element was armed with numerous weapons, grenades, and explosive "suicide" belts. There… <a href="https://t.co/fCOFyxtke1">pic.twitter.com/fCOFyxtke1</a></p>
— U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) <a href="https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1829690125896351762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It said the IS members were "armed with numerous weapons, grenades, and explosive 'suicide' belts," and that Iraqi forces were continuing "to further exploit the locations raided," only specifying that the operation occurred in western Iraq.</p>

<p>Five US troops were wounded during the raid and another two were injured in falls, a defense official said. One of the wounded was evacuated for treatment, as was one of the personnel injured in a fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All seven were in stable condition, the official said.</p>

<p>"ISIS remains a threat to the region, our allies, as well as our homeland. US CENTCOM alongside our coalition and Iraqi partners, will continue to aggressively pursue these terrorists," CENTCOM added.</p>

<p>The operation comes as Baghdad and Washington have been engaged in months of talks over the presence of anti-jihadist coalition forces in Iraq.</p>

<p>Despite Iraq's stated goal of a full withdrawal of the forces, no timeline has been made public.</p>

<p>The United States has some 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>Coalition forces have been targeted dozens of times with drones and rocket fire in both Iraq and Syria, as violence related to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that broke out in early October has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups across the Middle East.</p>

<p>Last winter, the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, claimed some 175 rocket and drone attacks against US troops in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>US forces have carried out multiple retaliatory strikes against these militant factions in both countries.</p>

<p>Thursday's raid also comes just under a week after US forces killed a senior leader of an Al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group in Syria.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Biologist Cesar Garzon was searching for a small, endangered parakeet in southern Ecuador when he was warned he may be kidnapped, highlighting the danger for scientists in the biodiverse country engulfed in narco violence.</p>

<p>"Do your work somewhere else because it is dangerous here," he said a man told him in April, in the troubled mining town of Camilo Ponce Enriquez.</p>

<p>That night, the town's mayor was shot dead. Earlier this month, a clash between criminal groups in the town left five dead, two of whom were found decapitated, and one burned.</p>

<p>Garzon, a bird expert at the state-run National Institute of Biodiversity (Inabio), tried to continue his research in a neighbouring town, whose mayor was also killed.</p>

<p>Tired of the ever-present danger, he packed his bags and returned to Quito.</p>

<p>Garzon has been studying the El Oro parakeet for two decades, working for its conservation and supporting the sustainable management of its habitats.</p>

<p>Mostly green, with a red forehead, the bird is endemic to Ecuador and has only been seen in the country's southwest provinces of Azuay and El Oro.</p>

<p>With only an estimated 1,000 specimens remaining, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it as in danger of extinction.</p>

<p>Garzon visited Camilo Ponce Enriquez, in Azuay province, to track down and study the endangered parakeet.</p>

<p>But the gold-rich town is in the grips of the Los Lobos drug trafficking gang, which finances its activities with illegal mining.</p>

<p>"We are left with uncertainty and frustration (...) There is a lack of information on that site," he told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said the violence was a blow to conservation as there "could be important areas that are home to endemic or threatened species and we can't do anything."</p>

<h3><strong>'Windows of opportunity'</strong></h3>

<p>Sandwiched between Colombia and Peru -- the world's top cocaine producers -- once-peaceful Ecuador has seen violence explode in recent years as enemy gangs with links to Mexican and Colombian cartels vie for control.</p>

<p>As the gangs have gained ground, homicides in Ecuador soared from six per 100,000 inhabitants in 2018 to a record 47 per 100,000 in 2023.</p>

<p>Mario Yanez, another biologist from Inabio, said his current work revolves around finding "windows of opportunity" to continue researching despite the violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists work closely with local communities and authorities and do shorter field trips or focus on similar species located in less risky areas.</p>

<p>"The levels of violence have led to total restrictions in certain areas of the country," especially on the coast and where there is mining, said Yanez.</p>

<p>These places carry the "stigma" of the violence and that "unfortunately is limiting international cooperation funds to be able to carry out conservation actions," he added,</p>

<p>The private Lalo Loor reserve in southwestern Manabi is one of Ecuador's last intact remnants of a unique ecosystem known as a coastal dry forest, home to many endemic species.</p>

<p>The province is also a drug trafficking stronghold. Due to the security crisis, American universities cancelled an annual visit of researchers and students to the reserve, a major source of income for Lalo Loor.</p>

<p>Their continued absence could force the reserve's administrative office to shutter, manager Mariela Loor said.</p>

<p>Judith Denkinger, a German biologist at the private Universidad San Francisco de Quito, told AFP that since 2022 she has put on hold her two decades of research into humpback whales on the coast of the conflict-ridden northwestern province of Esmeraldas, bordering Colombia.</p>

<p>She has been unable to gather photographic or acoustic records of the humpback whales that come to the equatorial Pacific to mate and give birth.</p>

<p>She also highlighted the plight of fishermen -- who she often works with at sea.</p>

<p>"Pirates, who are usually drug traffickers, come and threaten them, hijack their boat or steal their motor or kidnap them" to force them into drug trafficking, she said.</p>

<p>Daniel Vizuete, a specialist in Social Studies of Science and Technology at the Flacso University in Quito, said research related to the environment was "perhaps the most eroded precisely because it occurs ... in places where institutions are weaker."</p>

<p>"That means that even the lives of researchers can be at risk," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also points to other possible effects of criminal violence on science such as a "setback in terms of participation of women."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Needling her as “Comrade Kamaala” and describing his Democratic Party rival as an inveterate second-generation Marxist, Donald Trump on Friday campaigned in Pennsylvania, a key milestone on the road to the White House, where his lead in polls appears to be evaporating.</p>

<p>While Kamala Harris has moved to the centre and, at least publicly, renounced her radical past, Trump played back on giant TV screens at his rally in Johnstown clips of Harris' old statements aimed at her party's left.</p>

<p>During her failed run for the presidential nomination in 2019, Harris had vowed to ban fracking – a way of drilling for natural gas in shale formations underground – and Trump kept hammering at it because that is an important issue for Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In an interview on Thursday, Harris acknowledged she had changed her position and would not ban fracking, while also declaring repeatedly, “My values have not changed”.</p>

<p>With a phalanx of labourers dressed in their work clothes topped by hardhats standing behind him, he declared that from Day One, his policy would be “Drill baby, drill” for fossil fuels including gas.</p>

<p>At his rally in an indoor arena in Johnstown, her long ago pronouncements – that she has since walked back – on ending private health insurance, decriminalising illegal border crossing, cutting funding for police, and compulsorily buying back guns from owners rolled on screens, and Trump turned them into a handy scare tactic.</p>

<p>“She is a Marxist, her father is a Marxist”, Trump said, referring to her father Donald Harris, the Jamaica-born Stanford University emeritus professor of economics, from whom she is estranged.</p>

<p>RealClear Politics aggregation of Pennsylvania polls shows that Trump's 3 per cent lead over Harris in July when Biden withdrew has disappeared with the Democrat now having a narrow 0.8 per cent lead.</p>

<p>In the US system where the state-wise composition of the electoral college can override the national popular votes, Pennsylvania is one of the battleground states that go either way and help determine the winner.</p>

<p>Nationally Reuters/Ipsos and Morning Consult polls taken since last week give her a 4 per cent lead and the overall RealClear Politics aggregation puts her ahead by 1.8 per cent.</p>

<p>One of the clips projected was of her agreeing with an interviewer that she would agree to change government dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat, a category that includes beef.</p>

<p>He criticised her for this at the rally, as he has at previous campaign stops.</p>

<p>It could be interpreted as a subtle dig at her Indian heritage as he raised it days after having claimed that Harris has all along been an Indian and only recently proclaimed her African American background.</p>

<p>(In reality, her public acknowledgment of her Indian heritage came long after projecting her political persona as Black.)</p>

<p>At the rally he gave a shout-out to Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu elected to Congress, for leaving the Democratic Party to support him.</p>

<p>“I feel very happy to get” her endorsement, he said</p>

<p>While Trump chastised Harris' flip-flops, he too showed at the rally what would be a dissent from the core of conservative orthodoxy by reaffirming his backing for insurance or government-funded in vitro fertilisation.</p>

<p>A Bench of conservative judges in Alabama ruled that eggs fertilised through medical procedures are considered “unborn children” creating a legal quagmire that the Republican leaders are trying to get out of.</p>

<p>"We need more babies to be born in America", said the father of five from three marriages.</p>

<p>Trump's rallies are staged as political theater where he keeps his faithful amused and aroused jumping back and forth disjointedly between topics, leavening them with humor, mostly at the expense of his adversaries.</p>

<p>He called this speaking style, “weaving”, while he acknowledged some others dub it "rambling".</p>

<p>“I'll talk about nine things and they all come back brilliantly together”, he said.</p>

<p>Trump railed against the news media calling it biased and a man jumped into the media enclosure.</p>

<p>The intruder was hit by police with a jolt of electricity from a Taser device to subdue him and as he was led away to the crowd's cheers, the Republican candidate asked, “Is there anywhere that's more fun to be than a Trump rally”?</p>

<p>He joked that Harris would ask to join his Make America Great Again Movement and wear its signature red cap because she was backpedaling her past pronouncements.</p>

<p>He nicknamed Harris' running mate Tim Walz as “Tampon Tim” for the state he governs, Minnesota, putting female hygiene products in boys' school bathrooms in the name of equality for transgender students.</p>

<p>Plunging into divisive cultural issues, he said that he would ban men from participating as women in sports, stop sex change therapy for children, and reinforce parents' rights.</p>

<p>He added he would criminalise burning the national flag and enforce laws against damaging national monuments.</p>

<p>On foreign policy, he talked of his interactions with Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and his tough bargaining.</p>

<p>Harris would not be able to stand up to the likes of Xi and Putin, he asserted.</p>

<p>He blamed her for the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle in which 13 US military personnel were killed and defended his visit to their graves at the military cemetery in Washington where his entourage had a run-in with a Defence employee who said she was enforcing rules against politicising the place.</p>

<p>He said that he only agreed to the request from family members for pictures at the gravesite.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a months-long standoff over disinformation, a Brazilian Supreme Court judge banned billionaire Elon Musk's social media network X in the country on Friday. The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, ordered the "immediate, complete and comprehensive suspension of the operation of" X in the country and told the national communications agency to take "all necessary measures" to implement the order.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/brazils-supreme-court-orders-suspension-of-elon-musks-x-amid-row-6456202" target="_blank">Alexandre de Moraes</a> also threatened a fine of 50,000 reais ($8,900) to anyone who used "technological subterfuges" to get around the block, such as a VPN or the virtual private network.</p>

<h3><strong>The Elon Musk-Brazil Judge Controversy</strong></h3>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-slams-brazil-pseudo-judge-after-order-to-suspend-x-6456714" target="_blank">Elon Musk-Alexandre de Moraes controversy</a> began when the Supreme Court judge ordered the suspension of several accounts on X, formerly known as Twitter, belonging to supporters of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro, who tried to discredit the voting system in the 2022 election, which he lost.</p>

<p>Brazilian authorities are investigating whether Bolsonaro plotted a coup attempt to prevent current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from assuming office in January 2023.</p>

<p>In April, Moraes ordered an investigation of Musk, accusing him of reactivating some of the banned accounts.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-compares-brazils-chief-justice-to-harry-potter-villain-voldemort-6362346" target="_blank"><strong>ALSO READ | Elon Musk Compares Brazil's Chief Justice To Harry Potter Villain Voldemort</strong></a></p>

<p>X claims that Moraes threatened to arrest one of the company's legal representatives in Brazil if it did not comply.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musks-x-to-close-brazil-operations-over-censorship-orders-6359957" target="_blank">Musk's platform had shut all of its Brazil offices</a> due to what it called "censorship" by the judge, though its service had remained available for users in the country.</p>

<p>"We have a right to defend fundamental rights. Those who violate democracy, who violate fundamental human rights, whether in person or through social media, must be held accountable," Moraes said in a speech on Friday, apparently referring to X.</p>

<h3><strong>Ban On Elon Musk' X In Brazil</strong></h3>

<p>The Brazilian Supreme Court judge said the suspension would remain until all related court orders on X were complied with, including the payment of fines amounting to 18.5 million reais ($3.28 million), which he had previously slapped on the social media network for ignoring judicial orders.</p>

<p>The order will also be valid until a representative of the company in the country is appointed, he said.</p>

<p>Moraes also froze the financial assets of Musk's Starlink by issuing an order to block the accounts of the satellite internet network that has rapidly expanded the number of its users in Brazil.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/brazil-threatens-to-suspend-elon-musks-x-in-country-within-24-hours-6441356" target="_blank">he told Musk he had 24 hours</a> to find a new representative or he would face suspension. However, as the deadline passed, X said in a statement that it expected Moraes to shut it down "simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents."</p>

<p>X reportedly has more than 22 million users in Brazil.</p>

<h3><strong>What Elon Musk Said</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-need-to-move-brazil-employees-to-safe-place-5404285" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a>, who took over X in 2022, reacted sharply to the ban and branded Alexandre de Moraes an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge".</p>

<p>He also accused him of "trying to destroy democracy in Brazil."</p>

<p>"Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>"They're shutting down the #1 source of truth in Brazil," Musk added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A group of Indigenous women are hoping to stop the bulldozers at a former Montreal hospital which they believe could hold the truth about children still missing from a grisly half-century-old CIA experiment.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Indigenous women are hoping to stop the bulldozers at a former Montreal hospital which they believe could hold the truth about children still missing from a grisly half-century-old CIA experiment.</p>

<p>They have spent the last two years trying to delay the construction project by McGill University and the Quebec government.</p>

<p>"They took our children and had all kinds of things done to them. They were experimenting on them," said Kahentinetha, an 85-year-old activist from the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, southwest of Montreal, who goes by just one name.</p>

<p>The activists are relying on archives and testimonies that suggest the site contains unmarked graves of children formerly interned at the Royal Victoria Hospital and Allan Memorial Institute, a neighbouring psychiatric hospital.</p>

<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, behind the austere walls of the old psychiatric institute, the US Central Intelligence Agency funded a human experiments program called MK Ultra.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, the program aimed to develop procedures and drugs to effectively brainwash people.</p>

<p>Experiments were conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States, subjecting people -- including Indigenous children in Montreal -- to electroshocks, hallucinogenic drugs, and sensory deprivation.</p>

<p>"They wanted to erase us," said Kahentinetha.</p>

<p>A leading figure in the Indigenous rights movement who has travelled to Britain and the United States to denounce colonialism, she called this fight "the most important of (her) life."</p>

<p>"We want to know why they did this and who's going to take the blame for it," she said.</p>

<h2><strong>Sniffer dogs</strong></h2>

<p>In the fall of 2022, the mothers obtained an injunction to suspend work on a new university campus and research centre at the site -- a project worth Can$870 million (US$643 million).</p>

<p>Fellow activist Kwetiio, 52, who also uses just one name, said they insisted on arguing the case themselves without lawyers, "because in our ways, no one speaks for us."</p>

<p>Last summer, sniffer dogs and specialized probes were brought in to search the property's expansive and dilapidated buildings. They managed to identify three areas of interest for excavations.</p>

<p>But, according to McGill and the government's Societe Quebecoise des Infrastructure (SQI), "no human remains have been discovered."</p>

<p>The Mohawk mothers accuse the university and the government infrastructure agency of breaching an agreement by selecting the archaeologists who did the search and then ending their work too soon.</p>

<p>"They gave themselves the power to lead the investigation of crimes that were potentially committed by their own employees in the past," says Philippe Blouin, an anthropologist working with the mothers.</p>

<p>Even though their appeal was dismissed earlier this month, they have vowed to continue their fight.</p>

<p>"People should know history, so that it does not repeat itself," said Kwetiio.</p>

<p>In recent years, Canada has opened its eyes to past atrocities.</p>

<p>Generations of Indigenous children were sent to residential schools where they were stripped of their language, culture and identities in what a 2015 truth and reconciliation report said amounted to "cultural genocide."</p>

<p>Between 1831 and 1996, some 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their homes and placed in 139 such schools. Several thousand never returned to their communities.</p>

<p>In May 2021, the discovery of unmarked graves of 215 children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia started a national reflection on this dark chapter of Canadian history, while sparking searches for more graves across Canada.</p>

<p>"It was not only residential schools, it involved hospitals, sanatoriums, churches and orphanages too," said Kwetiio.</p>

<p>For her, what is most important is shedding light on what happened in order for "things to change," and to recreate "the harmony that we had before colonialism."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman stabbed and wounded five people in a bus in western Germany on Friday, police said, one week after a deadly knife attack that shook the country.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old suspect was arrested after the incident in the town of Siegen with no indications it was a terrorist attack, the local police force said in a statement.</p>

<p>Three of the five victims are in life-threatening condition, one is seriously wounded and the fifth is only lightly injured.</p>

<p>Germany was rocked by a stabbing attack one week ago that left three people dead and eight wounded in the western city of Solingen.</p>

<p>The identity of the suspected attacker, a 26-year-old Syrian man who was previously due for deportation to Bulgaria, stoked debate about Germany's immigration and asylum policies.</p>

<p>The killings have prompted Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government to announce new restrictions on carrying knives at public gatherings and on long-distance transport, as well as curbing benefits for some illegal migrants.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, police shot dead a man suspected of attacking passers-by with knives in the western town of Moers near Solingen.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Egyptian worker was killed Friday in a hotel fight that wounded three Arab-Israeli tourists and other workers in the Egyptian seaside town of Taba, a medical source told AFP.</p>

<p>The worker succumbed to his injuries "in an ambulance transporting him from Taba" on the border with Israel to Sharm al-Sheikh, 200 kilometres south, the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p>

<p>Three other workers and three "Arab 48" tourists were also wounded, state-linked Egyptian media Al-Qahera News reported.</p>

<p>"Arab 48" is a term that refers to Palestinians and their descendants who remained in Israel following its creation in 1948.</p>

<p>Friday's fight broke out between hotel staff and the tourists "who attempted to obtain services from the hotel without charge", the channel reported.</p>

<p>Al-Qahera News, which is linked to state intelligence, reported security authorities were investigating the incident.</p>

<p>A high-level security source denied Israeli media reports describing the altercation as a "stabbing operation".</p>

<p>The incident occurred in the Egyptian border town of Taba in South Sinai, which is a popular tourist destination for Israelis.</p>

<p>Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and has for decades played a key role as a mediator between Israeli and Palestinian officials, including in the current war in the Gaza Strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There is an "undeniable complicity" of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with terrorist groups, former US National Security Advisor Lt Gen (retd) H R McMaster has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an "undeniable complicity" of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with terrorist groups, former US National Security Advisor Lt Gen (retd) H R McMaster has said, revealing that during his tenure under then President Donald Trump, the White House faced resistance from the state department and Pentagon over providing security aid to Islamabad.</p>

<p>Despite directions from Trump to stop all aid to Pakistan till it stops giving safe havens to terrorists, McMaster in his latest book 'At War with Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House' says that the then Defence Secretary Jim Mattis was planning to deliver a military aid package to Islamabad that included over USD 150 million worth of armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>However, the aid was stopped after his intervention, McMaster writes in the book that hit the bookstores this week.</p>

<p>“It was difficult to get State and Defence even to comply with Trump's directives to stop certain activities. I discovered that contrary to the South Asia strategy, which called for the suspension of all aid to Pakistan with a few exceptions, when Mattis visited Islamabad in the coming weeks, the Pentagon was going to deliver a military aid package that included more than USD 150 million worth of armoured vehicles,” he writes.</p>

<p>McMaster says soon after he came to know about it, he called for a meeting with Mattis, the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Gina Haspel, and other senior officials.</p>

<p>“I started by noting that the president (Trump) had been very clear on multiple occasions to suspend aid to the Pakistanis until they halted support for terrorist organisations that were killing Afghans, Americans, and coalition members in Afghanistan...We had all heard Trump say, 'I do not want any money going to Pakistan',” he says.</p>

<p>Mattis, the former NSA writes, noted the possibility that Pakistan might retaliate in certain ways, but others, including Ambassador David Hale, who had joined by video from Islamabad, did not share those concerns.</p>

<p>“Mattis reluctantly halted that shipment of assistance, but other aid would continue, prompting Trump to tweet on New Year's Day, 'The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan with little help. No more!',” he writes.</p>

<p>“Pakistan was not changing its behaviour, and almost as an insult, the government released Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, on the eve of Mattis's visit. Moreover, a recent event in Pakistan involving hostages had exposed the undeniable complicity of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence with the terrorists,” McMaster writes.</p>

<p>He notes that news reports that time criticised the president's tweet as capricious and devoid of a coherent policy. But halting assistance was a critical part of the South Asia strategy that Trump had approved at Camp David in August, he says.</p>

<p>"A lunch that the president hosted with the vice president, Tillerson, Mattis, Kelly, and me on December 14 helped me understand why it was difficult to implement Trump's guidance on Pakistan or to foster cooperation on contingency plans for North Korea,” says McMaster.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US regulators on Friday cleared SpaceX to restart launching its stalwart Falcon 9 rocket, as a probe continues into a rare mishap this week during a first-stage booster landing.</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the Falcon 9 rocket on Wednesday after a first-stage booster tipped over and exploded while attempting to land on a droneship off the Florida coast.</p>

<p>The early morning launch was otherwise successful, delivering the latest batch of 21 Starlink internet satellites into orbit.</p>

<p>"The SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle may return to flight operations while the overall investigation of the anomaly during the Starlink Group 8-6 mission remains open, provided all other license requirements are met," the FAA said in a statement Friday.</p>

<p>A webcast from Elon Musk's company showed the first stage, which normally fires its thrusters to achieve a precise upright landing, tilting and blowing up as it descended onto a droneship off the Florida coast.</p>

<p>Although landing the booster is a secondary objective, and no lives or public property were at risk, the reusability of the entire rocket system is crucial to SpaceX's business model.</p>

<p>It broke a more than three-year streak of hundreds of successful booster landings.</p>

<p>Falcon 9 is the workhorse of SpaceX's fleet, trusted by the US government and private industry to propel satellites and astronauts into orbit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was last grounded for around two weeks in July when its second-stage engine experienced an anomaly that prevented it from deploying another batch of Starlink satellites at the correct altitude, leading them to burn up on re-entry through Earth's atmosphere</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A newly-elected UK MP from the Labour Party, Jas Athwal, has landed in controversy after reports emerged of appalling conditions in rental properties he owns. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg1j0lv1go?">BBC</a>, black mould and ant infestations have been found in flats managed by Mr Athwal, who holds the distinction of being the biggest landlord in the House of Commons with 15 rental properties.</p>

<p>Tenants in a block of seven flats in Ilford South have reported severe mould problems, with some residents having to clean their ceilings regularly to prevent the toxic substance from spreading. The situation is exacerbated by ant infestations that have made living conditions unbearable. One tenant described ants crawling on their child's body, while another feared eviction after voicing concerns about the dismal state of their flat.</p>

<p>"The ants are everywhere," one resident said. "They are on my kid's body and on their clothes."</p>

<p>Mr Athwal, expressing shock and remorse, has pledged to address these issues urgently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrew Boff, a Conservative member of the London Assembly, has called for an investigation by the Labour Party. Exploitative practices in the rental market was one of the issues that the Labour Party vowed to tackle in its 2024 general election manifesto.</p>

<p>"I'm deeply concerned," said Mr Boff. "I worry that there are people who are Jas Athwal's tenants who are now frightened to speak for fear of being evicted. We've heard this time and time again about how the threat of eviction is used to excuse poor maintenance of properties."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 21-year-old student from Nepal was shot dead allegedly by an Indian-origin man at her apartment in US during a robbery, police said on Saturday. The man, who has been identified as 52-year-old Bobby Sinh Shah, has been arrested.</p>

<p>Muna Pandey, a community college student, was found with multiple gunshot wounds inside her Houston apartment around 5.30 pm on Monday, police said. Staff at her apartment complex told police that they received an anonymous call about a body inside the apartment. When the police reached the scene, she was declared dead.</p>

<p>Two days later, police released a photo of Shah who was caught on CCTV leaving her apartment on Saturday. Police said Shah was arrested later that day at a traffic stop and charged with murder.</p>

<p>According to a GoFundMe page, Ms Pandey had moved to study at the Houston Community College from Nepal in 2021. Her mother had been trying to reach her for days before her body was found inside her apartment, a member of Nepalese Association of Houston told the New York Post.</p>

<p>"What her Mom said is her phone was always online. After Saturday night, phone was offline. She had three gunshots and she was laying down on the bed, with head down. Hopefully, the investigation will come up with some idea of how this happened," he said, adding that Ms Pandey was an only child.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The association is working with the Nepal Consulate to help make travel arrangements for Ms Pandey's mother to fly to Houston.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are reaching out to you, our community, to help bring Anita to the United States so she can say goodbye to her only child and give Muna the farewell she deserves. The funds raised will be used to cover the costs of Muna's funeral and to bring her mother to Houston to be with her daughter's body for the final rituals," reads the GoFundMe page that has raised nearly $30,000.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of two doctors who are among the five people charged in the ketamine overdose death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry was barred by a federal judge on Friday from practising medicine and through his lawyer afterwards expressed remorse.</p>

<p>Dr Mark Chavez appeared in US District Court in Los Angeles for a brief arraignment on a single felony count of conspiracy to illegally distribute ketamine and was permitted to remain free on a $50,000 bond.</p>

<p>Chavez has previously signed an agreement with federal prosecutors to enter a guilty plea, which defence lawyer Matt Binninger told reporters his client would do at a later proceeding to be scheduled within a few weeks. No plea was entered on Friday.</p>

<p>As part of the bond conditions set by Magistrate Judge Jean Rosenbluth, Chavez also surrendered his passport and was ordered not to practice medicine. He had agreed to surrender his medical license at a separate administrative hearing earlier this week, according to a spokesperson for the US Attorney's Office.</p>

<p>"My client is accepting responsibility. He's doing everything in his power to cooperate, to help in this situation, and he's incredibly remorseful," Binninger said outside the courthouse.</p>

<p>The lawyer added that Chavez's regret stemmed not from Perry's celebrity but from the fact that "someone who was trying to seek treatment died."</p>

<p>The attorney declined to discuss any details of the case. Chavez, with a downcast expression on his face, stood beside his lawyer but made no comment.</p>

<p>Another physician charged in the case, Dr Salvador Plasencia, has pleaded not guilty, as has co-defendant Jasveen Sangha, who authorities said was an illicit supplier of the drug and was known as the "ketamine queen."</p>

<p>Perry's live-in personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, who admitted to injecting Perry, and the alleged middleman who said he obtained ketamine from Sangha, have already pleaded guilty to charges they faced.</p>

<p>Authorities said Plasencia purchased ketamine from Chavez, and in text messages to Chavez discussing the amount to charge Perry for the drug wrote: "I wonder how much this moron will pay."</p>

<p>Perry died at age 54 in October 2023 from "acute effects" of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub, according to a December 2023 autopsy report.</p>

<p>The actor had publicly acknowledged decades of substance abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to dismiss a few hundred employees in the coming weeks as part of the firm's annual cull of low-performing staff, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The fresh round of firings would bring total cuts in 2024 to about 3% to 4% of the bank's workforce, with most of those reductions made earlier this year, one of the people said, asking not to be named discussing internal moves.</p>

<p>That's in line with the bank's typical approach as it seeks to keep a lid on costs and make room to enlist new talent. The annual exercise was briefly suspended in the middle of the Covid pandemic and was near the lower end of its typical 1% to 5% range last year.</p>

<p>Goldman employed 44,300 people at midyear. A company spokesperson said the bank's annual review of staff is normal and standard and that the company plans to have more employees at the end of 2024 than a year earlier.</p>

<p>The bank's stock climbed to an all-time high this week, rising more than 32% to surpass $510 by Friday's close of trading - making it the best performer among the top US banks. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day that Goldman is carrying out its annual cull.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least six people were killed and 59 others injured in a Russian strike on Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said.</p>

<p>Russia launched an attack with guided bombs from the Belgorod region, striking five locations, including a 12-story apartment building, Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on Telegram on Friday.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US State Department expressed disappointment on Friday, on the second anniversary of a United Nations report on human rights in Xinjiang, and called on China to take action and end the current repression of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups.</p>

<p>The 2022 report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded that "serious human rights violations" had been committed in the Xinjiang region.</p>

<p>Sharing a post on X, Matthew Miller, US State Department spokesperson said, "Two years since the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released an assessment on human rights violations in Xinjiang, the US continues to urge the PRC (People's Republic of China) to take immediate action and end the ongoing repression of Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups."</p>

<p>In 2022, after a multi-year assessment, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) concluded that "serious human rights violations have been committed" in Xinjiang, the US Department of State said in a press release.</p>

<p>The release further said that the United States is disappointed that after two years, the PRC continues to reject the OHCHR assessment's findings and refuses to implement the High Commissioner's recommendations to release all those arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, cease all intimidation and reprisals against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and abroad, and investigate allegations of human rights abuses, including torture, sexual violence, forced labor, and forced medical treatment.</p>

<p>The United States remains gravely concerned by the PRC's ongoing repression of predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, which the High Commissioner's assessment found "may constitute international crimes, particularly crimes against humanity." We again urge the PRC to take immediate action to end these ongoing atrocities, the release said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a day earlier, the Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international human rights watchdog, in a statement lamented the Chinese government for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang, claiming that the authorities have been persistently committing human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang.</p>

<p>While commenting on the situation, Maya Wang, the associate China director at Human Rights Watch, stated, "Beijing's brazen refusal to meaningfully address well-documented crimes in Xinjiang is no surprise, but shows the need for a robust follow-up by the UN human rights chief and UN member states. Contrary to the Chinese government's claims, its punitive campaign against millions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang continues to inflict great pain."</p>

<p>Thousands of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang continue to remain wrongfully imprisoned, wherein their relatives living domestically and abroad have little to no contact with their families in China. Many live with the uncertainty about whether their loved ones, sometimes dozens of their family and relatives, remain detained, imprisoned, or forcibly disappeared.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday reiterated India's stand regarding the Russia-Ukraine war and said that it will support any feasible and mutually acceptable solution or format that could restore peace.</p>

<p>Addressing a briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, " The decision as to when and how to commence peace talks is the prerogative of the two parties to the conflict. As friends and partners, we would support any feasible and mutually acceptable solution or format that could restore peace..."</p>

<p>Answering a question about Indians stuck in the Russian army, he said that 15 Indians, who were stuck in Russia, have been released and have returned to India adding that the Indian Embassy is in constant touch with the Russian authorities to facilitate the release of those who wish to return to India.</p>

<p>"We have an update as of now, as of today we have 15 Indians who have been released and they have returned to India, there are others who are waiting for discharge. Our mission, our embassy, is in touch with Russian authorities, and we hope that those who want to return back to india will be released soon," said Jaiswal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jaiswal said that India has always advocated constructive, solution-oriented, and practical engagement with all stakeholders to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

<p>This comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned from his visit to Ukraine where he had met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and advocated India's stand on achieving peace through dialogue.</p>

<p>Jaiswal stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already indicated India's willingness to play a constructive role in the interest of peace. He noted that the decision on when and how to begin peace talks is the prerogative of the two parties to the conflict.</p>

<p>"We have always advocated constructive, solution-oriented and practical engagement with all stakeholders to achieve a negotiated settlement to this conflict. This is evident in our outreach to both Russia and Ukraine at the highest level. PM has already indicated India's willingness to play a constructive role in the interest of peace. However, it is too early to comment on specific modalities and pathways at this stage," said the MEA spokesperson.</p>

<p>Following this, the MEA spokesperson also addressed the issue of Indian nationals stranded at the Sao Paolo Airport and stated that our Consulate is in contact with the Brazilian Foreign Office representative in Sao Paulo on the matter. They have also sought a meeting with the relevant authorities and are ascertaining further details.</p>

<p>"As far as the issue of indian stranded in the international airport in Sao Paulo is concerned, yes we are aware. here are several Indians. we also have a consulate in Sao Paulo. the consulate is in touch with the foreign office representative in the city. They have also sought a meeting with the local authorities. let me tell you what was reported in some medium, the indian there at the airport are been taken care of in terms of food nourishment etc..." said MEA.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, MEA also spoke at the CII Event on Africa and stated that "India-Africa relations are historic and special. Together with our African friends and partners, we want to strengthen the voice of the Global South. We are also keen to deepen our economic partnership with them."</p>

<p>"In pursuit of this objective, the 19th CII India-Africa Conclave was held in Delhi last week. It was inaugurated by the Hon'ble Vice President and attended by the Hon'ble Vice Presidents of Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Mauritius and Zimbabwe. In addition, we had 40 Ministerial participants from Africa and 1200 delegates from 65 countries attending the event. The conclave has given a major boost to our economic ties with African countries," MEA added.</p>

<p>"Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has had a long engagement with Africa and keeping in mind its importance, started an Africa division more than 25 years ago," according to CII</p>

<p>The organization has played a catalytic role in strengthening India-Africa ties, especially in the world of business. Today, CII has 75 counterpart organisations in 37 African countries that facilitate the exchange of information between the Indian and African industries.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has named political veteran Chris Lehane as its vice president of global policy, the New York Times reported on Friday.</p>

<p>Lehane, who is a member of the executive team at OpenAI, was a former policy chief for Airbnb and a member of the Clinton White House.</p>

<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>The appointment comes as Apple and chip giant Nvidia are reportedly in talks to invest in OpenAI as part of a new fundraising round that could value the Microsoft-backed startup above $100 billion.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI is weighing changes to its corporate structure to become more investor-friendly.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Supreme Court judge on Friday ordered the suspension of Elon Musk's X social media network in Brazil, after months-long standoff over disinformation in South America's largest nation.</p>

<p>The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, handed down the ruling after Musk failed to comply with an order to name a new legal representative for the company.</p>

<p>Musk, who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, reacted with fury, branding Moraes an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge" and accusing him of "trying to destroy democracy in Brazil."</p>

<p>"Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes," the billionaire wrote on X.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Free speech is the bedrock of democracy and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes <a href="https://t.co/eqbowALCeu">https://t.co/eqbowALCeu</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1829624142452195334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote></p>

<p>The two have been locked in an ongoing, high-profile feud for months as Moraes leads a battle against disinformation in Brazil.</p>

<p>Musk has previously declared himself a "free speech absolutist," but since he took over the platform formerly known as Twitter in 2022 he has been accused of turning it into a megaphone for right-wing conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Moraes ordered the "immediate, complete and comprehensive suspension of the operation of" X in the country, telling the national communications agency to take "all necessary measures" to implement the order within 24 hours.</p>

<p>He also asked Google, Apple, and internet providers to "introduce technological obstacles capable of preventing the use of the X application" and access to the website.</p>

<p>And he threatened to fine people 50,000 reais ($8,900) if they used "technological subterfuges" to get around the block, such as a VPN.</p>

<p>The social media platform has more than 22 million users in Brazil.</p>

<p>Musk shut X's business operations in Brazil earlier this month, claiming Moraes had threatened the company's previous legal representative with arrest to force compliance with "censorship orders."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Moraes told Musk he had 24 hours to find a new representative or he would face suspension.</p>

<p>Shortly after the deadline passed, X said in a statement that it expected Moraes to shut it down "simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents."</p>

<p>- 'Who does Musk think he is?'-</p>

<p>The standoff with Musk began when Moraes ordered the suspension of several X accounts belonging to supporters of Brazil's former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who tried to discredit the voting system in the 2022 election, which he lost.</p>

<p>Brazilian authorities are investigating whether Bolsonaro plotted a coup attempt to prevent current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from assuming office in January 2023.</p>

<p>Online users blocked by Moraes include figures like far-right ex-congressman Daniel Silveira, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2022 on charges of leading a movement to overthrow the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In April, Moraes ordered an investigation of Musk, accusing him of reactivating some of the banned accounts.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Musk's satellite internet operator Starlink said it had received an order from Moraes that froze its accounts and prevented it from conducting financial transactions in Brazil.</p>

<p>Starlink alleged that the order "is based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied -- unconstitutionally -- against X."</p>

<p>The company said on X that it intended "to address the matter legally."</p>

<p>Musk is also the subject of a separate judicial investigation into an alleged scheme where public money was used to orchestrate disinformation campaigns in favor of Bolsonaro and those close to him.</p>

<p>"Any citizen from anywhere in the world who has investments in Brazil is subject to the Brazilian Constitution and laws," Lula told a local radio station on Friday.</p>

<p>"Who does (Musk) think he is?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;On Friday evening, a violent incident occurred on a bus in Siegen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, leaving five people injured after a woman attacked them with a knife, local police confirmed, Xinhua reported.</p>

<p>Notably, the woman has been arrested.</p>

<p>The police informed that three persons were in life-threatening conditions. At least 40 other passengers were on the bus at the time of the incident. No further danger is posed, police said, according to Xinhua.</p>

<p>According to German newspaper Bild, the attacker is believed to be a German national, with indications suggesting that they may have been struggling with mental health issues and potentially under the influence of drugs. The police has clarified that they do not suspect terrorism to be a motivating factor.</p>

<p>The incident comes days after a Syrian man brought himself in and admitted to stabbing three people to death and several others at a festival in the western German city of Solingen on Friday, CNN reported citing the police.</p>

<p>The incident claimed the lives of two men, ages 67 and 56, and a lady, age 56.</p>

<p>It stunned Germany and led opposition parties to demand stricter immigration laws. The 26-year-old is accused by German prosecutors of being an ISIS member. Via its Amaq news agency, the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the incident. But it provided no proof to support that claim.</p>

<p>In a statement, prosecutors said that due to his "radical Islamist convictions, [the suspect] decided to kill as many people as possible at the Solingen city festival."</p>

<p>The suspect went on a significant manhunt before turning himself in. The man stated, "I'm the one you're looking for," to the officers while covered in blood, according to the daily Bild, reported CNN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has rejected the allegations of the government's involvement in the Bangladesh crisis, including the protests in the country that led to the deaths of hundreds of people.</p>

<p>Refuting all the reports and rumours, the White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean Pierre, said in a media briefing on Monday (local time), "So, we have had no involvement at all. Any, reports or rumours that the United States government was involved in these, in these events is simply, simply false. That is not true."</p>

<p>Jean Pierre further stated that Bangladeshi people should determine the future of the Bangladeshi government.</p>

<p>"This is a choice for and by the Bangladeshi people. We believe that the Bangladeshi people should determine the future of the Bangladeshi government, and that's where we stand. Any allegations, certainly we will continue to say, and what I have said here is simply untrue," Jean Pierre said.</p>

<p>Recently, in an interview with ANI, Michael Kugelman, a US-based Foreign Policy expert, and Director of the South Asia Institute at The Wilson Center, refuted allegations of foreign interference behind the mass uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, stating he had not seen any "plausible evidence" to support these claims.</p>

<p>He noted that the Hasina government's harsh crackdown on protesters escalated the movement. "My view has been very simple. I see this as a crisis that was driven by purely internal factors, by students who were unhappy about a particular issue, job quotas that they didn't like and they were worried about the government. Sheikh Hasina's government cracked down very hard on the students and that then turned the movement into something much bigger. And this was simply driven by internal factors," Kugelman said.</p>

<p>Kugelman dismissed allegations from Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who claimed foreign interference behind the protests, saying that the unrest was driven by "internal factors."</p>

<p>"Now, you know, when there is a conspiracy theory that is rooted in issues of foreign influence, one cannot disprove such type of allegation. Also, at the same time, one cannot conclusively prove it. I think the onus, is the responsibility to provide a plausible explanation for how it can be true. I am yet to hear that from Sheikh Hasina's son, from anyone," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, speaking on the protests outside the White House against the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, White House Press Secretary, Jean Pierre said that the US is going to continue monitoring the situation.</p>

<p>Jean Pierre said, "We are certainly going to continue monitoring the situation. I don't have anything else to say or to add beyond that."<br />
"When it comes to any type of human rights issue here, the President has been very consistent in speaking loud and clear in public and also privately and he will continue to do that. But, I don't have any specific engagement to speak to at this time," she added.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is experiencing a fluid political situation, with Sheikh Hasina resigning from the post of Prime Minister on August 5 amid mounting protests. The protests, led mainly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations.</p>

<p>A large number of people protested outside the White House in Washington on Friday last week against alleged violence targeting minority Hindus and others in Bangladesh since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>Protesters carried American and Bangladeshi flags and held posters demanding that Bangladeshi minorities be "saved." They chanted slogans of "We want justice" and called for peace amid the recent surge in violence.</p>

<p>The crowd, which included activists from various human rights organizations, members of the Bangladeshi diaspora and Indian-American Hindu allies, came from Washington, Maryland, Virginia, and New York.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called for the "safety and protection" of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh in a message on X on Thursday.</p>

<p>"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been fleeing to neighbouring India to escape the violence. Hindus, who make up about 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million population, have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which has faced backlash following violent clashes between anti-quota protesters and security forces last month.</p>

<p>Several US leaders, including Republican Congressman Pat Fallon and Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, have also spoken out against the alleged violence in Bangladesh.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and European allies called on Iran to "stand down" Monday, as fears mounted of an imminent attack on Israel that could spark an all-out war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Tensions are soaring in the region, with the United States rushing a missile submarine and an aircraft carrier group in a show of support for its key ally.</p>

<p>Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah have vowed revenge for the killing of the political leader of the Palestinian group Hamas in Tehran, and of a Hezbollah commander in Beirut.</p>

<p>International efforts to stave off an Iranian attack intensified, with US President Joe Biden and the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Britain warning Tehran in a joint statement on Monday.</p>

<p>"We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place," they said after speaking on Monday.</p>

<p>The White House warned that a "significant set of attacks" by Iran and its proxies was possible as soon as this week, saying that Israel shared the same assessment.</p>

<p>As the frantic diplomacy continued, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer both called on Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to urge de-escalation.</p>

<p>But Pezeshkian said Monday his country has the "right to respond to aggressors."</p>

<p>Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh had been in Tehran for the new Iranian president's inauguration last month when Haniyeh was killed in an attack that Iran has blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Israel assassinated Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut a day earlier, leaving the region on edge.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- &nbsp;'No further time to lose' -</strong><br />
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said his country was "ready to foil any threat in real time" but added that he was "not familiar" with reports that Iran was expected to launch an attack in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the country had strengthened defenses and organized "offensive options" as "threats from Tehran and Beirut may materialize."</p>

<p>Washington and the four European nations meanwhile intensified their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, regarding the conflict sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel as the root cause of the tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>They backed a call by Biden and the leaders of Egypt and Qatar for renewed talks between Israel and Hamas this Thursday, "and stressed there is no further time to lose."&nbsp;</p>

<p>They also called for "unfettered" delivery of aid to devastated Gaza.</p>

<p>The pressure to bring an end to the fighting in the Gaza Strip and for Hamas to release its hostages came as the militant group's armed wing said it had killed one Israeli captive and wounded two more in "incidents".</p>

<p>The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement that two of its fighters "assigned to guard" the hostages had fired at them in "two separate incidents" and that a committee had been formed to investigate.</p>

<p>Hamas has urged mediators to implement a truce plan earlier presented by Biden instead of holding more talks.</p>

<p>But Israel has accepted the invitation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt to send negotiators.</p>

<p>"The reason we're doing that is to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement," Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told a news conference.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Stop this war' -</strong><br />
Pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza grew after civil defense rescuers in the Hamas-run territory said an Israeli air strike on Saturday killed 93 people at a school housing displaced Palestinians.</p>

<p>Israel said it targeted militants operating out of the school and mosque.</p>

<p>On Monday, witnesses told AFP Israel struck Khan Yunis and Rafah from the air. Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, which has been fighting alongside Hamas in Gaza, said its militants were battling Israeli troops in Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>In central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, Suhail Abu Batihan said the Israeli bombardment was "causing terror" among residents, calling on mediators and "the world... to intervene to stop this war."</p>

<p>The Gaza war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,897 people, according to a new toll from the territory's health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU's top digital official wrote to Elon Musk Monday to remind him of his legal duty to stop "harmful content" from spreading on X, hours before the tech billionaire interviews Donald Trump live on the platform.</p>

<p>"With great audience comes greater responsibility," the bloc's internal market commissioner Thierry Breton posted on X, along with the letter laying out Musk's obligations to combat illegal content and disinformation under EU law.</p>

<p>The European Union has an ongoing probe into X, formerly Twitter, under its landmark Digital Services Act (DSA) which requires digital firms to effectively police online content to protect users from harm.</p>

<p>"The DSA obligations apply without exceptions or discrimination to the moderation of the whole user community and content of X (including yourself as a user with over 190 million followers)," Breton wrote to Musk.</p>

<p>Breton said the warning was motivated by the "risk of amplification of potentially harmful content in the EU," citing Musk's upcoming Trump interview, and also referencing his recent inflammatory comments about far-right riots in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>"We are monitoring the potential risks in the EU associated with the dissemination of content that may incite violence, hate and racism in conjunction with major political -- or societal -- events around the world," he wrote.</p>

<p>"My services and I will be extremely vigilant to any evidence that points to breaches of the DSA and will not hesitate to make full use of our toolbox, including by adopting interim measures, should it be warranted to protect EU citizens from serious harm," Breton wrote.</p>

<p>The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has emerged as a major voice in US politics but is accused of turning the platform formerly known as Twitter into a megaphone for right-wing conspiracy theories since acquiring it in 2022.</p>

<p>New analysis from the Center for Countering Digital Hate shows that Musk's false or misleading claims about the US elections have been viewed nearly 1.2 billion times on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran could launch a "significant" attack on Israel as soon as this week, the White House said Monday, as US President Joe Biden discussed the crisis with European leaders.</p>

<p>"We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>"We share the same concerns and expectations that our Israeli counterparts have with respect to potential timing here -- could be this week," added Kirby.</p>

<p>Kirby's comments came as the United States is rushing an aircraft carrier strike group and a guided missile submarine to the region in a show of support for Israel.</p>

<p>Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah group have vowed to avenge last month's killings of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.</p>

<p>Biden called the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Britain on Monday to discuss the growing tensions, the White House added.</p>

<p>The call was "largely for all the leaders to repeat what they have said before in terms of reaffirming Israel's defense" and to "send a strong message that we don't want to see any rise in violence, any attacks by Iran or its proxies."</p>

<p>The leaders also called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, with difficult talks set for Thursday on halting the conflict that started when the Palestinian group attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>The call came shortly after Biden returned to the Oval Office after a long weekend at his beach house in Delaware.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran had put its long-range Mohajer-10 drones on show at a defence exhibit in Russia, Iran's official news agency reported on Monday.</p>

<p>US officials have accused Iran of sending drones to Russia - including Mohajer-10's predecessor, the Mohajer-6 - that Moscow had used in its invasion of Ukraine. Tehran denies this.</p>

<p>IRNA said the more advanced system was on display at the Army 2024 International Military-Technical Forum, an event which runs from Monday to Wednesday in Patriot Park outside Russia's capital.</p>

<p>The report comes as the Middle East braces for Iran's threatened retaliation against Israel after the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31.</p>

<p>Iran released details of the Mohajer-10 system in August last year, saying it had an enhanced flight range, duration and could carry a greater payload.</p>

<p>A video accompanying that report showed the drone alongside other military hardware, with text saying "prepare your shelters" in both Hebrew and Persian.</p>

<p>According to Iranian media reports, the drone has an operational range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and can fly for up to 24 hours. Its payload can reach 300 kg (661 pounds), double the capacity of the Mohajer-6, the reports have added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's top commander said on Monday Kyiv controlled around 1,000 square kilometres of Russia's Kursk region, his first public comments since Ukraine launched its biggest cross-border attack in almost 2-1/2 years of full-scale war.</p>

<p>With Russia still struggling to repel the incursion seven days after it began, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy published a video clip of Oleksandr Syrskyi, the head of his armed forces, delivering a report on the fighting.</p>

<p>"We continue to conduct an offensive operation in the Kursk region. Currently, we control about 1,000 square kilometres of the territory of the Russian Federation," he said.</p>

<p>Zelensky said the meeting of top-level officials had ordered the preparation of a "humanitarian plan" for the area.</p>

<p>Russia's acting governor of Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, said Ukraine controlled 28 settlements, and the incursion was about 12 km deep and 40 km wide.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Ukrainian leader said the defence ministry and diplomats has been ordered to present a list of "necessary actions" needed to secure permission from Kyiv's Western allies to use long-range weapons for strikes on Russia.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Rustem Umerov urged Paris earlier on Monday to lift the ban on Western weapons strikes on military targets in Russia during a call with French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu, the Ukrainian readout said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada-India relationship is "very important for both the countries", Canadian MP Chandrakanth Arya said as he met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his visit to the country.</p>

<p>"Delighted to meet Canadian MP Chandrakanth Arya. As a genuine advocate of India-Canada friendship, appreciate his views and value his insights. @AryaCanada," the EAM posted on X on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also shared a photograph of their meeting on the social media platform.</p>

<p>The Canadian lawmaker also put out a post while sharing Mr Jaishankar's post.</p>

<p>"Canada-India relationship is very important for both countries. As the outgoing Canadian High Commissioner in India said a few months back 'in the long-term, Canada's strategic interest and India's strategic interest are absolutely aligned'. Economic relations, specifically Canadian investments in India are going strong," Mr Arya said.</p>

<p>"Skilled professionals from India are meeting our human talent needs. We have a huge number of international students from India. We must do everything possible not only to maintain this but to take it to the next level. @CanadainIndia," Mr Arya posted.</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada had come under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd" and "motivated".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 12-year-old boy on Monday admitted throwing a missile at a police van during far-riot inspired riots after a knife attack in a northern England town that killed three young girls.</p>

<p>District Judge Joanne Hirst said the boy -- who cannot be named due to his age -- had been more involved in the violence than any other accused person she had seen "coming through these courts, adult or child".</p>

<p>The boy pleaded guilty to two charges of violent disorder at a court in Manchester, northwestern England.</p>

<p>The violence, blamed by officials on the far right, came after misinformation spread about the alleged perpetrator of a mass stabbing on July 29 at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class led to rioting in English towns and cities.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said the boy was part of a group that gathered two days later outside a Manchester hotel housing asylum seekers.</p>

<p>He was remanded to local authority custody and will be sentenced on September 2.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people fled their homes around Athens on Monday, including in the historic town of Marathon, as strong winds fanned a wall of wildfire flames closer to the Greek capital.</p>

<p>A 30-kilometre (20-mile) long frontline of fires, more than 25 metres (80 feet) high in places, was moving towards Athens, the ERT public broadcaster reported.</p>

<p>Nearly 700 firefighters and over 30 aircraft battled the blazes that had advanced into the city's outer suburbs near Mount Pentelikon.</p>

<p>Authorities opened the Olympic stadium in northern Athens and other stadiums to house those fleeing. Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.</p>

<p>One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>Halandri became the latest suburban municipality to order a partial evacuation of areas threatened by the flames.</p>

</div>

<p>"Because of the direction of the wind we have decided on a precautionary evacuation," its mayor Simos Roussos told ERT. "The fire is very close."</p>

<p>Television footage showed flames burning among homes in Nea Penteli, a leafy Athens suburb which also told residents to relocate.</p>

<p>Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long-distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.</p>

<p>"We are facing a biblical catastrophe," said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. "Our whole town is engulfed in flames," he told the Skai television channel.</p>

<p>Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which looms above the capital and is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.</p>

<p>"Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.</p>

<p>A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>The destruction revived memories of the Mati disaster, the coastal area near Marathon where 104 people died in July 2018 in a tragedy later blamed on evacuation delays and errors.</p>

<p>The summer wildfire season in Greece this year has seen dozens of daily blazes after the Mediterranean country recorded its warmest winter and the hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.</p>

<p>Temperatures around Athens are forecast to peak at 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 50 kilometres (31 miles) per hour.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Engulfed in flames' -</strong></p>

<p>"Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.</p>

<p>Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias issued a warning Saturday that half the country faced a high-risk of fires due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions.</p>

<p>On Monday he said that a fire that broke out on Sunday near the town of Varnavas spread even though a water-bombing aircraft reached the area in just five minutes.</p>

<p>"We're working 24-hour shifts, all of us," said fireman Marinos Peristeropoulos.</p>

<p>"The fire spread very quickly because of the strong wind," he told AFP near one of the hotspots in Grammatiko.</p>

<p>Scientists say that human-induced fossil fuel emissions are worsening the length, frequency and intensity of heatwaves across the world.</p>

<p>Rising temperatures are leading to longer wildfire seasons and increasing the area burnt in the flames, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>

<p>Other parts of Europe are also struggling with high temperatures.</p>

<p>Temperatures in parts of France rose above 40 Celsius on Sunday. In Rome, temperatures were expected to reach 38 Celsius Monday and remain around 36 Celsius this week.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, temperatures between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius are expected.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - who last week took oath as head of Bangladesh's interim government - has heaped praise on students who spearheaded protests against ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel laureate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/muhammad-yunus" target="_blank">Muhammad Yunus</a> - who last week took oath as head of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/bangladesh" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>'s interim government - has heaped praise on students who spearheaded protests against ousted Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/sheikh-hasina" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina</a>. "There is no doubt... because of the student-led revolution the whole government collapsed..." Mr Yunus told reporters after a Sunday night meet with the students.</p>

<p>"I said (to the students), 'I respect you... I admire you. What you have done is absolutely unparalleled... and because you ordered me to do this (to take charge of the interim administration) I accept...'," Mr Yunus said, recounting part of the conversation he had with the students.</p>

<p>Two of the student protesters - Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud - are part of a 16-member advisory council that was sworn in with Mr Yunus. The 84-year-old won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for his work in microfinance and setting up the Grameen Bank, which works for community development.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus has also stressed the wave of resignations of high-ranking public officials, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and head of Bangladesh's central bank, was "conducted legally".</p>

<p>They had reportedly been issued ultimatums to quit.</p>

<p>"They want to have a new court," he said of the students. "So they went there and asked the chief justice to resign and put their pressure to make him resign."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will find the legal way to justify all of this, because legally... all the steps were followed," he said. His office only agreed to publish these quotes Monday evening.</p>

<h3><strong>"The Monster Is Gone"</strong></h3>

<p>"Finally, this moment, the monster is gone," Mr Yunus also said, referring to Ms Hasina's departure and the end of what her critics said was an autocratic rule that stifled all dissent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Mr Yunus warned the interim government that public goodwill is a limited resource and that they would face many difficult decisions ahead. "The moment you start taking decisions, some people will like your decisions, some people will not like your decisions," he said. "...that's the way it works."</p>

<h3><strong>Interim Bangladesh Government</strong></h3>

<p>The interim government was formed after Bangladesh witnessed weeks of violence and clashes - triggered by protests over a jobs quota - forced Ms Hasina, a five-time PM, to resign and flee.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina left the Prime Minister's residence in Dhaka - hours before it was overrun - and flew to India in a Bangladeshi military aircraft. The 76-year-old, seen as a key ally of New Delhi, remains in an undisclosed location amid reports she will seek political asylum, possibly in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, was rocked by violent protests against Sheikh Hasina's rule.</p>
</div>

<p>Following Ms Hasina's departure Md Yunus - who faced multiple corruption charges under the previous government and was in Europe while Sheikh Hasina was in power - was picked by the protesting to oversee democratic reforms.</p>

<p>His first act after being administered an oath of office - and taking the title of 'chief advisor' - was to lead a solemn tribute to the more than 450 people who died in the protests.</p>

<p>It is unclear when Bangladesh will hold an election to select a new Prime Minister. Whenever that is, Mrs Hasina is likely to return to contest, her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy told The Times of India. "She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>India Extends "Best Wishes"</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended his best wishes to Mr Yunus,</p>

<p>"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," he wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the change of guard in neighbouring Bangladesh, the Indian government now faces a diplomatic dilemma, even as China was also swift to welcome Dhaka's new authorities, saying it "attaches importance to the development" of relations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh was experiencing a "student-led revolution" after the ouster of premier Sheikh Hasina, the South Asian country's new interim leader Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>"This is a revolution, a student-led revolution," the Nobel laureate told a news briefing on Sunday.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about (that) because the business of the whole government collapsed."</p>

<p>Yunus, 84, arrived back in Bangladesh from Europe on Thursday after he was called by the student leaders of the protests that toppled Hasina and asked to steer democratic reforms.</p>

<p>"I said, 'I respect you, I admire you. What you have done is absolutely unparallelled'," he said.</p>

<p>"'Because you ordered me to do this, I take your order'," Yunus said he told them.</p>

<p>Several top allies of Hasina, whose iron-fisted tenure ended with her abrupt resignation and flight to neighbouring India a week ago, subsequently stepped down.</p>

<p>Among them were the former chief justice of the Supreme Court and the central bank governor.</p>

<p>They had been issued ultimatums to quit their posts by students but Yunus said their resignations had been conducted legally.</p>

<p>"They want to have a new court," he said of the students. "So they went there and asked the chief justice to resign and put their pressure to make him resign."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will find the legal way to justify all of this, because legally... all the steps were followed," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'The monster is gone' -</strong></p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her long rule.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents.</p>

<p>"Finally, this moment, the monster is gone," Mr Yunus said.</p>

<p>However, despite the groundswell of public goodwill towards him, Mr Yunus warned that his interim government faced difficult decisions ahead.</p>

<p>"The moment you start taking decisions, some people will like your decisions, some people will not like your decisions," he said. "Obviously, that's the way it works."</p>

<p>Yunus made the comments during an off-the-record media briefing on Sunday night at a state building being used as a temporary seat of government.</p>

<p>His office agreed to their publication on Monday evening.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.</p>

<p>He took office as "chief adviser" to a caretaker administration -- all fellow civilians bar a retired brigadier general.</p>

<p>He said last week that he wanted to hold elections "within a few months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan's military has arrested the former chief of its spy agency ISI, Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed, and initiated court martial proceedings against him - a first in the country's history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The military said the arrest was ordered by the Supreme Court in connection with a land development case, and multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after Mr Hameed's retirement.</li>
	<li>The management of a private housing scheme, Top City, had claimed in a petition in November&nbsp;2023 that Mr Hameed had orchestrated a raid on the offices and residence of its owner.</li>
	<li>Their petition claimed that Pakistan Rangers and officials of the ISI raided its premises in May 2017 and took away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments, over an alleged terrorism case.</li>
	<li>General Hameed later told the petitioner that he would return some items except for "400 tola&nbsp;gold and cash", <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1851818/former-dg-isi-faiz-hameed-taken-into-military-custody-ispr">reported Dawn </a>quoting the petition.</li>
	<li>The petition also accused some former ISI officials of being involved in the "illegal takeover of the housing society".</li>
	<li>In March 2024, former Pakistan interior minister Rana Sanaullah said the ex-ISI&nbsp;boss and his brother were under scanner over alleged corruption.</li>
	<li>In April, the military formed an inquiry committee to probe the allegations of misuse of authority against the former spymaster.</li>
	<li>Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed was among six senior-most generals whose name was included in the list of potential candidates for the top two military offices in November 2022, as per Dawn.</li>
	<li>Mr Hameed, however, sought an early retirement and sent his resignation to the high command the same month, four months before his retirement date.</li>
	<li>He had also faced criticism from Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz for allegedly having a role in their convictions.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden announced in late May a three-phase plan to end the war in Gaza, a proposal that Hamas wants to see implemented rather than enter new talks starting Thursday as Israel has agreed.</p>

<p>The plan, which Biden described as an Israeli proposal, has already seen intense deliberations over the past several weeks, even as the war in Gaza raged.</p>

<p>Last week, Israel -- which has been slow to publicly embrace the deal -- said it was ready for new talks on the proposal.</p>

<p>But just days later, it carried out a deadly strike on a Gaza school housing displaced people, killing at least 93, according to rescuers in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says the strike killed 19 Palestinian militants, while Israeli news website Walla, quoting the military, reported that 38 militants were killed.</p>

<p>AFP has been unable to independently verify the toll.</p>

<p>Israel's move to enter a new round of talks, likely to be held in either Cairo or Doha, also came less than two weeks after Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh -- who had been overseeing the ceasefire negotiations -- was killed in Tehran in a strike widely blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Below are the details of the plan and the statements of parties and brokers since Haniyeh's killing.</p>

<p><strong>Phase One</strong></p>

<p>Biden said the first phase includes a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, with Israeli forces withdrawing from "all populated areas of Gaza".</p>

<p>Hamas would release "a number" of hostages, including US citizens, captured in the October 7 attacks on Israel, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The remains of some hostages who had been killed would also be returned.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange.</p>

<p>Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their "homes and neighbourhoods" throughout Gaza, much of which has been devastated by Israeli bombing.</p>

<p>Humanitarian aid would "surge" to 600 trucks a day entering Gaza, while the international community would deliver hundreds of thousands of temporary shelters and housing units.</p>

<p>During the initial six-week period, Israel and Hamas would "negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities".</p>

<p>The ceasefire would also be extended as negotiations continue, with brokers the United States, Egypt and Qatar working to ensure they hold, Biden said.</p>

<p><strong>Phase Two</strong></p>

<p>Israeli forces would completely withdraw from Gaza under the second phase of the plan, lasting another six weeks.</p>

<p>Hamas would release "all remaining living hostages" including male Israeli soldiers. This has been a key sticking point for Hamas in the past.</p>

<p>If both sides keep to the deal, it will lead to the "cessation of hostilities permanently", Biden quoted the proposal as saying.</p>

<p><strong>Phase Three</strong></p>

<p>A major reconstruction and stabilisation plan for Gaza would begin, backed by the US and the international community.</p>

<p>Biden said he would also work with regional partners to ensure it happens in a way that "does not allow Hamas to re-arm".</p>

<p>The reconstruction phase would take between three and five years, a senior US official said.</p>

<p>The final remains of any hostages who had been killed would be returned in the third phase.</p>

<p><strong>What if it goes wrong?</strong></p>

<p>Biden said that if Hamas "fails to fulfil its commitments under the deal, Israel can resume military operations".</p>

<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the best way to secure the release of hostages is to keep applying military pressure on Hamas.</p>

<p>Biden, however, added that Egypt and Qatar would work to ensure Hamas sticks to the terms, while the United States would do the same for Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Who says what?</strong></p>

<p>Late on Sunday, Hamas said that any further talks would basically "provide cover for the occupation (Israel) and give it more time to perpetuate the war of genocide against" Gazans.</p>

<p>Israel has yet to respond to Hamas's latest calls for the deal to be implemented.</p>

<p>Mediator Qatar was quick to criticise Israel following the killing of Haniyeh.</p>

<p>"Political assassinations &amp; continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side? Peace needs serious partners," Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on X, hours after Haniyeh's assassination.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin ordered his army on Monday to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops who have entered Russian territory as authorities said over 120,000 people had been evacuated away from the fighting.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.</p>

<p>"One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society," Putin told a televised meeting with government officials.</p>

<p>"The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.</p>

<p>Some 121,000 people have fled the Kursk region since the start of the fighting, which has killed at least 12 civilians and injured 121 more, regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the meeting with Putin.</p>

<p>Authorities in Kursk announced on Monday they were widening their evacuation area to include Belovsky district, home to some 14,000 residents. The neighbouring Belgorod region also said it was evacuating its border district of Krasnoyaruzhsky.</p>

<p>Ukraine has pierced into the region by at least 12 kilometres (seven miles) and has captured 28 towns and villages, with the new front 40 kilometres long, Smirnov said.</p>

<p>A top Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend that the operation was aimed at stretching Russian troops and destabilising the country after months of slow Russian advances across the frontline.</p>

<p>Putin said Russia would respond by showing "unanimous support for all those in distress" and claimed there had been an increase in men signing up to fight.</p>

<p>"The enemy will receive a worthy riposte," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Maximum losses' -</strong></p>

<p>The assault appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard. Russia's army rushed in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash it.</p>

<p>But it conceded on Sunday that Ukraine had penetrated up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) into Russian territory in places.</p>

<p>It said some forces were near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, around 25 kilometres and 30 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that "the aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said thousands of Ukrainian troops were involved in the operation.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said on Monday that its air defence systems had destroyed 18 Ukrainian drones -- including 11 over the Kursk region.</p>

<p>- 'It's scary' -</p>

<p>Russia's emergency situations ministry said on Sunday that over 44,000 residents in the Kursk region have applied for financial assistance, TASS news agency reported.</p>

<p>Russia's rail operator has meanwhile organised emergency trains from Kursk to Moscow, around 450 kilometres away, for those fleeing.</p>

<p>"It's scary to have helicopters flying over your head all the time," said Marina, refusing to give her surname, who arrived by train in Moscow on Sunday. "When it was possible to leave, I left."</p>

<p>Across the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, AFP journalists on Sunday saw dozens of armoured vehicles daubed with a white triangle -- the insignia apparently being used to identify Ukrainian military hardware deployed in the attack.</p>

<p>At an evacuation centre in the regional capital of Sumy, 70-year-old retired metal worker Mykola, who fled his village of Khotyn some 10 kilometres from the Russian border, welcomed Ukraine's push into Russia.</p>

<p>"Let's let them find out what it's like," he told AFP. "They don't understand what war is. Let them have a taste of it."</p>

<p>Analysts think Kyiv may have launched the assault to relieve pressure on its troops in other parts of the frontline.</p>

<p>But the Ukrainian official said: "Their pressure in the east continues, they are not pulling back troops from the area," even if "the intensity of Russian attacks has gone down a little bit".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said he expected Russia would "in the end" stop the incursion.</p>

<p>Ukraine was bracing for a large-scale retaliatory missile attack, including "on decision-making centres" in Ukraine, the official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan's former ISI chief Lt Gen (retd.) Faiz Hameed has been arrested by the military ahead of his court martial in connection with a housing scheme scandal, the army said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unprecedented move, the Pakistan Army on Monday announced that it has arrested former ISI chief Lt Gen (retd.) Faiz Hameed and initiated court martial proceedings against him in connection with a housing scheme scandal.</p>

<p>"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City Case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd)," the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the army- said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd.), under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act," it said.</p>

<p>"In addition, multiple instances of violation of the Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established. The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody," it added.</p>

<p>Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.</p>

<p>He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that then prime minister Imran Khan was not happy with Munir.</p>

<p>Later, the army decided to replace Mr Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Imran Khan and it is believed that it was the beginning of souring of his ties with the powerful military.</p>

<p>The Top City case made headlines when on November 8, 2023, Moeez Ahmed Khan, the owner of Top City, filed a petition in the Supreme Court in which he accused Mr Hameed of misusing his authority.</p>

<p>He stated in the petition that on May 12, 2017, at the behest of Gen Hameed, ISI officials raided the top city office and his house and seized valuables, including gold, diamonds and money.</p>

<p>He also stated that Sardar Najaf, the brother of Mr Hameed, also contacted him to resolve the issue later. The petition also claimed that Gen Hameed later personally met him to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He alleged that the ISI officials extorted Rs 4 crore cash from him.</p>

<p>A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, which included Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, Justice Attar Minullah and Justice Aminuddin, heard the case and decided to send it to the Ministry of Defence for probing the allegation.</p>

<p>The army announced in April this year that it constituted a high-level inquiry committee headed by a major general to look into the allegations.</p>

<p>Mr Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.</p>

<p>The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has hitherto wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spain's ruling Socialists regained control of Catalonia's regional government as a new cabinet was sworn in on Monday, ending over a decade of separatist rule in the region.</p>

<p>The 16-member cabinet is led by Salvador Illa, who was Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's health minister during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"I want to assure you that the government will govern for all, this is a real obsession," Illa said during the swearing-in ceremony.</p>

<p>It is the first time since 2010 that the wealthy northeastern region has a government that does not come from the pro-independence camp.</p>

<p>The Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May, but fell short of a majority.</p>

<p>Illa secured the support of the tiny far-left Comuns party -- part of the Sumar alliance that backs Sanchez at national level -- and moderate separatist ERC party to become regional leader in a vote on Thursday in Catalonia's regional assembly.</p>

<p>Forming a government in Catalonia will be seen as a vindication of Sanchez's strategy of trying to tamp down support for separatism in the region by offering concessions, including a controversial amnesty for those involved in an illegal independence referendum in 2017 that triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.</p>

<p>To secure the support of the ERC, the Socialists vowed to grant Catalonia full control of taxes collected in the region, which has been for decades one of the main demands of pro-independence parties.</p>

<p>The proposal, which still must be approved by Spain's national parliament, is opposed by the conservative opposition as well as some in the Socialist party, who argue it will deprive the central state of a substantial revenues.</p>

<p>Last week's vote was overshadowed by fugitive separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, who defied a pending arrest warrant over his role in the 2017 secession bid, to appear at a Barcelona rally after seven years of self-imposed exile, and then vanished before police could arrest him.</p>

<p>He has returned to Belgium, where he has lived during most of the years since leaving Spain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

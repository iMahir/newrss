       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of prisoners are to be released early starting September to prevent the "collapse" of the prison system, the UK's new justice minister announced on Friday.</p>

<p>Shabana Mahmood said failure to do so risked the "total breakdown of law and order", with just 700 places left for men, and jails operating at 99 percent capacity since 2023.</p>

<p>England and Wales have the highest per capita prison population in Western Europe.</p>

<p>The release initiative would not apply to violent offenders serving more than four years, sex offenders, and those in prison for domestic abuse offences as well as those on life sentences.</p>

<p>The chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said this week that urgent action was required, as prisons were at "breaking point".</p>

<p>Mahmood, appointed last week after Labour's general election win, warned in dramatic language that if prisons ran out of cell space, there could be "van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go".</p>

<p>"With officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops, and setting neighbourhoods alight," she said in a speech at a prison.</p>

<p>"In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system. And a total breakdown of law and order."</p>

<p>Under the plans, prisoners who are eligible for automatic release after serving half their sentence will be freed earlier than normal.</p>

<p>The plans involve a temporary reduction of how long prisoners must serve behind bars, from 50 percent to 40 percent of their sentence.</p>

<p>The releases will start in September to give the Prison and Probation Service time to plan.</p>

<p>The total number of prisoners hit over 87,505 on Friday -- of whom over 83,800 were men -- leaving just 1,451 spaces available, official figures showed.</p>

<p>Since the start of 2023, the average occupancy rate in men's prisons had "routinely been higher than 99 percent", according to the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p>Officials say the prison system needs a buffer of around 1,425 cell spaces in men's prisons at all times to deal with sudden influxes of inmates.</p>

<p>Six new prisons to create an extra 20,000 places are being built.</p>

<p>The Prison Governors' Association (PGA) said it welcomed the speed of the new measures while demanding a "full review" and that "the public must never be placed in this position again".</p>

<p>PGA chairman Mark Fairhurst said the measures would free up around 4,500-5,000 more spaces and give prisons around 12 to 18 months before further steps would be needed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Princess Anne, the sister of British head of state King Charles III, returned to public duties Friday, weeks after she was treated in hospital after being struck by a horse.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, presented awards and met winners at a charity horseriding event in Gloucestershire, southwestern England, in a reported phased return to public appearances.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, as she is also known, suffered concussion and minor head injuries at her Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire in late June and spent five nights in hospital in Bristol.</p>

<p>She has since been recovering at her home on the sprawling estate and following standard concussion protocols.</p>

<p>It is believed she was struck by a horse as she was walking within the protected perimeter of its grounds, which hosts equestrian events.</p>

<p>The princess's medical team said at the time her injuries were consistent with a potential impact from a horse's head or legs.</p>

<p>She is a skilled horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is the mother of British rider Zara Tindall, who won eventing team silver at the 2012 London Olympics.</p>

<p>Anne has stepped in to represent Charles while he postponed public engagements during his cancer treatment, and rode at his official birthday parade last month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk-run X is developing a downvoting feature which will be used to improve the ranking of replies.</p>

<p>While the company hasn't announced its plans officially, recent findings suggest that the 'downvote' feature might actually resemble a 'dislike' button instead of a Reddit-style downvote icon, reports TechCrunch.</p>

<p>As per code references found in the X iOS app show a button that seems like a broken heart icon next to the microblogging platform's heart-shaped 'like' button as well as direct references to a 'downvote' feature.</p>

<p>The feature was tested by the company in 2021, ahead of Elon Musk's acquisition.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, reverse engineer Aaron Perris, @aaronp613 on X, discovered references in X's iOS app that indicated a downvote feature that appeared to be in development.</p>

<p>Now, he has found more image files in the iOS app that show the button could be styled as a broken heart as well as more direct references to the feature itself, the report mentioned.</p>

<p>Initially, the company had tested both upvoting and downvoting buttons across all posts. However, the latest tests show that X is only considering allowing downvotes on replies.</p>

<p>In June, Musk confirmed the rollout of a new feature that will hide all likes by default for X users.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hospital that launched the first breast milk bank for premature babies in Pakistan is negotiating for it to be reopened after clerics deemed it un-Islamic, doctors and the national Islamic council said Friday.</p>

<p>The milk bank in Karachi received religious approval in December from a provincial Islamic seminary, but that approval was withdrawn almost as soon as the facility opened in June, forcing it to shut.</p>

<p>"Breast milk is the only way to improve the chances of the survival of premature babies," said Jamal Raza, a doctor and the executive director of the Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology hospital, where the bank was set up.</p>

<p>"People have no idea what this is about. Only premature babies were going to be given this milk," Raza added.</p>

<p>The facility was intended to help premature babies survive in a country where the neonatal mortality rate is 39 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the UN children's agency -- one of the highest in South Asia.</p>

<p>A religious edict, or fatwa, approving the facility was issued in December 2023 by Jamia Darul Uloom, an Islamic advisory body in the province.</p>

<p>However, the government's National Council of Islamic Ideology later questioned whether it risked breaking Islamic codes on kinship, which dictate that husband and wife cannot be breastfed by the same woman.</p>

<p>"The child's family must know who the donors are to not complicate the issue of future marriages between such families," the head of research at the council, Inamullah, who goes by one name, told AFP</p>

<p>"We are confident that the outcome will be favourable."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A would-be attacker who planned to kidnap, rape, and murder one of the UK's top celebrities was on Friday given a life sentence with a minimum jail term of 15 years.</p>

<p>Gavin Plumb, 37, was last week found guilty of planning to "ambush" television presenter Holly Willoughby, 43, at her home, before taking her to a dungeon-type room.</p>

<p>He was caught after a US undercover police officer infiltrated an online group and forwarded Plumb's posts to the FBI.</p>

<p>US law enforcement officers then handed the evidence to UK police, who raided Plumb's home in Harlow, southeast England. They found an "abduction kit", which included cable ties and chloroform.</p>

<p>Willoughby, a daytime television presenter described by Judge Edward Murray as a "well-known and well-loved public figure", said the case had had a "life-changing" impact, according to a summary of her victim impact statement read in court.</p>

<p>"It is clear, the prosecution submits, ... that the extent of the shock and fear caused by this offending has been impossible to convey," said prosecutor Alison Morgan.</p>

<p>Morgan also said the media had not reported the full extent of his plans as they were "so depraved and vile", but the court was told that Plumb had intended to harm Willoughby's husband and children.</p>

<p>Plumb, who has a string of previous convictions relating to kidnapping and false imprisonment, told the undercover police officer online that he planned to slit Willoughby's throat as he tried to convince him to join in the plot, the court heard.</p>

<p>His legal team said that he "worshipped and was obsessed" with Willoughby and was "devastated to be the cause of such pain to her".</p>

<p>Nicola Rice, a specialist prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, called Plumb "a dangerous man who plotted unspeakable violence against one of the nation's most familiar faces.</p>

<p>"Despite his attempts to pass himself off as a harmless fantasist, the prosecution persuaded the jury that Plumb posed a very real threat," she added.</p>

<p>In England and Wales, life imprisonment is a sentence that lasts until a prisoner dies, but in most cases, the judge sets a minimum term, after which they become eligible for parole.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian regional airliner carrying three crew members crashed in a forested area near Moscow on Friday, killing all on board, Russian news agencies reported.</p>

<p>The plane, a Russian-designed Superjet 100, was carrying out a test flight after undergoing scheduled repairs and crashed a little over an hour after taking off, the TASS news agency said.</p>

<p>"According to preliminary information, three pilots were killed. All those on board," emergency services were quoted as saying by the agency.</p>

<p>The plane was headed to Moscow's Vnukovo airport, according to state media.</p>

<p>It crashed in a forested area of the Kolomensky District, a municipality about 60 kilometres (37 miles) southeast of the capital, the RIA news agency reported.</p>

<p>A plume of grey smoke could be seen rising from the crash site in photos and videos shared on social media.</p>

<p>Russian investigators have opened a criminal probe into the crash, according to the RIA news agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female political candidate in Tokyo's gubernatorial election has stirred controversy after she stripped herself on the national television broadcast. In a bizarre video promoting her campaign,&nbsp;Airi Uchino of the NHK Party stripped down to a tube top and asked viewers if she was "sexy" enough to win votes, the&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/world-news/candidate-strips-in-video-to-win-votes-in-tokyo-gubernatorial-race/"><em>New York Post</em> </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the footage, Ms&nbsp;Uchino is shown seated at a table wearing a button-up shirt as she addresses Japanese voters in an anime-style voice. She then strips down to a revealing tube top, striking a pose that suggests she is topless.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''I'm so cute; please watch my campaign broadcast. Do you think I'm sexy?'', she says in the video that has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/mrjeffu/status/1806463678247830011">gone viral on X.&nbsp;</a>She further invited viewers to add her on the messaging app LINE, promising to respond to each message personally and&nbsp;delivered the rest of her speech in a nude-coloured tube top.</p>

<p>This political stunt has raised eyebrows, with many criticising her for objectifying herself and prioritising her physical appearance over policy and leadership qualities. Many said that they felt embarrassed, while some questioned how such a spectacle could have been permitted.</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''While it is true that people strive to stand out, and our society's obsession with appearances often rewards outlandish behaviour, nevertheless, individuals who lack substance will inevitably be unmasked by the passage of time.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''At this point, they should change the rules… the race is turning into a farce and distracting people from the real issues. Democracy and all but this is not it.'' A third said, ''No matter how much you talk about freedom of speech in elections, this goes against public welfare.''</p>

<p>Seems her unconventional approach didn't work as&nbsp;Yuriko Koike, 71, secured a third consecutive four-year term in the Tokyo gubernatorial election that was held on July 7, according to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20240707/p2g/00m/0na/039000c" target="_blank">Mainichi</a>.&nbsp;</em>Ms Koike became Tokyo's first female governor in 2016 and won her second term in 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lived in seclusion directing Nepal's guerrilla war but emerged from the jungle to lead the Himalayan republic when his cadres laid down their arms and joined mainstream politics.</p>

<p>Still widely known by his nom de guerre Prachanda ("The Fierce One"), Dahal on Friday lost a parliamentary vote of confidence that will force him to relinquish the nation's revolving door premiership for the third time.</p>

<p>The civil war he launched in 1996 drew disaffected Nepalis into his Maoist rebellion with a rousing call to end centuries of feudal inequality, ultimately claiming more than 17,000 lives and leaving thousands more still missing to this day.</p>

<p>With a peace settlement that abolished Nepal's monarchy and brought the Maoists into government, Dahal was able to claim victory when the conflict ended a decade later.</p>

<p>"We believe that the country has adopted the agenda of the Maoists," he said in a 2022 interview with local broadcaster Kantipur.</p>

<p>Dahal was born into a high-caste Hindu family in 1954 but grew up in the poverty endemic to rural Nepal at the time, and spent his childhood herding goats and buffalo.</p>

<p>The extreme privation of his childhood spurred an interest in far-left ideology and he joined a communist party in 1980 at the age of 25.</p>

<p>He worked as a teacher but gradually became convinced that an armed insurgency was the only way to bring radical change to one of the world's poorest countries.</p>

<p>Through the war, he was a mysterious figure, anonymous to the public except for his wartime alias, until he emerged in 2006 to address his cadres as peace talks began.</p>

<p>Dahal steered his party to an unexpected victory in elections two years later but resigned after nine months following a deadlock over attempts to integrate former Maoist fighters into the army.</p>

<p>He has since gone on to serve as prime minister two more times, including another administration that lasted less than a year and his current stint of barely 18 months -- both common lengths of tenure under the ever-shifting alliances of Nepal's parliament.</p>

<p><strong>"Abandoning Rank And File"</strong></p>

<p>Dahal and his party colleagues credit the war for increasing the political representation of marginalised groups and improving their livelihoods.</p>

<p>He has been branded a dynamic and charismatic leader for his ability to navigate the choppy waters of Nepalese politics.</p>

<p>However, critics say he is an opportunist who has formed alliances with various parties to suit his own personal interests.</p>

<p>Since joining parliament he has come under fire for his lavish lifestyle, notably when it emerged that he had rented a sprawling luxurious estate in Kathmandu.</p>

<p>Many former guerrillas have quit the party, accusing Dahal and other leaders of betraying their sacrifices.</p>

<p>Two deputy leaders seen as likely successors were among those to depart, helping Dahal consolidate power.</p>

<p>Critics also accused him of fostering a culture of nepotism in the party by promoting his daughters and relatives.</p>

<p>Aditya Adhikari, an author who has written on the Maoist movement, said in 2016 that Dahal began to be seen after the war as someone attracted not just to "money and power".</p>

<p>"But also to people outside the movement who were rich and powerful, abandoning the rank and file and alienating his base."</p>

<p>Dahal married his wife Sita when the pair were still teenagers and she was by his side during the civil war, but little else is publicly known about her life before the conflict's end.</p>

<p>She died in 2023 after a long illness. The couple had four children, two of whom also died.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Friday lost a vote of confidence in Parliament after the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) withdrew its support for his government.</p>

<p>Prachanda, 69, received 63 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives (HoR). There were 194 votes against the motion.</p>

<p>At least 138 votes are needed to win the vote of trust.</p>

<p>Prachanda has survived four trust votes since he assumed the post on December 25, 2022.</p>

<p>Former prime minister K P Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML withdrew support from the Prachanda-led government last week after inking a power-sharing deal with the largest party in the House - Nepali Congress.</p>

<p>Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba has already endorsed Oli as the next prime minister.</p>

<p>The Nepali Congress has 89 seats in the HoR, while CPN-UML has 78 seats. Their combined strength of 167 is much more than the 138 required for a majority in the lower house</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli government's security cabinet has approved a plan to extend compulsory military service for men to 36 months from the current 32 months, Israel's Ynet news outlet reported on Friday.</p>

<p>The 36-month rule will stay in force for the next eight years, Ynet reported, after a meeting of the security cabinet that took place late on Thursday.</p>

<p>The measure is likely to be submitted to a vote in a meeting of the full cabinet on Sunday, it said.</p>

<p>Israel's military commanders have said they need to boost manpower so they can sustain the war with the Hamas terrorist group in Gaza and a confrontation with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militia.</p>

<p>In a separate initiative, Israel is planning to send draft notices to thousands of ultra-Orthodox seminary students who were previously exempt from military service.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 17-year-old boy remains in custody after two women were injured in an incident involving a "bladed weapon" at a gurdwara in Kent, south-east England, local police said on Friday.</p>

<p>Kent Police said its officers were called to the Siri Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara in Gravesend on Thursday evening to investigate reports that a male had entered the place of worship and attempted to assault those inside.</p>

<p>"It was reported that a male had entered the location and attempted to assault those in attendance whilst armed with a bladed weapon. Nobody was seriously injured during the incident but two women required medical attention for cuts and bruises," Kent Police said in a statement.</p>

<p>The officers arrested the teenage boy on suspicion of attempted murder and a religiously aggravated public order offence and also recovered the bladed weapon from the scene. The police have described it as an "isolated incident" and said that nobody else is currently being sought in connection with their investigation into the attack.</p>

<p>"We understand the community's concerns in relation to the events at the gurdwara, however we are treating it as an isolated incident," said Detective Superintendent Ian Dyball of Kent Police.</p>

<p>"Patrols will remain in the area for reassurance and we thank the community for their ongoing support and assistance," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Everyone loves a good host. Everyone loves a powerful host. Everyone loves a host who gives guided tours.</p>

<p>In this limited regard, the Prime Minister of India is no different from this author. Both are cherished guests in their gracious hosts' respective homes, and this summer sojourn is loaded with meaning for all and sundry. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-russia-sign-9-agreements-on-trade-climate-during-pm-modis-moscow-visit-6070175">Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Moscow visits</a>, six so far, always generate interest across global capitals. The latest two-day visit is no exception.</p>

<h2><strong>Beyond The Romanticism</strong></h2>

<p>Once we are done decoding the symbolism behind the Putin-Modi "bear hug" and the host driving his Indian counterpart in an electric car, it needs to come down to the brass tacks. How much do Russia and India matter to each other today? This question can be answered only after stripping it of all the romanticism defining the India-Russia relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modi's Putin meeting has happened at an interesting juncture in history for both the leaders. While the Indian Prime Minister has just started his consecutive third term with a much smaller mandate than his previous two stints, Putin's domestic base is shaky as usual. The Western world, however, continues to view them critically.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/russia-visit-an-emphatic-foreign-policy-statement-from-modi-3-0-6083426">Also Read | Russia Visit: An Emphatic Foreign Policy Statement From Modi 3.0</a></strong></p>

<p>The Western capitals are already abuzz with how India has flouted the 'rules' to pursue its own interests. Much like China. Or Iran. Or other countries challenging the West's diktats to isolate Putin by continuing their economic and diplomatic relations with Russia. For India, the biggest challenge is to set itself apart from the so-called 'untouchables'. But how does India do it when it already has the status of being the second-largest importer of Russian oil? Modi is now the recipient of the Russian government's highest civilian honour, the Order of St. Andrew. The timing of this trip has been a bit tricky for Modi, for sure, with Russia bombing a children's hospital in Ukraine on the same day. India can choose to ignore Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sharing his disappointment, but what is this Russian friendship worth to India today, if it only comes with expressions of reproach and disappointment from friends?</p>

<h2><strong>Friends And Enemies</strong></h2>

<p>India has a China issue. Not a problem as the world would want India to believe, but an issue - a neighbourhood issue. Russia's alleged no-limits friendship with China is India's ace in this geopolitical game. China does not care for its enemies' threats; it may listen to its friends, now scattered far and few between. India knows well to lean on such friends. New Delhi's ideological flexibility allows it to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The international system is anarchic. The most basic motive driving states is survival," says the propounder of the theory of offensive realism, John Mearsheimer. India carries out its offensive with charm. 'Strategic autonomy' is a theoretical concept for the West, if it applies to countries it doesn't think of as deserving of the said autonomy. India has been able to survive as a functioning democracy for more than seven decades, in part, because of its strategic autonomy. Not descending into the nadir of foreign-aided civil wars, coups, and constitutional chaos like its neighbours has been India's biggest achievement since independence.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Modi's Card In Moscow</strong></h2>

<p>The deterioration of US-China relations in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 coincided with the beginning of the rise of India and China as economic powers to reckon with. The economic reforms of the early 1990s paved the way for India's quick, and resilient, rise. Whether we could have done better or what more could have been done to keep the momentum going is another debate altogether. How China surpassed India significantly is also not germane to the issue at hand. What is, indeed, important is India's present stance as an important regional player. And this is the card that Modi carried to Moscow.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-hails-russia-as-indias-all-weather-friend-lauds-vladimir-putins-leadership-6066720">Also Read |&nbsp;PM Modi Hails Russia As India's "All-Weather Friend", Lauds Putin's Leadership</a></strong></p>

<p>Putin is relying on its space and nuclear power to not only assert its regional dominance but also consolidate its position in the global world order. India, too, has made significant strides in these areas. India needs nuclear tech, Russia is willing to sell it. The calculation is simple. The six nuclear plants under discussion, the establishment of defence production facilities, military cooperation, the development of national payment systems to discard the dollar dependence, and an unending supply of Russian oil to fuel India's infrastructure dreams are important for both Moscow and New Delhi. And they are equally important for policymakers and analysts in the West. With a freshly renewed friendship with Russia, where can India be pegged in the new geopolitical order?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modi's visit to Moscow has been undertaken from a position of power. It is neither a hollow gesture of sanctimony nor should it be seen as escapism. No wonder it has irked the many power centres in the US and Europe. But India has done nothing new or extraordinary or even in contravention of the country's long-held foreign policy. New Delhi remains non-aligned. But it's also beginning to look out for itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And good friends and hosts enable anyone attempting to do so.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first red mail pillar box to bear the cypher of King Charles was unveiled on Friday, keeping up a tradition dating back almost 175 years.</p>

<p>The new box has been installed on the High Street in Great Cambourne, central England, and local school children will get to post the first letters, and missives to the king himself about their interest in the environment.</p>

<p>The mailbox bears the king's cypher, the monogram that appears on government buildings which consists of the initials 'C' and 'R' - representing Charles's name and "Rex", the Latin for king - alongside a depiction of the crown.</p>

<p>One of Britain's most recognisable symbols, red pillar boxes appear on countless postcards and souvenir items, with about 115,000 in operation across the country.</p>

<p>The first post box was introduced in the 1850s, and their age can be traced by the royal cypher they bear, with the oldest dating back to the reign of Queen Victoria, Charles' great-great-great grandmother.</p>

<p>Although new boxes have been installed since Charles succeeded his mother in Sept. 2022, existing stocks bearing the late queen's cypher were used.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 22-year-old university student in the United States was found beaten to death and wrapped in a sheet in the back seat of her car - days after her boyfriend was let out of jail. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, Lauren Johansen's body was discovered wrapped in trash bags and a sheet on July 3 at a cemetery in Mississippi. Her father said he pleaded with a judge not to release her ex-boyfriend from jail, warning he would "kill her" if he did. However, the judge didn't heed his warnings and five days later, the body of the 22-year-old was found mutilated in her own car and police say her boyfriend was responsible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/us-news/nursing-student-lauren-johansen-found-beaten-to-death-after-dads-chilling-warning-to-judge/"><em>Post</em></a>, Ms Johansen's former partner, 23-year-old Bricen Rivers, has been arrested and charged with her murder. He had been released on a bond just five days before the 22-year-old's death. He was previously held for aggravated kidnapping for brutally beating Ms Johansen and holding her hostage during a December trip to Nashville.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Johansen was on track to get her nursing degree. She was first reported missing on July 2 when her sister woke up alone in their shared apartment with the front door wide open and their security camera smashed. The same morning, her father said he woke up to a notification that her location-tracking app had been turned off. He then reported her missing, and the next day, officers informed him that they had located her car in a nearby cemetery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Johansen was found dead in her car which was parked in the middle of a cemetery in Harrison County, Mississippi. Her mutilated body was wrapped up in trash bags over the back seats.</p>

<p>"She was basically beaten to death. Her face was smashed in, her head was smashed in, she was brutally beaten to the point she couldn't see out of either eye when she finally died and there was multiple holes in her head," Ms Johansen's father said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I helped the coroner lift her body out of the car. It was just mutilated," he continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The father also said that he had warned the judge that if her boyfriend was let out of jail, he would kill her. He alleged that Rivers had held his daughter hostage in December and beat her while the couple were on vacation in Nashville. He also added that in the moments leading to Rivers' December arrest, police officers found Lauren Johansen badly beaten and trying to escape a rental vehicle as Rivers reached for a firearm.</p>

<p>The heartbroken father slammed the criminal justice system in Tennessee for failing his family. "I think the criminal justice system in Nashville, Tennessee, failed my daughter and our family. The world shouldn't work this way," he said. "She was really beautiful, super, super smart. She had dreams and hopes that were larger than life. Everything she did, everything she touched," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, Rivers, who was arrested following a six-hour manhunt, faces a murder charge and is being held on a $1 million bond.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A road in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi has been named after an 84-year-old doctor with Indian roots as a tribute to his significant contributions to the country's health sector.</p>

<p>The Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT) has named a road in Abu Dhabi after Dr George Matthew to recognise his contributions as part of its “Honouring UAE's Visionaries: Commemorative Streets” project, which aims to honour individuals who have greatly contributed to the nation's development.</p>

<p>The road near Sheikh Shakbooth Medical City in Al Mafraq will now be known as George Matthew Street.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his journey, Dr Matthew said, “When I first arrived in the UAE, the infrastructure was still evolving. Inspired by the late HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Father of the Nation, I dedicated myself to helping the people. I am deeply grateful that my efforts have been recognised.” Dr Matthew arrived in the UAE in 1967 at the age of 26. Initially preparing to move to the US, he was persuaded by a missionary friend's description of Al Ain's beauty to stay.</p>

<p>His application for a position as Al Ain's first government doctor was successful, leading to the opening of the first clinic under Sheikh Zayed's blessing.</p>

<p>Starting his service as a General Practitioner, Dr Matthew, affectionately called Matyous (Emirati pronunciation of Mathew) by the locals, witnessed and contributed to the growth of modern medicine in the UAE.</p>

<p>He held several key positions, including Medical Director of Al Ain Region in 1972 and Health Authority Consultant in 2001. His contributions significantly advanced healthcare services in the emirate and promoted a modern medical culture in the country.</p>

<p>Dr Matthew went to England to learn management of tropical diseases, and later to Harvard for specialised studies in hospital management.</p>

<p>His commitment to education and professional development has been instrumental in shaping the healthcare landscape of the UAE. He played a vital role in educating and training healthcare workers, and his dedication earned him the trust and admiration of his colleagues and the community.</p>

<p>Known for his dedication and expertise, Dr Matthew has been a valuable source of medical knowledge for the Al Ain community.</p>

<p>In recognition of his service, the UAE granted Dr Matthew and his family citizenship 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Dr Matthew continues to work in the Private Health department alongside Dr Abdul Rahim Jaafar, another leading healthcare expert in the country.</p>

<p>Expressing his gratitude, Dr Matthew said, “I am ready to do whatever I can for the country and its citizens as long as I live. I pray that God will give me more time to serve.” Dr Matthew grew up in Thumpamon, Pathanamthitta, in Kerala, and graduated with an MBBS in 1965 from Trivandrum Medical College.</p>

<p>He moved to the UAE with his wife, Valsa, after their marriage. Their daughter also works in the government sector. PTI CORR GSP AKJ GSP</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli and Egyptian ceasefire negotiators are in talks about an electronic surveillance system along the border between Gaza and Egypt that could allow Israel to pull back its troops from the area if a ceasefire is agreed, according to two Egyptian sources and a third source familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The question of whether Israeli forces stay on the border is one of the issues blocking a potential ceasefire deal because both the Palestinian operatives Hamas and Egypt, a mediator in the talks, are opposed to Israel keeping its forces there.</p>

<p>Israel is worried that if its troops leave the border zone, referred to by Israel as the Philadelphi corridor, Hamas' armed wing could smuggle in weapons and supplies from Egypt into Gaza via tunnels that would allow it to re-arm and again threaten Israel.</p>

<p>A surveillance system, if the parties to the negotiations agree on the details, could therefore smooth the path to agreeing on a ceasefire - though numerous other stumbling blocks remain.</p>

<p>Discussions around a surveillance system on the border have been reported before, but Reuters is reporting for the first time that Israel is engaging in the discussions as part of the current round of talks, with a view to pulling back forces from the border area.</p>

<p>The source familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the discussions are about "basically sensors that would be built on the Egyptian side of the Philadelphi (corridor)."</p>

<p>"The idea is obviously to detect tunnels, to detect any other ways that they'd be trying to smuggle weapons or people into Gaza. Obviously this would be a significant element in a hostage agreement."</p>

<p>Asked if this would be significant for a ceasefire deal because it would mean Israeli soldiers would not have to be on the Philadelphi corridor, the source said: "Correct."</p>

<p>The two Egyptian security sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Israeli negotiators had spoken about a high-tech surveillance system.</p>

<p>Egypt was not opposed to that, if it was supported and paid for by the United States, according to the two Egyptian sources. They said that Egypt would not agree to anything that would change border arrangements between Israel and Egypt set out in a prior peace treaty.</p>

<p>At a military event on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could only agree to a deal that preserved Israeli control of the Gaza-Egypt border, but he did not spell out if that meant having troops physically present there.</p>

<p>Talks are underway in Qatar and Egypt on a deal, backed by Washington, that would allow a pause in the fighting in Gaza, now in its 10th month, and the release of hostages held by Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel started its assault on the Gaza Strip last October after Hamas-led operatives rushed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Since then, its forces have killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to medical authorities in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have said during the war that Hamas used tunnels running under the border into Egypt's Sinai region to smuggle arms. Egypt says it destroyed tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago and created a buffer zone and border fortifications that prevent smuggling.</p>

<p>Israel's advance into southern Gaza's Rafah area in early May led to the closure of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza and a sharp reduction in the amount of international aid entering the Palestinian territory. Egypt says it wants aid deliveries to Gaza to resume, but that a Palestinian presence should be restored at the Rafah crossing for it to reopen.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," he said, referring to Zelenskyy while speaking on the sidelines of the NATO Summit in Washington.</p>

<p>Zelenskyy looked nonplussed, then was seen shaking his head and smiling to himself.</p>

I am so focused on beating Putin."</p>

<p>Zelenskyy, who had by then recovered from his bafflement, responded by saying, "I am better (than Putin)."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 52,000 years ago, the skinned hide of a Siberian woolly mammoth was exposed to conditions so frigid that it spontaneously freeze-dried, locking its DNA fragments into place.</p>

<p>In a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists reported using this remarkable sample to reconstruct the animal's genome in three dimensions -- a breakthrough that could yield important new insights about extinct species and even boost efforts to bring them back to life.</p>

<p>Until now, ancient DNA specimens have only been found in short, scrambled fragments, severely limiting the amount of information researchers could extract.</p>

<p>"Now we show that, at least under some circumstances, it's not just those snippets of that DNA that survive, but they survive in such a way that preserves the original arrangement," co-author Olga Dudchenko, a geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understanding the 3D architecture of an organism's genome -- the complete set of its DNA -- is crucial for identifying which genes are active in specific tissues, revealing why brain cells think, heart cells beat, and immune cells fight disease.</p>

<p>It was long assumed that due to the rapid degradation of very small particles, such information would inevitably be lost to history.</p>

<p>But around a decade ago, an international team of scientists set out to find an ancient sample where the 3D organization of the DNA remained intact such that it could be fully reconstructed with a new analytical technique.</p>

<p>Their quest led them to an exceptionally well-preserved woolly mammoth sample, excavated in northeastern Siberia in 2018.</p>

<p>Whether the hirsute pachyderm -- a female with a distinctive mullet-style hairdo -- died naturally or was killed by humans is unknown. However, it does appear that early humans skinned her, leaving tissue around the head, neck, and left ear intact, according to Dudchenko.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Woolly mammoth jerky&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The team hypothesizes that the skin cooled and dehydrated, transitioning into a glasslike state that trapped its molecules in place and preserved the shape of its chromosomes, or the threadlike structures that hold DNA strands.</p>

<p>Essentially, they had discovered a piece of freeze-dried woolly mammoth jerky.</p>

<p>To test the resilience of jerky, they subjected lab-made and store-bought beef jerky pieces to a series of tests simulating the kind of damage ancient samples might encounter over millennia.</p>

<p>"We fired a shotgun at it. We ran over it with a car. We had a former starting pitcher for the Houston Astros throw a fastball at it," said Cynthia Perez Estrada, co-author of the study and a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University.</p>

<p>The jerky would break into tiny bits, shattering as dramatically as window glass at times. "But at the nano-scale, the chromosomes were intact, unchanged," said Perez Estrada in a statement.</p>

<p>One significant discovery from their research established that mammoths had 28 pairs of chromosomes. The finding aligns with the 28 chromosomal pairs found in elephants, the closest living relatives of mammoths, "but before this study, it was anybody's guess," said Dudchenko.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Fossil chromosomes'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The team's analysis also identified several "candidate" genes which might be responsible for what made woolly mammoths woolly -- including a gene responsible for long, thick eyelashes, and another associated with sparse sweat glands.</p>

<p>Erez Lieberman Aiden of Baylor College of Medicine, who co-led the team, told AFP that while the researchers' goal was not to bring mammoths back, the information they gleaned could be used for such efforts.</p>

<p>A Japanese team is looking at cloning woolly mammoths, while a group in the United States is aiming to create genetically "mammothized" elephants.</p>

<p>Within the skin, "96 per cent of genes are basically in the same activity state as an elephant," said Aiden, meaning that scientists working on de-extinction could now focus on the remaining four per cent.</p>

<p>The team now hopes that the benefit of their study will extend far beyond their special sample and open a new chapter in paleogenetics if other such "fossil chromosomes" can be found.</p>

<p>The Arctic permafrost remains a promising place to look, and it is also possible that mummification from ancient civilizations in warmer climates could preserve genomic structures too, according to Dudchenko.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former presidents and prime ministers have sent an open letter to current leaders of the world's 20 largest economies urging support for a global tax on billionaires, which they called a rare political opportunity.</p>

<p>The move comes as Brazil's G20 presidency, which put the proposal on the table in February, seeks to build support for a declaration at the group's finance ministers and central bank governors meeting later this month in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Signed by 19 Club de Madrid members, a forum of former leaders with over 100 participants, the letter praised U.S. President Joe Biden's billionaire income tax proposal but called for joint cooperation to combat tax evasion by the wealthiest.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO READ |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/global-super-rich-club-has-15-members-with-fortunes-over-100-billion-5682347">Global Super-Rich Club Has 15 Members With Fortunes Over $100 Billion</a></strong></p>

<p>"A global deal to tax the ultra-rich would be a shot in the arm for multilateralism: proving that governments can come together for the common good," said the letter.</p>

<p>Among signatories from across the political spectrum were Chile's Michelle Bachelet, Sweden's Stefan Lofven, Spain's Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, France's Dominique de Villepin, Canada's Kim Campbell, Australia's Julia Gillard and South Korea's Han Seung-soo.</p>

<p>Brazil's proposal, crafted by French economist Gabriel Zucman from the independent EU Tax Observatory, calls for an annual 2% levy on fortunes exceeding $1 billion, which could raise up to $250 billion annually from about 3,000 individuals.</p>

<p>While the communique from the latest G7 meeting in June said the group would continue collaborating with the Brazilian G20 presidency to enhance international cooperation and bolster efforts toward progressive and equitable taxation of individuals, some nations have already raised objections.</p>

<p>In May, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said his country sees new components of a global tax agenda with great skepticism, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States could not support negotiations involving redistributing proceeds among countries.</p>

<p>France, Spain, Colombia, Belgium, the African Union and South Africa, which will assume the G20 presidency next year, have already supported the initiative.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

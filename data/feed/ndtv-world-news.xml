       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday ended his reelection campaign. He said in a letter posted on social media platform X that he would remain in office until the end of his term and address the country later this week on his decision.</p>

<p>Below are reactions from politicians, industry and advocacy groups and other observers.</p>

<h3><strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>"I am honored to have the president's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination," Harris said in a statement. "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda."</p>

<h3><strong>Former President Donald Trump</strong></h3>

<p>In a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Trump responded, "He is the worst president in the history of our country. He goes down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country." Trump also said he thought Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been, according to CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>Former President Barack Obama</strong></h3>

<p>"I also know Joe has never backed down from a fight. For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America," the former president said in a statement. "I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges."</p>

<h3><strong>Chuck Schumer, Senate Majority Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American," the Democrat said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Elise Stefanik, House Republican Conference Chairwoman</strong></h3>

<p>"If Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States. He must immediately resign," Stefanik said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong></h3>

<p>"I commend President Biden for stepping down. His infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration - and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles - that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump," Kennedy said in a post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Hakeem Jeffries, House Democratic Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful," Jeffries said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Steve Scalise, House Majority Leader</strong></h3>

<p>"Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters. After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket-trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters," Scalise, a Republican, said on X.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee</strong></h3>

<p>"Americans and democracy-loving people world owe Joe Biden a debt of gratitude. The Congressional Black Caucus PAC joins President Biden in fully supporting Kamala Harris as our party's nominee," the organization said in a statement posted to X.</p>

<h3><strong>Nancy Pelosi, Former House Speaker</strong></h3>

<p>"President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history. With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden's greatness and goodness."</p>

<h3><strong>Gavin Newsom, Governor Of California</strong></h3>

<p>"President Biden has been an extraordinary, history-making president - a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans. He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents," Newsom posted on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Nanette Barragan, Chair Of The Congressional Hispanic Caucus</strong></h3>

<p>"I am with you @JoeBiden - I endorse @KamalaHarris as our Democratic nominee &amp; will work tirelessly to make sure she is elected our next President in November," Barrag√°n said in a post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>South Carolina Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn</strong></h3>

<p>"I echo the good judgment [President Biden] demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party's 2024 nominee for president," Clyburn said in a statement</p>

<h3><strong>Andy Beshear, Governor Of Kentucky</strong></h3>

<p>Beshear, whose name has also been floated as a possible contender as president or vice president, praised Biden for acting "in the best interest of our country, and our party" and "for a successful presidency that got big, important things done."</p>

<p>"Now it is time for our nation to come together," he added in his post on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Peter Welch, US Senator</strong></h3>

<p>Welch, the first Democratic Senator to call on Joe Biden to drop his reelection run, on Sunday praised the president for ending his quest, saying he showed "good judgment and great humility" and "put the country first."</p>

<p>"It was an agonizing decision," Welch said in an interview with Reuters. "Every fiber of his being wanted to continue to fight and to beat Trump again."</p>

<p>Welch declined to endorse Harris, who he acknowledged was the frontrunner to replace Biden.</p>

<p>The Democrats should have "an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Barbara Lee, US Representative</strong></h3>

<p>Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a phone interview there is "no other option" but to choose Harris as the party's nominee.</p>

<p>"She is the best vice president," Lee said. "She is experienced, capable and smart. She has been a part of the Biden-Harris legacy that needs to continue."</p>

<h3><strong>Gretchen Whitmer, Governor Of Michigan</strong></h3>

<p>"President Biden is a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump. His remarkable work to lower prescription drug costs, fix the damn roads, bring supply chains home, address climate change, and ensure America's global leadership over decades will go down in history. My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families' costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan," Whitmer said on X.</p>

<h3><strong>United Auto Workers</strong></h3>

<p>"Vice President Kamala Harris walked the picket line with us in 2019, and along with President Biden has brought work and jobs back to communities like Lordstown, Ohio, and Belvidere, Illinois. That's the legacy President Biden leaves and that's the work we will continue to build on as a union," the union said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Dick Durbin, Senator And Majority Whip</strong></h3>

<p>"Throughout his public career, Joe Biden always put country first. His four years as President made it clear that he was determined to put our country back on track and restore the soul of our nation. America will be forever grateful for all he has given to this country," Durbin posted on X.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Clintons</strong></h3>

<p>"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her," the Clintons said in a statement. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago, as he ran for the White House, Joe Biden saw himself as a one-term president -- a savvy conduit from the chaotic years of Donald Trump to a new generation of Democratic leaders.</p>

<p>"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else," Biden said at a campaign event in March 2020, with a group of much younger politicians vying to be his running mate -- including Kamala Harris, who ultimately got the nod.</p>

<p>"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country," said Biden, who went on to beat Trump, though the Republican never accepted his defeat.</p>

<p>It was widely seen as his main mission -- dislodge Trump from the White House, then bow out, with elegance, after one term.</p>

<p>Biden, now 81, will indeed be a one-term president, but under tumultuous, agonizing circumstances: long-simmering worries about his age and mental sharpness have exploded to doom him when he decided to go for a second term after all.</p>

<p>On Sunday Biden said he was dropping his bid to run against Trump again in November, yielding to intense and growing pressure as polls showed most people even in his own Democratic Party felt he was too old to run for another term, much less serve four more years.</p>

<h3><strong>Defiance to dropping out</strong></h3>

<p>Presidents tend to see their party take a beating in congressional elections held half way through their term, but Biden and his Democrats did surprisingly well in 2022. A feared hemorraghing of Democratic seats failed to materialize.</p>

<p>This was due in part to Americans' anger over the Supreme Court's ending of the 50-year-old federal right to abortion -- the decision of a court with three new conservatives judges appointed by Trump.</p>

<p>Energized by that strong showing, months later Biden announced that he would seek a second term after all.</p>

<p>"When I ran for president four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are," Biden said in April 2023.</p>

<p>"The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer," Biden said in a video announcing his 2024 run.</p>

<p>Biden and his party went through the motions of the Democratic primary elections with no serious opposition, although some in the party grumbled that Biden was too old to seek a second term.</p>

<p>"No, I've been very clear. I'd like to see a generational change," said Tim Ryan, a Democratic senator from Ohio.</p>

<p>Polls had long shown that many people considered Biden's age an issue, and for him the beginning of the end came on a debate stage with Trump in Atlanta on June 27.</p>

<p>As 50 million people watched on TV, the president performed dismally, struggling to complete sentences, speaking incoherently at times and looking dazed, his mouth agape.</p>

<p>A drum roll of calls for him to bow out began immediately, and grew steadily louder, amid warnings to Biden that he could not beat Trump, might destroy his own legacy if he insisted on running and lost, and could might well drag the Democratic Party down with him in defeat.</p>

<p>To the very end Biden insisted, day after day, he was all in -- the only candidate who could beat Trump as he had once before.</p>

<p>As he isolated at his beach house this weekend to recover from a Covid infection, Biden announced he would go back on the campaign trail next week.</p>

<p>Until Sunday's bomb dropped in a message on X. He said it was in the interest of the country and his party for him to step aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic party will be taking a historic gamble if it now turns to Vice President Kamala Harris to become its presidential candidate, betting that a Black woman can overcome racism, sexism and her own missteps as a politician to defeat Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, 81, announced on Sunday he was ending his campaign for reelection, while staying on as president for the remainder of his term. In a separate post on X, formerly Twitter, he endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made," Biden wrote. "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year."</p>

<p>Biden's decision comes after weeks of pressure from Democratic lawmakers and donors who feared he lacked the mental and physical stamina to win and serve four more years.</p>

<p>In more than two centuries of democracy, American voters have elected only one Black president and never a woman, a record that makes even some Black voters wonder if Harris can crash through the hardest ceiling in U.S. politics.</p>

<p>"Will her race and gender be an issue? Absolutely," said LaTosha Brown, a political strategist and co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris would face other big challenges: if promoted to the top of the ticket, she would have barely three months to campaign and unite the party and donors behind her. But many Democrats are excited about her chances.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is two decades younger than Trump and a leader in the party on abortion rights, an issue which resonates with younger voters and Democrats' progressive base. Proponents argue she would energize those voters, consolidate Black support, and bring sharp debating skills to prosecute the political case against the former president.</p>

<p>Her candidacy would offer a contrast with Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, the two white men on the Republican ticket, Brown said.</p>

<p>"That to me is reflective of America's past. She is reflective of America's now and future," Brown said.</p>

<p>But despite earning praise in the last few weeks for her strong defense of Biden, some Democrats remain concerned about Harris' shaky first two years in office, short-lived campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination, and - perhaps most of all - the weight of a long history of racial and gender discrimination in the United States.</p>

<h3><strong>'No Safe Option'</strong></h3>

<p>In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted immediately after the assassination attempt against Trump. Trump led Biden 43% to 41% in that same poll, though the 2 percentage point difference was within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris's approval ratings, while low, are a tick higher than Biden's. According to polling outfit Five Thirty Eight, 38.6 percent of Americans approve of Harris while 50.4 percent disapprove. Biden has 38.5 percent approval and 56.2 percent disapproval.</p>

<p>"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Kamala - Vice President Harris - you would be mistaken," Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a Biden supporter, said on Instagram. "There's no safe option."</p>

<p>The United States elected Barack Obama, the first and only Black president, in 2008. The only woman to head a presidential ticket of a major party, Hillary Clinton, lost to Trump in 2016.</p>

<p>Supporters of Harris, the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, argue she has already weathered unfair attacks related to her race and gender and is prepared for more.</p>

<p>"America has a history of racism, sexism, so I'm sure that will factor into this conversation, factor into her campaign," said Jamal Simmons, a former Harris aide.</p>

<p>But he said there is a flip side: Black voters could be galvanized if Harris is put at the top of the ticket, and women, including some who regret not voting for Clinton in 2016, would back her as well.</p>

<p>"It's also true that she will benefit from her race and her gender, that many African Americans may rally to her candidacy," he said.</p>

<p>Harris benefits from greater name recognition than the other Democratic leaders who have been floated as potential presidential candidates, he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are among those talked about in Democratic circles as possible replacements.</p>

<p>"While she has flaws and faults like everyone, we know those flaws and faults, so you can build a campaign with clarity. Any other candidates are complete unknowns," Simmons said.</p>

<p>One former Democratic lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he thought Harris was a bigger risk because of her record than her race.</p>

<p>Harris was plagued by staff turnover at the beginning of her vice presidency and showed little progress on her portfolios of protecting voting rights and stemming migration from Central America.</p>

<p>"I think the race thing is just a compounding factor or an exacerbating factor," the former lawmaker said. "Any of it's going to be a gamble, but I like the odds with another candidate, even if that means Kamala at the top of the ticket."</p>

<h3><strong>'Patriarchy Is Hell Of A Drug'</strong></h3>

<p>Critics have accused Trump of using racist and sexist language, explicitly and in code. In 2020 he said he had "heard" Harris, a U.S. citizen born in California, did not qualify to be a candidate for vice president.</p>

<p>At a rally in Michigan on Saturday, Trump piled on Harris for the way she laughs.</p>

<p>"I call her Laughing Kamala," Trump said. "You ever watch her laugh? She's crazy."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said Democrats were deploying "classic disinformation" about his language and noted Harris's dispute with Biden in a 2019 debate about school busing and her criticism of Biden for working with segregationists in the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In contrast, President Trump is polling at record-high levels with African Americans," Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump made false "birtherism" claims against Obama, who was born in Hawaii. Those falsehoods gained traction among far-right activists and his nationalist base, prompting an exasperated Obama, blasting "carnival barkers," to release a longer version of his birth certificate from the White House.</p>

<p>Polling at the time showed a quarter of all Americans - and 45 percent of Republicans - believed Obama had not been born in the country.</p>

<p>"You've got birtherism 2.0," said Cliff Albright, co-founder and CEO of Black Voters Matter Fund, an Atlanta-based non-profit, referring to Harris.</p>

<p>Nadia Brown, director of the women's and gender studies program at Georgetown University, said despite the rise of Black political leaders, there remains a notable reluctance to accept women in key leadership roles.</p>

<p>"Patriarchy is a hell of a drug," Brown said. "With racism, we know it, we can call it out. The mood that we're not seeing as articulately expressed is a real reticence to have a Black woman in particular as a leader."</p>

<p>Harris's standing in the party has improved with her aggressive advocacy for reproductive rights after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v Wade, which protected women's right to abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden credited her with helping to prevent a "red wave" of Republican victories in that year's midterm elections, and Harris has crisscrossed the country as a top campaign spokesperson on abortion rights.</p>

<p>Harris could also inherit Biden's strong support among Black voters, who helped propel him to the 2020 Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>But if the party ends up coalescing around Harris, she could receive some of the blame from voters who say Democratic leaders covered up Biden's frailties.</p>

<p>"I'm kind of done with the Democrats. So many knew about Biden's condition and hid it. Kamala was part of that," said Gina Gannon, 65, a retiree in the battleground state of Georgia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden's shock decision Sunday to end his reelection bid drew an outpouring of heartfelt reactions from American voters.</p>

<p>Several people expressed deep sadness that Biden, 81, had essentially been forced out after what they saw as an effective first term.</p>

<p>But others said the decision was a relief, given the growing calls for him to step down, and the clear signs of aging seen in his debate against Republican Donald Trump and other appearances.</p>

<p>Here is a selection of their comments.</p>

<p>"It's a shame. But the leader of the free world needs to be sharp, and needs to be on his game.... He is a kind man, he cares about our country, and so for him to be somewhat forced out of his position that he loved so much -- he served our nation for a long, long time -- it is sad." -- Thomas Watson, 67, amateur presidential historian, interviewed in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>

<p>"I think that Biden brought it upon himself. His performance has been a debacle. I think that it made the public very nervous as far as him going into this presidential race as a contender against Donald Trump, who is, although, an older individual as well." -- Tayaba Zahra, a 41-year-old lawyer, in New York.</p>

<p>"It's not a surprise. His mental decline has been obvious, I think. And it's a shame" -- Thomas Watson, 67, an amateur presidential historian at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>

<p>"The honest truth is I do think he wasn't equipped... (but) I'm sure for him personally this is a personal kind of devastation." -- Ingrid Gonzalez, 46-year-old entrepreneur and self-described independent, in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"I'm stunned. And happy - because the decision has finally been made, and now the Democratic Party can get their crap together and figure it out." -- Barb Katz, 59, a retired teacher from Illinois visiting Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>"I hope that there's no nonsense and they put Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket... Think about how invigorated the Democratic Party is going to be." -- Jill Lake, a Democratic voter from Maryland, interviewed in Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>"It makes me nervous in other ways because I don't know that this country is ready to elect a Black woman. But I think that we have to get ready, quick." -- Mary Biggs, a 58-year-old educator, in New York.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump crowed, "the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard" after President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race for the White House.</p>

<p>"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate," Trump posted on Saturday on Truth Social, the X-like social media platform he uses, mangling the capitalisation of his text.</p>

<p>After the June 27 debate in which his performance raised questions about cognitive abilities and his capacity to match Trump's campaign vitality, Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party candidate.</p>

<p>Trump piled on personal insults and questions about Biden's performance in the post, "Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation."</p>

<p>"He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more," Trump said repeating his constant refrain.</p>

<p>Trump alleged that "the people around him lied to America about his Complete and Total Mental, Physical, and Cognitive Demise" to prop up Biden.</p>

<p>Trump did not mention Harris, but said, "Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same."</p>

<p>On Saturday at a campaign rally, Trump ridiculed Harris.</p>

<p>He said, "Kamaala, I call her laughing Kamaala. Have you seen her laughing? She is crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She is nuts. She is not as crazy as (former Speaker) Nancy Pelosi."</p>

<p>CNN reported that Trump said that she (Harris) will be easier to defeat than Biden.</p>

<p>Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. fired the opening salvo on his father's behalf, "Kamala Harris owns the entire Left-wing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a week is a long time in politics, the last eight days of the US presidential campaign have proved a drama of epic proportions.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's shock decision Sunday to drop out of the 2024 presidential race capped a head-spinning week that began with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and has left Americans reeling.</p>

<p>Here is how the week unfolded:</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: Trump assassination bid</strong></h3>

<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump survives an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old on a nearby rooftop opened fire.</p>

<p>Pictures of the bloodied candidate defiantly shaking his fist as Secret Service agents rush him from the stage become iconic, galvanizing his supporters.</p>

<h3><strong>Monday: Republican National Convention begins</strong></h3>

<p>Trump appears before a roaring crowd at the Republican National Convention, his ear -- wounded in the assassination attempt -- covered by a white bandage. He names Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.</p>

<h3><strong>Wednesday: Pressure on Biden increases</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's support continues to ebb following his disastrous June 27 debate with Trump, as Democratic fears grow over the 81-year-old's age and ability to beat Trump at the polls -- then serve another four years.</p>

<p>A top Democratic lawmaker, Adam Schiff, joins a fast-growing list of party officials urging the president to step aside, praising him but saying "our nation is at a crossroads."</p>

<p>Biden is also diagnosed with Covid, forced to step off the campaign trail and retreat to his Delaware home to recover.</p>

<p>In an interview released the same day, he says he could reconsider his election bid if a "medical condition" emerged.</p>

<h3><strong>Thursday: Pelosi, Obama, Trump</strong></h3>

<p>New signs of waning Democrat support emerge: Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had worked to resolve the growing crisis, is said to tell House Democrats the president might be persuaded soon to exit the race.</p>

<p>And Barack Obama, the former president who was once Biden's boss, reportedly tells allies the president should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy."</p>

<p>In Milwaukee, Trump accepts his nomination at the Republican National Convention, promising an enraptured crowd they can expect an "incredible victory" in November.</p>

<h3><strong>Friday: 'Stakes are high'</strong></h3>

<p>With the list of lawmakers urging Biden to drop out reaching 25, he again insists he will stay in the race, saying, "The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win."</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: 'Bullet for democracy'</strong></h3>

<p>In his first rally since the attempted assassination, Trump tells a rapt crowd in swing state Michigan "I took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>He mocks Democrats' leadership crisis, saying, "They have no idea who their candidate is."</p>

<h3><strong>Sunday: Biden's big decision</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday begins with key Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat-aligned independent, joining the chorus urging Biden to step aside.</p>

<p>Two polls bring grim news for the president, one showing sharply dropping support in battleground state Michigan, the other showing Trump enjoying his highest favorability ratings in years.</p>

<p>At 1.46 pm Washington time (1746 GMT) Biden posts a stunning statement on social media announcing he is ending his candidacy, saying it is "in the best interest of my party and the country."</p>

<p>He endorses Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's new nominee, as top Democrats such as Bill and Hillary Clinton echo their support.</p>

<p>Trump declares on social media that Biden was "not fit to run" and "is certainly not fit to serve." Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson insists that Biden "must resign" as president "immediately."</p>

<p>The Democratic Party chairman announces there will be a "transparent and orderly" to pick someone to run in Biden's place.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Democrats on Sunday quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>After weeks of in-party fighting between Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind her is crucial just over 100 days before November's election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, not in his initial letter stepping down, but in a separate statement. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, lawmakers including U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said on social media platform X. "Democrats - it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this."</p>

<p>Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris "the American dream personified," noting she was the daughter of immigrants. "She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris."</p>

<p>Still, others including Pelosi thanked Biden for his patriotism but did not yet throw their support behind Harris or any other candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his reelection run, called for an open process to nominate Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrats should have "an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party," he said. "The debate in the Democratic Party is who can carry on the legacy of President Biden and defeat Trump."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race for the White House leaves a gap atop the Democratic presidential ticket that the party is now rushing to fill.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race for the White House leaves a gap atop the Democratic presidential ticket that the party is now rushing to fill.</p>

<p>Here is a look at potential replacements:</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>She seems like the obvious choice, and Biden has given her his endorsement.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been a heartbeat away from the Oval Office since Biden's January 2021 swearing in, is well positioned to be the Democratic Party's standard-bearer.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, is a trailblazer.</p>

<p>She was the first Black person and the first woman to serve as California's attorney general, and then was the first US senator of South Asian descent.</p>

<p>She is now the first woman and first Black vice president.</p>

<p>During her career as a prosecutor, Harris had a reputation for being tough -- a trait she could use to advantage in a campaign expected to focus on crime and immigration.</p>

<p>But some progressive Democrats have been critical of her strict punishment of minor offenders, saying it disproportionately affected minorities.</p>

<p>Harris also suffers from a dismal approval rating, which could prompt Democrats to find another solution.</p>

<h3><strong>Gavin Newsom</strong></h3>

<p>There is no rule that a running mate automatically replaces the presidential candidate in the case of a withdrawal. This is why California Governor Gavin Newsom's name keeps popping up.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old Democrat, a former mayor of San Francisco, has been at the helm of the Golden State -- the most populous in the United States -- for five years, and has made it a haven for abortion access.</p>

<p>Newsom steadfastly supported Biden and dismissed talk of replacing him prior to the Democrat's withdrawal, but he has also made little secret of his own presidential ambitions.</p>

<p>In recent months, he has increased his international travel, run multiple ads touting his record, and invested millions of dollars in a political action committee, fueling speculation that he will run in 2028. So why not 2024?</p>

<h3><strong>Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h3>

<p>Another possible Democratic candidate is Gretchen Whitmer, the 52-year-old governor of Michigan.</p>

<p>Her state has both a strong working-class population and major Black and Arab American communities -- all key groups of voters that Biden struggled to court.</p>

<p>Whitmer, a fierce critic of Trump, is perhaps best known for being the intended target of a kidnapping plot devised by a far-right militia group.</p>

<p>Michigan will be one of the crucial battleground states in the November 5 presidential election -- a strong argument, according to her supporters, for naming Whitmer as a candidate.</p>

<h3><strong>Josh Shapiro</strong></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro leads the biggest swing state in November's race.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old, who was elected in November 2022 with a convincing victory over a conservative rival and took office in early 2023, previously was elected twice as the state's attorney general.</p>

<p>He condemned Catholic priests who had sexually abused thousands of children and prosecuted Purdue Pharma, the maker of the powerful opioid painkiller OxyContin.</p>

<p>Shapiro is an effective speechmaker and an avowed centrist -- qualities that could propel him to national office.</p>

<h3><strong>The rest</strong></h3>

<p>Other names circulating include Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, but their chances so far seem limited at best.</p>

<p>Senator Amy Klobuchar and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who both ran against Biden in the 2020 primaries, have also been mentioned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following are some reactions from abroad to U.S. President Joe Biden's decision on Sunday to pull out of his campaign to seek reelection in November:</p>

<h3><strong>BRITISH PRIME MINISTER KEIR STARMER:</strong></h3>

<p>"I respect President Biden's decision and I look forward to us working together during the remainder of his presidency," Starmer said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, President Biden will have made his decision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people."</p>

<h3><strong>IRISH TAOISEACH SIMON HARRIS ON &nbsp;X:</strong></h3>

<p>"On behalf of the people and government of Ireland. I, as Taoiseach, would like to thank you Mr President for your global leadership and your friendship as you make your announcement that you will not stand in the 2024 US Presidential election.</p>

<p>"The world has changed since President Biden's victory in 2020 and we have had to face extraordinary challenges from a global pandemic to the return of war to the continent of Europe with the horrific full- scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia which has deliberately targeted and killed innocent civilians.</p>

<p>"President Biden has been a voice for reason, effective multilateralism and shared solutions."</p>

<h3><strong>KREMLIN SPOKESMAN DMITRY PESKOV speaking to SHOT news outlet:</strong></h3>

<p>"The elections are still four months away, and that is a long period of time in which a lot can change. We need to be patient and carefully monitor what happens. The priority for us is the special military operation," Peskov said, referring to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER JONAS GAHR STOERE:</strong></h3>

<p>"I respect Joe Biden's decision not to run for re-election. That justification deserves respect," Stoere told national broadcaster NRK.</p>

<p>"Biden has been one of America's most prominent politicians over several decades, and a president who has carried out several important reforms."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>POLISH PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK ON X:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"Mr. President @JoeBiden, many times you have made difficult decisions that have made Poland, America, and the world safer, and democracy and freedom stronger. I know that you were guided by the same principles when announcing your latest decision. Perhaps the most difficult one in your life."</p>

<h3><strong>CZECH PRIME MINISTER PETR FIALA ON X:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It is undoubtedly the decision of a statesman who has served his country for decades. It is a responsible and personally difficult step, but it is all the more valuable. I am keeping my fingers crossed for the USA that a good president emerges from the democratic competition of two strong and equal candidates."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president Donald Trump on Sunday reacted to Joe Biden ending his reelection bid, claiming the incumbent president is "certainly not fit to serve."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the race to be the next president, following mounting pressure from Democrats after a faltering debate performance against Republican candidate Trump last month.</p>

<p>Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris, the current vice-president, to be the new Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was! He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.</p>

<p>"All those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn't capable of being President, and he wasn't," Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, added, "We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" In a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden, 81, announced his exit from the 2024 race, Trump described Biden as going "down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country." Meanwhile, Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also attacked Kamala Harris as "even more liberal and less competent" than Biden.</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr. attacked Vice President Harris, who President Biden endorsed for the Democratic nomination after stepping down, as "even more liberal and less competent" than Biden.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something. She was put in charge of the border and we saw the worst invasion of illegals in our history!!!" Trump Jr. said.</p>

<p>Former president Donald Trump, told CNN earlier that he thinks Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been in the November 5 presidential election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Sunday that a negotiating team would be sent this week for new talks on a deal to free hostages held by operatives in Gaza.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said the team would leave Thursday -- the day after he gives a speech to the United States Congress -- but he did not say where they would go.</p>

<p>Qatar and Egypt, with US support, have been mediating indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, which holds the hostages and has been at war with Israel for more than nine months.</p>

<p>International mediators have been trying for months to seal an accord between Israel and Hamas. A deal would involve a six-week ceasefire during which some hostages seized by Hamas would be exchanged for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today held an in-depth discussion on the issue of the hostages with the negotiation team and senior security officials," said a brief statement released by his office.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who says he will meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on Tuesday, the day before a speech before Congress, "ordered the negotiating team to leave on Thursday," it added.</p>

<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant indicated that a deal could be reached.</p>

<p>"As a result of our military achievements during this war, the conditions have been created and a limited window of opportunity has opened to establish a framework for the release of the hostages," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The defence establishment backs you in your mission to bring about an agreement."</p>

<p>David Barnea, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, has twice been to Qatar in recent weeks for talks that fuelled the hopes of the families of the hostages that an accord could be close.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to eradicate Hamas as well as bring home all the hostages. Far-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal.</p>

<p>Hamas officials, whose October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war, have accused the prime minister of obstructing prospects for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Demonstrators in Israel, who have taken to the streets sometimes in the tens of thousands to demand new elections and a hostage-release deal, also accuse Netanyahu of prolonging the war.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that he believed "we're inside the 10 yard line and driving toward the goal line" for a ceasefire deal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden wanted to save the "soul of America" from Donald Trump, but his stubborn defiance of the march of time may have cleared his rival's path back to power.</p>

<p>Biden caved in to growing pressure Sunday and announced he is dropping out of the presidential race, amid concerns over his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump and serve four more years.</p>

<p>As he fought for his political survival after a disastrous debate, the 81-year-old Democrat repeatedly cited his family's mantra that "when you get knocked down, get back up again."</p>

<p>From playground punch-ups to a stutter to terrible family tragedies, Biden had long seen his life story as a series of comebacks against impossible odds.</p>

<p>And it was his triumph four years ago against Trump that convinced Biden that, despite being the oldest president in US history, he was the only one who could do it again -- until he threw in the towel on Sunday.</p>

<p>Overcoming his reputation as a gaffe machine, Biden initially lived up to his goal as a "unifier in chief" after the Trump years and the shock of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>But the question of his age always loomed large.</p>

<p>Biden eventually joked about it but always denied it was an issue, even after a debate where his rambling answers and listless stare sparked a revolt by Democrats.</p>

<p>A mix of pride and his conviction that Trump was a threat to democracy kept Biden fighting until it was, perhaps, too late.</p>

<p>Franklin Foer, author of a book on the Biden presidency, wrote recently that "humiliation -- and its transcendence -- is Biden's origin story."</p>

<p>"Right now it is his psychological prison, a mental habit that might doom American democracy," he wrote in the Atlantic.</p>

<p><strong>'Cruel losses'</strong></p>

<p>That outlook was largely formed by a hardscrabble childhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the American rust-belt.</p>

<p>Biden was part of a close-knit Irish Catholic family -- he was just the second Catholic US president after his hero John F. Kennedy -- that was known for its intense pride.</p>

<p>His mother Jean told the young Joey and his siblings every day that "nobody was better than a Biden," Ben Cramer wrote in his book "What It Takes," about the 1988 US election campaign.</p>

<p>He was also known for never backing down.</p>

<p>"He decided to fight... BANGO -- he'd punch the guy in the face," Cramer wrote.</p>

<p>One affliction Biden famously had to battle was a childhood stutter.</p>

<p>Repeatedly humiliated at school, the young Biden ended up teaching himself how to speak smoothly by sheer determination, repeating phrases again and again into the mirror.</p>

<p>But Biden's biggest test was yet to come.</p>

<p>In 1972, he was only 29 and had just won an unlikely victory to be elected senator for Delaware when his wife Neilia and their one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash. Their young sons Beau and Hunter were left badly injured.</p>

<p>Tragedy struck again in 2015 when Beau died of brain cancer, aged 46.</p>

<p>Biden also had to deal with the agony of Hunter's drug addiction and legal problems.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I marvel at Joe's strength. His life has been marked by cruel losses," First Lady Jill Biden, whom Biden married in 1977, said in her memoir "Where the Light Enters."</p>

<p><strong>'President for all Americans'</strong></p>

<p>With his family close around him, Biden did not let two failed presidential bids -- and a nearly fatal aneurysm in 1988 -- discourage him.</p>

<p>He served as Barack Obama's vice president for two terms, and his stubborn persistence in pursuit of the top job paid off when he came out of retirement to beat Trump in 2020, defying critics who said he was too old.</p>

<p>Saying at his inauguration he wanted to be a "president for all Americans," his old-fashioned centrism was a relief to many after the divisiveness of the Trump years.</p>

<p>At home he forced through a massive Covid recovery scheme and a green investment plan.</p>

<p>In Kamala Harris, his likely successor to the Democratic nomination, he appointed the first female, Black and South Asian vice president in US history.</p>

<p>US allies welcomed his pledge that "America is back" and his strong support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>But despite the best efforts of the White House to limit his public appearances, his age became the story again.</p>

<p>A series of senior moments culminated in the disastrous debate performance against Trump that doomed his bid for a second term.</p>

<p>As he fought to save it, he returned to the image of the underdog, often repeating his father's saying: "Don't compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative."</p>

<p>Now Democrats have done just that.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years Kamala Harris faced criticism that she was not up to the job of being a heartbeat away from the presidency. Now, she finds herself feted by Democrats as their best hope to stop Donald Trump's comeback.</p>

<p>Despite blazing a trail as the first woman, Black and South Asian vice president in US history, the 59-year-old Democrat long struggled with approval ratings as bad or worse than President Joe Biden's.</p>

<p>The last 12 months, however, have revealed a transformed Harris.</p>

<p>And with Biden's endorsement of Harris after stunning the world by dropping his own reelection bid Sunday, she's suddenly on the cusp of history.</p>

<p>Harris will hope she has done the hard work to earn her full party's backing in the midst of the crisis.</p>

<p>As the ageing Biden faded over the last year, his "veep" emerged as a force on the campaign trail, pushing for abortion rights and reaching out to core voters, including suburban women and Black men.</p>

<p>With a fondness for the f-bomb and her family nickname of "Momala" going viral, she has also finally started to cut through the noise to voters who previously barely paid attention.</p>

<p>She has also won plaudits in party circles by staying loyal to the 81-year-old president during the last few weeks, even as political vultures circled over his candidacy.</p>

<p>She now is likely to face Trump -- a brutal battle against a candidate who defeated Hillary Clinton in her bid become the first female commander in chief in 2016.</p>

<p>The fact that Harris has blamed much of the criticism of her by Republicans on racism and sexism would likely make a win feel even more vindicating for her.</p>

<p>Trump and other Republicans have notably stepped up their attacks on her as Biden's position weakened and polls showed Harris would fare better against him than Biden.</p>

<h3><strong>'Ready to serve'</strong></h3>

<p>A child of immigrant parents -- her father was from Jamaica and her mother from India -- Harris grew up in Oakland, California, in an activist household that saw her attend her first rallies in a stroller.</p>

<p>Her focus on rights and justice saw her build an impressive CV, becoming California's first Black attorney general and the first woman of South Asian heritage elected to the US Senate.</p>

<p>Harris then went up against Biden in the 2020 primaries. In one stinging attack, she criticized him for allegedly opposing the bussing of students to segregated schools.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me," she said in a barbed attack on her future boss.</p>

<p>But as his running mate, she consolidated the coalition that helped defeat the incumbent Trump in 2020.</p>

<p>Her transition to the White House, however, proved difficult.</p>

<p>Critics said she was underwhelming and gaffe-prone in a job that has been known to flummox many officeholders.</p>

<p>Struggling to carve out a role, she was tasked by Biden with getting to the roots of the illegal migration problem, but fumbled and then got defensive in response to a question during a visit to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>Unusually high staff turnover fed rumors of discontent in the vice presidential office.</p>

<p>And Republicans relentlessly targeted her as being unfit to take over should the worst happen to America's oldest-ever president, often resorting to stereotypes her supporters branded as sexist and racist.</p>

<p>Harris told the Wall Street Journal in February: "I am ready to serve. There's no question about that."</p>

<h3><strong>'Momala'</strong></h3>

<p>Things began to change as the 2024 race got underway.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign repeatedly deployed her to battleground states to hammer home the party's message on abortion rights, with Harris becoming the first vice president to visit an abortion clinic.</p>

<p>Gradually, she began to draw warm and fired-up crowds.</p>

<p>Some of the outreach was, however, cringe-inducing. Earlier this year, she was mocked after she told chat show host Drew Barrymore her family sometimes called her "Momala," and Barrymore replied: "We need you to be Momala of the country."</p>

<p>But voters seemed to be switching on.</p>

<p>A clip of her quoting her mother as often saying "You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?" became a meme, with a rising sense among supporters that now could be her time.</p>

<p>If elected, Harris would break one of the highest glass ceilings left for women in the United States -- that of occupying the country's top office.</p>

<p>Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, would also be breaking new ground, moving from being the current Second Gentleman to the country's first First Gentleman.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's withdrawal upends what was already a White House race for the ages, but it will rattle Donald Trump, too -- forcing him to recalibrate a campaign that was focused almost entirely on his former opponent.</p>

<p>For months Trump and his allies have been playing on concerns that the 81-year-old Biden may no longer be fit for office, gleefully sharing video clips of every stammer, rhetorical gaffe and red carpet stumble.</p>

<p>He was frequently a target of Republican mockery and scorn at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump's newly announced running mate J.D. Vance called him "Fake Scranton Joe."</p>

<p>But with the Democrat no longer in the race, the Trump operation finds itself pushed into a strategic pivot, forced now to shift its messaging to fit a contest with no incumbent and a yet-to-be-confirmed opponent, although Biden did endorse Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday as he pulled out of the race.</p>

<p>"Biden withdrawing is bad news for Trump," Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center think tank, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Biden has the lowest job approval of any first-term president at this stage of his presidency in polling history and is also irretrievably burdened by his age. It's much better for Trump to run against him than any conceivable opponent."</p>

<p>Trumpworld had been playing down the chances of Biden withdrawing, but behind the scenes aides have been consumed by the contingencies, preparing a brutal assault on the veteran Democrat's heir apparent, Harris.</p>

<p>"Nothing fundamentally changes" Jason Miller, one of Trump's closest advisors, told AFP during the Republican convention, saying that any "radical liberal" Democratic opponent, Harris or otherwise, shares "the responsibility for the failure of destroying our economy."</p>

<p>Harris, a 59-year-old former California senator is not a shoo-in, and could face competition from multiple leading Democrats in Congress and the nation's 23 Democratic governors.</p>

<p>"I'm going to show up and I'm going to campaign -- whether it's him or somebody else," Trump told a radio network in Virginia before Biden's announcement, pointing to polls showing him doing as well or better against other Democrats.</p>

<p>- Clash of cultures -</p>

<p>Voters have been telling pollsters for months they want younger political leaders, and a ticket topped by a relatively youthful swing state governor, for example, would be a threat to Trump, who would be 82 at the end of a second term.</p>

<p>A campaign led by Harris and backed up by a moderate midwestern running mate could present the biggest danger though, helping turn out more women, who historically vote in greater numbers than men and are a weakness for Trump.</p>

<p>Harris would also give Democrats a chance to redefine the race at their convention in Chicago in August as a clash of cultures between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon.</p>

<p>And Harris ensures that abortion rights -- one of her biggest domestic priorities and another vulnerability for Trump and the Republicans -- remains a crucial election issue.</p>

<p>Trump's new, serious focus on the vice president was demonstrated by his bestowal on her of one of his famous nicknames, referring to her on social media recently as "Laffin' Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>- 'Destruction and chaos' -</p>

<p>It is the disastrous June presidential debate in Atlanta that proved the catalyst for Biden's withdrawal.</p>

<p>A new survey from Democratic polling form Public Policy Polling released Thursday found that Harris -- with the right running mate -- likely can defeat Trump and Vance in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the three "Blue Wall" states seen as critical to electing a Democratic president.</p>

<p>The vice president has the disadvantage of incumbency, though, meaning Trump can pin on her anything that was considered a weakness for Biden -- including the border crisis, on which Harris led the administration's early efforts.</p>

<p>Several Democratic rising stars have been floated as alternatives, including governors Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom.</p>

<p>Newsom, of California -- who has demonstrated a willingness to go toe-to-toe with top Republicans -- would be unlikely to be intimidated by Trump's broadsides.</p>

<p>Whitmer was considered for the Biden ticket in 2020 and has since spearheaded a Democratic resurgence in Michigan, while Pennsylvania's Shapiro is another serious contender as chief executive of a critical swing state.</p>

<p>Whoever becomes the nominee, Trump will likely spend the rest of the campaign pushing them on their past defenses of Biden, accusing them of covering up the president's decline.</p>

<p>"The destruction and chaos created by the Biden administration isn't just on Crooked Joe -- it's on the entire Democrat Party," the Trump team said in a recent edition of its daily circular.</p>

<p>"None have been worse than Kamala Harris, who has lied repeatedly -- presumably putting her own position above the security of the American people."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost confidence in him and his ability to beat Donald Trump, especially after his shockingly poor performance in a televised debate last month against the Republican candidate.</p>

<p>His failure to complete sentences was widely noticed and took away focus from the many false statements and other gaffe made by Mr Trump. Days later he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats' worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he'd "gave it my all."</p>

<p>Mr Biden's gaffes at a NATO summit - invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin's name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and calling Harris "Vice President Trump" -further stoked anxieties.</p>

<p>In his note announcing his decision, which he posted on social media, President Biden wrote,&nbsp; "It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term".</p>

<p>The move clears the path for Vice President Kamala Harris to run at the top of the ticket -- the first Black woman to do so in the country's history. It is not clear whether she would be challenged by other party leaders.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Miss USA contest has seen several controversies and scandals in recent years, with multiple allegations of preferential treatment given to certain contestants.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After several months of turmoil and controversy, Miss Michigan Alma Cooper was announced the winner of Miss USA on August 4, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/lifestyle/new-miss-usa-crowned-following-year-of-pageant-controversy/"><em>New York Post</em></a>. Ms Cooper, a US Army officer became the third person to hold the title this year after the resignation of 2023's pageant winner.</p>

<p>"As the daughter of a migrant worker, a proud Afro Latina woman and an officer of the United States Army, I am living the American dream," she told judges during a question and answer round at the finale.</p>

<p>She added, "If there's anything that my life and my mother have taught me, it's that your circumstances never define your destiny: You can make success accessible through demanding excellence."</p>

<p>With a master's degree in data science from Stanford University, the 22-year-old defeated 50 other competitors in a pageant that featured swimsuit and evening gown rounds. Connor Perry of Kentucky and Danika Christopherson of Oklahoma were ranked first and second runner-ups. Based on her social media accounts, Ms Cooper is a military intelligence officer who serves as a second lieutenant.</p>

<p>Ms Cooper was crowned live by Miss USA 2023, Hawaii's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/miss-usa-savannah-gankiewicz-receives-death-threats-amid-pageant-controversy-5755463">Savannah Gankiewicz</a>, who inherited the tiara in May following Utah's Noelia Voigt's contentious resignation.</p>

<p>"While this decision was not made lightly, I firmly believe that this opportunity was meant for me and I am ready to make a positive impact with this organization that I hold dear to my heart," the 28-year-old was quoted as saying by CNN in May. She was crowned by the governor of Hawaii Josh Green at a ceremony in Honolulu.</p>

<p>"I am dedicated to taking action and making a difference. With my background as a certified mental health first aid responder and training in anti-bullying suicide prevention. I understand, the importance of prioritising your well-being and advocating for those in need. I believe that the true change starts from within and I am determined to lead by example and empower the class of 2024 and beyond," Ms Gankiewicz further said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ms Voigt, who was crowned in September 2023, resigned on May 6 and shared the news in an Instagram post. "I realise this may come as a large shock to many. Never compromise your physical and mental well-being," she wrote in the caption. Ms Voigt was crowned the 72nd Miss USA winner in Nevada in 2023. She was the first Venezuelan-American woman to win Miss USA, as per her statement.</p>

<p>Notably, according to AFP, the Miss USA contest has seen several controversies and scandals in recent years, with multiple allegations of preferential treatment given to certain contestants.</p>

<p>Although the organisation eventually determined that the allegations were unsubstantiated, Crystle Stewart, a previous Miss USA winner, resigned as president. After serving as the vice president of the organisation, her husband Max Sebrechts departed under a flurry of accusations of sexual harassment from previous participants. Cheslie Kryst, who was crowned Miss USA in 2019, died by suicide in early 2022.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government has called for a United Nations-led probe into the turmoil that saw Sheikh Hasina resign as the Bangladesh prime minister and flee the country yesterday. Foreign Secretary David Lammy also said that the UK wants to see a "peaceful and democratic future" of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>There was, however, no mention of any asylum being provided to Ms Hasina.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The last two weeks in Bangladesh have seen unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life. All sides must work together to restore calm under a transitional government.<br />
<br />
My statement on the ongoing situation ⬇️<a href="https://t.co/g0n4dfwHE9">https://t.co/g0n4dfwHE9</a></p>
— David Lammy (@DavidLammy) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1820508707022598429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks. The UK wants to see action taken to ensure Bangladesh a peaceful and democratic future. The UK and Bangladesh have deep people-to-people links and shared Commonwealth values," the Foreign Secretary said in a statement.</p>

<p>The top UK official said the last two weeks in Bangladesh saw "unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life". A transitional period has been announced by the Chief of the Army Staff, he said.</p>

<p>"All sides now need to work together to end the violence, restore calm, deescalate the situation and prevent any further loss of life," said Lammy.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power in Bangladesh for the past 15 years, resigned as the prime minister yesterday as deadly protests led by students threatened to snowball further. Soon after, she fled to India as an uncertainty loomed over her political future.</p>

<p>She is expected to leave for London later, where she may seek political asylum, sources told NDTV. Her plane is being refuelled for her London journey, they added.</p>

<p>No such references, however, were made in the UK official's statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina's dramatic flight from Bangladesh in a helicopter on Monday under pressure from protesters and the army is far from a first in the South Asian nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since independence half a century ago, many of the country's leaders have been forced to flee or had their time in office cut short by violent deaths.</p>

<p>AFP looks back at five key points in Bangladesh's turbulent history.</p>

<p><strong>1975: assassinations and coups galore</strong></p>

<p>Formerly East Pakistan, Bangladesh emerged as a new nation in 1971 after a brutal war involving India.</p>

<p>Independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became the country's first prime minister, before introducing a one-party system and taking office as president in January 1975.</p>

<p>Within a year he was assassinated by a group of soldiers on August 15, along with his wife and three sons. Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, with the support of part of the army, then took power.</p>

<p>Ahmad's tenure was short-lived. He was overthrown in a coup instigated by the army's chief of staff Khaled Mosharraf on November 3, who was assassinated in turn by rival mutineers.</p>

<p>After a series of further coups and counter-coups, General Ziaur Rahman took power on November 7.</p>

<p><strong>1981-83 : Bloody rebellion, bloodless coup</strong></p>

<p>After less than six years in power, Rahman was assassinated during an attempted revolt on May 30, 1981.</p>

<p>His vice-president Abdus Sattar took over as interim president with the backing of General Hussain Muhammad Ershad.</p>

<p>But Ershad turned on Sattar within a year, ousting him in a bloodless coup on March 24, 1982.</p>

<p>Immediately after the takeover, he imposed martial law and installed Ahsanuddin Chowdhury as president.</p>

<p>Then, on December 11, 1983, Ershad proclaimed himself head of state. Chowdhury, whose position was honorary, went on to lead a political party loyal to the general.</p>

<p><strong>1990: Ershad resigns after protests</strong></p>

<p>After a wave of protests calling for democracy in Bangladesh, Ershad resigned as president on December 6, 1990.</p>

<p>He was then arrested on December 12 and jailed after being convicted for corruption.</p>

<p>Justice Minister Shahabuddin Ahmed took over as interim leader until elections could be held the year after.</p>

<p>Ershad would eventually be released in January 1997.</p>

<p><strong>1991: First free elections</strong></p>

<p>The country's first free elections were held in early 1991, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) running out as clear winners.</p>

<p>Khaleda Zia, General Ziaur Rahman's widow, became Bangladesh's first woman prime minister.</p>

<p>She was succeeded by her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina, daughter of the country's founding father Mujibur Rahman, after Hasina's Awami League beat the BNP at the ballot box in 1996.</p>

<p>The BNP returned to power in 2001, with Zia once again becoming prime minister and completing her term of office in October 2006.</p>

<p><strong>2007: Anti-corruption purge</strong></p>

<p>In 2007, with the army's support, President Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency after anti-government demonstrations.</p>

<p>A military-led transitional government then launched an anti-corruption purge, imprisoning both Hasina and Zia on graft allegations before their release in 2008.</p>

<p>After her party's win in the polls in December 2008, Hasina once again became prime minister.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen, a staunch critic of communalism, has found an irony in ousted Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina's escape in the face of deadly student-led protests.</p>

<p>Ms Nasreen said Hasina had thrown her out of Bangladesh to "please Islamists", and the "same Islamists" were part of the student movement that forced her to leave the country.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/p0r3m19_taslima-tweet_625x300_06_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"Hasina in order to please Islamists threw me out of my country in 1999 after I entered Bangladesh to see my mother in her deathbed and never allowed me to enter the country again. The same Islamists have been in the student movement who forced Hasina to leave the country today," said Ms Nasreen in an online post.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina fled to India in a military plane yesterday and is likely to fly to London to seek asylum in the UK.</p>

<p>The author blamed her for allowing "Islamists to grow" and letting those involved in corruption to thrive. She also spoke against Army rule in her country and batted for democracy.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/she-didnt-want-to-leave-we-insisted-sheikh-hasinas-son-to-ndtv-6271386">"She Didn't Want To Leave, We Insisted": Sheikh Hasina's Son To NDTV</a></p>

<p>"Hasina had to resign and leave the country. She was responsible for her situation. She made Islamists to grow. She allowed her people to involve in corruption. Now Bangladesh must not become like Pakistan. Army must not rule. Political parties should bring democracy &amp; secularism," she said in an earlier post.</p>

<p>Ms Nasreen had to leave Bangladesh in 1994 in the wake of death threats by fundamentalist outfits over her book "Lajja". The 1993 book was banned in Bangladesh, but became a bestseller elsewhere.</p>

<p>Khaleda Zia, the jailed arch-rival of Ms Hasina, was the prime minister at that time.</p>

<p>The author has been living in exile since.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-president-orders-release-of-jailed-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-6270786">Sheikh Hasina Flees, Bangladesh President Orders Ex PM Khaleda Zia's Release</a></p>

<p>Bangladesh saw one of its deadliest demonstrations on Sunday with nearly 100 protesters dying in clashes with cops. In the fallout, the protesters breached the Prime Minister's residence on Monday. Ms Hasina avoided a direct confrontation, having already resigned and left the country in a military plane.</p>

<p>The country's army chief called a press conference hours later and declared an interim government would be formed to run the country.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Ms Hasina landed at the Hindon Air Force base in India - about 30 km from capital Delhi. She is likely to leave for London where she may seek asylum, sources told NDTV. They said her plane was being refuelled for the flight to London.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden held crisis talks on Monday on a potential Iranian counterattack on Israel as his administration said it was working around the clock to avoid all-out war in the Middle East.<br />
Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken engaged in frantic diplomacy to try to ease tensions sparked by a suspected Israeli attack that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.</p>

<p>The president called King Abdullah II of Jordan, which helped down Iranian drones and missiles in an earlier showdown in April, while Blinken called top officials in Qatar and Egypt, the key intermediaries seeking a ceasefire in the 10-month Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message -- all parties must refrain from escalation," Blinken said after joining other top officials in a White House meeting.</p>

<p>"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza," said Blinken, who has also spoken since Sunday with G7 counterparts and Iraq's prime minister.</p>

<p>On Monday, multiple US personnel were injured in a rocket attack on a base in Iraq, adding to the already heightened regional tensions.</p>

<p>Biden had been hoping in his final months in office to end the Gaza war and work on clinching a landmark deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Instead, he has boosted the US military presence in the Middle East in a show of strength to Iran.</p>

<p>After staunchly backing Israel's war against Hamas, Biden has made clear his frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, who was involved in the ceasefire negotiations.</p>

<p>Blinken, who has warned that Iran could strike soon, made a new pitch for Biden's ceasefire plan that would freeze fighting in Gaza and return hostages seized in the October 7 mega-attack on Israel by Hamas.</p>

<p>A ceasefire "will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread," Blinken said as he met Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.</p>

<p>In a veiled allusion to US frustrations, Blinken said, "What it really comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no."</p>

<p>"It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Fears of spiraling conflict</strong></p>

<p>Biden met in the White House's heavily secured Situation Room with his national security team including Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>He flew to the White House after a weekend home in Delaware, and after a kiss for First Lady Jill Biden, he headed straight into the Oval Office without commenting to reporters.</p>

<p>The White House said that Biden and the Jordanian king in their call "discussed their efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal."</p>

<p>King Abdullah called for "an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the catastrophe in Gaza" and for "ceasing all escalatory measures," according to a readout by the Jordanian royal court.</p>

<p>Iran fired directly at Israel in April, taking their long shadow war into the open following a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Syria.</p>

<p>The United States helped intercept the drones and missiles, and damage was minimal.</p>

<p>But Jordan -- in a delicate position with its large Palestinian population and a peace deal with Israel -- has insisted it does not want to be a battleground.</p>

<p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that in April, "we were able to chart a path that ultimately got us through that time without tipping into a wider war."</p>

<p>"But every time you have one of these cycles of escalation, you have a risk of parties miscalculating, you have the risk of them taking actions that get out of hand," Miller told reporters.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden Administration has said an interim government in Bangladesh, which has descended into chaos after the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina amid violent anti-quota protests, should be formed according to democratic principles, rule of law and the will of the Bangladeshi people.</p>

<p>"We want to see the Bangladeshi people decide the future of the Bangladeshi government," State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>

<p>Bangladesh descended into chaos as Prime Minister Hasina surreptitiously resigned and fled the country in a military aircraft while the army stepped in to fill the power vacuum by announcing an interim government.</p>

<p>As the news of Hasina's departure spread, hundreds broke into her residence, vandalising and looting the interiors, providing dramatic expression to the anti-government protests that have killed more than 300 people in a fortnight.</p>

<p>The embattled Bangladeshi leader later landed at the Hindon airbase in Ghaziabad as part of her plan to go to London.</p>

<p>Miller told the press conference here the United States is monitoring the situation carefully and calls for an end to violence and fixing accountability for the deaths that have occurred over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>"All decisions regarding the interim government should be made with respect to democratic principles, rule of law and the will of the Bangladeshi people," he said.</p>

<p>"Now, as to what accountability looks like, that's something that should take place under Bangladeshi law. Obviously, anyone responsible for acts of violence, acts that break the law should be held accountable for them," he said.</p>

<p>In response to a question, Miller said he is not aware if the former prime minister Hasina has sought an asylum in the United States.</p>

<p>"With respect to the violence over the past few weeks and the deaths that have occurred, it is vital that we have full and transparent investigations to ensure accountability for these deaths. As relates to the interim government, we think that it's important that we focus on the Bangladeshi people's democratic aspirations and see a path to democratic governance," Miller said.</p>

<p>Noting that the US greatly values its relationship with the people of Bangladesh, he said, "We want to see that continued. I would just urge everyone with requests or questions about what the future may entail, we are not even 12 hours out from the reported resignation of the prime minister." Miller said the United States is monitoring the situation in Bangladesh carefully. "The United States stands with the people of Bangladesh. We urge all parties to refrain from further violence. Too many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead," he said.</p>

<p>"We welcome the announcement of an interim government and urge any transition be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh's laws. Finally, we are deeply saddened about the reports of human rights abuses, casualties and injuries over the weekend and past weeks. We share our deepest condolences with those who have lost loved ones and those who are suffering," Miller said.</p>

<p>Earlier, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said, "We are monitoring the situation in Bangladesh closely." "The United States has long called for respecting democratic rights in Bangladesh, and we urge that the interim government formation be democratic and inclusive," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The NSC spokesperson said the US "commend the Army for the restraint they have shown today. We encourage all parties to refrain from further violence and restore peace as quickly as possible".</p>

<p>"We express our deep concern and sadness about the reports of casualties and injuries over the weekend and past weeks, and we share our deepest condolences with those who lost loved ones and those who are suffering.</p>

<p>"It will be vital for the new government to carefully and credibly investigate all attacks, and provide accountability and justice for the victims," the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Iran has vowed to take "decisive" action against the "aggressor" behind the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, accusing Israel of carrying out a "cowardly" attack.</p>

<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Monday that the killing of Haniyeh, who was in Iran for the swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian, was a "flagrant violation" of international law, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Iran will take its serious and deterrent action with "strength and decisiveness" to punish the "aggressor" based on its inherent right and the international law principles, Kanaani said at a weekly press conference.</p>

<p>He added that Tehran would pursue the matter through the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which will hold an emergency meeting of Foreign Ministers on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has blamed Israel for the attack, vowing a "harsh and painful response".</p>

<p>IRGC Chief Hossein Salami said on Monday that Israel would "understand its miscalculation" after Tehran retaliates.</p>

<p>The assassination has significantly heightened tensions in the region.</p>

<p>While Iran has insisted it does not seek escalation, it has made clear it will not tolerate attacks on its territory or its citizens.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rocket attack on a base in Iraq wounded multiple US personnel on Monday, officials said, adding to already heightened regional tensions over an expected Iranian counterattack on Israel.</p>

<p>The rocket fire is the latest in a series of attacks targeting Ain al-Assad base in western Iraq, which hosts American troops as well as personnel from the US-led coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group.</p>

<p>"There was a suspected rocket attack today against US and coalition forces" at the base, a US defense spokesperson said. "Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured."</p>

<p>"Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment" and updates will be provided as more information becomes available, the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the attack, the White House said.</p>

<p>"They discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>An Iraqi military source had earlier said that multiple rockets were fired at the base, with some landing inside it and another hitting a nearby village but not causing damage.</p>

<p>A commander in a pro-Iran armed group told AFP that at least two rockets targeted the base, without saying who had carried out the attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another source in the group and a security source confirmed an attack occurred.</p>

<p>Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza but since then have largely halted.</p>

<p>The latest rocket fire comes as fears grow of an attack by Iran and its allies on Israel in retaliation for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah figures in strikes last week either blamed on or claimed by Israel.</p>

<p><br />
- Series of attacks -<br />
The killings, with both Iran and Hezbollah vowing retaliation, are among the most serious series of tit-for-tat attacks that have heightened fears of a regional conflagration stemming from the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The Iran-aligned "Axis of Resistance" against Israel, which also includes Iraqi groups and Yemen's Huthis, have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war.</p>

<p>Monday's rocket attack occurred after US forces carried out a strike last week on combatants who were attempting to launch drones that were deemed a threat to American and allied troops, a US official said.</p>

<p>The strike, which Iraqi sources said left four killed, was the first by American forces in Iraq since February.</p>

<p>There have been two recent attacks targeting bases hosting US and allied forces in Iraq -- on July 16 and 25.</p>

<p>Prior to that, US troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April. But attacks against them were much more common in the first few months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, when they were targeted more than 175 times.</p>

<p>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran groups, claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>In January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Baghdad has sought to defuse tensions, engaging in talks with Washington on the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq, with Iran-backed groups demanding a withdrawal.</p>

<p>The US military has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Police added early Monday that they found a woman in her 20s with a gunshot graze wound to her head at the scene, and a man in his 20s who appeared to have been shot in his finger, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>While police were investigating, another man in his 20s with two gunshot wounds to his lower back and ankle crashed a vehicle into the entrance of Swedish First Hill hospital, police said, adding that the crashed vehicle appeared to have been shot at multiple times.</p>

<p>Additionally, a third man in his 20s walked into a nearby Kaiser Permanente medical facility with a gunshot wound to his right leg, according to police.</p>

<p>Police said any suspect or suspects responsible for the gunfire fled the crime area. No arrests have been made.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes killed three people Monday in the country's south, with Hezbollah announcing the death of two of its fighters and a rescue group mourning a paramedic.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes killed three people Monday in the country's south, with Hezbollah announcing the death of two of its fighters and a rescue group mourning a paramedic.</p>

<p>Since last week, tensions have soared as Iran and Tehran-backed groups, including Hezbollah, vowed revenge for the killing of Hamas's political leader in Tehran and Israel's killing of the Lebanese group's military chief in Beirut.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israel in support of its ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The twin killings have raised fears of full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah, which last went to war in the summer of 2006.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said an "Israeli enemy strike that targeted a motorbike" in the southern village of Ebba killed one person, wounded another and caused a pregnant woman who was near the site to miscarry due to "shock".</p>

<p>Earlier, the health ministry said an "enemy raid" near the cemetery in the border village of Mais al-Jabal "killed two people".</p>

<p>Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one of the dead in Mais al-Jabal was a paramedic with the Risala Scouts association, which is affiliated with the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement.</p>

<p>Hezbollah in separate statements announced the death of two fighters, one from Mais al-Jabal.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the air force "operated in the area of Ebba... in order to strike and eliminate" a Hezbollah operative, who it said was from the group's elite Radwan unit.</p>

<p>It also said "soldiers identified a terrorist cell operating a drone" in the Mais al-Jabal area, and that air forces "struck and eliminated the terrorists".</p>

<p>The frontline village is less than two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel and has experienced heavy bombardment since the cross-border clashes began, forcing most residents to leave.</p>

<p>Ali Abbas, a Risala Scouts rescue worker, told AFP the paramedic had travelled by motorcycle with another person to inspect the site of an earlier raid when they were hit.</p>

<p>- Medical supplies arrive -<br />
Hezbollah claimed a series of attacks on Israeli military positions on Monday, one with explosive-laden drones that it said was in response to the "assassination" in Mais al-Jabal.</p>

<p>The group had said early Monday it targeted other military sites in northern Israel with "explosive-laden drones" in response to previous Israeli "attacks and assassinations" in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military had said "numerous suspicious aerial targets were identified crossing from Lebanon" into northern Israel overnight, starting a fire and leaving an officer and a soldier "moderately injured".</p>

<p>The NNA reported Israeli strikes on other areas of south Lebanon on Monday, while the health ministry said three civilians were taken to hospital after Israeli white phosphorus shelling.</p>

<p>Also Monday, Lebanon received 32 tonnes of emergency medical supplies from the World Health Organization for "treating war wounds" in efforts to increase readiness for "escalation in the Israeli aggression on Lebanon", a health ministry statement said.</p>

<p>Health Minister Firass Abiad said another supply shipment was due to arrive in the coming days, according to the statement.</p>

<p>Lebanon is ill-prepared for war, with public services including the health sector hit hard by a more than four-year-long economic crisis that has also pushed many medical professionals to emigrate.</p>

<p>Amid rising tensions, Israeli jets broke the sound barrier twice in the skies over Beirut around noon, according to the NNA, sparking worry in the Lebanese capital.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence since October has killed at least 550 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 25 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protesters have reportedly set on fire the house of former Bangladesh cricket captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza as violence and chaos continued in the country after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and left the nation on Monday.</p>

<p>Mashrafe Bin Mortaza is a Member of Parliament from Narail-2 constituency in Khulna division, having won the seat for the second consecutive time as an Awami League candidate during the general elections held in Bangladesh earlier this year.</p>

<p>Local media reported that protesters vandalised and set fire to the house of Mashrafe Bin Mortaza after Sheikh Hasina flew out of the country following massive student protests.</p>

<p>Mashrafe Bin Mortaza led Bangladesh in 117 matches across formats - the most for his country. He took 390 international wickets and scored 2,955 runs in 36 Tests, 220 ODIs, and 54 T20Is during his long cricketing career.</p>

<p>After quitting the game, he entered politics in 2018 by joining the Hasina-led Awami League and was elected as an MP from the Narail-2 constituency.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's leading daily 'Dhaka Tribune' reported that the protesters also set fire to the District Awami League office and vandalised its President Subash Chandra Bose's house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sheikh Hasina landed at the Hindon Air Base in Ghaziabad near Delhi on Monday evening, arriving in a military transport plane of Bangladesh Air Force as thousands of protesters rushed and vandalised Ganabhaban - the official residence of the Prime Minister in Dhaka.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Alphabet's Google broke the law to cement its dominance over online searches and related ads, a federal judge ruled on Monday in the U.S. Justice Department's first victory against a monopoly in more than 20 years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge on Monday handed Google a major legal blow, ruling in a closely-watched anti-trust case that it has a monopoly with its dominant search engine.</p>

<p>The landmark decision against a "big tech" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.</p>

<p>District Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google maintained a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the "default" option that people were likely to use on devices.</p>

<p>"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly," Mehta wrote in his ruling.</p>

<p>The internet behemoth "has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution," he added.</p>

<p>The anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors against Google ended in May with a two-day hearing.</p>

<p>The case was the first of five major lawsuits by the US government to reach trial, with Meta, Amazon, Apple and a separate case against Google also heading for federal courtrooms.</p>

<p>Held in Washington, the trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.</p>

<p>Mehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.</p>

<p>At the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.</p>

<p>Court testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.</p>

<p>Mehta concluded, however, that Google's violation of the Sherman Act did not have "anticompetitive effects."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-sheikh-hasina-who-once-saved-bangladesh-from-military-rule-6267638">Sheikh Hasina</a>, who resigned as Bangladesh's prime minister and fled the country on Monday following <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-bangladesh-student-protests-led-to-sheikh-hasinas-resignation-6268678">weeks of protests</a>, did not want to leave at all but did so on the family's insistence, his US-based son and former Chief Advisor Sajeeb Wajed Joy told NDTV.</p>

<p>"She wanted to stay, she did not want to leave the country at all. But we kept insisting that it wasn't safe for her. We were concerned for her physical safety first; so we persuaded her to leave," her son Joy told NDTV's Marya Shakil in a telephonic interview.</p>

<p>"I spoke to her this morning. The situation in Bangladesh, as you can see, is anarchy. She is in good spirits but she is very disappointed. It's very disheartening for her because it was her dream to turn Bangladesh into a developed country and she worked so hard for it over the last 15 years, keeping it safe from militants and as well as from terrorism and in spite of all of that this vocal minority, the opposition, the militants have now seized power," he said.</p>

<p>Her flight came less than seven months after she celebrated a fourth straight term in power - and fifth overall - by sweeping national elections in January.</p>

<p>The 76-year-old was flown in a military helicopter on Monday with her sister to take refuge in India. She is expected to leave for London later, sources told NDTV, where she may seek political asylum.</p>

<p>Her son, however, said he did not discuss with her where she is headed now.</p>

<p>Her last 15 years in power were marked by arrests of opposition leaders, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent, and she resigned in the face of deadly student-led protests that have killed hundreds.</p>

<p>Protests began in June after student groups' demands for the scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs escalated into a movement seeking the end of her rule.</p>

<p>"We hope that there will be elections in Bangladesh but at this time with our party leaders being targeted I don't see how free and fair elections would be possible. In a way, it is no longer the family's responsibility. We have shown what we can do. We have shown How much we can develop Bangladesh and if the people of Bangladesh aren't willing to stand up and they are willing to let this violent minority seize power then people get the leadership they deserve," said his son.</p>

<p>Pressed to answer if his mother did the best for the country, he said, "Absolutely. Awami League still remains the most popular party in the country. BNP has the chance to come back to power and we have seen what they were like the last time. They ran the country to the ground. The militants had a free hand; they attacked the minorities with impunity."</p>

<p>Bangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered the release of jailed former prime minister and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-president-orders-release-of-jailed-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-6270786">key opposition leader Khaleda Zia</a>, hours after her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina was ousted and the military took power.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a broadcast to the nation on state television that Hasina had resigned and the military would form a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence," said Waker, shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's official residence.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's Channel 24 broadcast images of crowds running into the prime minister's compound, grinning and waving to the camera, looting furniture and books, or relaxing on beds.</p>

<p>The military said it would lift a curfew imposed to quash protests at dawn Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I doubt army will be able to normalise things that fast. Because right now what is happening is that the opposition and the militants, they are not only vandalising, they are also hunting out our leaders, former ministers and even what I am hearing minorties. I don't think the violence has ended," said Mr Joy. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Virginia man was charged with making violent online threats against Vice President Kamala Harris days after she began her US presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Frank Carillo was charged on Friday in federal court in Virginian with threatening the vice president after posting a series of messages targeting Kamala Harris on the social media site GETTR, according to court records.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris is the Democratic candidate facing Republican former President Donald Trump in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive I will do it personally if no one else does," read one post cited in court documents. Another said Kamala Harris is "going to regret ever trying to become president."</p>

<p>The messages were posted on July 27, six days after President Joe Biden announced he would not run for reelection and endorsed Kamala Harris to take his place as the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>The account also posted messages targeting Biden and FBI Director Christopher Wray.</p>

<p>FBI agents seized a rifle and a handgun during a search of Frank Carillo's home, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Frank Carillo was expected to make his first court appearance on Monday. Attorney information for Frank Carillo was not immediately available.</p>

<p>US Justice Department officials have been concerned by what they have called a spike in threats to public officials in the United States.</p>

<p>Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally last month. Officials have not identified a motive for the shooting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has narrowed her search for a vice presidential running mate to two finalists, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, the US vice president, is expected to announce her selection by Tuesday, ahead of her first scheduled public appearance with her running mate that evening at Temple University in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was unclear if a final decision has been made, the sources said. The rally will kick off a five-day, seven-city tour of battleground states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>The choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Kamala Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and US Senator JD Vance, his vice presidential pick, in the Nov. 5 election. Vance will also make a campaign stop in South Philadelphia on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Josh Shapiro, 51, is a rising star of the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes makes it a must-win state for both Kamala Harris and Trump.</p>

<p>A former state attorney general, Josh Shapiro would add to the ticket's historical significance; he would be the country's first Jewish vice president, while Kamala Harris is seeking to become the first Black and South Asian American woman elected US president.</p>

<p>Josh Shapiro's strong support for Israel could alienate some progressive voters, though it could also appeal to moderate voters and defang Republican efforts to turn the Israel-Gaza war into a wedge issue for Democrats.</p>

<p>Tim Walz, 60, is a former US Army National Guard member and a former teacher who has raised his profile in recent weeks as an effective advocate for Kamala Harris. He has attacked Trump and Vance as "weird," a viral insult the Kamala Harris campaign has embraced.</p>

<p>A former member of Congress from a Republican-leaning district, Tim Walz has proven appeal to rural, white voters, though he has also championed progressive policies as governor, such as free school meals and expanded paid worker leave. While Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, it is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds.</p>

<p>Speculation had focused on six finalists - four governors, a senator and a cabinet secretary in the Biden administration, all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.</p>

<p>In addition to Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz, contenders included US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.</p>

<p>The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, sources told Reuters. The Kamala Harris campaign plans a social media announcement featuring the duo, campaign officials familiar with the arrangements said.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' search for a running mate began in earnest two weeks ago, shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him.</p>

<p>There was no immediate indication that Monday's market selloff would have an impact on Kamala Harris' announcement timing. Trump, seeking to capitalize on the downturn, referred to the "Kamala crash" in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Kamala Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris is weighing the decision with her husband, Doug Emhoff, brother-in-law Tony West and a small circle of aides and advisers, the sources said.</p>

<p><strong>SEVEN CITIES, FIVE DAYS</strong></p>

<p>On her battleground states tour, Kamala Harris and her running mate will hit seven cities in five days: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada, said a campaign official, who did not wish to be named.</p>

<p>They will hold rallies in each location along the tour, which will include college campuses, historically Black universities, union halls and restaurants, the official said.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the Kamala Harris campaign launched a program to persuade Republican voters to support the Democrat and showcased endorsements from Republicans including former Trump White House officials Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye.</p>

<p>The program - called Republicans for Kamala Harris - will hold kickoff events in the battleground states of Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>

<p>On Monday, Kamala Harris notched another union endorsement with the hospitality workers union praising her as having a longstanding record of delivering for union workers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.</p>

<p>"We received 80 bodies inside 15 bags, with more than four martyrs in each bag, each wrapped in a single shroud", Civil Defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman told AFP.</p>

<p>Abu Suleiman said Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from.</p>

<p>"We do not know if they are martyrs (killed in Gaza) or prisoners from (Israel's) jails", he added.</p>

<p>AFP journalists on the scene saw men in hazmat suits inspecting the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheeting, before unloading them from the shipping container they had arrived in.</p>

<p>The bodies were then laid in a line for burial in a mass grave dug in the sand, with scores of Palestinians watching from the side.</p>

<p>The bodies were later buried at the Turkish cemetery, near Khan Yunis, the main city in the southern part of Gaza, AFP journalists said.</p>

<p><strong>A mother's search</strong></p>

<p>"You will ask me the reason why I put all the bodies in a mass grave?" said Tabesh Abu Ata from the Turkish cemetery.</p>

<p>"Because I have no capabilities to bury each one in an individual grave, (there are no) stones or tiles" for that, he said.</p>

<p>Salwa Karaz, a displaced woman from Gaza City in the north, told AFP that she had gone to the cemetery hoping to find her 32-year-old son Marwan, who went missing in January. He left behind an eight-month-old son.</p>

<p>"When we learned that 80 bodies had been handed over, we came to search in hopes of finding him among them", the 59-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"As of now, we have not learned anything," she lamented.</p>

<p>"We will try to identify him through his clothes. He was wearing brown pants, a navy blue shirt, a black jacket, and beige boots."</p>

<p>She last saw him leaving on his bicycle from their shelter in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.</p>

<p>In a statement released Monday, Hamas said Israel's delivery of bodies without identities "exacerbates the suffering of the families of martyrs and the missing, who seek to know the fate of their abducted children or to bury their martyrs in a dignified manner".</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment.</p>

<p>In December, Hamas government sources said Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them.</p>

<p>The bodies were then buried in Gaza, the sources added.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Debby landed in Florida Monday bringing high winds, pouring rain -- and 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than $1 million.</p>

<p>Debby, which hit the state's northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, washed the trove of drugs ashore along Florida's southernmost tip.</p>

<p>"Hurricane Debby blew 25 packages of cocaine (70 lbs.) onto a beach in the Florida Keys," US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II wrote on X.</p>

<p>The load of drugs, which Mr Briggs reported was valued at more than $1 million, was discovered by a good Samaritan who contacted the authorities.</p>

<p>In July of 2023, the mayor of Tampa, Florida similarly discovered 70 pounds (31.7 kilograms) of cocaine that had been washed ashore in the Florida Keys, while enjoying a vacation day.</p>

<p>In addition to bringing cocaine, Debby has killed one person, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, and could produce life-threatening storm surges as well as catastrophic flooding.</p>

<p>The Keys, a string of islands stretching off the state's southern tip, are located in close proximity to a number of Caribbean countries that serve as a transit hub for cocaine being trafficked from South America to Europe and North America, including into Florida.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations said Monday that nine employees of its agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) "may have been involved" in the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, which sparked war in Gaza, and have been fired.</p>

<p>"We have sufficient information in order to take the actions that we're taking -- which is to say, the termination of these nine individuals," UN spokesman Farhan Haq said.</p>

<p>Farhan&nbsp;Haq said the organization will need to evaluate any further steps to "fully corroborate."</p>

<p>Farhan&nbsp;Haq was speaking after the UN's oversight body completed its investigation into the allegations earlier this year by Israel that a total of 19 UNRWA employees may have been involved in the attack.</p>

<p>That prompted many governments, including top donor the United States, to abruptly suspend funding to the agency, threatening its efforts to deliver aid in Gaza. Several countries have since resumed payments.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,550 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give breakdowns of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>UNRWA, which has provided essential aid for Palestinian refugees since 1949, has long been criticized by Israel.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, UNRWA's chief Philippe Lazzarini called for Israel to "stop its campaign" against the organization, citing "outrageous" attacks on its employees, facilities and operations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Monday ordered the release of jailed former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, hours after her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina was ousted and the military took power.</p>

<p>The president's press team said in a statement that a meeting led by Shahabuddin had "decided unanimously to free Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia immediately".</p>

<p>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, along with the head of the navy and airforce, and top leaders of several opposition parties including the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami party, attended the meeting.</p>

<p>"The meeting has also decided to free all the people who have been arrested during the student protests," the statement added.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday, Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a broadcast to the nation on state television that Sheikh Hasina had resigned and the military would form a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"The meeting decided to form an interim government immediately", it added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina had sought to quell nationwide protests against her government since early July but she fled the country after brutal unrest on Sunday in which nearly 100 people were killed.</p>

<p>Khaleda Zia, 78, is in poor health and confined to hospital after she was sentenced to 17 years in prison for graft in 2018.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

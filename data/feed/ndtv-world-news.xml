       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two pistols that Napoleon Bonaparte once intended to use to kill himself were sold in France on Sunday for 1.69 million euros ($1.8 million), the auction house said, with the government insisting that they stay in the country as national treasures.</p>

<p>The identity of the buyer at the auction in Fontainebleau south of Paris of the finely adorned objects was not made public but the final sale price, with fees, was above the estimates of 1.2-1.5 million euros.</p>

<p>Ahead of the sale of the weapons, the national treasures commission of the French culture ministry had classified the objects as national treasures and placed a ban on their export, in a decision published in the government's official journal on Saturday.</p>

<p>The issuing of the export ban certificate opens a 30-month period during which the French government can make a purchase offer to the unidentified new owner, who has the right to refuse.</p>

<p>Whatever its value and age, a cultural property qualified as a national treasure can leave France only temporarily, with a mandatory return.</p>

<p>"Being classified as a national treasure gives an incredible value to the object," said a representative of the Osenat auction house, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>The richly decorated guns inlaid with gold and silver feature the engraved image of Napoleon in full imperial pomp.</p>

<p>They are said to have almost been used to end the French ruler's life in 1814, when he was forced to give up power after foreign forces defeated his army and occupied Paris.</p>

<p>"After the defeat of the French campaign, he was totally depressed and wanted to commit suicide with these weapons but his grand squire removed the powder," auction house expert Jean-Pierre Osenat told AFP ahead of the sale.</p>

<p>Napoleon instead took poison but vomited and survived, and later gave the pistols to his squire to thank him for his loyalty, Osenat added.</p>

<p>Memorabilia of the emperor is extremely sought after among collectors.</p>

<p>One of his famous "bicorne" black cocked hats with its blue, white and red trimmings sold for 1.9 million euros in November.</p>

<p>Upon his abdication, Napoleon went into exile on the island of Elba off the coast of Italy.</p>

<p>He would soon make a dramatic return to France, only to have his career definitively ended when he was defeated by the British at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, dying in exile on the island of St Helena six years later.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday embarked on a two-day visit to Russia, for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit. During the trip, PM Modi and his Russian counterpart are likely to discuss and assess multifaceted relations between the two nations and also exchange views on issues of regional and global concern.</p>

<p>Among the slew of programmes, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to host a dinner for PM Modi while the latter is slated to address the Indian community during the two-day visit.</p>

<p>PM Modi-Vladimir Putin meeting will see the world media including the Chinese, zeroing in on the high-profile meeting that is bound to have a wide geo-political impact in the region.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an old photo of PM Modi and President Putin has surfaced on social media. The viral photo is from the meeting that happened when Narendra Modi was Gujarat CM and accompanied the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Moscow for the India-Russia Summit in 2021.</p>

<p>Modi Archive, the popular X account sharing the photograph of the two leaders, said that the longstanding relationship between India and Russia has deep historical roots, which got strengthened over a period of time and also mentioned a specific incident on how the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi's initiative led to solidification of ties.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The longstanding relationship between India and Russia has deep historical roots, significantly strengthened by Prime Minister <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@narendramodi</a> during his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat.<br />
<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"During this (2001) visit, CM Modi signed a protocol pact for cooperation between his state Gujarat and the Russian province Astrakhan in which both states agreed to work together in the fields of petro and hydrocarbon sectors, trade, science and technology, education, tourism and culture. In the following years, these ties were strengthened through several visits," the Modi Archive said.</p>

<p>It further informs that the Gujarat CM visited Russia's Astrakhan in 2006 again and met with Governor Alexander Zhilkin, and the protocol pact for cooperation was extended for another five years.</p>

<p>In 2009, he was invited to address the 4th International Energy Week and deliver a keynote at the 9th Russian Oil and Gas Week conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The then CM Modi stumped the Russian businessmen by giving the presentation in Russian language.</p>

<p>In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled his vivid memories of his 2001 visit to Russia and remarked that it was his first meeting with President Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had stated that despite coming from a small state and relatively new to the international stage, President Putin treated him with great respect, which opened the doors to a lasting friendship.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Politics around the world is evolving in ways that both leaders and analysts are finding difficult to assess and respond to. Politicians are scrambling to sustain support as new entrants make inroads into constituencies that have lost faith in the established order. It is in this melee of the old and the new that the grammar of today's politics is charting a course of its own. Globally, the political elites have never seemed so out of touch as they seem today, unable to respond to the challenge from their streets.</p>

<p>In just the last few days, US President Joe Biden's credibility saw a free fall, while the UK booted out an accidental, out-of-touch Prime Minister, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-lost-big-youtuber-niko-omilana-mocks-him-with-a-giant-l-sign-behind-him-6042279">Rishi Sunak</a>, and ushered in the Labour Raj at a time when the rest of Europe is moving to the right. The French have given a mandate to the Far Right. Nine months after the terror attacks of October 7, Israel is facing a civil war-like situation, with people demanding Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/leaving-with-heavy-heart-israel-war-cabinet-minister-benny-gantz-quits-over-gaza-plan-5855047">Benjamin Netanyahu's</a> resignation even as the nation remains in a state of war on multiple fronts. In Iran, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/masoud-pezeshkian-iran-has-a-new-reformist-president-what-it-would-mean-for-india-6045285">Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian</a> found himself elected as the nation's new president, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili by securing around 53.3% of votes, nine percentage points more than Jalili.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/ex-uk-pm-rishi-sunak-for-whom-everything-that-could-go-wrong-went-wrong-6040945">Also Read |&nbsp;Rishi Sunak: For Whom Everything That Could Go Wrong, Went Wrong</a></strong></p>

<h2><strong>A Reformist In Iran, 'Changemaker' In UK</strong></h2>

<p>Different nations, different challenges, different political arcs, but all facing a moment of political reckoning. Ironically, it is Iran where the recent change of leadership holds the most promise. This is not the first time a reformist has come to power in Iran in a system that has been dominated by the "supreme leader" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since 1989. The conservatives have controlled all the levers of power and have managed to scuttle earlier reformists like Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani. However, there has been a growing disillusionment with the ruling elites. By criticising Iran's morality police and promising "unity and cohesion" &nbsp;as well as an end to Iran's "isolation" from the world, Pezeshkian talked in a language that appealed to those who want normalcy in a nation that has been on the edge of a precipice for years now.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak, on the other hand, was not only bogged down by the legacy of his predecessors who had made a mockery of public mandates, but he was also unable to soothe the British public struggling with rising costs of living and a crumbling public services infrastructure. The Conservative Party imploded, and Sunak's leadership never managed to rise to match the needs of today's Britain. And so, the Labour Party ended up getting a landslide even without increasing its vote share, thereby taking the United Kingdom in a direction opposite to the rest of Europe, where the Right is ascending.</p>

<h2><strong>Close Shave For Macron</strong></h2>

<p>In France, President Emmanuel Macron had to call a snap election fearing the resurgence of the nation's far-right party, the National Rally (RN). Only a last-minute, left-wing tactical adjustment could prevent an outright landslide for the RN. But this should be seen as just a consolation prize, as the RN has greatly increased its representation in Parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/france-legislative-elections-disaster-averted-emmanuel-macron-still-faces-big-challenge-ahead-6056303">Also Read |&nbsp;Disaster Averted, But Macron Still Faces Big Challenge Ahead</a></strong></p>

<p>Separately, last month, the European Union elections saw a resurgence of the right in ways few had anticipated, and the triumph of Eurosceptic parties will have serious long-term consequences for the ability of the 27-member bloc to work cohesively.</p>

<h2><strong>Concerns About Biden</strong></h2>

<p>The world's eyes, however, are now on the leadership contest in the US, where two old white men are busy damaging the brand of American democracy. Donald Trump, under whose presidency the foundations of the American democratic institutional fabric came close to collapsing, continues to be ahead in the presidential race, as the base of the Republican Party continues to move to the right. Trump's supporters still view him as an anti-establishment candidate and despite facing a number of charges in the courts, he is hailed as a victim. His greatest advantage is that he has his primary opponent in President Joe Biden, who, after a disastrous debate performance, is having a difficult time convincing his own party about his candidacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old templates no longer apply to the new political climate, where fast-evolving aspirations demand a change in the status quo. Back home in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third consecutive victory and Indian democracy's continuing resilience underscores the Indian electorate's ability to make nuanced choices even as the world around it undergoes a dramatic shift. Even so, this global churn has a lesson for Indian political leaders and the larger system.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched dozens of missiles at cities across Ukraine on Monday in an attack that killed at least 20 people and smashed into a children's hospital in Kyiv, officials said.</p>

<p>The rare day-time Russian barrage came as President Volodymyr Zelensky was due in Warsaw, the Polish government said, before he flies to the NATO summit in Washington.</p>

<p>Explosions rang out and black smoke could be seen rising from the centre of Kyiv, AFP journalists reported.</p>

<p>Pictures distributed by officials from the children's medical facility in Kyiv showed people digging through mounds of rubble, black smoke billowing over a destroyed building and medical staff wearing blood-stained scrubs.</p>

<p>"Russian terrorists once again massively attacked Ukraine with missiles. Different cities: Kyiv, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rig, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk," Zelensky said, listing major civilians hubs in the south and east of the country.</p>

<p>"More than 40 missiles of various types. Residential buildings, infrastructure and a children's hospital were damaged," he wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Zelensky said that there were an unknown number of people trapped under the rubble of the Okhmatdyt children's hospital and it was not immediately clear how many had been killed.</p>

<p>Municipal officials said earlier that at least seven people had been killed in the barrage that hit Kyiv.</p>

<p>Russian forces have repeatedly targeted the capital with massive barrages since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the last major attack on Kyiv with drones and missiles was last month.</p>

<p><strong>Must respond 'with force'</strong></p>

<p>In Zelensky's hometown Kryvyi Rig, which has been repeatedly targed by Russian bombardments, the strikes killed at least 10 and wounded over 30, the mayor said.</p>

<p>"In Dnipro, a high-rise building and an enterprise were damaged. A service station was damaged. There are wounded," the Dnipropetrovsk governor Sergiy Lysak added.</p>

<p>In the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have taken a string of villages in recent weeks, the regional governor said three people were killed in Pokrovsk -- a town that had a pre-war population of around 60,000 people.</p>

<p>There was no immedate comment on the strikes from the Kremlin but it insists its forces do not target civilian infrastructure.</p>

<p>"This shelling targeted civilians, hit infrastructure, and the whole world should see today the consequences of terror, which can only be responded to by force," the head of the presidential administration in Kyiv, Andriy Yermak, wrote on social media, following the attack.</p>

<p>Zelensky and other officials in Kyiv have been urging Ukraine's allies to send more air defence systems, including Patriots, to the war-battered country to help fend off fatal Russian aerial bombardments.</p>

<p>"Russia cannot claim ignorance of where its missiles are flying and must be held fully accountable for all its crimes," Zelensky said in another post on social media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">Only about 600 people have ever traveled to space. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.06.004">The vast majority of astronauts</a> over the past six decades have been middle-aged men on short-duration missions of fewer than 20 days.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Today, with private, commercial and multinational spaceflight providers and flyers entering the market, we are witnessing a new era of human spaceflight. Missions have ranged from minutes, hours and days to months.</p>

<p>As humanity looks ahead to <a href="https://theconversation.com/returning-to-the-moon-can-benefit-commercial-military-and-political-sectors-a-space-policy-expert-explains-209300">returning to the Moon</a> over the coming decade, space exploration missions will be much longer, with many more space travelers and even space tourists. This also means that a wider diversity of people will experience the extreme environment of space – more women and people of different ethnicities, ages and health status.</p>

<p>Since people respond differently to the unique stressors and exposures of space, researchers in space health, like me, seek to better understand the human health effects of spaceflight. With such information, we can figure out how to help astronauts stay healthy both while they're in space and once they return to Earth.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau8650">historic NASA Twins Study</a>, in 2019, my colleagues and I published groundbreaking research on how one year on board the International Space Station affects the human body.</p>

<p>I am a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nvFtqMoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">radiation cancer biologist</a> in Colorado State University's Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences. I've spent the past few years continuing to build on that earlier research in a series of papers recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-024-00009-8/index.html">published across the portfolio of Nature journals</a>.</p>

<p>These papers are part of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-024-00009-8/index.html">Space Omics and Medical Atlas package of manuscripts</a>, data, protocols and repositories that represent the largest collection ever assembled for aerospace medicine and space biology. Over 100 institutions from 25 countries contributed to the coordinated release of a wide range of spaceflight data.</p>

<h2><strong>The NASA Twins Study</strong></h2>

<p>NASA's <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau8650">Twins Study</a> seized on a unique research opportunity.</p>

<p>NASA selected astronaut Scott Kelly for the agency's first one-year mission, during which he spent a year on board the International Space Station from 2015 into 2016. Over the same time period, his identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and current U.S. senator representing Arizona, remained on Earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/does-a-year-in-space-make-you-older-or-younger-111812">My team and I examined blood samples</a> collected from the twin in space and his genetically matched twin back on Earth before, during and after spaceflight. We found that Scott's telomeres – <a href="https://theconversation.com/cells-become-zombies-when-the-ends-of-their-chromosomes-are-damaged-a-tactic-both-helpful-and-harmful-for-health-186445">the protective caps</a> at the ends of chromosomes, much like the plastic tip that keeps a shoelace from fraying – lengthened, quite unexpectedly, during his year in space.</p>

<p>When Scott returned to Earth, however, his telomeres quickly shortened. Over the following months, his telomeres recovered but were still shorter after his journey than they had been before he went to space.</p>

<p>As you get older, your telomeres shorten because of a variety of factors, including stress. The length of your telomeres can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-022-00842-x">serve as a biological indicator</a> of your risk for developing age-related conditions such as dementia, cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108435">In a separate study</a>, my team studied a cohort of 10 astronauts on six-month missions on board the International Space Station. We also had a control group of age- and sex-matched participants who stayed on the ground.</p>

<p>We measured telomere length before, during and after spaceflight and again found that telomeres were longer during spaceflight and then shortened upon return to Earth. Overall, the astronauts had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they had before.</p>

<p>One of the other Twins Study investigators, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vId_OTEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Christopher Mason</a>, and I <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108457">conducted another telomere study</a> – this time with twin high-altitude mountain climbers – a somewhat similar extreme environment on Earth.</p>

<p>We found that while climbing Mount Everest, the climbers' telomeres were longer, and after they descended, their telomeres shortened. Their twins who remained at low altitude didn't experience the same changes in telomere length. These results indicate that it's not the space station's microgravity that led to the telomere length changes we observed in the astronauts – other culprits, such as increased radiation exposure, are more likely.</p>

<h2><strong>Civilians in space</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbae007">In our latest study</a>, we studied telomeres from the crew on board SpaceX's 2021 Inspiration4 mission. This mission had the first all-civilian crew, whose ages spanned four decades. All of the crew members' telomeres lengthened during the mission, and three of the four astronauts also exhibited telomere shortening once they were back on Earth.</p>

<p>What's particularly interesting about these findings is that the Inspiration4 mission lasted only three days. So, not only do scientists now have consistent and reproducible data on telomeres' response to spaceflight, but we also know it happens quickly. These results suggest that even short trips, like a weekend getaway to space, will be associated with changes in telomere length.</p>

<p>Scientists still don't totally understand the health impacts of such changes in telomere length. We'll need more research to figure out how both long and short telomeres might affect an astronaut's long-term health.</p>

<h2><strong>Telomeric RNA</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06014-x">In another paper</a>, we showed that the Inspiration4 crew – as well as Scott Kelly and the high-altitude mountain climbers – exhibited increased levels of telomeric RNA, termed TERRA.</p>

<p>Telomeres consist of lots of repetitive DNA sequences. These are transcribed into TERRA, which contributes to telomere structure and helps them do their job.</p>

<p>Together with laboratory studies, these findings tell us that telomeres are being damaged during spaceflight. While there is still a lot we don't know, we do know that telomeres are especially sensitive to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/oxidative-stress">oxidative stress</a>. So, the chronic oxidative damage that astronauts experience when exposed to space radiation around the clock likely contributes to the telomeric responses we observe.</p>

<p>We also wrote a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10522-024-10098-7">review article with a more futuristic perspective</a> of how better understanding telomeres and aging might begin to inform the ability of humans to not only survive long-duration space travel but also to thrive and even colonize other planets. Doing so would require humans to reproduce in space and future generations to grow up in space. We don't know if that's even possible – yet.</p>

<h2><strong>Plant telomeres in space</strong></h2>

<p>My colleagues and I contributed other work to the Space Omics and Medical Atlas package, as well, including <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41510-4">a paper published in Nature Communications</a>. The study team, led by Texas A&amp;M biologist <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nHjDBNIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dorothy Shippen</a> and Ohio University biologist <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yXhk2d4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Sarah Wyatt</a>, found that, unlike people, plants flown in space did not have longer telomeres during their time on board the International Space Station.</p>

<p>The plants did, however, ramp up their <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/telomerase">production of telomerase</a>, the enzyme that helps maintain telomere length.</p>

<p>As anyone who's seen “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/">The Martian</a>” knows, plants will play an essential role in long-term human survival in space. This finding suggests that plants are perhaps more naturally suited to withstand the stressors of space than humans.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[The incident, considered the biggest old heist in Canada's history, occurred at the Pearson International Airport in Toronto last April.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 6,500 gold bars stolen last year from an airport in Canada are most likely overseas, police have said. The gold, in the form of serialised bars, worth over 20 million Canadian dollars, was stolen from Pearson International Airport in Toronto last April.<br />
<br />
It is considered the biggest gold heist in the country's history. The Peel Regional Police believes the gold was quickly smuggled to the Middle East or South Asia region.<br />
<br />
"We believe a large portion has gone overseas to markets that are flush with gold," lead investigator Det. Sgt. Mike Mavity told members of the Peel Police Service Board in a meeting on June 21, according to CBC News.<br />
<br />
Detective Mavity added, "That would be Dubai, or India, where you can take gold with serial numbers on it, and they will still honour it and melt it down…. And we believe that happened very shortly after the incident."<br />
<br />
The official further acknowledged that the gold bars were worth millions more at the time of the heist than what they had repeatedly stated.<br />
<br />
"Whether it's CA$20 million or CA$34 million might be a mitigating factor come sentencing, but it doesn't in my opinion change a lot," said the detective.<br />
<br />
Talking about claims that all of this gold was melted down in the basement of a Mississauga-based jewellery store, another official added, "We believe a small quantity was melted at that jewellery shop."<br />
<br />
Detective Mavity added, "At no point were we ever alleging that 400 kilograms of gold were melted down in a small jewellery shop by hand. That wasn't the message that we were trying to relay."<br />
<br />
Further, officials have said that nine people have been arrested in connection with the case. Among the suspects include a jewellery store owner, a former Air Canada manager as well as a warehouse employee.<br />
<br />
According to Fox News, the suspects are believed to have used a completed bill for a seafood pick-up to forge the paperwork that was further provided to a warehouse attendant. Only CA dollar 90,000 have been recovered from the heist, it added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing said Monday it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, which court papers show would see the aviation giant plead guilty to fraud.</p>

<p>The agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.</p>

<p>"We have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to the memorialization and approval of specific terms," Boeing told AFP in a statement.</p>

<p>Court papers filed in Texas on Sunday said the company had agreed to plead guilty to "conspiracy to defraud the United States" during the certification of MAX airplanes.</p>

<p>Boeing will be fined under the deal and must invest a minimum of $455 million in "compliance and safety programs", while compensation for families will be determined by the court.</p>

<p>Boeing's latest legal predicament was triggered by a DoJ determination in mid-May that the company ignored a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not meeting requirements to improve its compliance and ethics program after the MAX crashes.</p>

<p>Families of MAX victims were "highly disappointed" by the deal reached between Boeing and the DoJ, an attorney at Clifford Law representing them said.</p>

<p>"Much more evidence has been presented over the last five years that demonstrates that the culture of Boeing putting profits over safety hasn't changed. This plea agreement only furthers that skewed corporate objective," senior partner Robert A. Clifford said in a statement.</p>

<p>The families will ask the court to reject the plea deal at an upcoming hearing, according to an opposition filed by their legal team.</p>

<p>The original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification of the MAX.</p>

<p>The agreement required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year. But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.</p>

<p>In a May 14 letter to the US court, DoJ officials said that Boeing breached its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) used the 'Hannibal directive' during the Hamas attack on October 7, Haaretz, a leading daily, has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-07/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-ordered-hannibal-directive-on-october-7-to-prevent-hamas-taking-soldiers-captive/00000190-89a2-d776-a3b1-fdbe45520000">reported</a>. This directive allows soldiers to use force to prevent kidnappings, even if it puts the lives of hostages at risk,&nbsp;it said.</p>

<h3><strong>What is the Hannibal directive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Hannibal Directive is a controversial Israeli military policy that orders the use of maximum force to prevent the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers, even if it means risking their lives. The policy allows soldiers to open fire without constraints, targeting not only the abductors but also potential escape routes, including junctions, roads and highways, a former Israeli army soldier told Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>The directive was last invoked in 2014 during the Gaza war, resulting in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians and accusations of war crimes. Although the Israeli army denied using the doctrine, it was reportedly revoked in 2016 and used again now.</p>

<p>According to the Haaretz report, the protocol was used by the IDF after the&nbsp;October 7 attack at three army facilities, potentially endangering civilians. A message sent to Israel's Gaza division at 11:22 am ordered that "not a single vehicle can return to Gaza," implying that vehicles could be carrying kidnapped civilians or soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Everyone knew by then that such vehicles could be carrying kidnapped civilians or soldiers ... Everyone knew what it meant to not let any vehicles return to Gaza," a source told the Israeli newspaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the extent of harm to civilians and soldiers is unknown, soldiers' testimonies and IDF officers suggest it was used widely. The report stated that the Hannibal directive "did not prevent the kidnapping of seven of them [soldiers] or the killing of 15 other spotters, as well as 38 other soldiers".</p>

<p>On October 7, Hamas captured dozens of Israelis, including both soldiers and civilians. Many of these captives remain in the group's custody, while others were killed in subsequent Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. According to Israeli authorities, 1,139 people have died in the attacks, with 250 taken captive.</p>

<p>Israel's onslaught in Gaza has killed 38,000 people and displaced 1.9 million -- about 90% of the city's population -- since the beginning of the war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian authorities have accused a Sydney father of trying to stop rescuers from saving his own family in a "horrifying" home fire that killed two boys and a baby girl.</p>

<p>Flames engulfed the home in western Sydney's Lalor Park in the early hours of Sunday morning while the 28-year-old man, his female partner and seven children were inside, New South Wales state police said.</p>

<p>Three children -- two boys aged three and six, and a 10-month-old girl -- were killed.</p>

<p>The four other children aged between four and 11 and their mother, 29, were being treated at hospital for fire-related injuries but were all expected to recover, police said.</p>

<p>"This is a horrifying and senseless act that has quite rightly outraged the entire state," New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said Monday.</p>

<p>"These children deserved a loving home with safety and security, and instead they are gone."</p>

<p>Police said the three deaths were being investigated as a domestic-related multiple homicide.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has described domestic violence in Australia as a "national crisis" following a spike in the number of violent deaths of women this year and a series of high-profile attacks.</p>

<p>State police said the 28-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly "frustrated" police efforts to enter the burning building.</p>

<p>He was in an induced coma while being treated in hospital, under police guard, they said.</p>

<p>"It does appear that the 28-year-old man is responsible for multiple deaths," state homicide squad commander Danny Doherty told reporters on Sunday.</p>

<p>The suspect allegedly acted with "the intention of keeping the kids inside the premises whilst the fire was happening," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A policy update allowing the microblogging site X to manually review the direct messages (DMs) of some users has sparked major privacy concerns.</p>

<p>An X user, @kimdotcom, on Sunday flagged the new update that goes against the X policy of providing end-to-end encryption to every content on the platform.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the policy update shared online showed the Elon Musk-owned platform now reviews DMs to investigate reported violations and misuse of its services, "or to comply with laws or governmental requests".</p>

<p>Replying to the user, Elon Musk confirmed the update but did not provide any additional detail.</p>

<p>"It currently works in a clunky way for one to one messages (if you turn it on). We're working on making it easy to use and apply to group messages too. X audio and video calls are automatically encrypted," he said.</p>

<p>Several other users raised an alarm over the manual review of DMs and said Elon Musk did not understand the concern. "The 'comply with government requests' clause is unacceptable. Please say you still believe in free speech," a user said.</p>

<p>"Is it me or did Elon not understand the question of Kim? Kim was worried about reviewing the DMs by government request," another said on X. An user commented: "You didn't address the root of the concern. Why is X collaborating with governments to sift through our private DMs?"</p>

<p>According to the X website, encrypted DMs are an important aspect of the platform's aim to become the most trusted platform on the internet. "As Elon Musk said, when it comes to Direct Messages, the standard should be, if someone puts a gun to our heads, we still can't access your messages," the X help centre states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month was the hottest June on record, the EU's climate change monitoring service said on Monday, continuing a streak of exceptional temperatures that some scientists said puts 2024 on track to be the world's hottest recorded year.</p>

<p>Every month since June 2023 - 13 months in a row - has ranked as the planet's hottest since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin.</p>

<p>The latest data suggest 2024 could outrank 2023 as the hottest year since records began after human-caused climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon both pushed temperatures to record highs in the year so far, some scientists said.</p>

<p>"I now estimate that there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s," said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth.</p>

<p>The changed climate has already unleashed disastrous consequences around the world in 2024.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 people died in fierce heat during the haj pilgrimage last month. Heat deaths were recorded in New Delhi, which endured an unprecedentedly long heatwave, and amongst Greek tourists.</p>

<p>Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute, said there was a "high chance" 2024 would rank as the hottest year on record.</p>

<p>"El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon that will always come and go. We can't stop El Nino, but we can stop burning oil, gas, and coal," she said.</p>

<p>The natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, tends to raise global average temperatures.</p>

<p>That effect subsided in recent months, with the world now in neutral conditions before cooler La Nina conditions are expected to form later this year.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.</p>

<p>Despite promises to curb global warming, countries have so far failed collectively to reduce these emissions, pushing temperatures steadily higher for decades.</p>

<p>In the 12 months ending in June, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for any such period, at 1.64 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, C3S said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of France's allies breathed a sigh of relief that the worst was averted as Marine Le Pen's far-right failed to win a snap election on Sunday but they noted that a messy coalition from a hung parliament could also pose headaches for Europe.</p>

<p>Le Pen's National Rally (RN) had been favourite to top the polls, raising the risk of France's first far-right government since World War Two and threatening to upend economic and foreign policy in the euro zone's second-largest economy.</p>

<p>In particular, Ukraine's allies feared a Le Pen-led government could be soft on Moscow and pare back military aid that Kyiv has relied on since the Russian invasion in 2022, though her party has latterly said Russia was a threat.</p>

<p>The National Rally's defeat signals at least a temporary pushback against a far-right surge in Europe, but could herald a period of instability with a new government in an uneasy "cohabitation" with President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>"In Paris enthusiasm, in Moscow disappointment, in Kyiv relief. Enough to be happy in Warsaw," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X.</p>

<p>Macron had called the snap poll in an attempt to wrest the initiative back from Le Pen but his own party was left trailing behind an alliance of leftist parties that performed far better than expected to take first place.</p>

<p>Several early reactions from overseas rejoiced that the immediate threat of a far-right government had been averted.</p>

<p>"The worst has been avoided," said Nils Schmid, the foreign policy spokesperson for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats in Germany, where the far-right has also surged in popularity during a cost of living crisis.</p>

<p>"The president is politically weakened, even if he retains a central role in view of the unclear majority situation. Forming a government will be complicated," Schmid told the Funke media group.</p>

<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's party congratulated the leftist alliance, called the New Popular Front, for a victory that "stops the far-right from reaching the government".</p>

<p>Nikos Androulakis, the head of Greece's Socialist PASOK party, said the French people had "raised a wall against the far right, racism and intolerance and guarded the timeless principles of the French Republic: Liberty, Equality and Fraternity."</p>

<p>Colombia's leftist firebrand President, Gustavo Petro, also congratulated the French for keeping out Le Pen.</p>

<p>"There are battles that last just a few days but (which) define humanity's fate. France has gone through one of these," he said.</p>

<p>An EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity, called it a "huge relief" but added: "what it means for Europe on a day to day basis remains to be seen though."</p>

<p>DEEP DIVISIONS</p>

<p>The election left the French parliament split between three large groups - the left, the centrists, and the far right - with different platforms and no tradition of working together.</p>

<p>The left wants to cap prices of essential goods like fuel and food, raise the minimum wage and the salaries of public sector workers, at a time when France's budget deficit is already at 5.5% of output, higher than EU rules permit.</p>

<p>"Bye-bye European deficit limits! (The government) will crash in no time. Poor France. It can console itself with (Kylian) Mbapp&amp;#233;," said Claudio Borghi, senator from Italy's right-wing League party, referring to the French soccer star.</p>

<p>Other hard-right politicians expressed frustration.</p>

<p>Andre Ventura, leader of Portugal's far-right party Chega, called the result a "disaster for the economy, tragedy for immigration and bad for the fight against corruption".</p>

<p>A note by Capital Economics said France may have avoided the "worst possible outcomes" for investors, of an outright majority for either Le Pen or the leftists.</p>

<p>A fractious parliament means however it will be difficult for any government to pass the budget cuts that are necessary for France to comply with the EU's budget rules, it said.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, the chance of France's government (and the governments of other countries) clashing with the EU over fiscal policy has increased now that the bloc's budget rules have been re-introduced," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Colorado man, who murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters in 2018, now lives in constant fear in prison. Chris Watts is terrified of being attacked or killed by prisoners disgusted by his heinous crime, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/04/us-news/killer-dad-chris-watts-lives-in-fear-in-wisconsin-prison/ ">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>"A lot of guys would like to get their hands on him," said an inmate, who spent a year alongside Watts at the prison.</p>

<p>Watts pleaded guilty to murdering his pregnant wife, Shanann, and their two young daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, in 2018. He initially denied knowing what happened to his family but later confessed to the crime.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/crime/chris-watts-murders-shanann-wife-prison-084583-20240123 ">letters</a> to author Cheryln Cadle, Watts described trying to smother his daughters before murdering his wife. He wrote that he used a pillow from their bed to kill them and that his wife's eyes filled with blood and her face turned black with streaks of mascara. His attempt to kill his daughters initially failed, but he later managed to kill them and disposed of their bodies in oil tanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Watts was having an affair with Nichol Kessinger, a co-worker. The authorities believe it to be the motive for the murders. Ms Kessinger later stated that she thought Watts was already separated from his wife when they had an affair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is now sentenced to life in prison without parole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He killed two little girls who didn't do anything to deserve it. He's the lowest of the low at Dodge (Correctional Institution),” his former inmate said. “A lot of people want to get their revenge for those girls.”</p>

<p>Watts now lives a life of isolation and fear. According to sources, he is constantly in danger and has been transferred to a different facility for his safety. “He's an outcast,” said an inmate. “When people found out that his victims were two little girls, they wanted to kill him.”</p>

<p>Inmates said that he was protected at the prison, currently. “If the guards weren't always around, everyone would take a swing at him.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Every day, he thinks about what he did," Watts' former inmate said. "He has photos of the girls and he prays for forgiveness every day."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a worrying trend, Elon Musk-owned X is manually reviewing certain users' direct messages (DMs) to investigate reported violations and misuse of its service, “or to comply with laws or governmental requests”.</p>

<p>When an X user with @kimdotcom account posted this policy update, the tech billionaire on Monday did not provide a clear answer to the query, which goes against the policy of providing end-to-end encryption to every content on the platform.</p>

<p>“It currently works in a clunky way for one to one messages (if you turn it on). We're working on making it easy to use and apply to group messages too,” Musk replied.</p>

<p></p>

<p>“X audio and video calls are automatically encrypted,” he added.</p>

<p>Several users raised an alarm over X apparently manually reviewing DMs.</p>

<p>“Is it me or did Elon not understand the question of Kim? Kim was worried about reviewing the DMs by government request,” an X user posted.</p>

<p>Another user commented: “You didn't address the root on the concern. Why is X collaborating with governments to sift through our private DMs?”</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a one-minute video posted on Facebook on Sunday, Lawful-Sanders said, "effective immediately I am no longer an on-air host at WURD."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Radio host Andrea Lawful-Sanders who recently interviewed US President Joe Biden and claimed that the questions asked of President were provided in advance has resigned from WURD Radio, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/07/media/biden-interview-radio-host-philadelphia/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The interview featured pre-determined questions provided by the White House, which violates our practice of remaining an independent media outlet accountable to our listeners," Sara Lomax, president and CEO of the Philadelphia-based station, announced in a statement posted Sunday on its <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://wurdradio.com/2024/07/07/accountability-access-and-a-path-forward-why-black-media-matters/">website</a></em>. "As a result, Ms. Lawful-Sanders and WURD Radio have mutually agreed to part ways, effective immediately."</p>

<p>WURD is Pennsylvania's sole Black-owned talk radio station. Ms Lomax emphasized that the station prides itself on being an independent and trustworthy voice for its main audience of Black Philadelphians. She stated that using pre-provided questions "jeopardizes that trust and is not a practice that WURD Radio engages in or endorses as a matter of practice or official policy."</p>

<p>"WURD Radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other Administration," she added.</p>

<p>Lawful-Sanders, who hosted "The Source," interviewed Biden last week, asking him four questions about the election's stakes, his achievements, his debate performance, and his message to undecided voters. In a Saturday interview with CNN's Victor Blackwell, she revealed that these questions were among eight recommended to her by Biden's aides prior to the interview.</p>

<p>"The questions were sent to me for approval. I approved them," she said.</p>

<p>In a one-minute video posted on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/443556475259170"><em>Facebook </em></a>on Sunday, Lawful-Sanders said, “effective immediately I am no longer an on-air host at WURD. I tendered my resignation yesterday. It was accepted.”</p>

<p>She then thanked “all of you who played a part in this journey, including WURD Radio.” She went on to say that she is “grateful,” and that “Life is moving. Things are shifting and changing. And, in a day or so you'll hear more.”</p>

<p>The move has intensified the ongoing controversy surrounding Biden's sharpness, following his lackluster performance in the first presidential debate hosted by CNN. Many top Democrats have expressed frustration and concern over his debate performance, with some suggesting that he should reconsider accepting the party's nomination.</p>

<p>"If the White House is trying now to prove the vim, vigor ... of the president, I don't know how they do that by sending questions first before the interview so that the president knows what's coming," said Ms Blackwell.</p>

<p>Ms Blackwell further revealed that both Lawful-Sanders and Earl Ingram, host of "The Earl Ingram Show" in Milwaukee who also interviewed the president this week, asked Biden "essentially the same questions."</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson did not deny the campaign provided questions, but said, "We do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions."</p>

<p>"It's not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer. These questions were relevant to the news of the day - the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he'd delivered for black Americans," spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>However, the spokesperson later said that it will no longer suggest questions to interviewers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions they please, moving forward we will refrain from offering suggested questions," a source familiar with the Biden booking operation told CNN.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), an alliance of parties hastily assembled after President Emmanuel Macron called a surprise snap parliamentary election, looked set to score a shock win in Sunday's vote over the far right and the ruling centrists.</p>

<p>If initial projections are confirmed, Macron will be required to name a prime minister from the bloc. The initial estimates are typically accurate.</p>

<p>The NFP - made up of the Communist Party, the hard left France Unbowed, the Green party and the Socialist Party - has not said who would be its pick for prime minister. The following are some of its best-known figures:</p>

<h2><strong>Jean-Luc Melenchon, Hard Left France Unbowed Party</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/1bfh2fqo_jeanluc-melenchon-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Jean-Luc Melenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party.</p>

<p>He ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.</p>

<p>A fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing some voters while horrifying others with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies.</p>

<h2><strong>Marine Tondelier, Leader Of The Greens</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/7d40ep0o_marine-tondelier-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Tondelier, 37, grew up in Henin-Beaumont, a town in northern France that is well-known as a bastion of the far-right National Rally (RN) and its leader Le Pen.</p>

<p>Tondelier has a long record of opposing the RN.</p>

<p>She was elected as an opposition member of the town's municipal council in 2014. She documented her experiences working under an RN mayor and what she described as the oppressive atmosphere generated by the far-right administration in a 2017 book entitled "News from the Front".</p>

<p>Tondelier was also elected to a northern regional council in 2021, and she became leader of France's best-known ecologist party, the Greens, the following year.</p>

<h2><strong>Raphael Glucksmann, Socialist Party</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/4lk4lpl8_raphael-glucksmann-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Raphael Glucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections in early June. It obtained nearly 14% of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion.</p>

<p>Glucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili.</p>

<p>He advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion.</p>

<h2><strong>Laurent Berger, Former CFDT Trade Union Leader</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/ctana8e_laurent-berger-afp_625x300_08_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Laurent Berger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the RN.</p>

<p>Berger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slammed Seoul Monday for recent military drills near the border, saying the South must be "suicidal" and warning of a "terrible disaster".</p>

<p>After Pyongyang sent multiple barrages of trash-carrying balloons across the border, Seoul last month fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and resumed live-fire drills on border islands and by the demilitarised zone that divides the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong, who is a key regime spokesperson, said this was "an undisguised war game (and) an inexcusable and explicit provocation that aggravates the situation," according to a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.</p>

<p>South Korea's border drills were "suicidal hysteria, for which they will have to sustain terrible disaster," she added.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong said it was "clear to everyone... the riskiness of the above-said reckless live ammunition firing drills of the ROK army coming nearer to the border of the DPRK," referring to the South by its official name, the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>If Seoul's exercises breach the North's sovereignty, Kim Yo Jong warned: "our armed forces will immediately carry out its mission," without giving further details.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with Pyongyang ramping up weapons testing as it draws ever closer to Russia.</p>

<p>Seoul and Washington have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for use in the war in Ukraine -- which would violate rafts of sanctions on both countries.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the nuclear-armed North declared Seoul its chief enemy, and has jettisoned agencies designed for outreach and diplomacy with Seoul, while ramping up security along the shared border.</p>

<p>North Korean soldiers have crossed the border three times in recent weeks, likely accidentally Seoul's military says, while they were working to lay mines, clear foliage and build likely anti-tank barriers.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong also criticised recent trilateral drills between the United States, South Korea and Japan, saying they were "the height of confrontational hysteria".</p>

<p>"The war drumbeats clearly showed that the US and other hostile forces' rash manoeuvres for military hegemony in the region have crossed the red line," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida man is facing a felony robbery charge after allegedly attempting to withdraw 1 cent from a bank in Sumter County, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/06/us-news/florida-man-michael-fleming-tries-to-withdraw-1-cent-from-bank-gets-hit-with-robbery-charge/"><em>New York Post</em></a>. The Sumter County Sheriff's Office's arrest affidavit states the incident occurred just before 2 pm on Saturday at the Chase Bank on US-441 in Lady Lake.</p>

<p>The man, identified as Michael Fleming, entered the bank, filled out a withdrawal slip for 1 cent, and handed it to a teller. The teller reportedly informed Fleming that he couldn't withdraw just a penny.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-he-has-cleaned-a-lot-of-toilets-elon-musk-responds-6053618">Also Read|&nbsp;Nvidia's Jensen Huang Says He Has ''Cleaned A Lot Of Toilets'', Elon Musk Responds</a></p>

<p>"So you want me to say the other word?" Fleming reportedly told the bank teller, according to the arrest report. No further details about their conversation were provided in the affidavit, but deputies stated that the teller was afraid of potential violence and called law enforcement.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived, Fleming was still inside the bank and was taken into custody, the affidavit said. He was transported to the Sumter County Sheriff's Office, where he agreed to speak with deputies after being read his Miranda Rights.</p>

<p>Although the details of this conversation were redacted from the report, deputies stated they had probable cause to believe Fleming violated Florida's robbery laws, according to the affidavit.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old man was then taken to the Sumter County Detention Center, where he remains on $5,000 bond as of Tuesday afternoon, according to online jail records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The champagne was on ice at the far-right National Rally's (RN) headquarters, but the celebratory mood swiftly turned to disbelief when the first projected results from Sunday's parliamentary election appeared on TV screens.</p>

<p>For days, Marine Le Pen had confidently predicted that her party would triumph with an outright majority and her protege Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Instead, the National Rally was on course to come third, behind a left-wing alliance and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc.</p>

<p>It was undone to a large extent by tactical dealmaking between centrist and leftist opponents, who pulled more than 200 candidates from three-way races to avoid splitting the anti-RN vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The projected result brought to a shuddering halt what had appeared to be the far right's relentless rise in France, carefully engineered by Le Pen who had sough to clean up her party's image and tap the grievances of voters angry over living costs, strained public services, and immigration.</p>

<p>To be sure, Le Pen and her party have suffered disappointment before, most recently her 2022 defeat to Macron in the presidential election, and have managed to bounce back more strongly than before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But for now, the outcome was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<p>"The results are disappointing and they don't represent what French people want," said Jocelyn Cousin, 18, who had come to party HQ expecting a victory party.</p>

<p>The RN's momentum had appeared unstoppable after it trounced the centrists in European elections in early June and came first, ahead of the hastily assembled leftist New Popular Front, in the first round of the parliamentary vote on June 30.</p>

<p>Le Pen and Bardella attributed their party's setback on Sunday to the what Bardella called the "disgraceful alliance" the anti-RN forces, who he said had caricatured the party and disrespected its voters.</p>

<p>But IPSOS pollster Brice Teinturier pointed to the RN's own shortcomings, including revelations before the run-off that several of its candidates had expressed xenophobic views, raising questions over whether the party had really ditched its more toxic past.</p>

<p>"What happened is also that RN candidates themselves showed in this campaign that they either were not ready or had in their ranks candidates that are antisemitic, xenophobic or homophobic," Teinturier told France 2 television.</p>

<p><strong>'TIDE IS RISING'</strong></p>

<p>Florent de Kersauson, an RN candidate in Brittany in western France, acknowledged the fallout had been damaging. But he also said voters may have felt the party was arrogant in predicting an absolute majority.</p>

<p>"I thought it was strange that they said that," said Kersauson, who lost his race against a pro-Macron candidate. "It seemed like something that was very hard to achieve."</p>

<p>Bardella and Le Pen strove to put a brave face on their result. The party had increased its share of seats in the National Assembly to a record high, they noted, vowing to keep fighting until they won power.</p>

<p>"The tide is rising, but it didn't rise quite high enough this time," said Le Pen, who is likely to mount her fourth presidential campaign in 2027. "Our victory has merely been delayed."</p>

<p>That was also the feeling among many of the supporters gathered at party HQ in Paris.</p>

<p>"I see our victory coming. People are going to understand that the National Rally is not so horrible. I believe it will happen in 2027. I have a lot of hope and I'll continue to fight," said Elea da Cunha, 17.</p>

<p>Frederic-Pierre Vos, a close associate of Le Pen and former RN party lawyer elected in a constituency north of Paris, said the hung parliament thrown up by the election would mean an ungovernable France, providing fresh opportunities for RN in 2027.</p>

<p>Yet despite the party's fighting talk, Sunday's outcome was a clear setback.</p>

<p>Business newspaper Les Echos ran a front page showing a grim-faced Bardella with the headline "la claque" or "the slap".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

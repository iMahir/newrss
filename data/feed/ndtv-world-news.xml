       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden announced a $425 million arms package for Kyiv Wednesday in a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, ahead of a farewell visit to Berlin to discuss Ukraine, the White House said.</p>

<p>The package includes air defense and armored vehicles, said a readout of the call, adding that President Biden had briefed Mr Zelensky "on his efforts to surge security assistance to Ukraine over the remainder of his term in office."</p>

<p>Mr Biden would also hold a virtual meeting of Ukraine's allies in November, it added, as he tries to shore up international support for Kyiv before a possible return of Donald Trump to the White House in January 2025.</p>

<p>There was no mention, however, of any decision on whether to allow Ukraine to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russia, a move Biden has been reluctant to green-light so far.</p>

<p>The $425 million US package includes "additional air defense capability, air-to-ground munitions, armored vehicles, and critical munitions to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," the White House said.</p>

<p>The United States would in coming months provide hundreds of air defense missiles, artillery, hundreds of armored personnel carriers and thousands of additional armored vehicles, it added.</p>

<p>Mr Zelensky meanwhile "updated President Biden on his plan to achieve victory over Russia, and the two leaders tasked their teams to engage in further consultations on next steps."</p>

<p>Mr Zelensky said on X that he had spoken with Biden and thanked him for the package, which included "long range weapons."</p>

<p>"I am grateful to President Biden, both parties in Congress, and the American people for the $425 million defense package announced today," said Ukraine President, who is due to meet EU leaders on Thursday.</p>

<p>The United States has provided around $175 billion in both military and economic assistance to Ukraine during the war, despite frequent opposition from Republicans.</p>

<p>The call came on the eve of Mr Biden's whirlwind trip to Germany, where Ukraine will be high on the agenda.</p>

<p>Mr Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz could be joined for talks by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, media reports said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The risk of cholera spreading in Lebanon is "very high", the World Health Organization warned Wednesday, after a case of the acute and potentially deadly diarrhoeal infection was detected in the conflict-hit country.</p>

<p>The WHO highlighted the risk of cholera spreading among hundreds of thousands of people displaced since Israel escalated an air campaign against Hezbollah and launched a ground offensive intended to push the group back from its northern border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>"If the cholera outbreak ... spreads to the new displaced people, it might spread very fast," Abdinasir Abubakar, WHO's representative in Lebanon, told reporters in an online news conference.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said a cholera case had been confirmed in a Lebanese national who went to hospital on Monday suffering from watery diarrhoea and dehydration.</p>

<p>The patient, from Ammouniyeh in northern Lebanon, had no history of travel, the ministry said.</p>

<p>Lebanon suffered its first cholera outbreak in 30 years between 2022 and 2023, mainly in the north of the country.</p>

<p>The disease, which causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting and muscle cramps, generally arises from eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with the bacterium, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>The UN health agency has for months been warning that the disease could resurface amid "deteriorating water and sanitation" among the displaced and their host communities, Abubakar said.</p>

<p>The number of displaced swelled even before the escalation last month, as Hezbollah exchanged cross-border fire with Israel over the past year, saying it was acting over Israel's war on Gaza.</p>

<p>While people in northern Lebanon had recently been exposed or vaccinated, Abubakar cautioned that some communities on the move from southern Lebanon and the Beirut area had not built up any cholera immunity for three decades.</p>

<p>If the disease gets into those populations, he warned, "the risk of spread is very high".</p>

<p>WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters the agency had strengthened "surveillance and conduct tracing, including environmental surveillance and water sampling".</p>

<p>In August, he said, the Lebanese health ministry launched an oral cholera vaccination campaign targeting 350,000 people living in high-risk areas, but the campaign was "interrupted by the escalation in violence".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of Oxford today announced the final candidates for their Chancellor election. Three Indian-origin individuals are among the 38 finalists, but former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was not included.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Diverse Field Of Contenders</strong></h2>

<p>The finalists come from various backgrounds including academics, politicians, and business leaders. Ankur Shiv Bhandari (first Indian-origin Mayor of Bracknell Forest), Nirpal Singh Paul Bhangal (Professor of International Entrepreneurship), and Pratik Tarvadi (medical professional) will be competing for the position.</p>

<p>Former Conservative Party leader Lord William Hague and former Labour politician Lord Peter Mandelson are among the senior politicians selected, however, Khan is deemed to have been disqualified following the selection process.</p>

<h3><strong>38 Candidates Meet Tough Criteria</strong></h3>

<p>“Applications were considered by the Chancellor's Election Committee solely on the four exclusion criteria set out in the university's regulations. All applicants have been notified whether their submissions have been successful,” a university statement reads.</p>

<p>To qualify for the unpaid position, candidates were required to meet stringent criteria. They had to demonstrate exceptional accomplishments in their field, as well as the ability to inspire respect from a wider audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, candidates were expected to have a profound understanding of the university's research and academic goals, its diverse global community, and its aspiration to maintain its status as a world-class institution. Furthermore, they needed to possess the capacity and desire to elevate the university's reputation both domestically and internationally.</p>

<p>Although the university did not provide specific reasons for individual rejections, some experts suggested that Khan's criminal convictions in his home country - Pakistan, might have disqualified the former Oxford graduate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The University's Convocation, composed of faculty and alumni, will now conduct an online election to choose Lord Patten's successor. Lord Patten, a former governor of Hong Kong, will step down from his 21-year tenure as Chancellor at the end of Trinity Term 2024.</p>

<p>In the first round of voting, which begins on October 28, voters can rank as many candidates as they wish. The top five candidates, to be announced on November 4, will advance to the second round of voting, scheduled for November 18. The University of Oxford's new Chancellor will be revealed on November 25.</p>

<p>In his 'Statement of Interest,' Mr Bhandari expressed his desire to become Chancellor of Oxford University. He described the university as 'a temple of learning, research, and a beacon of history' and stated that serving as Chancellor would be 'the honor of my life.' Mr Bhandari believes he is well-suited for the role and can contribute to the university's ongoing mission.</p>

<p>Mr Bhangal highlights his global connections, deep understanding of Oxford and Oxford University, and experience as a course developer and visiting professor. He believes his strong business acumen, multicultural competence, and government contacts in major economies worldwide make him a valuable asset to Oxford University in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Tarvadi sees the Chancellor position as an opportunity to promote inclusivity, innovation, and a global impact. He asserts that his international experience and network would be crucial in establishing new partnerships and strengthening existing ones, thereby ensuring Oxford's continued leadership in global academic and research endeavors.</p>

<h3><strong>Oxford Chancellor - A Decade Of Leadership</strong></h3>

<p>The incoming Chancellor will serve a fixed term of no more than 10 years, in line with recent amendments to the university's statutes.</p>

<p>The Chancellor serves as the ceremonial head of Oxford University, presiding over significant ceremonies and chairing the Committee to Elect the Vice-Chancellor. Beyond these formal responsibilities, the Chancellor engages in advocacy, advisory, and fundraising activities, representing the university at various national and international events.</p>

<p>The position of Chancellor has previously been held by former Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan, former Labour home secretary and president of the European Commission Roy Jenkins, and most recently by Lord Patten.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any deployment of US nuclear weapons to Japan in the framework of an "Asian NATO" would lead to a collapse in regional stability, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, on the eve of taking office, outlined a plan to revamp Tokyo's closest alliance by locking Washington into an "Asian NATO" and stationing Japanese troops on US soil.</p>

<p>The new security alliance, Ishiba said, could even share control of Washington's nuclear weapons as a deterrent against Japan's nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>

<p>"And this will lead to what? The correct answer is - the collapse of any stability in an already long-suffering region," Zakharova said.</p>

<p>"This will become a monstrous catalyst for escalation in the region with unknown consequences, or rather, the consequences are known, but we do not want to voice them," Zakharova said, adding that such a move would demonstrate Tokyo's subservience to Washington and its willingness to blindly implement American policies on Japanese soil.</p>

<p>The proposal is not something Tokyo is moving ahead with immediately after India and the United States expressed different concerns about it. But Takeshi Iwaya, Japan's foreign minister, has said "it's one idea for the future."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has further strained tense relations with Israel with a comment referring to the creation of the Israeli state, a verbal jab that was rapidly denounced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as distorting history.</p>

<p>Macron has sought to take a more uncompromising stance on the conflicts in the Middle East after Israel launched an offensive against targets of the Shiite operator Hezbollah in Lebanon, a former French protectorate.</p>

<p>The French leader said last week that stopping the export of weapons used by Israel in Lebanon and in its war against the Palestinian operator Hamas in the Gaza Strip was the only way to stop the two conflicts.</p>

<p>France, which is home to Europe's largest Jewish population, has repeatedly urged a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, but has also increasingly criticised Israel over the heavy civilian toll in the conflicts.</p>

<p>Paris has also denounced Israeli fire against the 10,000 peacekeepers of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon, which includes a French contingent of around 700 troops.</p>

<p>In a new sign of the tensions between the countries, organisers of the major Euronaval defence show outside Paris next month said that following a decision of the French government, no Israeli stands or exhibits would be allowed at the salon.</p>

<p><strong>'Not the time'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>"Mr Netanyahu must not forget that his country was created by a decision of the UN," Macron told the weekly French cabinet meeting on Tuesday, referring to the resolution adopted in November 1947 by the United Nations General Assembly to partition Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state.</p>

<p>His comments during the closed-door meeting at the Elysee Palace were quoted by two participants who spoke to AFP and asked not to be named.</p>

<p>"Therefore this is not the time to disregard the decisions of the UN," he added. UN Security Council Resolution 1701 states that only the Lebanese army and UNIFIL should be deployed in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu hit back at Macron's comments later Tuesday, saying the country's founding was achieved by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, not a UN ruling.</p>

<p>He also said that among those who fought for Israel in 1948 were French Jews who had been sent to death camps after being rounded up by the collaborationist Vichy regime, which governed France during the Nazi occupation in World War II.</p>

<p>"A reminder to the president of France: It was not the UN resolution that established the State of Israel, but rather the victory achieved in the war of independence with the blood of heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors -- including from the Vichy regime in France," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>The French presidency's readout of a phone call between both men Tuesday -- sent deep in the night, several hours after the conversation took place -- made clear the testy nature of the exchange.</p>

<p>Macron told Netanyahu that he condemned "the indiscriminate Israeli strikes that only add to an already intolerable human toll, in Gaza as in Lebanon", it said.</p>

<p><strong>'What does it imply?'</strong></p>

<p>But Macron's comment on Israel's creation had also caused concern within the Jewish community in France.</p>

<p>Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), an umbrella group, said the remarks "if confirmed" constituted a "both a historical and political error".</p>

<p>He said such comments ignored the "century-old history of Zionism", the movement that aimed to build a Jewish homeland.</p>

<p>"At a time when anti-Semitism feeds on anti-Zionism, these remarks dangerously strengthen the camp of those who contest the legitimacy of Israel's right to exist," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>Caroline Yadan, an MP for Macron's centrist party, said the comments attributed to the president were "unworthy".</p>

<p>"Reducing Israel to a single UN decision is to deny the history of the Jewish people and its legitimate and historical connection to this land," she wrote on X. "What does this statement imply? That what the UN has done, the UN can undo? Is this a warning?"</p>

<p>"Macron's words have sown trouble in the macronie," said the left-wing daily Liberation, using the colloquial term for Macron's supporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel carried out dozens of strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Wednesday, killing a city mayor, toppling buildings and causing widespread destruction in several southern areas.</p>

<p>The latest exchanges in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed increasing calls for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said its warplanes struck dozens of Hezbollah targets in the southern city of Nabatiyeh, where the Lebanese group and its ally Amal hold sway.</p>

<p>The Lebanese health ministry said six people were killed and 43 injured in the strikes on two municipal buildings, adding that rescuers were searching through the rubble for survivors.</p>

<p>The city's mayor was among the dead, a local official told AFP, adding that the strikes "formed a kind of belt of fire".</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying that Israel "deliberately targeted a meeting of the municipal council that was discussing the city's services and relief situation".</p>

<p>Rescuers were also searching through rubble for survivors in the southern Lebanese village of Qana, where Israeli strikes killed three people and injured 54 on Tuesday, the Lebanese ministry said.</p>

<p>AFP footage showed mass destruction in the village, where entire buildings had been levelled.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Israeli air strikes hit Hezbollah's main stronghold in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters were locked in clashes at "point-blank range" near the southern village of Al-Qawzah.</p>

<p>Israel ramped up its bombardment, mainly targeting Hezbollah strongholds, in late September and sent ground troops across the Lebanese border on September 30.</p>

<p>The Israel-Hezbollah war has left at least 1,373 people dead in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah started low-intensity strikes on Israel in October last year in support of its ally Hamas, following its October 7 attack that triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>With Hamas weakened but not defeated, Israel widened the focus of its military operations to include Lebanon, vowing to fight until tens of thousands of Israelis forced by Hezbollah's fire to flee their homes are able to return.</p>

<p><strong>Israel striking nuclear sites 'unlikely'</strong></p>

<p>The region has also braced for Israel's promised retaliation against its arch-foe Iran for launching around 200 missiles at Israel on October 1.</p>

<p>Iran said the attack was itself retaliation for an Israeli strike in Beirut days before that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian general Abbas Nilforoushan.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has warned Israel against striking Iran's nuclear or oil facilities.</p>

<p>A spokesman of Iran's atomic agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, said on Wednesday that an Israeli attack on key Iranian nuclear sites was "very unlikely".</p>

<p>If Israel were to do "such a stupid thing," Iran could "quickly compensate" for any potential damage, he added.</p>

<p>Tehran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate if Israel attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Pressure on Israel&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>But Netanyahu told French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday that he was "opposed to a unilateral ceasefire, which does not change the security situation in Lebanon," according to his office.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant then called Macron a "disgrace" after Israeli delegations were banned from exhibiting hardware at a defence show being held in France next month.</p>

<p>The US government -- Israel's top arms supplier -- has also criticised Israel's air strikes in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"We have made clear that we are opposed to the campaign the way we've seen it conducted over the past weeks" in Beirut, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Israel has also faced criticism over injuries and damage sustained by UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, 16 European Union defence ministers called "for maximum political and diplomatic pressure on Israel" to prevent further incidents against peacekeepers in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said his country "places great importance on the activities of UNIFIL and has no intention of harming the organisation or its personnel".</p>

<p>The Lebanese Red Cross said two paramedics were wounded on Wednesday in an Israeli strike on a south Lebanon village while a rescue mission coordinated with UN peacekeepers was underway.</p>

<p>UNICEF, the UN's agency for children, said Lebanese children were "at growing risk of" health issues "including waterborne diseases like cholera, hepatitis and diarrhoea" because the fighting had damaged or disrupted essential services.</p>

<p><strong>Famine fears in Gaza</strong></p>

<p>There has also been a chorus of international condemnation about the humanitarian crisis in hunger-ravaged Gaza.</p>

<p>In a letter sent to the Israeli government on Sunday, the United States warned it could withhold weapons deliveries unless more humanitarian aid was delivered to Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned on Wednesday that there was "a real risk" of famine in Gaza.</p>

<p>The besieged strip has "become a kind of wasteland, which I would say is almost unliveable," UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.</p>

<p>Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza after the October 7 attack by Hamas resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures, including hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>The Israeli campaign has killed 42,409 people, the majority civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory which the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>For over a week, Israeli forces have engaged in a sweeping air and ground assault targeting northern Gaza and the area around Jabalia amid claims that Hamas operators were regrouping there.</p>

<p>Nidal al-Arab lost 10 of his family members during Israeli strikes on Jabalia.</p>

<p>"People are trapped. If they don't die of shelling, they will soon die of thirst and hunger because the siege is getting tighter," the 40-year-old told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Jimmy Carter, who recently turned a hundred, announced that he is voting for Kamala Harris and that is what he really cares about, dismissing his age-related milestone moment as "just another birthday".</p>

<p>"He said he didn't care about that. It's just a birthday. He said he cared about voting for Kamala Harris." James Earl "Chip" Carter III said in an interview to The Washington Post.</p>

<p>That is 100-year-old Jimmy Carter, the oldest ex-president who served in office from 1977 to 1981, during the Cold War era. Chip Carter also added that his father spent his days watching speeches from the Democratic National Convention. "He thought Michelle Obama was the best, and he thought Kamala was great, too," he said.</p>

<p>'I'm only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,' Carter told his son Chip, his grandson Jason Carter told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has always been of the opinion that Jimmy Carter was "the worst president", however more recently he said, "Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of our country, worse than Jimmy Carter by a long shot."</p>

<p>Georgia - one of the seven key swing states is critical to the November election as Biden beat Donald Trump in 2020 by a hair's breadth - less than 1 percent of the vote in the state, and Carter's family said he can't wait to cast his mail-in ballot for Harris. Furthermore, he does not believe Donald Trump should be president again, Chip Carter said.</p>

<p>Although a 100-year-old exercising his rights might seem touching and inspiring, users on X have varying opinions regarding the centenarian ex-prez casting his vote and the photo has been widely shared on social media. One user commented, "This is crazy. I have some dead relatives I can dig up and take to vote for Trump if this is what we're doing now."</p>

<p>While another said, "Did he actually vote or was it a family member that did it for him? Does anyone know if he's even of sound mind and was capable of making his own decision?" Another user condemned the entire episode, saying, "Shame on the Democrats for wheeling him out in that state."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Shame on the Democrats for wheeling him out in that state.</p>
— AmericanPapaBear (@AmericaPapaBear) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmericaPapaBear/status/1846255868293066986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>On the flipside, there were users who also celebrated the gesture, "Carter's vote serves as a reminder that in American politics, age doesn't necessarily diminish one's sense of duty or the desire to shape the future. Ok? Ok."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ah, Jimmy Carter casting his vote for Kamala Harris as early voting opens—quite the symbolic gesture, don't you see? The former president, now 99, is still deeply engaged in the political landscape, driven not by the prospect of his own milestone birthday, but by the opportunity…</p>
— L. Ron Hubbard (Parody) (@FakeLRonHubbard) <a href="https://twitter.com/FakeLRonHubbard/status/1846275319663382970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>One of the most important questions that arises with this particular instance is whether the state will count Carter's ballot if he fails to make it till November 5th. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in such cases, most states haven't delineated what to do. Clearly such votes will likely not be numerous enough to sway the results of an election.</p>

<p>According to his son who spoke to the Journal-Constitution, Carter is very "interested in politics and the war in Gaza".</p>

<p>"After my grandmother passed, he had a pretty long low period when he wasn't really engaging much at all," The Washington Post quoted Jason Carter, his eldest grandchild. "But now he's talking about politics again."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will host a summit of BRICS leaders next week, seeking support in his standoff with the West from the expanded group that now represents about a third of global economic output.</p>

<p>Russia says the event will be attended by leaders from Brazil, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE, and Saudi Arabia - which has been invited to join - will be represented by its foreign minister.</p>

<p>Here are some of the proposals Moscow will put forward:</p>

<p><strong>BRICS CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS INITIATIVE</strong></p>

<p>An alternative payment system in national BRICS currencies that would include a new messaging system and a network of national commercial banks linked to each other through the BRICS central banks, removing the need to exchange local currencies through the U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>The system would be immune to external pressure and will use blockchain technology to store and transfer digital tokens, backed by national currencies, to make it more secure and reduce transaction costs. The aim is to keep trade flows between member countries running smoothly even if one or more members are denied access to the international financial system.</p>

<p><strong>BRICS CLEAR</strong></p>

<p>An international settlement and depository infrastructure that Russia says would enhance cross-border trade in national securities. The idea is to allow all members to retain full access to BRICS financial markets even if they are cut off from Western financial infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>BRICS REINSURANCE</strong></p>

<p>The proposal is to establish a BRICS reinsurance company to allow uninterrupted shipment of goods and key commodities between members in the event that Western reinsurance firms, who dominate international trade, refuse to provide their services.</p>

<p>This issue is especially relevant to Russia as Western countries have since 2022 applied a price cap on its oil, blocking access to Western shipping and insurance services if the oil is sold for more than $60 a barrel.</p>

<p><strong>BRICS CONTINGENT RESERVE ARRANGEMENT</strong></p>

<p>An international financial facility aimed at supporting member countries during times of economic crises that would serve as an alternative to funding from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>

<p><strong>BRICS GRAIN TRADE EXCHANGE</strong></p>

<p>The proposal calls for the establishment of a trading platform for grain and other major commodities, with an associated pricing agency that will provide price data and market analytics. Currently, international prices for major commodities are set on Western bourses.</p>

<p><strong>COOPERATION ON CREDIT RATINGS</strong></p>

<p>Better communication and experience-sharing between the member countries' credit rating agencies, with the use of artificial intelligence to help eliminate human bias. This measure would shield BRICS markets from a pullout by Western credit rating agencies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli delegations taking part in the major Euronaval defence show in France next month will not be permitted to set up any stand or exhibit hardware following a decision by the French government, organisers said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The decision comes as tensions are rising between Israel and France following comments by President Emmanuel Macron criticising the civilian casualties in the Israeli campaigns against Shiite group Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The French leader last week insisted that stopping the export of weapons used by Israel in both operations was the only way to halt the two conflicts.</p>

<p>"The French government informed Euronaval of its decision to approve the participation of Israeli delegations at Euronaval 2024, without any stand or exhibition of equipment," said the organisers of the show which is due to start on November 4 in Paris.</p>

<p>Euronaval, a biennial event that attracts naval defence exhibitors from around the world, said seven Israeli companies are affected by the decision.</p>

<p>"In accordance with the French government's decision, Israeli companies and citizens who wish to attend will be welcomed at the show under the conditions listed above," it added.</p>

<p>At the end of May, the presence of Israeli defence manufacturers at the Eurosatory land defence and security exhibition was banned by the government, before finally being authorised by the French courts.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Wednesday denounced a "victory plan" presented by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying he was trying to push NATO into a direct conflict with Moscow.</p>

<p>In his speech, Zelensky called on his allies to take urgent steps to bolster Kyiv at a precarious moment in a bid to end the conflict with Russia next year.</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters the plan Zelensky unveiled to his parliament would lead to disaster for the Ukrainian people.</p>

<p>"He is pushing NATO into direct conflict with our country," Zakharova said, adding that Zelensky could not rely on his Western partners.</p>

<p>"I can simply tell Zelensky if he is not aware... The partners of the Kyiv regime have already demonstrated how they see Ukraine in the security architecture: they see Ukraine in a coffin and Ukrainian citizens in the grave as well."</p>

<p>Russia has long accused the West of exploiting Ukraine to wage a proxy war against Moscow. The United States and its NATO allies say they are helping Ukraine defend itself against an unjustified colonial-style land grab.</p>

<p>Zakharova recalled a warning by President Vladimir Putin last month that the West would be fighting Russia directly if it allowed Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western-supplied long-range missiles.</p>

<p>Putin warned at the time that Moscow would be forced to take unspecified "appropriate measures" in such a scenario.</p>

<p>Zakharova said Zelensky therefore knew "perfectly well" what his appeals to NATO would lead to.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday that it was too early to comment in detail on the Zelensky plan but that Kyiv needed to "sober up" and realise the futility of the policies it was pursuing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A road rage incident in North Carolina turned deadly when a 75-year-old man fatally shot another man on Saturday evening. According to witnesses, Terrell Eugene Giddens allegedly shot 40-year-old Jeffrey Michael Guida with a rifle after the two men pulled over and got out of their vehicles during a traffic dispute, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/north-carolina-father-40-killed-in-front-of-his-3-young-kids-during-road-rage-dispute-with-elderly-man-75/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giddens also reportedly fired at Mr Guida's car, which had Guida's three children - aged 13, 11, and 2 - inside. Fortunately, the children were unharmed, as confirmed by the Catawba County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-woman-32-arrested-for-allegedly-chopping-mother-into-pieces-and-cooking-body-parts-6802729">Also Read|&nbsp;US Woman, 32, Arrested For Allegedly Chopping Mother Into Pieces And Cooking Body Parts</a></p>

<p>"It certainly could have been worse if the children were injured or killed," Catawba County Sheriff's Office Capt. Aaron Turk told WBTV.</p>

<p>Giddens was arrested and now faces charges of murder and three counts of first-degree attempted murder. Witnesses said the altercation took place at the intersection of Island Point Road and North View Harbour Drive in Catawba, NC, roughly an hour outside of Charlotte.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived at the scene around 5 p.m., they found Mr Guida dead, but Giddens was not present. Investigators used witness accounts and a description of Giddens and his vehicle to locate him at his home on Island Point Road, where he was taken into custody.</p>

<p>Friends and family have since created a small memorial for Mr Guida at the location where he was killed.</p>

<p>"It's unbelievable, isn't it? That something like that could happen right here in my neighbourhood," neighbour Dennis Couch told WBTV.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holding his teddy bear, Gazan mother Asmaa al-Wasifi mourned her 10-year-old son, who was killed in an Israeli strike before he could take his second polio shot.</p>

<p>The United Nations began the second round of its polio campaign in central areas of the enclave on Monday, though many Gazans said the effort was futile given the ongoing Israeli campaign to crush Hamas.</p>

<p>"The time for second vaccine was here, but the (Israeli) occupation did not let them live to continue their lives and their childhood," said Asmaa, crying as she went through her son's clothes and school books.</p>

<p>Yamen, along with four of his cousins - the oldest of whom was 10 - were killed when Israel hit their family home on September 24 in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.</p>

<p>The children had received their first polio vaccines three weeks earlier in a UN campaign that prompted rare daily pauses of fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in pre-specified areas.</p>

<p>The campaign began after a baby was partially paralysed by the type-2 polio virus in August, in the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>Yamen's grandmother Zakeya, who lost at least 10 of her family members, called for the war that has ravaged the tiny enclave of 2.3 million people for more than a year to end.</p>

<p>"We don't want any drinks or any aid. We want them to give us safety and security - for the war to end," she said.</p>

<p>Efforts to secure a ceasefire so far have faltered, with Israel and Hamas unable to agree on key demands.</p>

<p>Her son Osama, 35, said his wife's body was unrecognisable after the strike that also killed their four children.</p>

<p>The children had just had fresh haircuts to get ready for school, he added.</p>

<p>"They were happy like butterflies... Ten minutes later, the targeting happened. I found them all in pieces," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British photojournalist was tragically stabbed to death on a hiking trail in California, with his teenage son now facing charges for the murder, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/crime/paul-lowe-stabbing-son-california-hiking-b2630064.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paul Lowe, an award-winning photographer known for documenting conflicts like the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war, was found dead on October 12 in the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>

<p>The 61-year-old had suffered a fatal stab wound to the neck, according to records from the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://local.nixle.com/alert/11266773/"><em>Los Angeles County Medical Examiner</em></a>.</p>

<p>His 19-year-old son, Emir Lowe, was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder, authorities confirmed.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department stated, "The District Attorney's office filed one count of murder against suspect Emir Lowe for the murder of his father, Christian Paul Lowe. There is no additional information at this time."</p>

<p>Emir Lowe is charged with one count of murder and is scheduled to appear in court for the first time on Wednesday at the West Covina Courthouse, according to police.</p>

<p>The incident reportedly occurred around 3:28 p.m. on Mount Baldy Road, near Stoddard Canyon Falls. Authorities responded to a call about an assault with a deadly weapon and found a "white male adult suffering trauma to his upper torso."</p>

<p>Paul Lowe was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency responders.</p>

<p>The sheriff's department added that a man fitting the suspect's description was seen leaving the scene in a vehicle, which later crashed a few miles away. The individual was detained for further investigation.</p>

<p><em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/warstudies/status/1846226458726830450">King's College London</a>,</em> where Paul Lowe was a visiting professor in war studies, expressed their condolences, stating that the esteemed photojournalist would be "deeply missed."</p>

<p>"Paul was a Visiting Professor in the Department of War Studies, a Professor of Photojournalism at the University of the Arts London, and an award-winning photojournalist with VII Academy. A friend, colleague and collaborator whose work had a huge impact in shining a spotlight on the Siege of Sarajevo and addressing its legacy, we were privileged to work with him on several projects related to art and reconciliation.</p>

<p>"His boundless energy, warmth, creativity, initiative and enthusiasm were contagious and uniquely inspiring. He will be deeply missed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking about the challenges faced in the region, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in his address at the SCO Summit in Islamabad today made a veiled reference about China and Pakistan.</p>

<p>The foreign minister said, "If trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate, if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address," adding that "It is only when we reaffirm our commitment most sincerely to the Charter that we can fully realise the benefits of cooperation and integration that it envisages."</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's remarks come at a time where relations both with China and Pakistan are severely strained due to issues of terrorism from Pakistan and military standoffs with China along the Line of Actual Control.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/if-good-neighbourliness-is-missing-s-jaishankars-veiled-dig-at-china-pakistan-6803601" target="_blank">Ties between India and Pakistan</a> have gone into a deep-freeze as India has made it clear that dialogue can happen only in an atmosphere "free of terror" and that the ball is now in Pakistan's court for them to end the scourge of terrorism. As for China, ties have diminished to the very minimum after Beijing's multiple unilateral actions along the Line of Actual Control over the last few years. There can be no cooperation when there is no trust, and that is what Mr Jaishankar highlighted in his subtle, yet clearly evident reference to the two neighbours.</p>

<p>Addressing all the delegates at the key regional summit being held in Islamabad, Mr Jaishankar also said that "Cooperation must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. It should recognise territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas. It cannot progress if we cherry-pick global practices, especially of trade and transit."</p>

<h2><strong>'THE 3 EVILS - TERRORISM, EXTREMISM, SEPARATISM'</strong></h2>

<p>Speaking about the "three evils" that plague our world, Mr Jaishankar said, "But most of all, our endeavours will progress only when our commitment to the Charter remains firm. It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the 'three evils'. If activities across borders are characterised by terrorism, extremism and separatism, they are hardly likely to encourage trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges in parallel."</p>

<p>Giving a glimpse of how the region would be if the these evils were addressed and countered successfully, Mr Jaishankar said, "Let us contemplate how much we all stand to gain if it was to be otherwise. Our very agenda today in Islamabad gives us a glimpse of those possibilities. Industrial cooperation can enhance competitiveness and expand labour markets. MSME collaboration has positive implications for employment. Our collective endeavours can expand resources and encourage investment flows. Business communities will profit through larger networks. Collaborative connectivity can create new efficiencies. The world of logistics, as indeed of energy, could undergo a sea change. Environmental protection and climate action are ready domains for mutually beneficial exchanges. The treatment of infectious and non-infectious diseases will benefit from accessible and affordable pharmaceutical capabilities. Whether it is health, food or energy security, we are all clearly better off working together. Indeed, even culture, education and sports are promising areas. In effect, there is so much that we can do once we are truly determined to promote that synergy."</p>

<h3><strong>'GLOBALISATION IN A MULTI-POLAR WORLD'</strong></h3>

<p>The foreign minister further emphasised that "This is not just an endeavor for our own benefit. We all realise that the world is moving towards multi-polarity. Globalisation and rebalancing are realities that cannot be denied. Cumulatively, they have created many new opportunities in terms of trade, investment, connectivity, energy flows and other forms of collaboration. There is no question that our region would benefit immensely if we take this forward. Not just that, others too would draw their own inspiration and lessons from such efforts."</p>

<p>Speaking about cooperation and collective consideration among SCO member states, Mr Jaishankar said, "It is imperative that we now renew our resolve to attain the objectives of the SCO. That means recognizing the current constraints on our cooperation and focusing on the pathway forward. It can surely happen when we develop and implement an agenda that is firmly based on an agreed mutuality of interests. To do that, it is equally essential that we abide by the do's and don'ts so clearly articulated by the Charter."</p>

<h3><strong>'DIFFICULT TIME IN WORLD AFFAIRS'</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about the hurdles and challenges faced by most countries in today's globalised-world, especially arising out of the two major conflicts - Israel's conflict with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, and the Russia-Ukraine war, Mr Jaishankar said "We meet at a difficult time in world affairs. Two major conflicts are underway, each with its own global repercussions. The Covid pandemic has left many in the developing world deeply devastated. Disruptions of various kinds - ranging from extreme climate events to supply chain uncertainties and financial volatility - are impacting growth and development. Debt is a serious concern, even as the world falls behind in achieving SDG targets. Technology holds great promise, as well as raising a new host of concerns. How should the members of the SCO respond to these challenges?"</p>

<p>The answers, he said, "lie in the Charter of our organization. And I urge you to reflect on Article 1 that spells out the goals and tasks of the SCO. Let me summarize it for our collective consideration. The objective is to strengthen mutual trust, friendship and good neighbourliness. It is to develop multi-faceted cooperation, especially of a regional nature. It is to be a positive force in terms of balanced growth, integration and conflict prevention. The Charter was equally clear what the key challenges were. And these were primarily three, that the SCO was committed to combatting: one, terrorism; two, separatism; and three, extremism."</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, whose visit to Islamabad for the SCO Summit was little over 24 hours, congratulated Pakistan for Islamabad's Presidency of the SCO Council of Heads of Government forum this year. He added that "India has extended its full support for a (Islamabad's) successful presidency (of the forum)."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An influencer in Taiwan who touted herself as a "caring" mother of five has been accused of abusing and killing a 2-year-old boy under her care. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, the woman, identified by her surname Sung, allegedly killed a toddler after repeatedly abusing him for a week. She was previously a parenting expert with nearly 9,000 followers on Facebook. The woman had been posting loving photos of her and her five children, and sharing her experiences as a parent. So, the boy's father was convinced by her posts and sent his son under her care in February, paying her $930 a month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in June, the little boy vomited and lost consciousness after being beaten during a bath. At the time, Sung rushed him to the hospital, where he was declared dead from serious injuries. Forensic examinations later revealed 15 old and new injuries on the boy, including seven caused by club and shoehorn. The 2-year-old had also suffered skull fractures and a brain haemorrhage, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3281981/caring-taiwan-kol-mother-5-accused-beating-and-killing-toddler-under-her-care" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>, Sung, who had been bringing up her children on her own, got a home care licence in 2022 but cancelled it in March. The boy's father then registered with the government for Sung to continue looking after his son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sung allegedly abused the boy for a week before his death because he refused to eat his meals by himself and was not tidy enough. A surveillance camera installed at her home recorded her crime. Authorities said that the woman constantly beat the boy on the head with a shoehorn, knocked him against a wall and threw him into the bathtub, which eventually caused his death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sung has been charged with injuring and killing a child. She faces a minimum of 10 years in jail and a maximum of life imprisonment. Kaohsiung Social Affairs Bureau said they had sent her five children to their relatives and would carry out home visits regularly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, users discovered that in 2016, Sung posted that she felt "painful about news of child abuse" and denounced parents abusing their own children. "What were you thinking, abusing other people's child in front of your five kids? How could you abuse a kid while writing all those parenting posts?" said one post on her Facebook page.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian man who survived 66 days adrift at sea in a small inflatable boat on Wednesday spoke from his hospital bed about his ordeal.</p>

<p>Mikhail Pichugin, 46, was rescued by a fishing boat Monday off the coast of the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, more than two months after he set off on a boat trip with his brother and 15-year-old nephew, both of whom died aboard.</p>

<p>Taken to a hospital in the city of Magadan, Pichugin was well enough to speak briefly to journalists Wednesday, lying in a hospital bed.</p>

<p>Looking pale with red-rimmed eyes but not emaciated, he gave a few details of how he managed to survive in the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>

<p>"With God's help, how else? If a boat called Angel saved me," he said, smiling, referring to the name of the fishing boat whose crew spotted him.</p>

<p>"I collected rainwater," he said. He also credited a sleeping bag filled with camel hair for helping him survive.</p>

<p>"It's wet, it doesn't get dry but you crawl under it, you wriggle around a bit and you get warm."</p>

<p>"I had no choice. I have my mother at home, my daughter," he added on his motivation to live.</p>

<p>Magadan deputy governor Tatiana Savchenko said his condition was "satisfactory".</p>

<p>She said the administration would pay for Pichugin to fly home and for relatives to visit.</p>

<p>Pichugin comes from Ulan-Ude in Siberia but was working on the far eastern island of Sakhalin as a driver.</p>

<p>He set off from the coast of the Khabarovsk region on August 9 with his visiting brother Sergei, 49, and nephew Ilya, 15, on a crossing to Sakhalin meant to take a few hours.</p>

<p>When they failed to arrive, Russian rescuers surveyed the area by helicopter and plane, suspecting the boat had drifted towards Kamchatka, but found nothing and the search was eventually called off.</p>

<p>The boat was found around 1,000 kilometres (670 miles) from its starting point.</p>

<p>Pichugin may have survived because of his portly 100-kilogramme (220 pounds) stature, according to his wife. Russian television reported he weighed only 50kg when found on Monday.</p>

<p>His wife Yekaterina told RIA Novosti news agency: "It's a kind of miracle". She said the men had taken enough food and water to last only two weeks.</p>

<p>Transport investigators have launched a probe into possible breaches of safety rules, raising the prospect that Pichugin could face a criminal charge and risk a jail term of up to seven years.</p>

<p>Russian television reported the men should have taken a satellite phone, the only means of communication in the Sea of Okhotsk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday unveiled his long-awaited Victory Plan to end Russia's invasion, rejecting any territorial concessions and urging ramped-up Western backing, including an invitation to join NATO.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday unveiled his long-awaited Victory Plan to end Russia's invasion, rejecting any territorial concessions and urging ramped-up Western backing, including an invitation to join NATO.</p>

<p>After pushing back Russian troops at the start of the invasion in February 2022, Kyiv is now facing mounting pressure to find an exit strategy as its troops suffer battlefield losses and Moscow intensifies its strikes on infrastructure.</p>

<p>Russia has seized around a fifth of Ukraine's territory since the invasion began, reducing towns and cities to rubble and killing thousands of civilians.</p>

<p>But in his address to lawmakers in Kyiv on Wednesday, the 46-year-old leader ruled out the possibility that Ukraine could cede some territory to secure peace and also dismissed any pause in the conflict.</p>

<p>"Russia must lose the war against Ukraine. And this does not mean a freeze (in fighting) and it does not mean any trade in Ukraine's territory or sovereignty," Zelensky said in his speech to lawmakers, flanked by European Union and Ukrainian flags.</p>

<p>The number one priority in the five-part so-called Victory Plan, the Ukrainian leader said, was closer integration with the US-led NATO defence alliance.</p>

<p>"The first point is an invitation to NATO, now," Zelensky said, claiming that Moscow had been undermining security in Europe for decades because Kyiv was not a member.</p>

<p><strong>Kremlin derides 'futile' plan</strong></p>

<p>Zelensky also said that his country's Western allies should lift restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons so Kyiv can target Russian military sites on occupied Ukrainian territory and also within Russia.</p>

<p>The Kremlin immediately dismissed Zelensky's roadmap to end the grinding conflict, describing it as "some ephemeral peace plan".</p>

<p>"The only peace plan there can be is for the Kyiv regime to realise the futility of the policy it is pursuing and understand the need to sober up," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>Russia has demanded Kyiv abandon territory it already controls in the east and south of Ukraine as a precondition for peace talks.</p>

<p>The Russian military announced during Zelensky's address to lawmakers that its forces had captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, where its forces are steadily advancing.</p>

<p>The ministry said the villages of Nevske and Krasnyi Yar had been "liberated", publishing a video of destroyed buildings in Nevske with Russian flags flying from two of them.</p>

<p><strong>'Coalition of criminals'</strong></p>

<p>In his address, Zelensky criticised China, Iran and North Korea for their support for Moscow, renewing accusations that Pyongyang was sending its citizens to work in Russian factories and fight alongside Russian forces.</p>

<p>"The coalition of criminals along with Putin already includes North Korea," Zelensky told lawmakers. "Everyone sees the Iranian regime's assistance to Putin, and also China's cooperation with Russia."</p>

<p>Kyiv has dismissed any rival plans to end the war, including those put forward by Brazil and China, saying they lack guarantees for Ukraine's security or the war-battered country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p>Unlike Zelensky's "Peace Formula," an agenda that stipulates Russia must withdraw all its troops from Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders, the Ukrainian leader had until Wednesday given few details about his "Victory Plan."</p>

<p>He visited European leaders last week in a bid to promote the plan and secure as much aid as possible, as future backing from Washington hinges on the outcome of presidential elections next month.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, he said he had discussed a secret annex to the "Victory Plan" with the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Germany to deploy on Ukrainian territory a "non-nuclear strategic deterrence package" that would discourage future Russian attacks after the war.</p>

<p>He also said he would present his Victory Plan in full at an EU summit on Thursday, urging more Western support and an invitation to NATO.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are the five main points of a Ukrainian plan for victory against Russian invading forces no later than next year as outlined by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. Another three points were secret, he said, as he unveiled the plan in a speech at Ukraine's parliament:</p>

<p><strong>NATO INVITE</strong></p>

<p>Ukraine needs an unconditional invitation to join the NATO military alliance now, he said.</p>

<p>"We understand that NATO membership is a matter of the future, not the present. But (Russian President Vladimir) Putin can see that his geopolitical calculations are headed for defeat," Zelenskiy said.</p>

<p><strong>BEEF UP UKRAINE'S DEFENCE CAPABILITIES</strong></p>

<p>He said Ukraine's ability to defend itself had to be "irreversibly strengthened" and laid out a number of ways to do this.</p>

<p>They included further arming Ukraine and strengthening its defence industry, boosting air defence capabilities, removing restrictions on weapon use and a continuation of Ukrainian military operations on Russian soil.</p>

<p><strong>DETERRENCE</strong></p>

<p>Zelenskiy said Ukraine's western allies should deter Russia from any further aggression by showing Moscow that this would have consequences.</p>

<p>"Ukraine proposes to place on its soil a comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package that will be sufficient to protect Ukraine from any military threat from Russia," he said.</p>

<p>He said there was also a secret addendum to this part of the plan, and did not go into further detail on what the proposed deterrence involved.</p>

<p><strong>STRATEGIC ECONOMIC POTENTIAL</strong></p>

<p>Zelenskiy proposed that Ukraine sign an agreement with the U.S., EU and other unnamed allies that would allow for joint investments and use of Ukraine's natural resources, which Zelenskiy said were worth trillions of dollars.</p>

<p>"These include, in particular, uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite and other strategically valuable resources that will strengthen either Russia and its allies or Ukraine and the democratic world in global competition," he said.</p>

<p><strong>UKRAINE STRENGTHENING NATO</strong></p>

<p>Zelenskiy proposed that after the war, Ukraine's armed forces could be used to enhance the security of NATO, and replace some of the U.S. forces currently stationed in Europe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

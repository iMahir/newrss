       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">When Pavel Durov arrived in France on his private jet last Saturday, he was greeted by police who promptly arrested him. As the founder of the direct messaging platform Telegram, he was accused of facilitating the widespread crimes committed on it.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The following day, a French judge extended Durov's initial period of detention, allowing police to detain him for up to 96 hours.</p>

<p>Telegram has rejected the allegations against Durov. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ne8r1yy0o">In a statement, the company said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The case may have far-reaching international implications, not just for Telegram but for other global technology giants as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is Pavel Durov?</strong></h3>

<p>Born in Russia in 1984, Pavel Durov also has French citizenship. This might explain why he felt free to travel despite his app's role in <a href="https://time.com/6158437/telegram-russia-ukraine-information-war/">the Russia-Ukraine War</a> and its widespread use by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27007298?seq=1">extremist groups</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13530">criminals more generally</a>.</p>

<p>Durov started an earlier social media site, VKontakte, in 2006, which remains very popular in Russia. However, a dispute with how the new owners of the site were operating led to him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/02/founder-pavel-durov-leaves-russian-social-network-site-vkontakte">leaving the company in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>It was shortly before this that Durov created Telegram. This platform provides both the means for communication and exchange as well as the protection of encryption that makes crimes harder to track and tackle than ever before. But that same protection also enables people to resist authoritarian governments that seek to prevent dissent or protest.</p>

<p>Durov also has connections with famed tech figures Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and enjoys broad support in the vocally libertarian tech community. But his platform is no stranger to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1933562">legal challenges</a> – even in his birth country.</p>

<p>An odd target</p>

<p>Pavel Durov is in some ways an odd target for French authorities.</p>

<p>Meta's WhatsApp messenger app is also encrypted and boasts three times as many users, while X's provocations for hate speech and other problematic content are <a href="https://www.isi.edu/news/55932/new-twitter-now-with-more-hate/">unrepentantly public and increasingly widespread</a>.</p>

<p>There is also no suggestion that Durov himself was engaged with making any illegal content. Instead, he is accused of indirectly facilitating illegal content by maintaining the app in the first place.</p>

<p>However, Durov's unique background might go some way to suggest why he was taken in.</p>

<p>Unlike other major tech players, he lacks US citizenship. He hails from a country with a <a href="https://theconversation.com/kremlin-tightens-control-over-russians-online-lives-threatening-domestic-freedoms-and-the-global-internet-182020">chequered past of internet activity</a> – and a diminished diplomatic standing globally thanks to its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>His app is large enough to be a global presence. But simultaneously it is not large enough to have the limitless legal resources of major players such as Meta.</p>

<p>Combined, these factors make him a more accessible target to test the enforcement of expanding regulatory frameworks.</p>

<h3><strong>A question of moderation</strong></h3>

<p>Durov's arrest marks another act in the often confusing and contradictory negotiation of how much responsibility platforms shoulder for the content on their sites.</p>

<p>These platforms, which include direct messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp but also broader services such as those offered by Meta's Facebook and Musk's X, operate across the globe.</p>

<p>As such, they contend with a wide variety of legal environments.</p>

<p>This means any restriction put on a platform ultimately affects its services <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Regulating+Platforms-p-9781509537082">everywhere in the world</a> – complicating and frequently preventing regulation.</p>

<p>On one side, there is a push to either hold the platforms responsible for illegal content or to provide details on the users who post it.</p>

<p>In Russia, Telegram itself was under pressure to provide names of protesters organising through its app to protest the war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Conversely, freedom of speech advocates have fought against users being banned from platforms. Meanwhile, political commentators cry foul of being “censored” for their political views.</p>

<p>These contradictions make regulation difficult to craft, while the platforms' global nature makes enforcement a daunting challenge. This challenge tends to play in platforms' favour, as they can exercise a relatively strong sense of platform sovereignty in how they decide to operate and develop.</p>

<p>However, these complications can obscure the ways platforms can operate directly as deliberate influencers of public opinion and even publishers of their own content.</p>

<p>To take one example, both Google and Facebook took advantage of their central place in the information economy to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14614448231166057">advertise politically orientated content</a> to resist the development and implementation of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code.</p>

<p>The platforms' construction also directly influences what content can appear and what content is recommended – and hate speech can mark <a href="https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.790571095083969">an opportunity</a> for clicks and screen time.</p>

<p>Now, pressure is increasing to hold platforms responsible for how they moderate their users and content. In Europe, recent regulations such as <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19014/media-freedom-act-a-new-bill-to-protect-eu-journalists-and-press-freedom">the Media Freedom Act</a> aim to prevent platforms from arbitrarily deleting or banning news producers and their content, while the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-impact-platforms">Digital Services Act</a> requires that these platforms provide mechanisms for removing illegal material.</p>

<p>Australia has its own Online Safety Act to prevent harm through platforms, though the recent case involving X reveals that its capacity <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/05/x-elon-musk-vs-australia-esafety-commissioner-wakeley-church-stabbing-footage">may be quite limited</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Future implications</strong></h3>

<p>Durov is currently only being detained, and it remains to be seen what, if anything, will happen to him in the coming days.</p>

<p>But if he is charged and successfully prosecuted, it could lay the groundwork for France to take wider actions against not only tech platforms, but also their owners. It could also embolden nations around the world – in the West and beyond – to undertake their own investigations.</p>

<p>In turn, it may also make tech platforms think far more seriously about the criminal content they host.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a letter to the US Congress, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has alleged that the US government under Joe Biden "repeatedly pressured" Meta to censor certain content on its platforms.</p>

<p>In the letter addressed to US House of Representatives, Mr Zuckerberg said that the platform had to make some changes, that "with the benefit of hindsight and new information," they won't make today. He added that he regrets not being "more outspoken" about it.</p>

<p>"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree. Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure. I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it," the letter read.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said he felt that Meta should not compromise its content standards due to pressure from any Administration. "We're ready to push back if something like this happens again," he said.</p>

<p>The Meta CEO also spoke of a FBI warning about a "potential Russian disinformation operation about the Biden family and Burisma in the lead up to the 2020 election."</p>

<p>"That fall, when we saw a New York Post story reporting on corruption allegations involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's family, we sent that story to fact-checkers for review and temporarily demoted it while waiting for a reply. It's since been made clear that the reporting was not Russian disinformation, and in retrospect, we shouldn't have demoted the story. We've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again for instance, we no longer temporarily demote things in the US while waiting for fact-checkers," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg reiterated his support for the electoral infrastructure ahead of the presidential elections in November. He spoke of he made to strengthen the infrastructure in a non-partisan way. "I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other. My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Texas judge on Monday ordered a temporary pause on a policy that would streamline the process for spouses of US citizens to obtain legal status in the country, a blow to one of US President Joe Biden's biggest immigration reform policies.</p>

<p>Judge J. Campbell Barker granted a 14-day administrative stay in a case brought by the Republican attorneys general of 16 US states challenging the Biden administration's policy.</p>

<p>In June, Biden announced the new policy, which streamlined a pathway to citizenship for an estimated half a million immigrants married to US nationals.</p>

<p>The 16 states bringing the lawsuit, however, say the policy is costing them millions of dollars in public services -- including healthcare, education and law enforcement -- used by the immigrants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date," Judge Barker wrote in his order.</p>

<p>"This is just the first step. We are going to keep fighting for Texas, our country, and the rule of law," said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose state is party to the case, in a post on X after the order.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has been struggling to address immigration, a hugely divisive issue for many Americans ahead of November's presidential election, which will see Vice President Kamala Harris take on Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party is walking a fine line of seeking to be tougher on illegal migrants while also introducing reforms to the country's inefficient immigration system.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign for the White House has centred on portraying the United States as under assault by what he calls a migrant "invasion."</p>

<p>The new rules would streamline the process for those who already qualify for permanent residence by removing a requirement that they leave the country as part of the application process.</p>

<p>The rules applied to those present in the country for at least 10 years and married to a US citizen before June 17, 2024, and also applied to an estimated 50,000 stepchildren of US citizens.</p>

<p>Those approved would be granted work authorization and the right to stay in the United States for up to three years while they apply for a green card, which is a pathway to full citizenship.</p>

<p>Monday's ruling suspends the granting of this "parole in place" status, but does not halt the Department of Homeland Security from continuing to accept applications for the status.</p>

<p>Barker wrote that the court did not "express any ultimate conclusions about the success or likely success" of the plaintiffs' case while the stay was in place.</p>

<p>The court announced an expedited hearing schedule in the case, but Barker noted that the two-week stay would likely be extended while proceedings are underway.</p>

<p>"The court thus expects that good cause may exist to extend this administrative stay for additional periods through mid-October," the order read.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has reportedly announced that employees at his social media company X (formerly Twitter) will receive their stock options based on their contributions. In an email sent to staff, reported by <em>The Verge</em>, Mr Musk told employees that the company would reward stock options based on employee impact and that workers would need to submit a one-page summary of their contributions to X to get them. Notably, this decision has reportedly created further tension among employees following recently reported delays in promotions and concerns about layoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Citing sources, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226830/elon-musk-email-x-twitter-stock-grants" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Verge</em></a> also reported that X employees were still waiting for their annual equity refresher, which was expected in April. The billionaire had assured X staff that they could regularly cash out stock, similar to SpaceX staff, according to two employees. However, he has not yet followed through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last stock refresh for X employees was in October 2023, valuing the company at $19 billion - significantly less than the $44 billion Mr Musk paid for it. Employees reportedly received RSUs at a share price of $45 during this refresh, the outlet said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 in a $44 billion deal. He laid off almost half the employees shortly after his takeover of the company and sent a hardcore ultimatum to the remaining staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, this controversial ultimatum to employees also resulted in a legal victory for a former X worker. An<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musks-x-ordered-to-pay-rs-5-crore-to-employee-fired-for-not-responding-to-billionaires-email-6353219"> Irish court </a>ordered the microblogging platform to pay over $602,640 (approximately Rs 5 crore) to Gary Rooney, who was fired in December 2022 after Mr Musk's takeover of the company. Mr Rooney held a senior procurement role at the time of his dismissal. He had been employed by X since September 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Also Read |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/us-school-assignment-asking-students-if-god-is-real-sparks-uproar-online-6425679">US School Assignment Asking Students If God Is Real Sparks Uproar Online</a></strong></p>

<p>Ireland's Workplace Relations Commission held Mr Rooney had been unfairly dismissed in 2022 and ordered X to pay him a huge amount - the largest sum the agency has ever awarded. The Commission heard that X maintained that the employee had resigned voluntarily after he failed to tick a box committing to new unspecified working arrangements in an email from the company's new owner Elon Musk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the Irish Workplace Relations Commission refused to buy this argument and ruled that not clicking "yes" in response to the email did not constitute an act of resignation. "It is not OK for Mr. Musk, or indeed any large company to treat employees in such a manner in this country or jurisdiction. The record award reflects the seriousness and the gravity of the case," the complainant's solicitor Barry Kenny said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple will host its fall event on Sept. 9 at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, according to an invite on Monday, where it will likely unveil a series of new iPhones and updates to other devices and apps.</p>

<p>The upcoming launches are crucial for Apple as it looks to reverse a global sales slowdown, particularly in China, and lay out its artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.</p>

<p>At its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella "Apple Intelligence", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.</p>

<p>However, these features will be available only on the latest Apple devices and will be rolled out gradually starting later this year.</p>

<p>Apple faces increasing pressure from competitors such as Samsung and Alphabet's Google, who have recently announced AI functionality alongside their new Galaxy and Pixel smartphones, respectively.</p>

<p>While Apple's event invite teases "It's Glowtime," no further details have been provided. The company typically announces new iPhones and watches at the fall event, its biggest product showcase every year.</p>

<p>In recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.</p>

<p>Apple has said its third-quarter sales were better than expected on the back of iPhone 15, its latest series, which is set to receive the new AI features. Overall sales in China dropped more than expected at 6.5%, pressured by Chinese smartphone brands, chiefly Huawei.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nvidia stock has gained 3,776% since the start of 2019 as the company benefits from selling the main chip necessary for artificial intelligence work, minting many new multimillionaires in the process.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's a summer day in Santa Clara, California, and an assortment of luxury cars - Porsches, Corvettes, Lamborghinis - take up parking spots previously occupied by humbler models. Some have new paint jobs in the lime green from Nvidia Corp.'s logo. And they are stuck where their owners want to be: at the office.</p>

<p>Nvidia stock has gained 3,776% since the start of 2019 as the company benefits from selling the main chip necessary for artificial intelligence work, minting many new multimillionaires in the process. But the work hours are just as gruelling and high-stress, current and former employees said, leaving little time for the jet-setting, homebuying and leisure many can now afford. A culture problem is brewing, said the 10 people, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old chipmaker has piled on market cap faster than any other company in history. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has established expectations of scrappiness and overworking, with a chaotic structure where one manager can have dozens of direct reports, the current and former employees said. Rather than firing employees like his competitors, Huang has said he prefers to "torture them into greatness."&nbsp;</p>

<p>One former employee, who worked in technical support for enterprise clients, said he was expected to work 7 days a week, often until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. He said many of his former colleagues, especially those on engineering teams, worked longer hours. He described the environment as a pressure cooker, noting several company meetings he characterized as yelling fights - but said the pay package made it hard to leave. He left in May and requested anonymity to speak frankly about the company.</p>

<p>Another, who worked in marketing until 2022 and requested anonymity to protect her career, said she often attended 7 to 10 meetings per day, each with more than 30 people involved, often punctuated by bouts of fighting and shouting. But she said she put up with it for two years, because of the "golden handcuffs" - the opportunity for even more wealth.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Nvidia declined to comment.</strong></h3>

<p>Nvidia hasn't had any trouble keeping its employees in recent years, in part because its stock grants typically vest - or become available - over a four-year period, giving workers incentive to stay to earn their whole pay package. In 2023, 5.3% of employees left the company, but after its valuation topped $1 trillion, that same turnover rate dropped by nearly half, to 2.7%, according to its 2024 sustainability report. The overall semiconductor industry's turnover rate is much higher, at 17.7%, according to Nvidia.</p>

<p>The tech industry trope of "resting and vesting" is so common it was ridiculed by Hollywood in HBO's "Silicon Valley" show with a character who squanders away his time playing video games and drinking big sodas waiting for his stock to vest. But it doesn't work at Nvidia. One current employee said it would be embarrassing and even socially difficult to coast.</p>

<p>Those who tried have become the subject of internal critique. During a staff meeting late last year employees complained to Huang that some of their colleagues were in "semiretirement" mode, according to a former employee who attended the meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those who have been at the company for close to a decade would have more than enough money to retire, according to a former engineering employee who left the company in June. Many don't, though, because there are millions more waiting when the next stock grant vests, the person added.</p>

<p>The explosive stock rally also means that many Nvidia employees are sitting on bigger nest eggs than peers at other chipmakers. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress, who joined the company 11 years ago, owns stock worth about $758.7 million. Her Intel Corp. counterpart Dave Zinsner, who has a larger pay package but has a shorter tenure, owns stock worth just $3.13 million. At Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Nvidia's nearest rival, which has also seen rapid share growth, CFO Jean Hu, who joined in 2023, owns stock worth $6.43 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former engineering employee who asked not to be named said that, throughout 2023 and 2024, working at Nvidia meant encountering frequent expressions of wealth among employees of virtually all seniority levels. He said he regularly saw coworkers surfing Zillow and alluding to new vacation homes in casual conversation. He added that it's become common for employees to attend big-ticket sporting events like the Super Bowl and the NBA Finals.</p>

<h3><strong>How to Turn a Camry Into Two Lamborghinis</strong></h3>

<p>Nvidia staff who put money into purchase plan have big budgets<br />
"It's just always very surprising how much money they have in one stock," said Spencer Hsu, a real estate agent based in Palo Alto, California, who has worked with multiple Nvidia employees this year - on nights and weekends, of course. The clients are making 40% to 60% down payments on multimillion-dollar homes.</p>

<p>Conversations about Nvidia's daily market gain or loss (but usually gain) can be heard in hushed tones at lunchtime, according to several of the recently departed employees. A current Nvidia product manager said that thousands of employees are on a company Slack channel dedicated to exchanging personal finance advice. The group is catered toward employees who have held onto their vested shares - not the many others who sold off much of their stock long before its peak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not just about the money. Airan Junior, who was at the chipmaker from 2020 to 2023, said that "working at Nvidia is like Disneyland" because of the many teams solving interesting technical problems. He worked on a sales team based out of Brazil, and said the company's culture, however unconventional, contributed to its massive success. Nvidia now accounts for more than 90 percent of sales in the AI chip market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huang, who has 60 direct reports, has no time for bureaucracy, detailed PowerPoint presentations or one-on-one meetings. He'll involve himself in seemingly minor decisions, such as the choice of a photo for a marketing campaign. Huang is well known for making Nvidia employees send a regular email to a centralized email address with a bulleted list of five things they're working on. Huang sometimes responds to these emails directly to ask for more details or dole out directives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huang has said his approach to leadership has been shaped by facing "real adversity" running Nvidia for more than three decades. He tells employees that he's pushing them to do their life's work. "It should be like that," Huang said of his demanding management style in a recent 60 Minutes interview. "If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn't be easy."</p>

<p>Most employees appear to approve of Huang's unusual leadership style. His approval rating on Glassdoor is 97%, higher than his peers at Alphabet Inc. (94%), Apple Inc. (87%), Meta Platforms Inc. (66%) and Amazon.com Inc. (54%).</p>

<p>But the ex-marketing employee warned that Huang's flat corporate structure sometimes works differently than intended. She said that in her experience, because of the company's structure, people are incentivized to fight for Huang's attention rather than work together toward Nvidia's long-term success. The same structure applies to those far below Huang - the former technical support employee said his supervisor had more than 100 people directly reporting to him. At a certain point, with a certain amount of money, the stress starts to lose its appeal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech giant Apple on Monday named insider Kevan Parekh as its chief financial officer, replacing company veteran Luca Maestri who will transition from the role on Jan. 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The leadership change comes ahead of Apple's multiple product launch this fall season, which analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone.</p>

<p>It includes artificial intelligence features, which are crucial for Apple as it looks to reverse a slowdown in global sales, particularly in China, and better compete with rivals who have rolled out AI upgrades.</p>

<p>Parekh, who has been with Apple for more than a decade and will join the company's executive committee, most recently served as vice president of financial planning and analysis.</p>

<p>"It appears that the transition to the new CFO is planned and orderly, which is the most important question. Maestri staying on with Apple is also very important, as it removes the risk of financial questions," D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.</p>

<p>"(Parekh) will need to continue the prudent capital management, but may also be tasked with restarting Apple's exploration of complimentary acquisitions."</p>

<p>Before Apple, Parekh held senior leadership roles at Thomson Reuters and General Motors.</p>

<p>Apple said Maestri will continue to lead the corporate services teams, including information systems and technology, information security and real estate and development, reporting to CEO Tim Cook.</p>

<p>During Maestri's tenure, Apple more than doubled its revenue, with services revenue growing more than five times.</p>

<p>"Apple filling the role with an internal candidate should make the transition a bit smoother... any change of this magnitude does create some level of uncertainty, especially given the consistency and the history of execution from Maestri," Piper Sandler analysts said in a note.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Apple said its third-quarter iPhone sales were better than expected and forecast more gains as it bets on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, even as its overall China business disappointed.</p>

<p>In recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.</p>

<p>At its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella "Apple Intelligence", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker's shares were last down nearly 1% in extended trading.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday ocean temperatures are rising in the Pacific Islands at three times the rate worldwide, and its population was "uniquely exposed" to the impact of rising sea levels.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday ocean temperatures are rising in the Pacific Islands at three times the rate worldwide, and its population was "uniquely exposed" to the impact of rising sea levels.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters in Tonga where the Pacific Islands Forum is being held, Guterres highlighted the findings of a report that showed the South West Pacific was worst hit by sea level rises, in some places by more than double the global average in the past 30 years.</p>

<p>"I am in Tonga to issue a global SOS – Save Our Seas – on rising sea levels," he said.</p>

<p>"Rising seas are amplifying the frequency and severity of storm surges and coastal flooding. These floods swamp coastal communities. Ruin fisheries. Damage crops. Contaminate fresh water. All this puts Pacific Island nations in grave danger," he said.</p>

<p>Water expands as it warms, contributing to sea level rise, he said.</p>

<p>Climate change and security are dominating discussions at the week-long annual leaders meeting, where the 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum span atoll nations threatened by sea level rise such as host Tonga, and one of the world's biggest exporters of coal, Australia.</p>

<p>Asked by a reporter about Australia's export of fossil fuels, Guterres said fossil fuels must be phased out globally, although "the situation in different countries is different" and there would be different ways to do this.</p>

<p>The report released on Tuesday by the World Meteorological Organization showed ocean temperatures in the South West Pacific are increasing at up to three times the rate worldwide.</p>

<p>"Pacific islands are uniquely exposed. This is a region with an average elevation just one to two metres above sea level," Guterres said.</p>

<p>"Half the infrastructure is within 500 metres of the sea," he added.</p>

<p>Without cuts to global emissions, the Pacific Islands can expect additional sea level rise of 15 cm (5.9 inches) by 2050 and 30 days a year of coastal flooding, he said.</p>

<p>He called for global leaders to "massively boost climate adaptation investments" in vulnerable countries.</p>

<p>A "loss and damage" fund to help poor nations cope with costly climate disasters was approved at last year's U.N. climate summit, after years of lobbying by groups including the Pacific Islands, but the challenge remains to attract significant contributions to the fund from wealthier nations.</p>

<p>"Developed countries must deliver on their finance commitments – including the commitment to double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion a year by 2025," Guterres said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Special counsel Jack Smith is arguing to revive his office's classified documents case against former President Donald Trump in the first formal filing since the criminal case was dismissed last month by Judge Aileen Cannon.</p>

<p>In a brief filed with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Monday, Smith argued that Cannon's decision to end the Trump case because the prosecutors' office lacked constitutional authority was "novel" and "lack[ed] merit."</p>

<p>Cannon had ruled the Justice Department didn't have the ability to appoint or fund special counsels like Smith.</p>

<p>Smith's team also cast the decision from Cannon as not just affecting other special counsel prosecutions - of which there are several ongoing in other courts, against Trump and Hunter Biden, among others - but also as potentially affecting the power of leaders across the federal government, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>"If the Attorney General lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the Department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office, other than the few that are specifically identified by statute," Smith's office wrote in the 81-page filing.</p>

<p>"The district court's rationale would likewise raise questions about hundreds of appointments throughout the Executive Branch, including in the Departments of Defence, State, Treasury, and Labor," the prosecutors added.</p>

<p>Trump was charged last summer with several counts of mishandling sensitive government documents taken from his White House at the end of the presidency. The Republican presidential nominee also faces several obstruction charges for alleged efforts to hinder the federal probe into the materials.</p>

<p>The former president and his two co-defendants - Trump employees also accused of obstruction - have pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>The 11th Circuit is reviewing the determinations by Cannon that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional and that his office was being unlawfully funded, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>Notably, though other courts have upheld the use of special counsels, Cannon said that Congress had not given the Justice Department the authority to make such an appointment, while also concluding that the funding for Smith's office had not been properly appropriated by lawmakers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sea level rises in the Pacific Ocean are outstripping the global average, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report showed on Tuesday, imperiling low-lying island states.</p>

<p>Globally, sea level advances are accelerating as higher temperatures driven by the continued burning of fossil fuels melt once-mighty ice sheets, while warmer oceans cause water molecules to expand.</p>

<p>But even compared to the global average rate rise of 3.4 millimetres a year over the past three decades, the WMO report showed that the average annual increase was "significantly higher" in two measurement areas of the Pacific, north and east of Australia.</p>

<p>"Human activities have weakened the capacity of the ocean to sustain and protect us and – through sea level rise – are transforming a lifelong friend into a growing threat," said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo in a statement to coincide with the release of the regional State of the Climate report 2023 at a forum in Tonga.</p>

<p>Already, such rises have brought a surge in the frequency of coastal flooding since 1980, with dozens of instances happening in islands like the Cook Islands and French Polynesia which previously reported just a handful of such cases annually.</p>

<p>Such events are sometimes caused by tropical cyclones which scientists think could also be intensifying due to climate change, as sea surface temperatures climb.</p>

<p>Over 34 hazards like storms and floods were reported in the Pacific region in 2023, resulting in more than 200 deaths, the WMO report said, adding that only a third of small island developing states had early warning systems.</p>

<p>A WMO spokesperson said that the impact of rising water levels on Pacific islands was disproportionately high since their average elevation is just a meter or two (3.3 to 6.5 feet) above sea level.</p>

<p>To raise awareness of the dangers, Tuvalu's foreign minister gave a speech to the U.N. climate conference in 2021 while standing knee-deep in seawater, making global headlines.</p>

<p>But the WMO report said further rises across the planet would "continue for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss from ice sheets".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian military launched a massive strike on Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure facilities, the Russian Defence Ministry said.</p>

<p>"This morning, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air and sea-based weapons, striking unmanned aerial vehicles at critical energy infrastructure facilities that ensured the operation of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine. All the assigned targets were hit," it said on Monday in a statement.</p>

<p>The Ministry added that two electronic warfare stations and four field ammunition depots were destroyed over the past 24 hours, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday on Telegram that Russia launched more than 100 missiles of various types and about 100 drones, calling it "one of the largest attacks -- a combined strike".</p>

<p>Zelensky said the attack had caused extensive damage to the energy sector, but facilities are currently being restored.</p>

<p>Ukraine's government-run Ukrinform news agency said that explosions struck the Ukrainian capital, the cities of Dnipro, Kropyvnytsky, Vinnytsia and Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine and the eastern city of Kharkiv.</p>

<p>According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia fired at Ukraine several groups of combat drones and cruise missiles.</p>

<p>Eleven Russian Tu-95MC strategic bombers and six Tu-22M3 long-range supersonic bombers were airborne during the attack.</p>

<p>Ukrainians had been expecting a major Russian missile attack for some time. The US Embassy issued a warning last week of an elevated risk of attack around Ukrainian Independence Day, which Ukraine marked on Saturday.</p>

<p>Nearly 15 missiles and 15 drones targeting the capital of Kyiv were downed, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, wrote on Telegram. Both Russia and Ukraine deny deliberately targeting civilians.</p>

<p>Each says its attacks are aimed at destroying infrastructure critical to the other's war effort.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Former US congresswoman, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 announced her endorsement of former President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential polls in November, The Hill reported.</p>

<p>Gabbard, who has become a regular presence in conservative media, announced a National Guard Association gathering in Michigan where Trump was also speaking.</p>

<p>"This administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts in regions around the world, and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before," Gabbard said.</p>

<p>"This is one of the main reasons why I am committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can once again serve us as our commander-in-chief," she added.</p>

<p>Notably, Gabbard ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign in the Democratic primary in 2020. After ending her bid, she exited Congress, left the Democratic Party and appeared at events like the Conservative Political Action Conference, The Hill reported.</p>

<p>The former congresswoman has huddled with Trump in recent weeks as part of preparations for next month's scheduled debate between Trump and Vice President Harris.</p>

<p>Arguably the most notable moment of Gabbard's unsuccessful 2020 White House bid was when she attacked Vice President Harris on the debate stage over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard's endorsement comes days after Robert F Kennedy Jr suspended his independent White House bid and backed Trump, which the former president's campaign touted as a significant development in battleground states.</p>

<p>This comes days after the New York Times reported that Trump has brought in Tulsi Gabbard to help sharpen his attacks in the debate against Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Gabbard reportedly joined Trump's practice session at the latter's private club and home, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are set to face off in the ABC News debate on September 10.</p>

<p>Notably, Gabbard brings some key qualities to Trump's role: She's a woman, at a moment when Trump is for a second time facing a woman as his general election rival; she's a former House member, giving her policy experience; and, perhaps most importantly for Trump, she has been on a debate stage with Harris and delivered a stinging attack against her record as a prosecutor, New York Times reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States continues to assess that the threat of attack against Israel by Iran and its proxy groups still exists, the Pentagon said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States continues to assess that the threat of attack against Israel by Iran and its proxy groups still exists, the Pentagon said on Monday, after Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander.</p>

<p>"I would point you to some of the public comments that have been made by Iranian leaders and others... we continue to assess that there is a threat of attack," Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters.</p>

<p>Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said earlier that Iran's aggressive activities towards Israel had never been higher, adding Israel and the U.S. must be prepared to prevent the Islamic Republic from gaining nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Gallant was meeting with top U.S. military officer General C.Q. Brown, who is on a trip to the region aimed at preventing Israel's war with the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza from engulfing the region.</p>

<p>In one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare, Israel on Sunday struck Iran's Lebanon-based proxy Hezbollah with around 100 jets in what it said was a pre-emptive strike aimed at thwarting a much larger attack.</p>

<p>Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also met with the Israeli military's Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi.</p>

<p>"We are very determined to continue degrading Hezbollah's capabilities, eliminating more commanders. We are not stopping. Our mission is to return the residents of the north to their homes in safety," Halevi told Brown.</p>

<p>With three deaths confirmed in Lebanon and one in Israel following Sunday's missile exchange, both sides indicated they were happy to avoid further escalation for now, but warned that there could be more strikes to come.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Monday trashed reports in Bangladesh that the opening of the Farakka barrage in West Bengal is causing floods in some areas in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>"We have seen fake videos, rumours and fear-mongering to create misunderstanding. This should be firmly countered with facts," External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>He said relevant data is shared with joint river commission officials concerned in Bangladesh on a regular and timely basis, and it was done this time as well.</p>

<p>"We have seen media reports of the opening of Farakka barrage gates that will allow the flow of over 11 lakh cusecs of water downstream of the river in its natural course into the Ganga/Padma river," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>"This is a normal seasonal development that takes place due to increased inflow from heavy rainfall in the Ganga river basin catchment areas upstream," he said.</p>

<p>The MEA spokesperson was responding to media queries on the matter.</p>

<p>"It is to be understood that Farakka is only a barrage and not a dam. Whenever the water level reaches the pond level, whatever inflow comes that passes," he said.</p>

<p>"It is merely a structure to divert 40,000 cusecs of water into the Farakka canal that is carefully done using a system of gates on the main Ganga/Padma river, while the balance water flows into the main river to Bangladesh," Jaiswal added.</p>

<p>Last week too, India described as factually incorrect reports in Bangladesh that the flood situation in certain parts of the country has been caused by the opening of a dam on the Gumti river in Tripura.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said floods on the common rivers between the two countries are a "shared" problem inflicting suffering on people on both sides and requires close mutual cooperation towards resolving it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada is reducing by tens of thousands the number of temporary foreign workers it brings in, reversing some expansions to the program it made in 2022 as the government struggles to bring down numbers of temporary residents.</p>

<p>The temporary foreign worker program brings non-Canadians to the country to work on a short-term basis. Meant to fill labor shortages, it has grown dramatically and has come under fire for suppressing wages and leaving workers vulnerable to abuse, in part because of permits that tie workers to employers.</p>

<p>A UN special rapporteur called it "a breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his cabinet is also considering reductions to permanent resident streams. Trudeau has been lagging in polls ahead of an election expected next year as a growing share of Canadians say Canada is bringing in too many immigrants.</p>

<p>"We're looking at the various streams to make sure that as we move forward, Canada remains a place that is positive in its support for immigration, but also responsible in the way we integrate and make sure there's pathways to success for everyone who comes to Canada," Trudeau told reporters Monday.</p>

<p>He said the government will present a broader plan on immigration levels this fall.</p>

<p>Canada has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers but its government is under pressure to reduce the number of temporary residents, which has grown dramatically in recent years.</p>

<p>The government has pledged more measures to reduce the temporary resident population to 5% of Canada's total population in three years. Its share was 6.8% in April and the Bank of Canada has said it expected that number to rise.</p>

<p>Changes announced Monday would end low-wage temporary foreign workers in communities with unemployment at 6% or higher, reduce the share of employers' workforces that can be low-wage temporary foreign workers to 10% and reduce the length of a low-wage temporary foreign worker permit to one year from two.</p>

<p>The changes exempt certain sectors including agriculture, food processing, construction and healthcare.</p>

<p>Combined with changes from earlier this year, the measures are expected to reduce the number of temporary foreign workers by about 65,000, Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault told reporters Monday.</p>

<p>The changes were "a great first step, but it's only a first step" said economist and Smart Prosperity Institute senior director Mike Moffatt, who called for the low-wage stream to be abolished.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Emmanuel Macron on Monday denied any political link to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov as the tech tycoon spent a second day in French custody following his surprise arrest at a Paris airport.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Emmanuel Macron on Monday denied any political link to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov as the tech tycoon spent a second day in French custody following his surprise arrest at a Paris airport.</p>

<p>Numerous questions have been raised about the timing and circumstances of Durov's detention.</p>

<p>Sources close to the case said Durov is accused of failing to curb the spread of illegal content on Telegram, which has over 900 million users. The company has dismissed the accusations.</p>

<p>Born in Soviet times into a family of academics in Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg, Durov spent his childhood in Italy before building up Russia's then-biggest social network VKontakte (VK) in his early 20s. He set up Telegram after leaving Russia a decade ago and Forbes magazine estimates his current fortune at $15.5 billion.</p>

<p>Writing on the X social media platform that he was addressing "false information" concerning the case, Macron said Durov's arrest "took place as part of an ongoing judicial investigation."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to rule on the matter," he wrote in a highly unusual comment on a legal case.</p>

<p>Durov, 39, holds a French passport in addition to his Russian nationality.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Nothing to hide' -</strong></p>

<p>An investigating magistrate extended Durov's detention on Sunday, &nbsp;according to a source close to the investigation. The initial detention for questioning can last up to 96 hours.</p>

<p>When this period ends, the magistrate can either free Durov or press charges and remand him in custody.</p>

<p>Durov, who has been based in Dubai in recent years, arrived in Paris from the Azerbaijani capital Baku, and was planning to have dinner in the French capital, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a bodyguard and a personal assistant who always travelled with him, added the source, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>One key question is why Durov flew into France when he would have likely been aware he was wanted in the country. "Perhaps he had a feeling of impunity," said a source close to the case, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Baku on a state visit to Azerbaijan on August 18 and 19 but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that the pair had met.</p>

<p>Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, &nbsp;issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, another source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Telegram said in response that "Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe."</p>

<p>"Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards," it added.</p>

<p>"It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for the abuse of that platform."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Enforce the law' -</strong></p>

<p>Telegram has positioned itself as a "neutral" alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also plays a key role since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, used actively by politicians and commentators on both sides of the war.</p>

<p>But critics accuse it of hosting often illegal content ranging from extreme sexual imagery to disinformation and also narcotics services.</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Peskov said Moscow had received no information from France on why Durov was detained, saying "we do not know concretely what Durov is accused of".</p>

<p>Elon Musk, who leads the Tesla car group and X, formerly Twitter, posted the hashtag #FreePavel on his platform and commented in French, "Liberte Liberte! Liberte?" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).</p>

<p>Macron said that while France is "deeply committed to freedom of expression and communication" such freedoms are "upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life".</p>

<p>"It is up to the judiciary, in full independence, to enforce the law," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris clashed on Monday over next month's U.S. presidential debate, with the vice president's team seeking a return to open microphones while her Republican rival threatened to pull out entirely, suggesting the previously agreed-upon ABC network was biased.</p>

<p>"Why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?" Trump, who is making his third bid for the White House, wrote in a social media post late Sunday night that also accused the network of bias. "Stay tuned!!!"</p>

<p>Harris spokesperson Brian Fallon said on Monday the vice president's campaign wanted the broadcaster to keep the candidates' microphones on throughout the event, not muted when their opponent was speaking as in the last presidential debate. So-called "hot mics" can help or hurt political candidates, catching off-hand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public.</p>

<p>"The Vice President is ready to deal with Trump's constant lies and interruptions in real-time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button," Fallon said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement they had already agreed to the same terms as CNN's June debate, which had muted microphones, adding: "We said no changes to the agreed-upon rules."</p>

<p>But Trump later told reporters that he preferred to have his microphone kept on, adding that he did not like it muted last time and that he was not preparing much for the face-off against his new rival.</p>

<p>"Doesn't matter to me. I'd rather have it, probably, on. But the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time," Trump said.</p>

<p>"I'm not spending a lot of time on it. I think my whole life I've been preparing for a debate," Trump added. "You can't cram knowledge into your head, for you know, 30 years of knowledge in one week. So, you know, there's a little debate prep, but I've always done it more or less the same way."</p>

<p>Representatives for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Harris secured the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden stepped aside last month, and had said they would do the Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News previously agreed to by Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>Biden had pushed for earlier debates, hoping to boost his campaign and cast a brighter light on Trump. But his own halting performance at the June 27 face-off triggered alarm within his party, with him ending his reelection bid weeks later.</p>

<p>Trump had floated another debate hosted by Fox News on Sept. 4, which he later said would be a televised town hall with just himself and host Sean Hannity. The Harris campaign said no.</p>

<p>The vice presidential candidates, Republican U.S. Senator JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, are scheduled to debate Oct. 1 on CBS News.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran carried out on Monday a rare public execution of a man over the murder of a lawyer two years ago, state media reported.</p>

<p>"The death sentence against the murderer of a lawyer was carried out this morning in public in Shahroud city" of the northern Semnan province, the judiciary's Mizan Online website said.</p>

<p>The official IRNA news agency said the man was a 20-year-old who confessed to having been hired by a gang to kill the lawyer, without providing further details.</p>

<p>Monday's execution was carried out in accordance with the Islamic Sharia law of "retribution".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public executions are relatively rare in Iran, where almost all capital punishments are carried out inside prisons, usually by hanging.</p>

<p>Iran executes more people per year than any other nation except China, according to rights groups including Amnesty International.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, authorities in central Iran executed a male fortune-teller for raping and sexually assaulting his clients.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim government chief Muhammad Yunus on Monday met the country's Hindu community leaders and vowed to promote interfaith harmony as he hosted a reception for them coinciding with Janmashtami.</p>

<p>The minority Hindu population has faced vandalisation of their business and properties and devastation of Hindu temples in the students' violence that ensued for days following the ouster of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India on August 5.</p>

<p>During the meeting, Mr Yunus said he wants to build a Bangladesh where everyone can practice their faith without any fear and where no temple needs to be guarded.</p>

<p>"Our responsibility is to establish the rights of every citizen. Our job is to ensure justice for every citizen," he told a group of Hindu leaders at the State Guest Jamuna in the capital.</p>

<p>"There can't be any divisions among people in our country. We are equal citizens. The interim government is determined to protect the rights of every citizen of the country," Mr Yunus was quoted as saying by the official BSS news agency.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh is a large family where the responsibility of the government is to protect the rights of every citizen," his office quoted him as saying on X.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad president Bashudeb Dhar, Ramkrishna Mission of Dhaka's principal Swami Purnatmananda Maharaj, and Hindu community leaders including Kajol Debnath and Monindra Kumar Nath were present during the meeting.</p>

<p>"We spoke with Professor Yunus for almost an hour and he said all Bangladeshis are members of a single family. We will eliminate any sense of communalism," Dhar told PTI.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus greeted the country's Hindu community leaders and promised to promote interfaith harmony, the statement said.</p>

<p>The CA office statement said the Hindu leaders greeted Mr Yunus on the auspicious occasion, saying they sought blessings of the Lord Sri Krishna for the harmony and prosperity of the nation and the interim government.</p>

<p>"Hindu leaders praised the Chief Adviser's recent comments at the Dhakeshwari Mandir, a sacred temple in Old Dhaka, saying it would help build a non-communal society in the country and ensure religious harmony in the society," the statement read.</p>

<p>During the meeting, they raised the issue of "Hindu property grabbing, including the land of Hindu temples".</p>

<p>The meeting between Mr Yunus and the Hindu leaders came as tens of thousands of Hindus celebrated Janmashtami by rallying at the famous Dhakeshwari Temple and other temples and Hindu monasteries by singing Vedic hymns, kirtans and bhajans.</p>

<p>Janmashtami is a public holiday in Bangladesh to mark the birth celebration of Lord Krishna.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After an escalation of hostilities Sunday amid over 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement, here are the major eruptions of violence since their 2006 war.</p>

<p>The devastating month-long war in the summer of 2006 cost Lebanon more than 1,200 lives, mostly civilians, while some 160 Israelis were killed, mostly soldiers.</p>

<p>The following years saw sporadic attacks, which surged following the October 7 attack by Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/10-key-moments-in-israel-hamas-war-6240607" target="_blank">Israel.</a></p>

<h3><strong>2007-2013: rocket fire and incursion</strong></h3>

<p>On June 17, 2007, two rockets were fired into northern Israel from Lebanon hitting an industrial zone in the border town of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-israel-to-evacuate-over-20-000-residents-of-town-near-lebanon-border-4499426" target="_blank">Kiryat Shmona</a> without causing casualties. Hezbollah denies responsibility.</p>

<p>In early August 2010, a move by Israeli troops to uproot trees in a disputed border area at Adaysseh sparks a deadly border battle in which two Lebanese soldiers and a journalist are killed along with a senior Israeli officer.</p>

<p>On August 7, 2013, four Israeli soldiers on patrol were wounded in a blast claimed by Hezbollah 400 metres (yards) inside Lebanese territory.</p>

<h3><strong>2014-2015: Israeli strikes</strong></h3>

<p>On February 26, 2014, Hezbollah says Israeli warplanes had carried out an air raid on one of its positions at Lebanon's border with Syria.</p>

<p>On October 7, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-missile-exchange-how-israel-vs-hezbollah-unfolded-in-the-skies-6414952" target="_blank">Israel </a>strikes two Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon in response to its bomb attack against Israeli troops on the ceasefire line on the Shebaa hills between the two countries that wounded two soldiers.</p>

<p>On January 28, 2015, two Israeli soldiers are killed in a Hezbollah ambush in the Shebaa hills.</p>

<p>The attack is carried out in retaliation for a raid blamed on Israel 10 days earlier on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, which killed at least six members of Hezbollah and an Iranian general.</p>

<p>In retaliation, Israeli tanks and artillery bombarded several villages in southern Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>2019: drones and missiles strikes</strong></h3>

<p>On August 25, 2019, two explosive-laden drones hit the southern Beirut suburbs, causing material damage according to Hezbollah, which blames the attack on Israel.</p>

<p>The day before, an Israeli air strike in Syria had killed two Hezbollah members.</p>

<p>On September 1, the Israeli army and Hezbollah traded missile fire along the border.</p>

<h3><strong>2021: uptick in clashes</strong></h3>

<p>On August 4, 2021, three rockets were fired from Lebanon, of which two fell in Israel. The Israeli army responds with air strikes on southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>On August 6, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2021-and-2023-blasts-near-israel-embassy-share-chilling-similarities-4762886" target="_blank">Hezbollah</a> fires more than 10 rockets at Israel, which responds with artillery fire.</p>

<h3><strong>2023-2024: October 7 attacks aftermath</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has traded almost daily cross-border fire with Israel since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>In southern Lebanon, a Reuters video journalist was killed on October 13, and six other journalists from AFP, Reuters and Al Jazeera were wounded in a strike by an Israeli tank.</p>

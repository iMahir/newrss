       <description><![CDATA[Acoustic waves coming out of the black hole at the heart of the Perseus cluster of galaxies were transposed up 57 and 58 octaves in order to make them audible for human ears.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US space agency NASA has recorded an eerie audio clip that captures sound waves coming out of a supermassive black hole situated 250 million light years away. The acoustic waves, coming out of the black hole located at the heart of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, were transposed up 57 and 58 octaves to make them audible for human ears.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The audio was released in 2022 and it was the first time when the sound waves were extracted and made audible.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sound waves do exist in space, even though we might not be able to hear them naturally.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a surprising discovery in 2003, astronomers detected acoustic waves rippling out through the huge amounts of gas surrounding the supermassive black hole at the Perseus galaxy cluster, which is now popular for its eerie wails.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioR5np1fmEc?si=j_mmSoSCwg4vTqYA" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p dir="ltr">It is difficult to hear them at their current pitch as it includes the lowest note ever detected in the universe by humans – much below the limits of human hearing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">NASA's recent sonification has majorly amplified these sound waves, in order to get a sense of how they would sound like while ringing through the intergalactic space.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The lowest note, which was identified in 2003, is a B-flat and is located over 57 octaves below middle C, the report said, adding that its frequency is 10 million years at that pitch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is to be noted that the lowest note that can be detected by human ears has a frequency of one-twentieth of a second.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After being extracted radically from the supermassive black hole, these sound waves were played in an anti-clockwise direction from the center.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This was done to make them audible in all directions from the supermassive black hole at the enhanced pitches of 144 quadrillion and 288 quadrillion higher then their original frequency.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Like several other waves recorded from space, the result for this one was eerie too.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The tenuous gas and plasma, which drifts between the galaxies, in clusters known as the 'intracluster medium' is denser and much hotter than the intergalactic medium outside it. As the temperatures help to regulate&nbsp;star formation, hence sound waves could play a pivotal role in galaxy clusters' evolution over longer periods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Rinson Jose, an Indian emigrant to Norway, has been linked to the Hezbollah pager blasts in Lebanon, which killed 12 people. Reports have suggested that Norta Global, a Bulgaria-based company owned by him, had a role in supplying the pagers.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Born in Kerala's Wayanad, Jose went to Norway to pursue higher studies a few years ago. He briefly worked in London before going back to Oslo.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Relatives told news agency IANS that Jose is settled with his wife in Oslo and has a twin brother based in London. "We speak daily over the phone. However, for the last three days, we have had no contact with Jose. He is a straightforward person and we trust him fully. He will not be part of any wrongdoing. He may have been trapped in these blasts," Thankachen, a relative of the 37-year-old, said on Friday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Jose founded Norta Global Ltd in April 22. The company is based in Bulgaria's Sofia and declared a revenue of $ 725,000 (approximately Rs 6 crore) for consulting activities outside the European Union last year.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>According to his LinkedIn page, he has also worked for almost five years in digital customer support for Norwegian press group DN Media, news agency AFP reported. DN Media told newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been on an overseas work trip since Tuesday and that they have not been able to contact him.</li>
	<li>Bulgarian state security agency DANS said on Friday that the pagers used in the blasts in Lebanon were not imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk-owned social media platform X has named a legal representative in Brazil, the firm's lawyers said on Friday, in a move that would address one of the demands imposed by Brazil's top court to allow the company to operate in the country.</p>

<p>Andre Zonaro and Sergio Rosenthal, who were recently appointed as X's lawyers in Brazil, told Reuters that colleague Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao was chosen as the firm's legal representative, and that they had submitted her name to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Brazilian law requires foreign companies to name a legal representative to operate in the country. The representative would assume the legal responsibilities for the firm locally.</p>

<p>X had a legal representative in Brazil until mid-August, when it decided to close its offices in the country.</p>

<p>In late August, Brazil's top court ordered mobile and internet service providers to block X in the nation, and users were cut off within hours after X did not name a new legal representative.</p>

<p>The move followed a months-long dispute between Musk and Brazilian Justice Alexandre de Moraes over the firm's non-compliance with court orders demanding the platform take action against the spread of hate speech.</p>

<p>Courts have previously blocked accounts implicated in probes of spreading misinformation and hate, which Musk has denounced as censorship.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the lawyers representing X in Brazil said the firm was starting to comply with orders on removing content, another demand from the top court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mark Robinson denied the allegations and called them "tabloid trash".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson allegedly referred to himself as a “Black Nazi,” insulted Martin Luther King Jr, used antisemitic and homophobic slurs, and praised slavery in comments on a pornographic website before entering politics, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum/index.html">according to a CNN report</a>. The CNN investigation connects Robinson to a user named ‘minisoldr' who made the inflammatory remarks.</p>

<p>Robinson, who is also North Carolina's lieutenant governor, denied the allegations and called them “tabloid trash". He told CNN, “This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not anything that is characteristic of me."</p>

<p>The comments, which date back to between 2008 and 2012, were posted on a pornographic website.</p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Among the most aggressive remarks attributed to Mark Robinson, under the username ‘minisoldr,' were statements supporting the reinstatement of slavery and Nazi ideology.</p>

<p>“Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves,” one post read, while another said, “I'm a black NAZI!”.</p>

<p>In another post, Robinson allegedly expressed a preference for Adolf Hitler over US leadership during the Obama administration.</p>

<p>Robinson also allegedly referred to Martin Luther King Jr as a “f***ing commie b***ard” and suggested that if he were in the Ku Klux Klan, he would have called King “Martin Lucifer Koon.”</p>

<p>Robinson denied these allegations in a video posted to his X (formerly Twitter) account, stating that those were not his words. He also claimed that his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Josh Stein, was behind the alleged leak to CNN.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I wanted to take a minute to address the latest outrageous lies coming from my opponent's dishonest campaign: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ncgov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ncgov</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ncpol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ncpol</a> <a href="https://t.co/RtteVUiozr">pic.twitter.com/RtteVUiozr</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Even during an interview with CNN, Robinson rejected any connection to these comments, saying, “I'm not going to get into the minutia of how somebody manufactured this, these salacious tabloid lies.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, CNN identified Robinson was ‘minisoldr' through his email address, biographical references, and unique phrases he had used elsewhere online. Robinson has also reportedly used the ‘minisoldr' username on other websites.</p>

<p>Despite the turmoil, Robinson remains defiant. “We are not getting out of this race. There are people who are counting on us to win this race,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Robinson, who has been endorsed by Trump, is currently trailing his Democratic opponent Josh Stein in the polls. If elected, Robinson would become North Carolina's first Black governor.</p>

<p>Asked about the CNN report about Robinson, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said "President Trump's campaign is focused on winning the White House and saving this country."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe is fighting an uphill battle for a fresh mandate to continue belt-tightening measures that stabilised the economy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cash-strapped Sri Lanka was voting for its next president Saturday in an effective referendum on an unpopular International Monetary Fund austerity plan enacted after the island nation's unprecedented financial crisis. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is fighting an uphill battle for a fresh mandate to continue belt-tightening measures that stabilised the economy and ended months of food, fuel, and medicine shortages. His two years in office restored calm to the streets after civil unrest spurred by the downturn in 2022 saw thousands storm the compound of his predecessor, who promptly fled the country.</p>

<p>"We must continue with reforms to end bankruptcy," Wickremesinghe, 75, said at his final rally in the capital Colombo this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Decide if you want to go back to the period of terror, or progress."</p>

<p>But Wickremesinghe's tax hikes and other measures, imposed per the terms of a $2.9-billion IMF bailout, have left millions struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>"The country needs new leadership," newspaper vendor Sunil, who did not give his surname, told AFP. "We need change."</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe is tipped to lose to one of two formidable challengers including Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, the leader of a once-marginal Marxist party tarnished by its violent past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sri Lanka's crisis has proven an opportunity for the 55-year-old Dissanayaka, who has seen a surge of support based on his pledge to change the island's "corrupt" political culture.</p>

<p>Fellow opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, 57, the son of a former president assassinated in 1993 during the country's decades-long civil war, is also expected to make a strong showing.</p>

<p>"There is a significant number of voters trying to send a strong message... that they are very disappointed with the way this country has been governed," Murtaza Jafferjee of think tank Advocata told AFP.</p>

<p>A total of 39 people are contesting the vote, including one 79-year-old candidate who remains on the ballot despite dying of a heart attack last month.</p>

<h3><strong>'Wild elephants'</strong></h3>

<p>More than 17 million people are eligible to vote in the election, with more than 63,000 police deployed to guard polling booths and counting centres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We also have anti-riot squads on standby in case of any trouble, but so far everything is peaceful," police spokesman Nihal Talduwa said.</p>

<p>"In some areas, we have had to deploy police to ensure polling booths are safe from wild animals, especially wild elephants."</p>

<p>Dozens of people were lining up outside polling stations in Colombo before voting began.</p>

<p>Polls close at 4:00 pm (1030 GMT) with counting to begin on Saturday evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A result is expected on Sunday, but an official outcome could be delayed if the contest is close.</p>

<p>Schools were closed on Friday to be converted to polling stations, which will be staffed by more than 200,000 public servants deployed to conduct the vote.</p>

<h3><strong>'Not out of the woods'</strong></h3>

<p>Economic issues dominated the eight-week campaign, with public anger widespread over the hardships endured since the peak of the crisis two years ago.</p>

<p>Official data showed that Sri Lanka's poverty rate doubled to 25 percent between 2021 and 2022, adding more than 2.5 million people to those already living on less than $3.65 a day.</p>

<p>Experts warn that Sri Lanka's economy is still vulnerable, with payments on the island's $46-billion foreign debt yet to resume since a 2022 government default.</p>

<p>The IMF said reforms enacted by Wickremesinghe's government were beginning to pay off, with growth slowly returning.</p>

<p>"A lot of progress has been made," the IMF's Julie Kozack told reporters in Washington last week.</p>

<p>"But the country is not out of the woods yet."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The name of an Indian emigrant to Norway has cropped up in the investigation into the pager blasts aimed at Hezbollah operatives, which killed 12 people in Lebanon and left thousands injured. Now a Norwegian citizen, Rinson Jose migrated to the country from Wayanad in Kerala and reports had initially suggested that a company owned by the 37-year-old in Bulgaria was involved in the supply of the pagers to the militant group.</p>

<p>Initial investigations had revealed that the pagers, which had reportedly been modified by Mossad to hide three grams of explosives in each device, were manufactured by a Taiwan-based company, Gold Apollo. In a statement, the company said, however, that the pager model used in the blast, AR-924, was actually manufactured and sold by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Hungary's Budapest, which had been authorised to use its trademark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, on Thursday, two days after the pagers exploded, Bulgarian state security agency DANS said it was coordinating with the country's interior ministry and probing the role of a company, whose name was later revealed to be Norta Global Ltd. The company, which was registered in Sofia in 2022, was found to be owned by a Norwegian, Rinson Jose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A day later, on Friday, however, DANS said the pagers used in the blasts in Lebanon were not imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Following verifications, it has been indisputably established that no communication equipment corresponding to those that exploded on September 17 was imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria," the agency was quoted as saying by news agency AFP.</p>

<p>It added that the company and its owner had "not carried out any transactions linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise" or that "fall under laws on terrorism financing".</p>

<p>Police in Norway's Oslo said they have opened a "preliminary investigation into the information that has emerged".</p>

<p><strong>'Went To Norway To Study'</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by news agency IANS, Jose went to Norway to pursue higher studies a few years ago. He briefly worked in London before going back to Oslo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to his LinkedIn page, he has also worked for almost five years in digital customer support for Norwegian press group DN Media, AFP reported. DN Media told newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been on an overseas work trip since Tuesday and that they have not been able to reach him.</p>

<p>Relatives told IANS that Jose is settled with his wife in Oslo and has a twin brother based in London. "We speak daily over the phone. However, for the last three days, we have had no contact with Jose. He is a straightforward person and we trust him fully. He will not be part of any wrongdoing. He may have been trapped in these blasts," Thankachen, a relative of the 37-year-old, told the news agency on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added that they have not been able to contact Jose's wife either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Norta Global, founded by Jose, declared a revenue of $ 725,000 (approximately Rs 6 crore) for consulting activities outside the European Union last year.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The story of Stuxnet's development and deployment began years earlier. The inception of Stuxnet can be traced back to the early 2000s, during a period of heightened tension between Iran and Western nations over Iran's nuclear ambitions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's June, 2009. The streets of Tehran have erupted in protests over the results of a presidential election. The incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has emerged victorious with an overwhelming majority against Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Protesters alleged a fraudulent victory. Among them is a woman named Neda Agha-Soltan, who on her way to join the main protests, parked her car at some distance from the gathering and stepped out as the vehicle's air conditioner was not working. As she breathed in the fresh air, a sniper belonging to a government-funded militia took aim and shot her square in the chest. She was dead.</p>

<p>While this was unfolding in Tehran, around 300 kilometres to the south at the Natanz nuclear facility, the heart of Iran's nuclear program - 'strange' things were happening. Just days after Neda's death, the CIA reportedly received approval to initiate a cyber operation against this facility. The operation involved uploading a sophisticated piece of malware, known as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-stuxnet" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a>, directly onto Iranian hardware. This malware had been in development for years, a collaborative effort between the United States and Israel, and represented the world's first digital weapon.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: The Genesis</strong></h2>

<p>Stuxnet was not a new presence in Iran's nuclear infrastructure; it had been causing disruptions for years. However, this new version was designed to deliver a decisive blow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story of Stuxnet's development and deployment began years earlier. The inception of Stuxnet can be traced back to the early 2000s, during a period of heightened tension between Iran and Western nations over Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Bush administration, concerned about Iran's potential to develop nuclear weapons, sought unconventional methods to impede Tehran's progress. Thus, the covert operation codenamed 'Olympic Games' was born. This initiative, involving close collaboration between the CIA, the NSA, and Israel's Mossad, aimed to create a digital weapon capable of physically disrupting Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities.</p>

<p>Stuxnet was not an ordinary piece of malware. Its design reflected a level of sophistication unprecedented in the realm of cyber weapons. The malware targeted Siemens Step7 software, used to control industrial equipment, specifically focusing on the centrifuges at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility. These centrifuges, essential for enriching uranium, operated at high speeds and required precise control to function correctly.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: The Execution</strong></h2>

<p>The US built a replica of Iran's nuclear facility in its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html" target="_blank">Oak Ridge facility</a> in the state of Tennessee, where they meticulously studied the centrifuges to understand how to sabotage them without detection. In 2007, the first version of Stuxnet was released, targeting these centrifuges by preventing the release of pressure through the valves, causing the uranium gas to solidify and the centrifuges to spin out of control and ultimately self-destruct.</p>

</div>

<p>Iran's nuclear facility was air-gapped, meaning its network was offline, so Stuxnet had to be introduced via an inside agent using a USB drive. The malware operated undetected, using a rootkit to hide its presence and stolen digital certificates to appear as legitimate commands. Despite its effectiveness, initial versions of Stuxnet only slowed Iran's progress, and did not sabotage it entirely.</p>

<p>In response, US researchers developed a more aggressive version of Stuxnet, using four zero-day exploits and stolen private keys to sign its commands. This version could spread rapidly, even across air-gapped networks, and reprogram the centrifuges to destroy themselves while masking the sabotage as hardware malfunctions.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: The Implications</strong></h2>

<p>An insider at Natanz introduced this new version of Stuxnet, and it quickly spread throughout the facility's network. However, its aggressive nature led to unintended consequences: the malware spread beyond Natanz, infecting computers across Iran and eventually the globe. The CIA, realising the uncontrollable spread of Stuxnet, decided to continue with the operation, hoping it would remain undetected within Natanz.</p>

<p>Their hopes were dashed when cybersecurity firm Symantec discovered Stuxnet and published a detailed report on the malware. Iran soon realised the extent of the cyber attack and took measures to protect their nuclear program. Despite the setbacks caused by Stuxnet, Iran vowed to continue its nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>One of the earlier hints of Stuxnet's existence emerged in June 2010 when a Belarusian cybersecurity firm discovered an unusual piece of malware on an Iranian computer. As cybersecurity experts from around the world began analysing the code, they were astounded by its complexity and purpose.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Impact On Iran's Nuclear Program</strong></h2>

<p>Stuxnet's impact on Iran's nuclear program was significant but not immediately catastrophic. By 2009, Iran had installed over 7,000 centrifuges at Natanz, but Stuxnet caused approximately 1,000 of these to fail. The disruptions forced Iran to temporarily halt its enrichment activities and replace the damaged equipment, delaying its nuclear ambitions by several months to years.</p>

<p>The Iranian government, initially oblivious to the cause of the centrifuge failures, eventually recognised the cyber intrusion. Publicly, Iran downplayed the impact of Stuxnet, but internally, it spurred significant investment in cybersecurity measures and the development of offensive cyber capabilities.</p>

<p>Over the following years, targeted assassinations of key Iranian nuclear scientists further crippled their program. Car bombings and other attacks eliminated many of the leaders involved, including the director of the Natanz facility.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: Global Fallout</strong></h2>

<p>Stuxnet did not confine itself to Iran. It spread to other countries, including India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, affecting industrial systems worldwide. In India, several critical infrastructure facilities, &nbsp;reportedly infecting as many as 80,000 computers. Several power plants and manufacturing units were also found to be vulnerable to similar attacks.</p>

<p>In 2013, India adopted the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/National_cyber_security_policy-2013_0.pdf">National Cyber Security Policy</a> which focused on "protection of information infrastructure and preservation of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in cyberspace". The following year, the Centre announced the formation of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.india.gov.in/website-national-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-centre" target="_blank">National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre</a> to further safeguard India's cyber security space.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female official in China has been sentenced to 13 years in prison and fined one million yuan (approximately Rs 1.18 crore) for misconduct. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, Zhong Yang, nicknamed "the beautiful governor" for her looks, served as the governor and deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Qiannan prefecture, Guizhou province. She has been accused of having sexual relations with 58 male subordinates and accepting nearly 60 million yuan in bribes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 52-year-old joined the Communist Party at 22, eventually rising to the rank of deputy in the National People's Congress (NPC). Zhong became known for starting a fruit and agriculture association aimed at helping farmers, as well as spending her own money to support the elderly in need, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/china-personalities/article/3279110/china-official-infamous-keeping-58-staff-members-lovers-amassing-illegal-funds-jailed" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In January, a documentary produced by Guizhou Radio and Television uncovered controversies involving Zhong. It was reported that Ms Zhong accepted bribes and used her position to ensure that companies she favoured received lucrative contracts, under the pretext of government investment. This included approving the development of land in a high-tech industrial estate for a businessman who had a close relationship with her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the documentary, a private business owner claimed that Ms Zhong would neglect companies without personal ties to her. The documentary also revealed that in 2023, the Guizhou Provincial Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee announced that Ms Zhong was suspected of serious disciplinary and legal violations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, the 52-year-old has also been accused of engaging in affairs with 58 male subordinates. Some reportedly chose to be her lover due to the advantages she offered, while others did so reluctantly as they feared her authority. Ms Zhong allegedly spent time with her lovers under the pretext of working overtime and going on business trips.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Zhong was arrested in April 2023. In September, she was removed from office and expelled from the CPC. She also lost her position in the National People's Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the documentary, Ms Zhong said she regrets her actions. "I can't face my former colleagues, family members, or the leaders who have cared for and nurtured me. I am truly ashamed and embarrassed," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 52-year-old added that she had mistakenly believed she needed to cultivate a few trustworthy businessmen to help her handle political issues. She also noted that after she became an official, her parents would prepare a simple dish of vegetables and boiled tofu for her during Chinese New Year. "They told me... that my work and life should be like the dish, clean and pure. I accepted it every year and ate the food, but I didn't take their advice to heart," she said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was reportedly attending a meeting with other commanders when he was killed.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Israeli military said it conducted a "targeted strike" against Aqil, which also killed around 10 other senior Radwan commanders.</li>

	<li>According to reports, Aqil was the second-in-command in the group's military after Fuad Shukr, who was also killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on July 30.</li>
	<li>Like most of Hezbollah's military leadership, little was known about Ibrahim Aqil, whom group members knew only by his nom de guerre Hajj Abdul Qader.</li>
	<li>His Radwan Force spearheaded Hezbollah's ground operations and Israel has repeatedly demanded that its fighters be pushed away from the border.</li>
	<li>Aqil was wanted by the United States for involvement in the 1983 bombing of the US embassy in Beirut.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The US had offered a $7 million reward for information on Aqil, describing him as a "principal member" of an organisation that claimed the 1983 embassy bombing, which killed 63 people.</li>
	<li>According to the US, Aqil was also involved in the hostage-taking of two Germans in the late 1980s and bombings in Paris in 1986.</li>
	<li>In 2015, the US Treasury sanctioned Aqil and Shukr as terrorists, and in 2019, the US State Department branded him a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist".</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Friday, the Israeli military and security sources in Lebanon said, escalating a year-long conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some operations against Hezbollah and Hamas leaders and commanders blamed on Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>HEZBOLLAH:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p><strong>IBRAHIM AQIL</strong></p>

<p>An Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs killed Hezbollah's operations commander Ibrahim Aqil, who serves on the group's top military body, on Sept. 20.</p>

<p>Aqil, who has also used the aliases Tahsin and Abdelqader, is a member of Hezbollah's top military body, the Jihad Council.</p>

<p>The United States accuses him of a role in the Beirut truck bombings that struck the American embassy in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the US Marine barracks six months later which killed 241 people.</p>

<p><strong>FUAD SHUKR</strong></p>

<p>An Israeli strike on the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital on July 30 killed Hezbollah's top commander Fuad Shukr, identified by the Israeli military as the right-hand man of Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Shukr was one of Hezbollah's leading military figures since it was established by Iran's Revolutionary Guards more than four decades ago.</p>

<p>The United States imposed sanctions on Shukr in 2015 and accused him of playing a central role in the 1983 bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 U.S. military personnel.</p>

<p><strong>MOHAMMED NASSER</strong></p>

<p>Mohammed Nasser was killed in an Israeli airstrike on July 3. Israel claimed responsibility, saying he headed a unit responsible for firing from southwestern Lebanon at Israel.</p>

<p>Nasser, a senior commander in Hezbollah, was responsible for a section of Hezbollah's operations at the frontier, according to senior security sources in Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>TALEB ABDALLAH</strong></p>

<p>Senior Hezbollah field commander Abdallah was killed on June 12 in a strike claimed by Israel, which said it had hit a command and control centre in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Security sources in Lebanon said he was Hezbollah's commander for the central region of the southern border strip and was of the same rank as Nasser.</p>

<p>His killing prompted the group to fire a massive barrage of rockets across the border at Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>HAMAS</strong></h3>

<p><strong>MOHAMMED DEIF</strong></p>

<p>Israel's military said Deif was killed after fighter jets struck in the area of Khan Younis in Gaza on July 13 after an intelligence assessment. The elusive Deif had survived seven Israel assassination attempts.</p>

<p>Deif is believed to have been one of the masterminds of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, which triggered the Gaza war. Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p>

<p><strong>ISMAIL HANIYEH</strong></p>

<p>Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the early hours of July 31 in Iran, the Palestinian militant group said.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was killed by a missile that hit him directly in a state guesthouse where he was staying. Israel has not claimed responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>SALEH AL-AROURI &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>An Israeli drone strike on Beirut's southern suburbs of Dahiyeh killed Deputy Hamas chief Saleh al-Arouri on Jan. 2, 2024.</p>

<p>Arouri was also the founder of the Hamas military wing, the Qassam Brigades.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new report has shown that the US Secret Service is responsible for security failures in the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, which led to one death and multiple injuries.</p>

<p>An internal review by the agency revealed on Friday that agents neglected to use technology that could have identified the attacker when he flew a drone over the rally site hours before the incident, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The report highlighted failures by the Secret Service's advance team and its coordination with state and local law enforcement prior to the attack. The Secret Service, responsible for overseeing Trump's security, failed to instruct local police snipers to secure a nearby rooftop.</p>

<p>Former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned amid widespread outrage over the agency's failure to prevent the incident, was previously grilled by multiple lawmakers at a Congressional hearing on why the agency failed to secure the rooftop.</p>

<p>At a news briefing on Friday, Acting Director Ronald Rowe highlighted a "lack of clarity" from the Secret Service in their security planning for Trump's rally.</p>

<p>At the rally, just shortly before shots were fired into the crowd, some people saw the suspect climbing on top of the roof and alerted local police, but Trump's protective detail had no idea police were searching for the suspicious person.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents and local law enforcement operated on different radio frequencies and were stationed in separate locations, which hindered their ability to quickly share information.</p>

<p>"It's important that we hold ourselves accountable for the failures of July 13th, and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again," Rowe said.</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt of Trump in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service allocated additional resources not typically provided to someone in Trump's position.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a man was arrested after a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence at the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida and "engaged" with him. Trump was unharmed in what appears to be the second assassination attempt in about two months.</p>

<p>Just days after the second assassination attempt, the US House of Representatives on Friday unanimously approved a bill that aims to enhance Secret Service protection for the presidential nominees and their respective vice presidential candidates.</p>

<p>The bill would require the Secret Service to "apply the same standards for determining the number of agents required to protect presidents, vice presidents, and major presidential and vice presidential candidates".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Travis King's lawyer said he was later released because of good behavior and time served.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US soldier who crossed into North Korea last year pleaded guilty to desertion as part of a plea agreement Friday and was sentenced to 12 months of confinement, his lawyer said. Because of good behavior and time served, the soldier was released, according to the lawyer.</p>

<p>Travis King was facing 14 charges related to him fleeing across the border from South Korea into the North in July 2023 while on a sightseeing tour of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean Peninsula, and prior incidents.</p>

<p>But he pleaded guilty to just five -- desertion, assault on a noncommissioned officer, and three counts of disobeying an officer -- as part of a deal that was accepted on Friday by a military judge.</p>

<p>"The judge, under the terms of the plea deal, sentenced Travis to one year of confinement, reduction in rank to private (E-1), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge," a statement from King's attorney Franklin Rosenblatt said.</p>

<p>"With time already served and credit for good behavior, Travis is now free and will return home," the statement said.</p>

<p>"Travis King has faced significant challenges throughout his life, including a difficult upbringing, exposure to criminal environments, and struggles with mental health," Rosenblatt said. "All these factors have compounded the hardships he faced in the military."</p>

<p>In a statement, the US Army's Office of Special Trial Counsel confirmed King's guilty plea as part of a deal and said that "pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, all other charges and specifications were dismissed."</p>

<p>"The outcome of today's court martial is a fair and just result that reflects the seriousness of the offenses committed by Pvt. King," prosecutor Major Allyson Montgomery said in the statement.</p>

<p>At the time of the incident, King had been stationed in South Korea, and after a drunken bar fight and a stay in South Korean jail, he was supposed to fly back to Texas to face disciplinary hearings.</p>

<p>Instead of doing so, he walked out of the Seoul-area airport, joined a DMZ sightseeing trip and slipped over the fortified border where he was detained by the communist North's authorities.</p>

<p>Pyongyang had said that King had defected to North Korea to escape "mistreatment and racial discrimination in the US Army."</p>

<p>But after completing its investigation, North Korea "decided to expel" King in September for illegally intruding into its territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some 53 people have been killed and 51 others are missing in Mexico's western Sinaloa state since rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel began clashing on September 9, local authorities said on Friday, with gruesome violence showing no signs of abating. The trigger for the conflict between the two most powerful factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug gang, dates back to July, when legendary trafficker and leader of one of those groupings, Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, was arrested in the United States.</p>

<p>Zambada, 74, alleges that a senior member of the Los Chapitos, another faction of the cartel, kidnapped him and then flew him to the United States against his will.</p>

<p>Since fighting broke out on Sept 9, shootouts have disrupted daily life in the capital, Culiacan, where schools have had to close on some days while restaurants and shops shuttered early.</p>

<p>Sinaloa governor Ruben Rocha Moya on Friday said more than 40 people have been arrested in recent days, while more than 5,000 food packages have been handed out across Sinaloa.</p>

<p>Mexico's military, which has struggled to calm the violence, on Thursday arrested the alleged head of security for Ivan Archivaldo Guzman, the leader of Los Chapitos and son of jailed former Sinaloa kingpin, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.</p>

<p>Fernando Perez Medina, known as "El Piyi", was captured in Culiacan, according to a federal security source.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mexico's Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (Profepa) said it was providing resources to local authorities to feed a tigress tied to a tree. Senior Sinaloan narcos often keep tigers as pet animals.</p>

<p>Profepa said in a statement that vets in Sinaloa had declined to assist due to security fears, and it had provided military officials with a "cage, a dart rifle and darts". But the violence had prevented the military from rescuing it.</p>

<p>Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday said that the United States was partly responsible for the instability because they "carried out this operation", referencing the prior surrender talks between U.S. officials and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the trafficker who kidnapped Zambada.</p>

<p>U.S. officials have privately confirmed that they held talks with Guzman but U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, last month said that American officials were surprised to discover Zambada on U.S. soil.</p>

<p>Salazar added that no U.S. resources or personnel were involved in the July 25 kidnapping of Zambada.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She speaks seven languages, has a PhD in particle physics, an apartment in Budapest plastered with her own pastel drawings of nudes, and a career that took her around Africa and Europe doing humanitarian work.</p>

<p>What Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono, 49, the Italian-Hungarian CEO and owner of Hungary-based BAC Consulting, says she hasn't done is make the exploding pagers that killed 12 people and wounded more than 2,000 in Lebanon this week.</p>

<p>After her company was revealed to have licensed the design for the pagers from their original Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo, Barsony-Arcidiacono told NBC News that she didn't make them.</p>

<p>"I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong," she said.</p>

<p>Since then, she has not appeared in public. Neighbours say they haven't seen her. She did not respond to messages seeking comment. Her flat in a stately old Budapest building, where a door to a vestibule had been open earlier in the week, has been shuttered.</p>

<p>Discussions with acquaintances and former work colleagues paint a picture of a woman with an impressive intellect, but a peripatetic career in a string of short-term jobs in which she never quite settled down, despite embellishing her CV along the way.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of hers, who like others who knew her socially in Budapest asked not to be identified, said she seemed like someone who "could easily be used". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Good-willed, not a business type, more like someone who often tries something new, who quickly believes things and then gets enthusiastic about that," the person said, adding that Barsony-Arcidiacono had been looking for income as she wanted to leave another job.</p>

<h3><strong>'ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES OF MY LIFE'</strong></h3>

<p>Kilian Kleinschmidt, a veteran ex-U.N. humanitarian administrator who hired Barsony-Arcidiacono in 2019 to run a six-month Dutch-funded programme to train Libyans in Tunisia in subjects such as hydroponics, IT and business development, described her as a "bullying" manager, and said he released her before her contract was over.</p>

<p>"Cristiana. That was one of the biggest mistakes of my life, I think," Kleinschmidt told Reuters. "It was simply awful on a personal level... Then at some point I said enough is enough. I should probably have done it sooner. I said that's enough and I sent her home a month early."</p>

<p>Barsony-Arcidiacono has not responded to Reuters calls and emails and there was no answer when Reuters visited her private address in downtown Budapest.</p>

<p>At her Budapest home, a steel outer gate encloses a small vestibule where life drawings of nudes sketched in red and orange pastels can be seen taped up on the wall. An inner door leading into her apartment was ajar when Reuters first visited the building on Wednesday, and closed when the reporter returned on Thursday. No one answered the bell.</p>

<p>A woman living in the building for the past two years said Barsony-Arcidiacono was already a resident when she moved in, and described her as kind, not loud, but communicative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She practiced her drawing as part of a Budapest art club, though she hadn't attended for a couple of years, said the organiser of the group, who said she seemed like more of a businesswoman than an artist but was upbeat and outgoing.</p>

<p>A schoolmate of Barsony-Arcidiacono said she grew up in a family with a working father and housewife mother in Santa Venerina, near Catania in eastern Sicily, and attended high school nearby. He described her as a quite reserved youngster.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s she earned her PhD in physics at University College London, where her dissertation on positrons - a subatomic particle with the mass of an electron and a positive charge - remains available on the UCL website. But she appears to have left without pursuing a scientific career.</p>

<p>"As far as I know she has not done scientific work since then," Akos Torok, a retired physicists who was one of her professors at UCL and published papers with her at the time, told Reuters by email.</p>

<p>A resume she used to get the job working for Kleinschmidt included references to other post-graduate degrees, in politics and development, from the London School of Economics and the School of Oriental and African Studies, which Reuters was not able to verify. She then went on to describe a string of jobs working on NGO projects in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<p>In a separate CV on the BAC Consulting website, she described herself as a "Board Member at the Earth Child Institute", an educational and environmental charity in New York. The group's founder, Donna Goodman, told Reuters Barsony-Arcidiacono had never held any role there.</p>

<p>"She was a friend of a friend of a board member, and contacted us about a job opening" in 2018, Goodman said. "But she was never invited to apply."</p>

<p>That CV also described her as a former "Project Manager" at the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2008-2009, who organised a nuclear research conference. The IAEA said its records indicated she had been an intern there for eight months.</p>

<p>On BAC Consulting's website, which was taken down by the end of this week, the company gave little idea of its actual business in Hungary. Its registered address is a serviced office in a Budapest suburb.</p>

<p>"I am a scientist using my very diverse background to work on interdisciplinary projects for strategic decision-making(water &amp; climate policy, investments)," Barsony-Arcidiacono wrote on her CV.</p>

<p>"With excellent analytical, language, and interpersonal skills, I enjoy working and leading in a multicultural environment where diversity, integrity, and humour are valued."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Israel announced Friday that it killed Ibrahim Aqil, commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, in a precision airstrike on Beirut. The attack targeted a meeting of senior commanders, killing at least 14 people, including 10 high-ranking officials.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Aqil, a senior <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-inside-lebanon-politics-hezbollah-iran-and-a-larger-battle-for-hegemony-6588884" target="_blank">Hezbollah military figure</a> wanted by the United States for his role in the 1983 bombings of the US Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, was hailed by Hezbollah as one of its key leaders. Hezbollah confirmed his death, calling him a "great jihadist leader."</li>
	<li>The United States had placed a $7 million bounty on Aqil for his involvement in the 1983 bombings that killed hundreds of Americans in Lebanon. Aqil was also implicated in the kidnapping of American and European hostages in the 1980s.</li>
	<li>The airstrike, which struck Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut, left significant damage, including a massive crater and a destroyed high-rise building. Rescue workers continued to search the rubble for survivors. &nbsp;In response to the airstrike, Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets at Israeli military positions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Aqil's death marks a serious blow to Hezbollah's leadership, especially as it comes just weeks after the death of Fuad Shukr, another senior Hezbollah commander, in a similar Israeli airstrike. Both men were top figures within Hezbollah's military operations and played key roles in planning attacks against Israel.</li>
	<li>The strike follows two days of explosions earlier in the week, which targeted Hezbollah's communication devices and killed 37 of its members.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Israeli military officials said that Aqil was killed while meeting with other commanders to plan further attacks against Israel, including a potential invasion of northern Israeli territories. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the meeting as part of Hezbollah's "Conquer the Galilee" plan, an operation aimed at infiltrating Israeli communities.</li>
	<li>The United Nations and regional actors expressed concern over the growing escalation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, called for restraint from all sides. The strike has also drawn strong condemnation from Iran, which supports Hezbollah, accusing Israel of broadening the war's geography.</li>
	<li>Iran's foreign ministry denounced the attack as a violation of international law, while Hezbollah vowed retribution. Israel, however, defended the operation as necessary for its national security. Admiral Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, stressed that Israel did not seek a broader conflict but was determined to neutralise threats to its citizens.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged fire almost daily along the Israel-Lebanon border since the Gaza war began in October. The war, sparked by Hamas' deadly attack on Israel on October 7, has drawn Hezbollah into the conflict. Hezbollah has launched rocket attacks into northern Israel, which have intensified in recent weeks.</li>
	<li>Lebanon's Health Ministry reported that the strike killed 14 people and wounded 66 others, and they expect the death count to rise. Local residents have described the bombardment as some of the heaviest in years.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With more than a month to go before the November 5 presidential election, some Americans are already lining up to cast their ballots in this tightly contested race.</p>

<p>Early in-person voting kicked off Friday in the US states of Virginia, South Dakota and Minnesota as voters pick between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"You just feel that we're part of the process," said 56-year-old Tom Kilkenny, who came to a polling station in Arlington, Virginia, where people were lining up before it even opened early in the morning.</p>

<p>His wife Michelle, 55, said she was happy to set a good example for her friends and neighbors by voting early.</p>

<p>"When you... speak with them, I can myself say 'I voted already' and then start spreading the word," said Michelle Kilkenny, whose blue T-shirt was covered in Democratic Party pins.</p>

<p>Each of the country's 50 states has its own voting procedures: early voting by mail or in person, election day voting or a combination of the three.</p>

<p>For some Americans casting their ballot as soon as it becomes possible is a family tradition.</p>

<p>Nick Vucic and his wife Becca brought their three daughters to the polling station in Arlington.</p>

<p>"We want them to be engaged as soon as possible," said Vucic, 38.</p>

<p><strong>- Clashing worldviews -</strong></p>

<p>In Arlington, just across the Potomac River from the US capital, the city center was dotted with Harris and Trump signs and posters. Activists set up information booths, while voters, mostly Democrats, chatted with one another.</p>

<p>Besides electing their next president, voters are also casting ballots in local and state-wide elections.</p>

<p>Following a rollercoaster election campaign -- which saw President Joe Biden drop out of the race to pass the torch to Harris, two apparent attempts on Trump's life, and explosive televised debates -- the stakes could not be higher.</p>

<p>"I can't believe we can pick Donald Trump, when I think about it, I become very worried," said Ann Spiker, 71. "That's why we're out and doing what we can."</p>

<p>But an hour west of Washington in the Virginia city of Fairfax, some voters have a different worldview.</p>

<p>Arthur Stewart, a 58-year-old heating and air conditioning technician, said he cast his ballot to return Trump to the White House.</p>

<p>"He already has a record with the economy when he was here before, and I believe he's going to continue that," said Stewart, who has a shaved head and a soft smile. "One of the other issues is the border, security of the border. He was very good on that."</p>

<p>Stewart also echoed Trump's unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen from the Republican billionaire.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to make sure that I voted early, in case there was some issue with fraud this time," he said.</p>

<p>But one thing does seem to unite Americans on both sides of the political divide. Whether they support Harris or Trump, once they've cast their ballots, they are given an "I voted" sticker that they proudly wear on their chests.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The erratic life of a struggling roofing contractor suspected of trying to shoot Donald Trump swerved from bounced checks to a weapon felony conviction and a quixotic plan to help Ukraine fight Russia's invasion, before culminating in what appears to be a foiled assassination plot.</p>

<p>Ryan Routh, 58, was charged with two gun-related crimes in a federal court in Florida on Monday, a day after he was spotted with a rifle hiding in shrubbery on the property line of Trump's golf course. More charges are expected.</p>

<p>Officials have not cited any possible motives.</p>

<p>Routh mocked President Joe Biden on social media and suggested in a 2023 self-published book that he voted for Trump in 2016. But he then wrote that backing Trump was a "terrible mistake" and at various points described the former president as a "fool," a "buffoon," and an "idiot."</p>

<p>Addressing Iran, Routh wrote that "you are free to assassinate Trump" for the former president's decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.</p>

<p>In his 291-page book "Ukraine's Unwinnable War," Routh argued that democracy needed defending around the world and the United States had its own "catastrophe" on Jan 6, 2021, "perpetrated by Donald Trump and his undemocratic posse."</p>

<p>Court records showed Routh has a long history of breaking traffic laws, not paying his taxes on time and writing bad checks. But it was in 2002 that he lost his right to own a gun when he pleaded guilty to a felony in North Carolina for possessing an illegal explosive device in April.</p>

<p>Months after his arrest in that case while released on a bond, Routh fled from a traffic stop by a police officer near his home in Greensboro, North Carolina, and barricaded himself inside his roofing business for several hours before police were able to arrest him for having a concealed handgun without a permit, according to court records and a 2002 news article by the Greensboro News &amp; Record.</p>

<p>A few days later, Routh pleaded guilty to possession of what court records described as a "binary explosive with a 10-inch detonation cord and a blasting cap," which is defined in North Carolina law as a weapon of mass destruction and is a felony punishable by up to 59 months in prison, according to the county district attorney's office and the Guilford County Superior Court clerk's office. He was sentenced to probation.</p>

<p>Eight years later, he again pleaded guilty to felonies after he was charged with possession of stolen goods: a blowtorch, a pull-cart and a power cord, according to the district attorney's office. As the owner of several roofing companies, he has been repeatedly sued by people accusing him of not paying his bills.</p>

<p>The FBI said on Monday that it received a tip in 2019 that Routh was a felon in possession of a firearm - prohibited by federal law - but that the person who made that tip would later not confirm the information during an interview with agents.</p>

<p>The FBI relayed the tip to local authorities in Hawaii, where Routh moved in 2018 after decades in North Carolina.</p>

<p><strong>POSTS ON UKRAINE, DEMOCRACY</strong></p>

<p>Reuters found profiles on X, Facebook and LinkedIn for a Ryan Routh, and public access to the Facebook and X profiles was removed hours after the shooting.</p>

<p>The three accounts bearing Routh's name showed he supported Ukraine in its war against Russia.</p>

<p>On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, writing: "I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please."</p>

<p>The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he traveled to Ukraine, spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine.</p>

<p>One current and another former U.S. volunteer serving with the foreign legion of Ukraine's army said they recalled Routh and believed that he spent time in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk. Both of them said he exhibited odd behavior.</p>

<p>Routh was blocked from the "Volunteers for Ukraine" chat group on Signal last year and blacklisted, after appearing "delusional" with promises to bring foreign volunteer recruits to the country despite having no military background, said a former U.S. volunteer with the legion, who asked not to be named.</p>

<p>While on leave in the west from battle in Ukraine, he and fellow volunteers tried their best to avoid Routh and others who made such grand promises, the volunteer told Reuters.</p>

<p>The International Legion, where many foreign fighters in Ukraine serve, said it had no links with Routh.</p>

<p><strong>MOCKING BIDEN</strong></p>

<p>On X in 2020, Routh expressed support for Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and mocked Biden as "sleepy Joe."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Routh tagged Biden in a post on X: "@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose."</p>

<p>North Carolina voting records showed no party affiliation for Routh, though he did vote in this year's Democratic Party primary.</p>

<p>A former neighbor of Routh in Greensboro, North Carolina, Kim Mungo, said he was known to occasionally shoot weapons outside his home on holidays, though not in a threatening manner.</p>

<p>She occasionally cooked in his home and said, "He was cool to me."</p>

<p>Mungo, 53, who said she lived next to Routh for about a decade, said he had moved away several years ago. But he reappeared in May and was cleaning out the house, apparently intending to sell it.</p>

<p>"I ain't seen him in a while," Mungo said. "I don't know what his mindset was."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Security Council has met in an emergency session on Lebanon, following an uptick in cross-border fire between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, and deadly wireless device explosions targeting members of the militant group.</p>

<p>Rosemary DiCarlo, UN under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, said on Friday that alarming developments in Lebanon and the region have come after nearly one year of hostilities on an almost daily basis across the Blue Line, a buffer zone separating Israel and Lebanon, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"These exchanges have been a repeated breach of the cessation of hostilities and in violation of (Security Council) resolution 1701," she said.</p>

<p>Abdallah Bou Habib, Lebanon's foreign minister, said "Israel, through this terrorist aggression, has violated the basic principles of international humanitarian law ... and indiscriminately targeted civilians."</p>

<p>Denouncing Israel as "a rogue state," he called on the council to condemn the recent attacks, implement resolution 1701 and stand on the right side of history.</p>

<p>"Isn't this terrorism when you target a whole population while they tend to their daily life and not fighting on the front?" he asked.</p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, Syria's permanent representative to the United Nations Koussay Aldahhak said the devastating recent attacks were deployed without any regard to international law or to humanity.</p>

<p>He said the Arab Group demands the Security Council condemn this cyberterrorism and Israel's aggressions against the Palestinian people in Gaza and attacks on other countries, including Syria.</p>

<p>In his national capacity, Aldahhak said Syria condemns the aggression and ongoing terrorism against the Lebanese people.</p>

<p>Speaking in his national capacity, Samuel Zbogar of Slovenia, which holds the Security Council presidency for September, said "We are stepping in a dangerous new territory and as new technology is being used and developed, we underline the need to respect the existing legal obligations."</p>

<p>He called on the Security Council to act before the situation in the region spirals beyond control, emphasizing that diplomacy must be the only path forward.</p>

<p>Danny Danon, Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, said his country did not seek the war, stating that on October 8, when Israeli citizens in the south were being "slaughtered" by Hamas, Hezbollah "unleased hundreds of rockets" in the north against civilians.</p>

<p>He said that since then, more than 8,000 rockets have "rained down" on Israel, killing 46 people and injuring a further 294. Danon added that Israel's objective is to "restore security to our northern borders" and "bring our people home."</p>

<p>"We are very concerned at the heightened escalation across the Blue Line, including the deadly strike we saw on Beirut today," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said at a daily briefing.</p>

<p>He urged all parties to de-escalate immediately, exercise "maximum restraint" and "immediately return to the cessation of hostilities and to fully implement Security Council resolution 1701."</p>

<p>Warning that the region is "on the brink of a catastrophe," he said all efforts should focus on finding a diplomatic solution.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Rosie, the world's oldest cat, is dead. Her owner Lila Brisset recently bid farewell to Rosie, the fluffy tortoiseshell cat believed to be the oldest in the world. The cat died at the age of 33 in her owner's home in Norwich UK, according to a report in the New York Post.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rosie was born in 1991 and held the unofficial title of "world's oldest cat" as the current holder is Flossie, a 28-year-old cat from Kent. In June, Rosie turned 33 and died at the equivalent age of 152 in human years.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Lila, who had adopted Rosie when she was a kitten, said, "I miss her so much. She wasn't very well and one day she just walked into the hallway of the house, laid down and passed away. There were lots of good memories though and I'm happy we had our time together."</p>

<p dir="ltr">After giving up the outside life, Rosie slept near the window during the later years of her life. The cat was supposed to go to a different family but the family realised that their daughter was allergic. Enter Lila, a widow who had previously rescued a stray dog and another cat.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the New York Post, Lila had previously shared, "She's quite a character. Rosie sleeps by the window all day and, like clockwork, she will have some food and use the litter tray."</p>

<p dir="ltr">She continued, "There's no need for an alarm clock. All she does is eat, sleep, use the litter tray and repeat. I often have to check if she's still alive and breathing. I'm worried about the day she crosses over the rainbow bridge. She'll leave a big void. I'll miss her when she goes. But I'll never have her put down."</p>

<p dir="ltr">As of now, Creme Puff of Austin, Texas holds the record for being the oldest cat that ever lived. Born on August 3, 1967, she survived until August 6, 2005, for 38 years and 3 days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since acquiring Twitter, rebranded as X in 2022, Elon Musk has continuously used the platform to air his views, often sparking controversy in the process.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since acquiring Twitter, rebranded as X in 2022, Elon Musk has continuously used the platform to air his views, often sparking controversy in the process. The billionaire, known for his contributions to space exploration, electric vehicles, and cryptocurrency, has also cultivated a reputation for sharing inflammatory and provocative statements. Here are five of his most controversial posts on X, ranging from comments on political figures to conspiracy theories.</p>

<p><strong>1. Musk Questions Lack of Assassination Attempts on Biden and Harris</strong></p>

<p>Musk reacted to an alleged assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump by questioning why no one seemed to be targeting President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris. Following reports that Secret Service agents had foiled an attack on Trump at his Florida golf course, Musk responded to a post asking, "Why do they want to kill Donald Trump?" with the disturbing retort, "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala."</p>

<p>This post ignited a firestorm of criticism for its reckless tone and dangerous implications.&nbsp;Elon Musk later tried damage control in another post: "Well, one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X."</p>

<p><strong>2. Promoting An Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory</strong></p>

<p>In November 2023, Musk found himself embroiled in controversy after endorsing a post that invoked the widely discredited "Great Replacement" theory. The theory claims that Jewish people and other minorities are orchestrating the "replacement" of white populations through immigration, leading to so-called "white genocide."</p>

<p>Musk's response, calling the user's statement "the actual truth," was widely condemned. Though he later admitted that his endorsement was "foolish," the damage was done.</p>

<p><strong>3. Adding Fuel To The 'Pizzagate' Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>The "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory, a false narrative claiming prominent Democrats ran a child trafficking ring out of a Washington, DC pizza restaurant, resurfaced on Musk's feed in late November 2023.</p>

<p>On November 28, Musk posted a meme referencing the debunked theory, complete with superimposed dialogue from The Office TV show. "Does seem at least a little suspicious," Musk wrote in the now-deleted post.</p>

<p><strong>4. Backing Questionable War Accounts</strong></p>

<p>After the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out in Gaza in October 2023, Musk landed in a spot after recommending two X accounts for real-time coverage of the war. Both accounts had previously been criticised for sharing misinformation, including an AI-generated image of an explosion at the Pentagon. One had also posted numerous antisemitic comments in recent months.</p>

<p>While Musk deleted the post after backlash, the incident added to concerns about his role in enabling misinformation to spread unchecked on X.</p>

<p><strong>5. A Jab at Taylor Swift</strong></p>

<p>When pop superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, Musk was quick to react. Swift, signing off her post with the tongue-in-cheek "childless cat lady," provoked a sarcastic reply from Musk: "Fine Taylor... you win... I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life."</p>

<p>This bizarre response, followed by Musk agreeing with a user who said Swift's endorsement aligned with demographic trends of unmarried women supporting Democrats, was viewed as inappropriate and out-of-line. While some found humour in the exchange, many Swift fans and political commentators condemned Musk's comments as tasteless and condescending.</p>

<p>Musk's daughter Vivian Wilson called him out publicly on X. "The timing for the Taylor Swift endorsement of Kamala Harris honestly could not have been better. Can't wait to see the Swifties at the polls! Vote blue," the 20-year-old wrote on Instagram's Threads, in support of the pop star.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Monday to discuss tackling illegal immigration, a day after another Channel migrant shipwreck claimed eight lives.</p>

<p>Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party was elected with a crushing parliamentary majority in July, has vowed to fight illegal immigration, a hot-button topic in British politics for years.</p>

<p>Far-right riots shook cities and towns across England and Northern Ireland shortly after Starmer's election, the UK's worst unrest since 2011, with mosques and migrant accommodation centres often targeted.</p>

<p>The perilous cross-Channel journeys migrants attempt from northern France have posed a fiendishly difficult problem to solve for successive British prime ministers.</p>

<p>Eight migrants died on Sunday after their overcrowded boat capsized in the Channel, bringing to 46 the number of people who have lost their lives this year trying to reach British shores.</p>

<p>Around 800 people crossed the Channel on Saturday, the second-highest figure since the start of the year, according to the UK interior ministry.</p>

<p>Starmer has rejected the previous Conservative government's plan to expel all illegal migrants to Rwanda while their asylum claims are examined.</p>

<p>Instead, UK media say he is interested in the strategy of Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party and whose country is on the front line of the European Union's migration crisis.</p>

<p>In November last year, Italy signed an agreement with Albania to open two centres in the Balkan country where migrants would be sheltered while their asylum claims are processed.</p>

<p>Italy will fund and manage the centres, which will be capable of accommodating up to 3,000 migrants who have arrived on Italian shores by boat.</p>

<p>Migrants with rejected asylum claims would be sent back to their country of origin, whereas those with accepted applications will be granted entry to Italy.</p>

<p>That is a key difference from the former UK government's Rwanda scheme, whereby migrants sent to the East African nation could never have settled in Britain irrespective of the outcome of their claim.</p>

<h3><strong>Italy migrant numbers fall&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It's in early days, I'm interested in how that works, I think everybody else is," Starmer said of the Italian scheme in comments carried by British media.</p>

<p>Starmer said he and Meloni "have already discussed how we can improve joint operations, so that is something we will discuss".</p>

<p>Their meeting is scheduled for midday (1000 GMT), according to Meloni's office.</p>

<p>The newly appointed chief of the UK's new Border Security Command, Martin Hewitt, will accompany Starmer during his trip to Italy, his office said.</p>

<p>Meloni's government has also inked a deal with Tunisia granting aid in exchange for greater efforts to stop Italy-bound migrants who leave the North African country and cross the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>According to the Italian Interior Ministry, migrant arrivals by sea have dropped markedly since the start of the year.</p>

<p>Between January 1 and September 13, 44,675 people arrived in Italy compared to a figure of 125,806 for the same period in 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[AI tools on classroom tablets and computers will act as "virtual assistants that can make learning easier for students and help teachers identify methods for an increasingly bespoke education"]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy is introducing artificial intelligence in its schools as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government explores new ways to close the country's digital skills gap with other European Union members.</p>

<p>Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara said this week - when schools reopened across Italy - that AI-assisted software would be tested in 15 classrooms across four regions, with a view to expand the scheme later if the experiment is successful.</p>

<p>AI tools on classroom tablets and computers will act as "virtual assistants that can make learning easier for students and help teachers identify methods for an increasingly bespoke education," the minister told the TGcom24 news channel.</p>

<p>Italy has one of the worst basic digital skills scores in the 27-member EU, according to the bloc's statistical agency Eurostat, faring better only than Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

<p>Few details were given about the initiative, however. Valditara's office was not able to confirm the names of the schools that would test the new technology and expand on its workings.</p>

<p>However, the planned evaluation of the trial starting with this school year is "promising", Francesca Bastagli, head of research at the Fondazione Agnelli educational think tank, told Reuters on Friday.</p>

<p>"It will hopefully tell us what works and what is needed for future rollouts of AI tools in schools to be inclusive and effective", she said.</p>

<p>Italy's AI-push for schools came as the minister also issued a blanket ban on the use of mobile phones in classrooms, even for educational purposes.</p>

<p>Past attempts to digitalise Italian schools have proven difficult, including during the COVID pandemic, partly due to the advanced age of teaching staff, with more than half of them aged 50 or older, according to OECD data.</p>

<p>Meloni has made AI one of the themes of this year's G7 summit, which was hosted by Italy. In their final communique, leaders said they would deepen their "cooperation to harness the benefits and manage the risks of (AI)".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been in the limelight ever since they closed the door on royal life in 2020. As the couple celebrated Harry's 40th birthday over the weekend, it has now been alleged that the Duchess of Sussex terrifies her staff, with a person calling her a “dictator in high heels”. "Everyone's terrified of Meghan... She belittles people, she doesn't take advice” a source close to the couple told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hollywood-keeps-quitting-prince-harry-meghan-markle-1235996963/">The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">The person stated that both Harry and Markle are "poor decision-makers" as they change their minds frequently.&nbsp;"Harry is a very, very charming person - no airs at all - but he's very much an enabler. And she's just terrible," the source added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another insider told the media outlet that Markle "marches around like a dictator in high heels," adding that she has reduced grown men to tears.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“She's absolutely relentless... She marches around like a dictator in high heels, fuming and barking orders. I've watched her reduce grown men to tears," the person added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the years, the couple have witnessed high staff turnover, with Markle's top aide and private secretary departing in 2021. Last month, their chief of staff left the job in just three months.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Josh Kettler, the Santa Barbara-based consultant, resigned in August after just three months on the job. Before Kettler, Toya Holness was their global press secretary until 2022.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, this is not the first time when Markle has been criticised for her behaviour toward their employees.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Buckingham Palace had in 2018 investigated her for her treatment of two royal aides, which was earlier labeled as "bullying behaviour". While no findings was made public, she called the claims a "calculated smear campaign".&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">After severing ties with the royal family, Harry and Markle have been residing in Montecito, California.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, a prominent royal expert recently claimed that the former actor is regretful over the way their exit from the royal family went down.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Meghan does regret certain statements that she made,” Fox News quoted royal expert and commentator Kinsey Schofield as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Schofield stated that the couple were not received in the way Markle expected, while "several of her comments have backfired.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile that struck near Israel's Tel Aviv, a bustling commercial hub on Sunday. Rebel Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi claimed responsibility for the missile, describing it as a "ballistic missile" that penetrated Israel's sophisticated air defence systems. While there were no casualties, the attack added to the already fragile regional tensions, particularly as the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas' attack on October 7, neared its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to respond, warning that the Iran-backed Houthi rebels would "pay a heavy price" for the strike. While the missile caused only minor damage - shattering glass at a train station and injuring several civilians on their way to shelters - the symbolic nature of the attack cannot be understated. It is the latest escalation involving the Houthis, who have increasingly been drawn into the Gaza conflict as part of a broader network of militias collectively known as Iran's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis of Resistance</a>.</p>

<p>The attack prompted questions about how a militia in war-torn Yemen has managed to acquire the capability to launch such long-range missile strikes.</p>

<h2><strong>Origins Of The Houthis' Missile Capabilities</strong></h2>

<p>The Houthis' ability to acquire and launch ballistic missiles lies in historical weapons caches, Iranian support, and arms trafficking. The group, officially known as Ansar Allah, evolved from a grassroots religious movement in the 1990s to a powerful militia with sophisticated weapons. Since the Yemeni civil war broke out in 2015, the Houthis have relied on three primary sources to build their missile arsenal:</p>

<h3><strong>Yemeni Government Missiles&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>During the Cold War, Yemen was divided into North and South, with each side receiving military aid from competing superpowers. The Yemeni government first began acquiring Scud missiles from the Soviet Union in the 1970s. Over the years, various ballistic and surface-to-air missiles found their way into Yemen's military stockpiles, including those from North Korea and Iran, and, ironically, Saudi Arabia and the United States.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Reuters </span></p>
</div>

<p>The 1994 Yemeni civil war saw the use of these ballistic missiles, and by the time the Houthis began to rise in prominence in the 2000s, they had ample access to outdated but still functioning missile systems. Between 2004 and 2010, the Houthis repeatedly looted government armouries, gaining access to missiles and other heavy weaponry. However, it wasn't until 2015, when they allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, that their missile capabilities expanded significantly.</p>

<h3><strong>Arms Supply And Tactical Training By Iran&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Since the outset of the Yemeni civil war, the Houthis have relied heavily on Iranian support, which includes everything from missile components to training in assembly and launch techniques. Although Iran has never openly acknowledged their support, US and coalition forces have intercepted Iranian missile shipments en route to Yemen multiple times.</p>

<p>According to the book 'The Missile War in Yemen' by Ian Williams and Shaan Shaikh, debris from missile strikes has been found with Farsi inscriptions and Iranian manufacturing labels. Iran's provision of missiles like the Burkan series, the Quds-1 cruise missile, and the Sayyad-2C surface-to-air missile has augmented the Houthis' long-range strike capability.</p>

<p>One of Iran's most strategic advantages is its ability to smuggle missile components into Yemen using clandestine routes. These routes include overland passages through Oman, covert shipments via the Arabian Sea, and even smuggling through unregulated ports along Yemen's Red Sea coast. In many cases, the missiles arrive in parts and are assembled in Houthi-controlled territory with Iranian help.</p>

<h3><strong>Spoils Of War</strong></h3>

<p>The Saudi-led coalition, formed to support Yemen's internationally recognized government, has inadvertently supplied the Houthis with weapons through accidents and losses in battle. Houthi forces have seized rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, and other equipment from Saudi forces or their allies.</p>

<p>In 2015, a Saudi coalition air-drop mishap resulted in the Houthis capturing a shipment of RPG-26 variants. The rebels wasted no time in showcasing their spoils, with a Houthi leader holding a thank-you note addressed to Saudi King Salman. While these captures have occasionally included advanced missile systems, they remain the least significant source compared to Iranian aid and Yemeni stockpiles.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Houthis have demonstrated an evolving capability in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Drones have become a key part of their arsenal, and Iran's influence is again apparent. The Houthis' Sammad drone series, used in one-way "suicide" missions, bears a resemblance to Iranian drone models like the Sayad.</p>

<h3><strong>The Houthi-Iran Alliance: Why Iran Supports The Houthis</strong></h3>

<p>The Houthis are part of a growing network of Iranian-backed militias and political factions, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and various Shiite militias in Iraq. For Tehran, the Houthis represent a low-cost, high-impact proxy force capable of destabilising the Arabian Peninsula and projecting Iranian power into the Red Sea, a key global trade route.</p>

<p>The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, is one of the world's most important maritime chokepoints. By supporting the Houthis, Iran gains influence over this vital corridor, potentially disrupting global oil and trade flows. This makes the Houthis an important part of Iran's strategy, which aims to challenge US and Saudi dominance in the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of people in Japan aged 65 or older hit a record high of 36.25 million this year, government data shows, as the country contends with one of the world's fastest-ageing societies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elderly now account for 29.3 per cent of Japan's total population, also a new high, according to data released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications on Sunday.</p>

<p>The ministry said the proportion of elderly residents put Japan at the top of the list of 200 countries and regions with a population of over 100,000.</p>

<p>Italy, Portugal, Greece, Finland, Germany and Croatia represented Europe in the top 10, with rates of over 20 per cent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Korea stood at 19.3 per cent and China at 14.7 per cent.</p>

<p>Japan is facing a steadily worsening population crisis, as its expanding elderly population leads to soaring medical and welfare costs, with a shrinking labour force to pay for it.</p>

<p>The country's overall population shrank by 595,000 to 124 million, according to previous government data.</p>

<p>Sunday's data showed that 9.14 million elderly people were employed in 2023, also a record.</p>

<p>They represent 13.5 per cent of the total workforce -- or one employee in seven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Japanese government has attempted to slow the decline and ageing of its population without meaningful success.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The strongest storm to hit Shanghai in over 70 years made landfall on Monday, with flights cancelled and highways closed as Typhoon Bebinca lashed the city with strong winds and torrential rains.</p>

<p>A red alert is in place, and some coastal residents have been evacuated, city authorities said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The typhoon landed early Monday morning in the coastal area of Lingang New City, in Pudong to the city's east, the China Meteorological Administration said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the strongest storm to hit Shanghai since Typhoon Gloria in 1949, state broadcaster CCTV said shortly after Bebinca made landfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many businesses were already closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival public holiday, and the city's 25 million residents have been advised to avoid leaving their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All flights at Shanghai's two main airports are grounded, and ferry services and some trains have been suspended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highways were closed at 1:00 am local time (1700 GMT), and a 40-kilometre (25-mile) per-hour speed limit is in place on roads inside the city.</p>

<p>At rush hour, live video feeds showed Shanghai's normally jammed roads almost empty of traffic, and its famed skyline obscured by thick fog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nine thousand residents have been evacuated from Chongming District, an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River, authorities said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Footage from northern Baoshan District showed ferocious winds ripping through a line of trees on the riverbank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shanghai's flood control headquarters told CCTV they had already received dozens of reports of incidents related to the typhoon, mostly fallen trees and billboards.</p>

<p>CCTV broadcast footage of a reporter by the coast in neighbouring Zhejiang province, where waves pounded the craggy coastline under leaden skies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If I step out into (the storm), I can barely speak," the reporter said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can see that the surface of the sea is just wave after wave, each higher than the last."</p>

<p>Another typhoon, Yagi, killed at least four people and injured 95 when it passed through China's southern Hainan island this month, according to national weather authorities.</p>

<p>Bebinca has also passed through Japan and the central and southern Philippines, where falling trees killed six people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCTV said Bebinca was expected to move northwest, causing heavy rain and high winds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are driving climate change and making extreme weather more frequent and intense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms will begin training its AI models using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram in the UK over the coming months, the company said, after it had paused the training in the region following a regulatory backlash.</p>

<p>The company will use public posts including photos, captions and comments to train its generative artificial intelligence models, it said on Friday, adding that the training content will not include private messages or information from accounts of users under the age of 18.</p>

<p>The update follows Meta's decision in mid-June to pause the launch of its AI models in Europe after the Irish privacy regulator told the company to delay its plan to harness data from social media posts.</p>

<p>The company had then said the delay would also allow it to address requests from Britain's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p>

<p>"Since we paused training our generative AI models in the UK to address regulatory feedback, we've engaged positively with the ICO ... this clarity and certainty will help us bring AI at Meta products to the UK much sooner," Meta said on Friday.</p>

<p>Facebook and Instagram users in the UK will start receiving in-app notifications from next week explaining the company's procedure and how users can object to their data being used for the training, Meta added.</p>

<p>Meta has made changes to its approach since it paused the plans in June, the ICO said in a statement, adding the company has simplified the way users can object to the processing of their data and has extended the window in which they can do so.</p>

<p>In June, Meta's plans faced backlash from advocacy group NOYB, which urged national privacy watchdogs across Europe to stop such use of social media content, saying the notifications were insufficient to meet EU's stringent privacy and transparency rules.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title"><span style="font-size: 13px;">The rings of Saturn are some of the most famous and spectacular objects in the Solar System. Earth may once have had something similar.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118991">a paper published last week</a> in Earth &amp; Planetary Science Letters, my colleagues and I present evidence that Earth may have had a ring.</p>

<p>The existence of such a ring, forming around 466 million years ago and persisting for a few tens of millions of years, could explain several puzzles in our planet's past.</p>

<h3><strong>The case for a ringed Earth</strong></h3>

<p>So it's extremely unlikely that all 21 craters from this period would form close to the equator if they were unrelated to one another. We would expect to see many other craters at higher latitudes as well.</p>

<p>We think the best explanation for all this evidence is that a large asteroid broke up during a close encounter with Earth. Over several tens of millions of years, the asteroid's debris rained down onto Earth, creating the pattern of craters, sediments and tsunamis we describe above.</p>

<h3><strong>How rings form</strong></h3>

<p>You may know that Saturn isn't the only planet with rings. Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus have less obvious rings, too. Some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2742">scientists have even suggested</a> that Phobos and Deimos, the small moons of Mars, may be remnants of an ancient ring.</p>

<p>So we know a lot about how rings form. Here's how it works.</p>
</div>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Saturn backlit by the Sun, taken by the Cassini spacecraft.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Cassini Imaging Team / SSI / JPL / ESA / NASA</span></span></figcaption>

<p>When a small body (like an asteroid) passes close to a large body (like a planet), it gets stretched by gravity. If it gets close enough (inside a distance called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">Roche limit</a>), the small body will break apart into lots of tiny pieces and a small number of bigger pieces.</p>

<p>All those fragments will be jostled around and gradually evolve into a debris ring orbiting the equator of the larger body. Over time, the material in the ring will fall down to the larger body, where the larger pieces will form impact craters. These craters will be located close to the equator.</p>

<p>So if Earth destroyed and captured a passing asteroid around 466 million years ago, it would explain the anomalous locations of the impact craters, the meteorite debris in sedimentary rocks, craters and tsunamis, and the meteorites' relatively brief exposure to space radiation.</p>

<h3><strong>A giant sunshade?</strong></h3>

<p>Back then, the continents were in different positions due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA8r3FVw46c">continental drift</a>. Much of North America, Europe and Australia were close to the equator, whereas Africa and South America were at higher southern latitudes.</p>

<p>The ring would have been around the equator. And since Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbit around the Sun, the ring would have shaded parts of Earth's surface.</p>

<p>This shading in turn might have caused global cooling, as less sunlight reached the planet's surface.</p>

<p>This brings us to another interesting puzzle. Around 465 million years ago, our planet began cooling dramatically. By 445 million years ago it was in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirnantian">Hirnantian Ice Age</a>, the coldest period in the past half a billion years.</p>

<p>Was a ring-shading Earth responsible for this extreme cooling? The next step in our scientific sleuthing is to make mathematical models of how asteroids break up and disperse, and how the resulting ring evolves over time. This will set the scene for climate modelling that explores how much cooling could be imposed by such a ring.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Cher had argued that a conservatorship was necessary to protect these funds from being spent on drugs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop star Cher has withdrawn her bid for a conservatorship over her son, Elijah Blue Allman. The singer had initially filed for the conservatorship in December, citing concerns about Allman's substance abuse and mental health, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkdm7588v2o" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, after months of legal proceedings and a brief mediation, Cher and Allman have reached a private settlement. The dismissal of the conservatorship allows the family to focus on healing and rebuilding their relationship.</p>

<p>The law firm representing him, Cage &amp; Miles, told the BBC in a statement that the outcome "allows the parties to focus on healing and rebuilding their family bond, a process that began during mediation and continues today".</p>

<p>The decision comes after Allman was set to receive significant assets from a trust established by his late father, musician Gregg Allman. Cher had argued that a conservatorship was necessary to protect these funds from being spent on drugs.</p>

<p>In court filings, lawyers for Cher said the singer was "concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah's life at risk".</p>

<p>The filing said that she had "worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs".</p>

<p>Her son said that struggling with addiction and previous poor financial choices, he was sober and receiving regular treatment.</p>

<p>While the court had previously denied Cher's requests for temporary conservatorship, she had continued to pursue the matter. However, Allman's legal team successfully demonstrated that he was capable of managing his finances and maintaining sobriety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In rejecting the temporary conservatorship bids, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jessica Uzcategui said Mr Allman had proven he had "managed his finances" and "remained drug-free".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reacting to the incident of an alleged assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump, billionaire Elon Musk questioned why is no one trying to assassinate President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump was the target of an alleged assassination attempt on Sunday in Florida, the FBI said, with the Republican presidential candidate's campaign and law enforcement reporting he was safe and unharmed.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service confirmed one or more of its agents "opened fire on a gunman" located near the boundary of Trump's golf course, and that an "AK-47 style rifle" with a scope was recovered along with a GoPro video camera.</p>

<p>Responding to a post on X which read, "Why they want to kill Donald Trump?", Musk wrote: "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala."&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Isaacman conducted the first commercial "spacewalk" hundreds of miles above the surface of the Earth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jared Isaacman, a former high school dropout living in his parents' basement in New Jersey, has achieved remarkable success as a tech billionaire and space tourist. His journey from humble beginnings to becoming a pioneer in space exploration is nothing short of extraordinary.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Mr. Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis briefly ventured into the vacuum of space to test the company's new spacesuits during the five-day Polaris Dawn mission. This marked the first time that nonprofessional astronauts from a private company performed a spacewalk.</p>

<p>"I decided I was going to go to space when I was 5 [years old]. I was pretty calculated about it at that point, it just took me a little while to get it into motion," Isaacman told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/how-civilian-astronaut-jared-isaacman-built-billion-dollar-business-shift4-payments.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It</em></a> in 2021.</p>

<p>Isaacman's entrepreneurial spirit was evident from a young age. At 16, he dropped out of high school to found Shift4 Payments, a payment processing company. Despite facing initial challenges, his company quickly gained traction and became a leader in the industry.</p>

<p>To start his entrepreneurial journey, he used a $10,000 check from his grandfather as seed money and set up shop in his childhood home's basement. &nbsp;"$10,000, you know, you needed to build a couple of computers," Isaacman said. "That wasn't expensive. And, you needed some phones, and that was enough to get you going."</p>

<p>He shared with the media outlet that his first employees included his friend Brendan Lauber, who was Shift4's chief technology officer until last year, and Isaacman's dad, a salesman who had previously worked for a home security company.</p>

<p>His company has a market value of $7.4 billion and now has 2,000 employees across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There's just no way, at that age, you could ever imagine" the company becoming worth billions of dollars, said Isaacman. "One of the best times at a startup is when you've got the eight people in the basement eating Chinese food and everybody kind of shares knowledge, and you share in your successes and failures together, and you learn together."</p>

<p>Shift4's success propelled Isaacman to billionaire status, and he has since made significant contributions to space exploration. He funded and led the first civilian mission to space aboard SpaceX's Dragon capsule, setting a record for the longest civilian spaceflight.</p>

<p>In 2009, Isaacman set a world record by flying a Cessna Citation CJ2 around the world in just under 62 hours- nearly 20 hours faster than the previous record holder. Three years later, he founded Draken International, a company that trains student pilots for the U.S. Air Force. In 2020, he sold the company to the investment firm Blackstone Group for "a nine-figure sum," as reported by Forbes.</p>

<p>Isaacman's passion for space exploration extends beyond his own personal achievements.</p>

<p>"As far as I'm concerned, I'm super lucky in life," Isaacman told <em>Bloomberg</em>, ahead of the spacewalk. "You know - teenage basement startup, just trying to buy pizza on the weekend, and it's turned into quite the empire."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Sunday in Florida, the FBI said, with the Republican presidential candidate's campaign and law enforcement reporting he was safe and unharmed.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service confirmed one or more of its agents "opened fire on a gunman" located near the boundary of Trump's golf course, and that an "AK-47 style rifle" with a scope was recovered along with a GoPro video camera.</p>

<p>Amid the confrontation with the Secret Service, the suspect bolted out of the shrubbery he had been hiding in and escaped in a black car. A witness helped police identify the vehicle and authorities tracked it down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have somebody in custody right now that is a potential suspect," Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told a news conference.</p>

<p>Trump had been golfing at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida, not far from his Mar-a-Lago residence, when the would-be shooter was spotted in bushes one hole ahead of the former president, Bradshaw said.</p>

<p>"President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity," his campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement, while Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris expressed relief her political rival was out of danger.</p>

<p>Trump himself said in a fundraising message on his website: "Fear not! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God!"</p>

<p>The unnerving incident appears to mark the second time in as many months that Trump has been the target of an assassination attempt. The former president was wounded in the ear on July 13 as he addressed an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<h3><strong>Unsure if shot taken&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Authorities who addressed Sunday's news conference did not confirm whether a gunman actually fired a weapon in the direction of the former president, but said that shots were fired by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>"We are not sure right now if the individual was able to take a shot at our agents," said Rafael Barros, of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it is "investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump."</p>

<p>Officials praised the quick action of the Secret Service, an agency that has been under intense scrutiny since its apparent failure to detect and stop a gunman from shooting at Trump in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Sheriff Bradshaw said Secret Service personnel in Trump's protective detail spotted "this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engaged that individual, at which time the individual took off."</p>

<p>He estimated the suspect was set up 300 to 500 yards (275 to 455 meters) away, but "with a rifle and a scope like that, that's not a long distance."</p>

<p>Sheriff William Snyder of neighbouring Martin County said on CNN that the potential suspect who was stopped and detained by law enforcement had "a relatively calm, flat effect. He was not displaying a lot of emotions."</p>

<h3><strong>'Relieved'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Law enforcement was launching a sweeping investigation but as of Sunday afternoon, there was no indication of the shooter's motive.</p>

<p>The incident came amid heightened tensions in the knife-edge presidential race and concern for the safety of both candidates.</p>

<p>"There is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country," President Joe Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I have directed my team to continue to ensure that the Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president's continued safety."</p>

<p>Vice President Harris took to social media to say "I am glad he is safe."</p>

<p>Several Trump supporters and members of his inner circle, including his running mate J.D. Vance, offered their support and gratitude that tragedy was avoided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm glad President Trump is safe," Vance said on X. "I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits."</p>

<p>The Secret Service, tasked with protecting presidents, former presidents and other dignitaries, has faced criticism since the Pennsylvania shooting.</p>

<p>Kimberly Cheatle, the head of the agency, resigned amid the ensuing scrutiny, and at least five agents were placed on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Representative Elise Stefanik, the fourth-ranking US House Republican, thanked law enforcement for their actions Sunday but raised questions about the latest incident.</p>

<p>"We must ask ourselves how an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again," she said in a statement.</p>

<p>"There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump narrowly escaped an alleged assassination attempt on Sunday in Florida, according to the FBI. A 58-year-old suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, was arrested after Secret Service agents opened fire near the boundary of Trump's golf course. A high-powered AK-47-style rifle with a scope and a GoPro camera was recovered at the scene.</p>

<p>When Secret Service agents opened fire, Routh reportedly bolted out of the shrubbery he was hiding in and escaped in a black car. Authorities were able to track down the car after witnesses helped police identify it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have somebody in custody right now that is a potential suspect," Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told a press conference, as quoted by news agency AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Ryan Wesley Routh?</strong></h3>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/trump-shooting-suspect-routh.html?searchResultPosition=1">New York Times</a>, Routh is a former construction worker from North Carolina Greensboro. Routh had no formal military background but expressed strong desires to participate in armed conflict in the past, particularly in Ukraine after Russia's 2022 invasion. In one post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Routh declared his willingness to "fight and die" in Ukraine. He also advocated for civilians to change the course of global conflicts.</p>

<p>"I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE," he wrote.</p>

<p>According to the New York Times, on the messaging application Signal, Routh wrote, "Civilians must change this war and prevent future wars" as part of his profile bio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Each one of us must do our part daily in the smallest steps help support human rights, freedom and democracy; we each must help the Chinese," his bio on WhatsApp reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Routh's activities didn't stop at online declarations. In a 2023 interview with The New York Times, he claimed to have travelled to Ukraine to support the war effort and recruit Afghan soldiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This wasn't Routh's first brush with violence. In 2002, he was arrested after barricading himself inside a building with a fully automatic weapon in Greensboro. The charges were serious, though the outcome of the case remains unclear.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump "Safe"</strong></h3>

<p>"President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity," his campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Fear not! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God!" Trump himself said in a website fundraising message, as quoted by news agency AFP&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest shooting incident comes weeks after Trump was the Target of another assassination attempt while addressing a rally in Pennsylvania. The would-be assassin fired a bullet from his sniper from a distance, which grazed the former US President's ear. The suspect was then shot dead by authorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI is investigating what it said was another assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The incident occurred Sunday at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach in Florida where Trump, the former president, was golfing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shots were fired from an AK-47-style rifle in former US President Donald Trump's vicinity on the grounds of his golf course in Palm Beach Florida, where he was present. The Republican candidate is "safe", his party campaign said.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, US Vice President and Democratic Party's Presidential candidate said she has been "briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida. I am glad that he is safe." Ms Harris said, "Violence has no place in America."</p>

<p>The US Secret Service, the organization responsible for protecting serving and former Presidents, accompanied Mr Trump - A protocol followed by the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The motive behind the shooting is unclear, but still, it came almost two months after a failed assassination attempt against Mr Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a shooter, atop a roof, shot a 5.56mm bullet from an AR-15 style rifle, which grazed his ear and blood splattering on his face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Secret Service accepted that it had failed to protect the former president at an election rally in Pennsylvania on July 13.</p>

<p>The Secret Service takes full responsibility for the tragic events of July 13th. This was a mission failure. The sole responsibility of our agency is to make sure our protectees are never put in danger. We fell short of that in Butler. And I'm working to make sure that this failure does not happen again," Acting Director of the US Secret Service, Ronald Rowe said.</p>

<p>Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will be up against each other in the closely contested presidential elections scheduled for November this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident in Florida comes days after the first Presidential debate between the rival candidates where Ms Harris "trumped" Donald Trump and a majority of debate watchers said Harris outperformed Trump, according to a CNN flash poll released shortly after the debate. YouGov showed 54% of those surveyed said Harris won while 31% said Trump was the victor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity, the Republican presidential candidate's team said today. "President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity. No further details at this time," campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said a statement.</p>

<p>The shooting took place at Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. A "person of interest" has been detained along with a weapon, the New York Times reported, citing local law enforcement officials.</p>

<p>Trump had been golfing when the gunshots were heard, multiple media reports said. Trump had been accompanied at the time by his Secret Service protective detail when shots were fired.</p>

<p>It was unclear who the shooter or shooters were, or what the motive was. There was no immediate indication that Trump had been targeted.&nbsp; Media outlet CNN, citing security agency own sources, reported that officials believed the shots at the golf club were indeed intended for Trump.</p>

<p>The former US president's son Donald Trump Jr. said that authorities also found an AK-47 rifle in the bushes, extremely close to the spot from where Trump was leaving.</p>

<p>"Again folks! SHOTS FIRED at Trump Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. An AK-47 was discovered in the bushes, per local law enforcement," he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

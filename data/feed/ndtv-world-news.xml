       <description><![CDATA[His death, reportedly carried out by an unknown assassin, has drawn attention due to his involvement in the military-industrial complex supporting Russia's aggression in Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mikhail Shatsky, deputy general designer and head of its software department of the Mars Design Bureau, a Russian company that develops missiles used in Moscow's war with Ukraine, has been killed, according to <em>Kyiv Independent.</em></p>

<p>He was shot dead by an unknown assassin in Kuzminsky Forest Park, at Kotelniki, eight miles southeast of the Kremlin in the Moscow region, according to the Astra Telegram channel and other Russian and Ukrainian sources.</p>

<p>Shatsky was employed by a company that creates and produces onboard guidance systems for the Russian space and military industries. It has been a part of the state corporation Rosatom's department since December 2017.</p>

<p>He was also an associate professor and was working actively on upgrading the Russian Kh-59 cruise missile to the Kh-69 level, which Russian troops use to strike Ukraine.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://kyivindependent.com/shatsky/"><em> Kyiv Independent,</em></a> Shatsky was seen as the main proponent of incorporating AI technology into Russian drones, aircraft, and spacecraft.</p>

<p>Shatsky's death was previously reported by Ukrainian-Russian anti-Kremlin journalist Alexander Nevzorov, who wrote on his Telegram channel that HUR "eliminated a particularly dangerous criminal."</p>

<p>Nevzorov shared photos of a person resembling Shatsky lying dead in the snow. The man was reportedly killed in the Kuzminsky forest park near Kotelniki in Moscow Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.</p>

<p>"Anyone who is involved in the development of the Russian military-industrial complex and support of Russian aggression in Ukraine in one way or another is a legitimate target of the Defence Forces," the source said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ingenuity was designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over 30 days but managed to operate for almost three years, performing 72 flights.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA has finally revealed why its Ingenuity Helicopter crashed on the Martian surface in January, earlier this year. Engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and AeroVironment conducted the in-depth assessment and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-performs-first-aircraft-accident-investigation-on-another-world/" rel="noindex, nofollow">concluded </a>that the failure of Ingenuity's navigation system to provide accurate data "during the flight likely caused a chain of events that ended the mission". As per the flight data, Ingenuity reached an altitude of 12 metres, clicked the images and returned to the surface after 32 seconds but the communication was severed. After mission command on Earth re-established the communication, it was discovered that Ingenuity had sustained damage to its rotors.</p>

<p>"When running an accident investigation from 100 million miles away, you don't have any black boxes or eyewitnesses," said Ingenuity's first pilot, Havard Grip of JPL, adding: "While multiple scenarios are viable with the available data, we have one we believe is most likely: Lack of surface texture gave the navigation system too little information to work with."</p>

<p>Ingenuity's navigation system was designed to track visual features on the Martian surface using a camera over well-textured (pebbly) but flat terrain. During the fateful flight, Ingenuity was in a region of Jezero Crater that is filled with steep, relatively featureless sand ripples. The topography confused the helicopter and resulted in a hard impact which caused Ingenuity to pitch and roll.</p>

<p>"The rapid attitude change resulted in loads on the fast-rotating rotor blades beyond their design limits, snapping all four of them off at their weakest point - about a third of the way from the tip," the findings stated.</p>

<p>"The damaged blades caused excessive vibration in the rotor system, ripping the remainder of one blade from its root and generating an excessive power demand that resulted in loss of communications," it added.</p>

<h3><strong>Down but not out</strong></h3>

<p>The Perseverance Rover and Ingenuity Helicopter were both part of the Mars 2020 mission that blasted off Earth aboard an Atlas V rocket. While Perseverance continues to work flawlessly, Ingenuity suffered a cruel end but not before it accomplished some major tasks.</p>

<p>Ingenuity was designed to perform up to five experimental test flights over 30 days but managed to operate for almost three years, performing 72 flights and flying 30 times farther than planned. The inaugural Ingenuity flight took place on April 19, 2021, when the 1.8-kilogram flying object took off using its two counter-rotating blades.</p>

<p>Despite being grounded, Ingenuity still beams&nbsp;weather and avionics test data to Perseverance about once a week. NASA believes that the weather information may help future explorers of the Red Planet. The avionics data is already proving useful to engineers working on future designs of aircraft and other vehicles for the Red Planet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence is being used for a novel purpose: training customer service staff to handle irate customers through an AI-powered, foul-mouthed robot.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence has seamlessly integrated into nearly all back-office operations across professional industries, and in various ways, it has become a part of daily life through AI-enabled devices. From customer care chats to automated phone calls, many sectors already rely on AI-driven solutions. However, AI is now being utilised for a surprising purpose: simulating angry customers to train customer service executives to remain calm and composed while handling irate callers.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/angry-foul-mouthed-monster-robot-34296295"><em>the Daily Star,</em></a> scientists have built a foul-mouthed bad boy robot to help train customer service staff. The robot rotter can get angry, fly into a rage, and fire off volleys of expletive-laden abuse to teach workers how to handle complaints. US developers Furhat Robotics and audEERING say the machine monster is a 'social robot' that uses artificial intelligence to detect vocal expression. That means it can pick up on-and react to-people's moods. It can be programmed to become extremely angry and to curse and swear.</p>

<p>Louis Simeonidis, director of business development at Furhat Robotics, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/angry-foul-mouthed-monster-robot-34296295"><em>the news outlet,</em></a> "If we've done our job right, you should be able to walk up and engage with the robot just like your friend. You should be able to communicate and express with it the same way you would with other people.And it should be able to communicate back to you the way other people would communicate."</p>

<p>audEERING founder Florian Eyben added: "We can understand sarcasm, irony, and we can understand that you're actually maybe not in the best mood, and the way you say things matters here."</p>

<p>A technology expert who tested out the bot at the Voice &amp; AI Conference in Washington, DC, had to calm it down.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fashionable US drinkware brand Stanley on Thursday recalled 2.6 million travel mugs after faulty lids were found to pose a risk of burning users with hot liquid.</p>

<p>The US Consumer Product Safety Commission issued the recall of Stanley's Switchback and Trigger Action models, citing lid threads that shrink due to heat or usage.</p>

<p>The fault can cause the lid "to detach during use, posing a burn hazard," the commission said, adding Stanley had received 91 complaints worldwide, resulting in 38 burn injuries.</p>

<p>Stanley cups and mugs -- insulated, colorful and in all sizes -- have surged in popularity in recent years, starring in multiple TikTok clips and lifestyle memes.</p>

<p>New releases of limited edition cups have caused long queues outside stores and even tussles among desperate customers.</p>

<p>A woman was arrested in California earlier this year for allegedly stealing 65 Stanleys worth almost $2,500 from a sporting goods store.</p>

<p>The recalled items cost between $20 and $50.</p>

<p>Seattle-based Stanley said in a statement to US media that it was "committed to constant improvement and are focused on creating quality products that are built for life."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inmates at the Pennsylvania jail where Luigi Mangione has been lodged, gave a wild interview to a TV reporter who was standing outside the prison compounds. The inmates voiced their support for Mr Mangione in the live interview as anchors for US outlet Newsnation asked them the questions. Reporter Alex Caprariello attempted to broadcast a segment about Mr Mangione's conditions within the prison but when inmates watching the news saw themselves on TV, they quickly responded to the questions, with some even flickering the lights to signal yes or no.</p>

<p>In the video that has since gone viral on social media, the inmates could be heard yelling out, "Luigi's conditions suck" and "Free Luigi", earlier in the day when Mr Caprariello was recording a bite. As he returned to the prison for the 10 pm bulletin with anchor Ashleigh Banfield, the inmates once again chimed in with a response. As Ms Banfield quizzed if Mr Mangione had a TV in his cell, the prisoners screamed "No".</p>

<p>"Wow, this is the strangest interview I've ever conducted," Ms Banfield said.</p>

<p>After Ms Banfield read the prison's menu for the day and questioned the inmates if the food at the facility was good, she was met with loud jeering from the inmates who said it was "terrible" and "BS", according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/12/us-news/luigi-mangiones-fellow-inmates-decry-terrible-prison-conditions-in-wild-tv-interview-with-reporter-standing-outside/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>NY Post.</em></a></p>

<h3><strong>Luigi Mangione in prison</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Mangione has been kept at the State Correctional Institution in Huntington for the alleged murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Authorities allege that Mr Mangione fired multiple rounds on Mr Thompson from behind using a gun with a silencer attached to it.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, law enforcement officials said the gun that Mr Mangione possessed had fingerprints matching the shell casings found at the scene of the December 4 shooting. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is pushing for extraditing Mr Mangione to New York.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luigi Mangione apparently used a ghost gun, a firearm that can be made at home, to shoot down the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police said. The 26-year-old allegedly shot Thompson in the back and in the calf. "As of right now the information we're getting from Altoona is that the gun appears to be a ghost gun, may have been made on a 3D printer, with the capability of firing a 9mm round," NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghost-guns-what-to-know/">CBS NEWS.</a></p>

<p>As per the Pennsylvania criminal complaint filed after Mangione's arrest, the police officials found a black 3D-printed pistol and a black 3D-printed silencer while searching his backpack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The pistol had a metal slide and a plastic handle with a metal threaded barrel...The pistol had one loaded Glock magazine with six nine-millimetre full metal jacket rounds. There was also one loose nine-millimetre hollow point round," the police affidavit said.</p>

<p>Thompson was killed in New York City on December 4, while the suspect, Luigi Mangione, was detained at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>What is a ghost gun?</strong></p>

<p>A privately made firearm, popularly called a 'ghost gun', can be assembled by people other than the licensed manufacturers, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).</p>

<p>It is difficult to track them, for they are made without any serial number. However, not all ghost guns are considered illegal, and not all firearms are supposed to have a serial number in the US, according to CBS News.</p>

<p>Ghost guns can be of any type -- a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun or machine gun.</p>

<p>More than 45,000 suspected ghost guns were reported to the ATF between 2016 and 2021, &nbsp;recovered by police from potential crime scenes.</p>

<p><strong>How to make them?</strong></p>

<p>To make a ghost gun, people usually use a 3D printer or assemble it from a kit. These weapons can be made for less than $200, while officials have put the average price at roughly $500.</p>

<p>In the US, not all types of ghost guns are illegal. People in the country can make their own using 3D printing or other processes if the gun is "detectable," as per the Gun Control Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luigi Mangione, the man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO, reportedly fled his day-to-day life in Hawaii to "zen out" on a long solo trip to Asia before returning and gunning down Brian Thompson.</p>

<p>After leaving his co-living space in the US state, the 26-year-old set off to Asia earlier this year to soak in hot springs, meditate, and catch up on books, besides doing some writing of his own, according to The New York Times. During his travels, he visited Japan and Thailand. In between, he recorded a voice message to share with a friend he met while travelling abroad.<br />
<br />
“I want some time to zen out,” Mangione said in the audio message he sent his friend on April 27 this year. At the time, he was hiking in Japan's Nara region.<br />
<br />
Describing his Nara visit, Mangione said, "There's like these tiny little villages here, on the side of the cliffs — I'll send a photo. It's super lush, there's this beautiful river that cuts through the gorge".<br />
<br />
He further shared his desire to stay in the region for a month and "just meditate and just hot spring, and do some writing."<br />
<br />
A few weeks later, he sent another message to a friend when he was on Mount Omine in Japan. He even described the gruelling terrain and shared how women are not allowed to climb it.<br />
<br />
"This mountain is peak misogyny... I needed to stop getting distracted by women lol," he wrote to his friend whom he met during his travels.<br />
<br />
Soon after that, Mangione started losing touch with his friends and family.<br />
<br />
In June this year, a friend sent him a text, asking “Where in the world are you?”.<br />
<br />
But he did not receive any reply from Mangione, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/luigi-mangione-gunman-united-healthcare-shooting.html">The New York Times </a>reported.<br />
<br />
Thereafter, his family reached out to his friends late in the summer, saying they had not heard from him for months. Mangione was reported missing by his family in California on November 18.<br />
<br />
A few weeks after that, Mangione re-surfaced in New York City, where he now stands accused of killing the UnitedHealthcare boss on December 4.<br />
<br />
These details have emerged as investigators look into Mangione's whereabouts in the months leading up to Brian Thompson's murder.<br />
<br />
This comes after the New York Police Department (NYPD) earlier said they were looking at whether Mangione's back injury, which he suffered in July last year, had fueled the alleged vendetta against the medical industry.<br />
<br />
“As far as motive, it looks like he had animus toward the healthcare industry," an official earlier said.<br />
<br />
Mangione was taken into custody from Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday after a five-day manhunt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Hong Kong spent Rs 76 lakh ($90,028) earlier this year on a competition to rename two giant pandas, gifted by China, but ended up retaining the original names despite spending the huge sum. According to a report in the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3290596/hong-kong-spent-hk700000-panda-naming-contest-was-it-waste-money?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article" rel="noindex, nofollow">South China Morning Post </a>(SCMP)</em>, the giant panda renaming competition started in October where the public was invited to come up with fresh names for "An An" and "Ke Ke" -- the two bears, who arrived from Sichuan.</p>

<p>As per the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the taxpayer's money was spent to build a website for the activity, recruit staff, post advertisements on internet and Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations in addition to offering prizes to the winners.</p>

<p>The winner of the competition was awarded prizes worth Rs 5.16 lakh which included a tourbillon watch, valued around Rs 4 lakh and membership and vouchers for Ocean Park where the pandas are kept. Despite offering the prizes, the judges, who did not take any pay for their services, announced that the pandas would keep their original names.</p>

<p>Quizzed about the wastage of funds, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui said the authorities were not to know that the public would prefer keeping the original names.</p>

<p>Notably, the giant pandas in Hong Kong are usually named either after seeking suggestions from the public, or by keeping the names given to them while breastfeeding, or by adopting the names that were given to them by the authorities.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/giant-pandas-bao-li-qing-bao-flown-to-us-from-china-aboard-panda-express-6800580" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Giant Pandas Flown To US From China Aboard 'Panda Express'</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Giant pandas arrive</strong></h3>

<p>Male "An An" and female "Ke Ke" are both aged five, the equivalent of 15 in human years. The pair arrived in the country amid much fanfare in September when Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki and Tourism Minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung welcomed them at the Hong Kong International Airport in a glittering ceremony.</p>

<p>As per Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong, An An and Ke Ke could help bring in customers and generate revenue. “It is difficult to put a number on [costs] as it is more than just about the income or the park, or the profit or losses. We believe our social responsibility is strong,” Mr Pong <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3279984/hong-kongs-2-new-giant-pandas-and-ke-ke-touch-down-city-soon?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article" rel="noindex, nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>“Most importantly we want to bring people to the park, to buy tickets or annual passes to maintain a steady income flow,” he added.</p>

<p>The pandas were unveiled to the public last week with the park anticipating huge rush in the days leading up to Christmas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maye Musk, the mother of Elon Musk, has shared a 1990 photo of her son, taking everyone back to the time the family lived in Toronto. The image shows a young Elon Musk dressed in a black suit, white shirt and tie, offering a stark contrast to the image of wealth and luxury now associated with the billionaire.</p>

<p>"This photo was taken in our rent-controlled apartment in Toronto, with my mom's painting on the wall," Maye wrote, adding, "The suit cost $99 which included a free shirt, tie and socks. A great bargain!"</p>

<p>Ms Musk added the suit was her son's only one at the time and he wore it every day. "He wore this suit every day to his bank job in Toronto. I couldn't afford a second suit. We were happy," she said, emphasising the contentment they found despite their financial constraints.</p>

The Musk family, originally from South Africa, moved to Canada before eventually settling in the US. During these early years, Maye worked to support her children, facing numerous challenges in providing for them. In her memoir, 'A Woman Makes a Plan - Advice for a Lifetime of Adventure, Beauty, and Success,' she wrote about their struggles, including buying second-hand clothes and living frugally.<br />
<br />
“We couldn't afford to go out and eat. I fed them peanut butter sandwiches. My kids loved it! They didn't know they were deprived,” Maye wrote in her memoir.<br />
<br />
Despite the Tesla and SpaceX CEO's remarkable rise to fame and fortune, his mother expressed discomfort with labels like "wealthy" or "billionaire," preferring to focus on her son's intellect. "I don't like the word 'wealthy' or 'billionaire' because I think it is degrading. I think he's the genius of the world," she said in a recent interview with Fox Business.<br />
<br />
Elon Musk himself is known for his frugal approach to life. In 2020, he made headlines when he said on X that he had sold all his possessions and no longer owned a house. "I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house," read his post.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Undercover FBI agents were not present during the 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Donald Trump supporters, a Justice Department watchdog said Thursday in a report debunking a popular right-wing conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>"We found no evidence in the materials we reviewed or the testimony we received showing or suggesting that the FBI had undercover employees in the various protest crowds, or at the Capitol, on January 6," Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz said in an 88-page report.</p>

<p>Thousands of Trump supporters rushed in the US Capitol on January 6 in a bid to prevent congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's election victory.</p>

<p>Right-wing media and even some Republican lawmakers have spuriously claimed that undercover FBI agents provoked the attack on Congress, which followed a fiery speech by Trump in which he falsely claimed the election had been stolen.</p>

<p>The inspector general said that while no undercover FBI agents were present at the Trump rally or the Capitol, 26 FBI informants known as confidential human sources (CHS) were in Washington at the time.</p>

<p>Three of the informants had been tasked with reporting on domestic terrorist suspects while the others were there on their own.</p>

<p>"None of these FBI CHSs were authorized to enter the Capitol or a restricted area, or to otherwise break the law on January 6, nor was any CHS directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6," the report said.</p>

<p>The inspector general also said there had been an intelligence-gathering failure by the FBI ahead of the January 6 attack.</p>

<p>"While the FBI undertook significant efforts to identify domestic terrorism subjects who planned to travel to the Capital region on January 6," the report said, "the FBI did not take a step that could have helped the FBI and its law enforcement partners with their preparations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Specifically, the FBI did not canvass its field offices in advance of January 6, 2021, to identify any intelligence, including CHS reporting, about potential threats to the January 6 Electoral Certification," it said.</p>

<p>FBI deputy director Paul Abbate was quoted as saying this was a "basic step that was missed" in "understanding the threat picture prior to January 6."</p>

<p>Trump was impeached by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives following the attack on the Capitol, but acquitted by the Senate.</p>

<p>He is to return to the White House on January 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election.</p>

<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the assault on Congress. Trump has lauded them as "patriots" and "political prisoners" and pledged to pardon many of them when he returns to the White House.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover on Thursday (Dec 12) climbed atop Jezero Crater's rim at what the scientists have described as the "Lookout Hill" to reveal the mysteries of the Red Planet. Since first landing at the crater in February 2021, this is the first time that the rover has ventured outside to explore a region that is unlike anywhere it has investigated on the Red Planet. The rover took a little over three months and climbed 500 metres to reach the crater's rim where it is expected to analyse rocks that were deep inside the Martain surface.</p>

<p>"Status update: I've reached the rim of Jezero Crater! The ascent took 3.5 months and included 1,640 feet (500 m) of vertical climb. It was steep and slippery - but I'm built to do hard things," read a post by the rover on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>“During the Jezero Crater rim climb, our rover drivers have done an amazing job negotiating some of the toughest terrain we've encountered since landing,” <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/perseverance-rover/nasas-perseverance-rover-reaches-top-of-jezero-crater-rim/" rel="noindex, nofollow">said </a>Steven Lee, deputy project manager for Perseverance.</p>

<p>“They developed innovative approaches to overcome these challenges — even tried driving backward to see if it would help — and the rover has come through it all like a champ."</p>

<p>The Jezero Crater was formed 3.9 billion years ago due to a massive impact which meant Perseverance only examined rocks that were left there after the impact. However, outside the crater, the rocks buried under the Martain surface were thrown out, making them much older and suitable for potential life.</p>

<p>Since landing on Mars, Perseverance has completed four science campaigns viz., the "Crater Floor", "Fan Front", "Upper Fan" and "Margin Unit. Perseverance's fifth campaign is called the "Northern Rim" and in its first year, the rover will visit as many as four sites of geologic interest, collect samples and drive around 6.4 kilometres.</p>

<p>"The Northern Rim campaign brings us completely new scientific riches as Perseverance roves into fundamentally new geology," said Ken Farley, project scientist for Perseverance at Caltech in Pasadena.</p>

<p>After leaving Lookout Hill, Perseverance will slide down the other side of the rim called "Witch Hazel Hill". After the steep descent, the rover will turn towards "Lac de Charmes" -- a region located on the plains beyond the rim which is less likely to have been significantly affected by the formation of Jezero Crater.</p>

<h3><strong>Sign of life on Mars</strong></h3>

<p>In July this year, the rover discovered an intriguing rock sample, nicknamed "Cheyava Falls," which contains organic molecules and structures that could have been formed by microbial life.</p>

<p>''The rock exhibits chemical signatures and structures that could possibly have been formed by life billions of years ago when the area being explored by the rover contained running water,'' NASA said at the time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday said the ruling dispensation of Bangladesh is expected to ensure the safety of minorities.</p>

<p>Speaking during the Question Hour in Lok Sabha amid reports of attacks of Hindus in the neighbouring country, he said the treatment of minorities in Bangladesh is a matter of concern.</p>

<p>His statement comes a day after a student from Bangladesh swam across a river and entered India illegally, while a seventeen-year-old Hindu girl ran through the night and crossed over to the Indian side because she was being targeted for being an ISKCON devotee.</p>

<p>Bangladesh on Tuesday acknowledged 88 incidents of communal violence against minorities, primarily Hindus, following the ouster of then-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.</p>

<p>Interim government head Muhammad Yunus' press secretary Shafiqul Alam also said that 70 people have been arrested in those incidents.</p>

<p>He made the disclosure a day after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri flagged regrettable incidents of attacks on minorities and conveyed India's concerns, including those related to the safety and welfare of minorities, during his meetings with the Bangladeshi leadership.</p>

<p>In the Parliament, Jaishankar also said that for India to have good relations with Pakistan, the neighbouring country needs to show they are free of terrorists.</p>

<p>Responding to questions on India's Neighbourhood First Policy, he said the development projects, trade volume and exchanges with neighbours, barring Pakistan and China, answers if other countries have an "India first" policy.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's new leadership said Thursday it was searching for missing US journalist Austin Tice and had secured the release of another American it said had been held by the ousted government.</p>

<p>In 2022, US President Joe Biden accused Syria of holding Tice, a freelance photojournalist detained near Damascus a decade earlier, and demanded that the government of Bashar al-Assad release him.</p>

<p>The transitional government, which took the helm in Syria after Assad's ouster on Sunday, said that "the search for American citizen Austin Tice is ongoing".</p>

<p>"We confirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the US administration to search for American citizens disappeared by the former Assad regime," the transitional government's department of political affairs added in a statement on Telegram.</p>

<p>In recent days, Syrian residents and armed men have broken into government prisons, freeing inmates, some of whom have spent decades behind bars.</p>

<p>The political department's statement said that another US citizen, Travis Timmerman, "has been released and secured".</p>

<p>Residents of the Al-Zyabiyeh neighbourhood of Damascus said they had found Timmerman wandering around without shoes.</p>

<p>"The municipality guard Mousa Rifai found him, so we brought him to our house and fed him and he slept for about an hour," said Ziyad Nedda.</p>

<p>"He was held in the Palestine Branch, he wouldn't stop saying it. 'I was held in the Palestine Branch in Damascus'," he said.</p>

<p>The "Palestine Branch", also known as Branch 235, was a prison operated by the Syrian intelligence services under Assad.</p>

<h3><strong>Release 'huge Christmas present'</strong></h3>

<p>According to US media reports, 29-year-old Timmerman was last seen in Budapest, Hungary, in early June.</p>

<p>His sister Pixie Rogers described his release as a "huge Christmas present" and said she "can't wait for that day" she is reunited with her brother.</p>

<p>Timmerman's mother "is very, very ecstatic...overwhelmed, and just beyond super excited with this information that we got today," Rogers told the US network CBS.</p>

<p>Tice was working for Agence France-Presse, McClatchy News, The Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets when he was detained at a checkpoint in Daraya, a suburb of Damascus, on August 14, 2012.</p>

<p>Last week, the missing journalist's mother, Debra, told reporters her son is believed to be alive and is being "treated well," without providing further details.</p>

<p>The rebel forces, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), appointed an interim prime minister on Tuesday to lead Syria until March.</p>

<p>Assad fled the country over the weekend, ending a half-century of his family's iron-fisted rule.</p>

<p>Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments including the United States, though it has more recently sought to moderate its rhetoric.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Measuring 210 feet, the asteroid 2024 XW15 is said to be similar to a large aeroplane. It was expected to approach the planet on Friday at 9:42 AM IST, travelling at a massive speed of 25,859 miles per hour.</p>

<p>It was to pass within 4,010,000 miles of the Earth, around 16 times the distance between the planet and the Moon. Experts said there was nothing to worry about.</p>

<p><strong>Asteroid 2024 XC16</strong></p>

<p>Another asteroid confirmed to fly past the Earth is 2024 XC16, which measures roughly 100 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>It's expected to move past the planet at the speed of 46,269 miles per hour, while its closest approach will be within 3,280,000 miles of the planet. While this distance is less compared with the asteroid 2024 XW15, it is considered far enough to ensure the safety of the planet.</p>

<p>Asteroids, like the 2024 XW15, are relics of the early solar system that dates back to 4.6 billion years. These space rocks help researchers and scientists understand the Earth's history and the cosmos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The potential risk posed by these asteroids is not hypothetical. There have been instances when their collision has led to devastating consequences. Among the highly popular examples is the asteroid which is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Such major events underscore the need to monitor these space rocks and keep track of their movements to understand their trajectories. Advanced monitoring plays a valuable role in the timely implementation of mitigation strategies, should any of these asteroids pose a risk.</p>

<p>Tracking the orbits of these asteroids gives critical data for planetary defence efforts.</p>

<p>Over the years, NASA has developed advanced tools to track near-Earth objects (NEOs). NASA-backed Jet Propulsion Laboratory has employed cutting-edge radar systems to analyse the path of asteroids. Missions such as OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 have been highly successful in bringing asteroid samples back to Earth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is donating $1 million to US President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund and the company will air the event on its Prime Video service, an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Prime Video represents an in-kind donation worth another $1 million, the spokesperson said. The donations were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>Amazon joins another tech giant, Meta Platforms, in donating to the January 20 Trump inauguration. Meta will also give $1 million, a company spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and executive chairman, will meet with Trump next week, the president-elect said on Thursday in an interview with CNBC.</p>

<p>Trump has criticized the coverage of his first term as president by the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos.</p>

<p>The Post decided not to endorse a candidate in the November presidential election. The decision blocked an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, according to National Public Radio.</p>

<p>Bezos defended the move not to issue an endorsement, saying in an opinion piece in the paper that "most people believe the media is biased" and the Post and other newspapers needed to boost their credibility.</p>

<p>Trump raised a record $106.7 million for his 2017 inauguration festivities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US couple was shot dead in the violence-plagued western Mexican state of Michoacan, state prosecutors said on Thursday, just after the country's president had wrapped up a meeting with security officials aimed at addressing a wave of violence.</p>

<p>Identified as Gloria A, 50, and Rafael C, 53, the couple was traveling in a pickup in the municipality of Angamacutiro when they were shot on Wednesday night, the attorney general's office in Michoacan said in a statement.</p>

<p>While the woman died at the scene, the man died shortly afterward of his wounds in the hospital, the statement added. It was not clear why the couple, who were married, had been targeted and investigations are ongoing.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman added that the woman, who had obtained US citizenship, and the man, who was born in the US to Mexican parents, had family and a home in Angamacutiro.</p>

<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October, has promised to replicate nationally the success she had as mayor of Mexico City in bringing down the sprawling capital's murder rate.</p>

<p>But her first two months in office have been marked by an outbreak of cartel violence in several hot spots.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A woman seeking a single tooth extraction on July 26 at the makeshift clinic, located in a kitchen, was allegedly told she needed five teeth removed due to decay.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 70-year-old woman from Long Island, US, has been accused of running an unlicensed dental practice from her kitchen, allegedly performing extractions and other procedures for nearly $2,000, according to prosecutors. Gladys Serrano, a resident of a one-bedroom apartment on Greenwich Street in Hempstead, is facing criminal charges after allegedly practising dentistry without proper qualifications, reported the New York Post.</p>

<p>"Practicing dentistry without proper authorisation poses an incredibly serious risk to public health and safety. This defendant's alleged home operation endangered the well-being of at least one person in need of dental care," Nassau County District Attorney Anne T Donnelly said in a statement.</p>

<p>The accusations stem from an incident where a woman, seeking a single tooth extraction, contacted Serrano through a referral on July 26. Upon arriving at Serrano's makeshift clinic - a kitchen separated by a curtain - the patient was reportedly told she needed five teeth removed due to decay.</p>

<p>Serrano allegedly extracted the teeth and provided the patient with paper towels to absorb significant bleeding, advising her to rinse with salt water. Over the following months, the patient returned multiple times, hoping to receive a dental bridge. Despite Serrano's efforts to create moulds and adjust impressions, the victim was never provided with a bridge that fit properly. During this period, the victim reportedly paid Serrano $1,950.</p>

<p>A search of Serrano's apartment uncovered numerous items related to dental procedures, including used instruments, extraction tools, tartar scrapers and moulds. Prosecutors also noted the discovery of medication vials, dental needles and antibiotics, including Amoxicillin and Lidocaine.</p>

<p>A review of New York State records revealed that Serrano was not licenced to practice dentistry.</p>

<p>She pleaded not guilty during her arraignment on December 10, facing one count of unauthorised practice of a profession. The judge released Serrano under pre-trial supervision with electronic monitoring and also ordered her to surrender her passport and restricted her travel within the state.</p>

<p>Authorities believe Serrano may have treated other people as well. Those who suspect they were victims have been asked to contact the Nassau County District Attorney's Office of Immigrant Affairs.</p>

<p>If convicted, Serrano could face up to four years in prison. She is scheduled to appear in court again on January 8, 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Baba Vanga's 2025 predictions include a catastrophic war between the East and West, alien contact leading to a potential crisis, advancements in telepathy and nanotechnology, and significant scientific breakthroughs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Baba Vanga's 2025 Predictions: </strong>Vangelia Pandeva Gushterova, also known as Baba Vanga, was a blind Bulgarian mystic who died in 1996 at the age of 85. Even after her death, people all across the world are still fascinated by her prophecies. Called the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans,' Baba Vanga claimed that she lost her sight at the age of twelve and then developed the gift of prophecy. One of her most prominent forecasts was the September 11, 2001, attack on the Twin Towers in New York.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/baba-vanga-and-nostradamus-have-made-the-same-chilling-prediction-for-2025-war-in-6883428">Baba Vanga </a>made several chilling predictions for 2025, many of which suggest death and destruction. Her 2025 prophecies, which continue to intrigue people, include warnings of catastrophic global events. These forecasts are concerning because they appear to predict global unrest that might affect the entire planet. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/baba-vangas-predictions-for-2024-and-when-the-world-might-end-5368311">Baba Vanga</a>'s predictions are a subject of constant interest and concern due to her capacity to predict such occurrences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are a few of the Nostradamus of the Balkans' extremely outrageous but believable prophecies.</p>

<h3><strong>The destruction of Europe</strong></h3>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/baba-vangas-2025-predictions-warn-34290956?int_source=nba"><em>the Daily Star,</em></a> the mystic predicted war and the absolute destruction of the West-oh joy. She said, "As soon as Syria falls, expect a great war between the West and the East. In the spring, a war in the East will begin, and there will be a Third World War. A war in the East that will destroy the West." And in another prediction, she claimed, "Syria will fall at the feet of the winner, but the winner will not be the one." It's hard to argue about this one, given it's clearly happening in front of our own eyes.</p>

<h3><strong>Alien contact</strong></h3>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/baba-vangas-2025-predictions-warn-34290956?int_source=nba"><em>news portal, </em></a>Vanga warned: "Humanity will make contact with extraterrestrial life, possibly leading to a global crisis or apocalypse."</p>

<p>With the promise of Donald Trump releasing all files the United States Government holds on aliens when he gets into power, it's possible that this prediction is far more accurate than we'd like to believe.</p>

<h3><strong>Telepathy is not far off</strong></h3>

<p>Baba Vanga predicted that humanity would develop telepathy by 2025, allowing for direct mind-to-mind communication. This advancement, she believed, would revolutionise human interaction.Elon Musk's brain chip has already been making waves with a form of telepathy where a person controls technology, but could he finally crack a human-to-human version?</p>

<h3><strong>A year of scientific breakthroughs</strong></h3>

<p>Baba Vanga predicted 2025 would bring major scientific and medical breakthroughs, including advancements in telepathy and nanotechnology. However, she also cautioned about the potential dangers of misusing these technologies for destructive purposes, though her exact quotes are now unavailable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is working to get an American citizen found on Thursday in Syria out of the country and bring him home, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Jordan, where he held meetings to discuss the political transition of Syria.</p>

<p>In media reports, the man was identified as Travis Timmerman.</p>

<p>"In terms of American citizen who was found just today, I can't give you any details on exactly what's going to happen, except to say that we're working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria," Blinken told reporters in Aqaba, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But for privacy reasons, I can't share any more details about this," Blinken added.</p>

<p>CBS News reported that Timmerman identified himself as an American from Missouri and that he was freed from a prison earlier in the week after Syrian rebel groups ousted the country's longtime president Bashar al-Assad over the weekend.</p>

<p>Assad fled to Russia after a 13-year civil war and more than five decades of his family's autocratic rule, during which Syria ran one of the most oppressive police states in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Following his ouster, Syrians flocked to the infamous prisons where the Assad regime is estimated to have held tens of thousands of detainees.</p>

<p>Blinken added that the efforts to locate Austin Tice, another US citizen who was abducted in Syria over a decade ago was still continuing.</p>

<p>"No update on Austin Tice, except to say that every single day, we are working to find him and to bring him home, making sure that the word is out to everyone that this is a priority for the United States," Blinken said.</p>

<p>Tice, a former US Marine and a freelance journalist, was 31 when he was kidnapped in August 2012 while reporting in Damascus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said on Sunday the US government believes Tice is alive. He has tasked his team with doing whatever it takes to bring Tice home, according to people familiar with the directive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

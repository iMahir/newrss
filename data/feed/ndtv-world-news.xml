       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has shared a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Tesla's latest innovation - Cortex, a cutting-edge AI training supercluster being built at Tesla Headquarters in Austin.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the Tesla CEO gave the world a view of the Cortex supercluster, a massive array of supercomputers. "Video of the inside of Cortex today, the giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI," Mr Musk wrote on X.</p>

<p>The facility is expected to play a crucial role in developing and refining Tesla's AI models, which will be used to improve or enhance the company's electric vehicles, energy products and other technologies.</p>

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1827981493924155796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Earlier in July, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would bring a 50,000 GPU cluster online, doubling down on its Dojo custom AI chip supercomputer. The cluster will increase Tesla's capabilities to scale full-scale driving FSD and other AI initiatives.</p>

<p>Mr Musk also addressed internal Nvidia emails revealing plans to ship thousands of GPUs reserved for Tesla to his private ventures X and xAI. He stated that the GPUs were needed to fill Tesla's data centres and would be used to support Tesla's AI initiatives.</p>

<p>Tesla's CFO, Vaibhav Taneja, mentioned that the company still expects capital expenditures to pass $10 billion despite a dip in Q2 capex, as per a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musk-tesla-to-bring-50000-gpu-cluster-online-doubling-down-on-dojo-supercomputer/">DataCentreDynamics</a>. Mr Musk also launched a poll asking users whether Tesla should invest $5 billion in his AI startup xAI.</p>

<p>The announcements come as Tesla reported second-quarter earnings that missed expectations, with a decline in revenue and profits. However, Elon Musk remains committed to advancing Tesla's AI capabilities, stating that the company has "no choice" but to make Dojo work due to the high demand for Nvidia GPUs. Mr Musk aims to make Dojo a success, with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815850297895576040">8,000 H100-equivalent training online</a> by year-end.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's xAI aims to release Grok 2 in August and work on Grok 3, which will rival OpenAI's GPT-5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Ukrainian drone strike on a residential building in Saratov, Russia, has drawn chilling comparisons to the 9/11 attacks, as video footage of the incident circulates on social media.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war shows no signs of ending soon, with daily reports of devastation emerging from the battlefield. The conflict has now encroached on residential areas, affecting ordinary citizens. A recent video has surfaced, capturing footage of a Ukrainian drone striking a residential building in Saratov. The attack bears a chilling resemblance to the way planes collided with the World Trade Centre during the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>The Russian regional health ministry told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sputnikglobe.com/20240826/four-people-injured-after-drone-attack-on-russias-saratov---regional-health-ministry-1119908853.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Sputnik,</em></a> "Four people were injured after a drone attack on the Russian city of Saratov, including one woman who was hospitalised in serious condition.".</p>

<p>"One woman was hospitalised in serious condition in one of the medical institutions of the city of Saratov. Three injured persons received assistance on the spot," it said.</p>

<p>Several social media handles shared a video on X, showing the aftermath of a drone strike on a high-rise apartment building in Saratov. The attack caused significant damage and disrupted air travel in the region.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dutch data protection watchdog said Monday it hit ride-hailing app Uber with a 290-million-euro ($324 million) fine over the transfer of personal data of European drivers to US servers.</p>

<p>The regulator said the transfers were a "serious violation" of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as they failed to appropriately protect driver information.</p>

<p>"Uber did not meet the requirements of the GDPR to ensure the level of protection to the data with regard to transfers to the US. That is very serious," Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) chairman Aleid Wolfsen said in a statement.</p>

<p>The DPA said Uber collected sensitive information of European drivers, including taxi licences, location data, photos, payment details, identity documents, "and in some cases even criminal and medical data of drivers".</p>

<p>Over a two-year period, the DPA said, the information was transferred to Uber's US headquarters without using transfer tools.</p>

<p>"Because of this, the protection of personal data was not sufficient," the DPA said.</p>

<p>Uber said it would appeal the fine.</p>

<p>"This flawed decision and extraordinary fine are completely unjustified," an Uber spokesperson said in a statement</p>

<p>"Uber's cross-border data transfer process was compliant with GDPR during a 3-year period of immense uncertainty between the EU and US. We will appeal and remain confident that common sense will prevail," the statement said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person has died and two others were still missing a day after an ice cave collapsed in southeast Iceland while a tour group was visiting the area, police said Monday.</p>

<p>A group of 25 people of "several nationalities" were on an organised tour of the glacier Breidamerkurjokull together with a guide, when the cave collapsed, police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police said that four people got stuck under the ice and two of them had been found.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Sudurland police said the two people recovered were seriously injured, but added in a later statement early Monday that one of them had been "pronounced dead at the scene."</p>

<p>The other person was transported to a hospital by helicopter and was in a "stable" condition.</p>

<p>Rescue services began a search operation for the two missing Sunday and were continuing the search on Monday.</p>

<p>"A large number of rescuers and responders have taken part in the operation," police said, adding that the conditions were "difficult."</p>

<p>Authorities decided to temporarily suspend the search on Sunday evening once it became too dark and it was no longer considered safe.</p>

<p>The glacier where the accident happened is near the glacial lagoon Jokulsarlon, one of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/worst-volcanic-activity-in-50-years-in-iceland-after-major-volcano-eruption-6400507" target="_blank">Iceland's</a> more popular tourist destinations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lamis al-Jaar says she can hardly sleep at night after hardline Jewish settlers violently assaulted her and four other members of her Israeli Bedouin family, sparking outcry across the country.</p>

<p>On August 9, the 22-year-old got lost while driving with her young daughter, two sisters and a niece from the Bedouin city of Rahat in southern Israel towards Nablus, a large Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>The women say that when they asked a man for directions, they unwittingly set in motion what Israeli police would later describe as a "serious attack" -- one that heightened concerns about rising settler violence and spurred an outpouring of support for the family.</p>

<p>The man they approached sent them down the wrong road, then blocked their car when they tried to turn around, allowing a dozen assailants to descend on the vehicle, throwing stones and brandishing weapons.</p>

<p>Lamis, a teacher's aide in a kindergarten, was certain she was going to die. She told AFP how one of the men threatened her daughter Elaf, just two and a half years old, "with the barrel" of his firearm.</p>

<p>Her sister Raghda al-Jaar, a 29-year-old assistant in a dentist's office, said the men shattered the car windows and sprayed its occupants with tear gas.</p>

<p>"I said... that we were Israeli citizens," Raghda recounted, but when one of the men realised she was calling the police he threw a rock at her and shouted: "You will not leave here alive!"</p>

<p>Despite being outnumbered, the group managed to flee and were eventually rescued by Israeli police and soldiers.</p>

<p>Police said they had "accidentally entered" Givat Ronen, an outpost of the Jewish settlement of Har Bracha, south of Nablus.</p>

<h3><strong>Religious nationalists</strong></h3>

<p>The area is run by members of the so-called hilltop youth, religious nationalists who dream of settling all the biblical land of Israel, and who sometimes also clash with Israeli security forces.</p>

<p>Israel's Bedouins are descendants of Muslim shepherds who once roamed freely across desert expanses far beyond the country's current borders.</p>

<p>Like other Arab minorities in Israel, they often complain of discrimination.</p>

<p>Rahat, where the al-Jaar family lives, is home to one of the biggest concentrations of Bedouins.</p>

<p>During the interview with AFP, which took place at the home of their father Adnan al-Jaar, Lamis and Raghda described their injuries: fractured fingers and back pain for Lamis and a head injury for Raghda, whose left leg is also in a cast.</p>

<p>Two days after the attack, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called Adnan al-Jaar to tell him he was "shocked" by the violence and that "all citizens of Israel deserve equal and decent treatment", his office said.</p>

<p>Adnan al-Jaar, a 59-year-old truck driver who like his daughters switches easily between Hebrew and Arabic, told AFP such outreach "makes us feel good", even though he fears the crime, like other instances of violence, could go unpunished.</p>

<p>The police have so far announced the arrest of five suspects, four of whom remain in custody while the fifth is under house arrest.</p>

<h3><strong>Chorus of support</strong></h3>

<p>The attack against the al-Jaars occurred against the backdrop of worsening violence in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Israeli settlements in the territory are illegal under international law, and the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-israeli-settlements-threaten-creation-of-palestinian-state-says-un-5199759">United Nations</a> considers them an obstacle to peace with Palestinians.</p>

<p>But settlements have grown under all governments, both left and right after Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, and they have increased significantly since the formation in December 2022 of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's current government.</p>

<p>Netanyahu appointed several far-right ministers who support the annexation of the entire West Bank, an agenda they have pursued even more aggressively since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip on October 7.</p>

<p>The violence meted out to the al-Jaars nevertheless appears to have shaken Israel, and myriad voices have denounced it.</p>

<p>Centre-right opposition lawmaker Matan Kahana visited the al-Jaar home to show solidarity, saying he was "reassured that the majority of the Israeli people condemn this act".</p>

<p>Rabbi Benny Lau, known as a moderate Orthodox figure, posted a photo on Facebook of his meeting with Adnan al-Jaar, accompanied by a message emphasising the aspirations of "the millions... who want to live together".</p>

<p>Amit Segal, a television personality known for his right-wing views, condemned the remarks of a far-right parliamentarian whom he accused of colluding with "supporters of terrorism" by trying to shift blame for the August 9 attack onto the victims.</p>

<p>Ordinary Israelis have also spoken out.</p>

<p>Noa Epstein Tennenhaus, 41, recently drove an hour and a half with her husband and their four children to present a toy to young Elaf.</p>

<p>"I cried" upon learning of the attack, she told AFP.</p>

<p>"I imagined being in the position of Lamis in the car and being attacked by these monsters."</p>

<p>"Blind hatred is going to get us all killed in the end if we don't stand up to it," she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Thai court will sentence Thursday a famed Spanish actor's son charged with murdering and dismembering a Colombian plastic surgeon he met online.</p>

<p>The case against Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, a 30-year-old chef and son of actor Rodolfo Sancho, has generated enormous interest in his home country, with scores of Spanish reporters flying in for the trial.</p>

<p>He is accused of murdering and dismembering Edwin Arrieta Arteaga on the tourist island of Koh Pha Ngan last year.</p>

<p>His trial on charges of premeditated murder, hiding a body and destroying documents was held in April on nearby Koh Samui, another tourist hotspot known for its turquoise waters and rave parties.</p>

<p>Sancho denies premeditated murder, but remains in detention after admitting he killed Arrieta, 44, in what he says was self-defence.</p>

<p>He has also admitted hiding the body, but denies destroying the Colombian's passport.</p>

<p>The two had agreed to meet up after getting to know each other online.</p>

<p>The trial heard that Sancho had placed parts of Arrieta's body in plastic bags and distributed them around Koh Pha Ngan.</p>

<p>Though his crimes are punishable by the death penalty, Arrieta's family has said they would prefer life in prison.</p>

<p>"Let him be left in Thailand so he can take time, all the time that God gives him to live, to think about what he did," Darling Arrieta, the victim's sister, said in an HBO documentary about the case.</p>

<p>"He not only dismembered my brother, he dismembered a family."</p>

<h3><strong>'An accident'</strong></h3>

<p>Sancho's father said in the same documentary that Arrieta had threatened his son, after which "there was a fight, and in this fight there was an accident".</p>

<p>The defence maintains that Sancho acted in legitimate self-defence after Arrieta tried to force him to have sex.</p>

<p>"He tried to rape me, and we fought," Sancho said in a statement quoted by the Spanish daily El Mundo.</p>

<p>According to the paper, Sancho said he didn't immediately inform the police of Arrieta's death because he was in shock, and because it was all "an accident".</p>

<p>But a lawyer for the victim's family, Juan Gonzalo Ospina, said in a recent interview with El Mundo that Sancho was living a "false reality".</p>

<p>"He continues to deny responsibility for what he did," he said.</p>

<p>The Thai police, he added, "have done a commendable job" reconstructing the crime and finding evidence.</p>

<p>"When Sancho went to report the disappearance of Edwin Arrieta looking for an alibi, they already knew the author of the crime was him," he said.</p>

<p>Ospina said it was proven at the trial in April that Sancho had bought knives, plastic bags and cleaning supplies ahead of the crime, and kept them in the room where the killing took place.</p>

<p>"This is indisputable," he added.</p>

<p>He said Sancho acknowledged at trial that Arrieta went into convulsions after he hit him.</p>

<p>"In his statement he admitted that afterwards, he finished him off. That is to say, he murdered him," he added.</p>

<p>However, a lawyer for Sancho's family, Carmen Balfagon, told the Spanish news programme Cronica that they were "very optimistic, because in the trial we demonstrated that there was no premeditation".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ballistic missile launchers that North Korea has said it <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-deploys-250-ballistic-missiles-on-southern-border-6265937">plans to deploy</a> on the border with South Korea are believed to have a range of 110 km (68 miles), allowing them to target Chungcheong Province south of Seoul, the Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>North Korean state media reported earlier this month that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the delivery of 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers described as modern tactical weapons personally designed by Kim to be transferred to the border.</p>

<p>Experts have said Pyongyang could use them to attack or threaten Seoul.</p>

<p>South Korean intelligence officials, however, are sceptical over whether North Korea can supply enough missiles for the 250 missile launchers while it also supplies weapons to Russia as part of bilateral military cooperation, Yonhap reported on Monday, citing lawmakers on the intelligence committee.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia have been accused of conducting <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/key-points-of-north-koreas-landmark-strategic-partnership-treaty-with-russia-5930166">arms trade</a> by Seoul and Washington to help replenish Russia's stock of missiles and artillery for its war with Ukraine.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines has confirmed two more mpox virus infections of the milder clade 2 variety, its health ministry said Monday, bringing the number of active cases to three.</p>

<p>"We continue to see local transmission of mpox clade II here in the Philippines, in Metro Manila in particular," Health Minister Teodoro Herbosa said in a statement.</p>

<p>The newly confirmed cases were a 37-year-old male in Metro Manila who had rash on his body last week and was brought to a government hospital, and a 32-year-old male from the capital who had skin lesions on his body.</p>

<p>The Philippines announced last week it had detected a case of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-is-mpox-how-it-spreads-critical-symptoms-and-more-6409144" target="_blank">mpox</a> virus' milder variant in a 33-year-old male who had no travel history outside the Philippines.</p>

<p>The three cases this year means the Philippines has had 12 laboratory-confirmed case since July 2022.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization earlier this month declared mpox a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-declares-mpox-global-health-emergency-for-second-time-in-2-years-6339042" target="_blank">global public health emergency</a>, its highest form of alert, for the second time in two years, because of an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>A new form of the virus has triggered global concern as it seems to spread easily though routine close contact.</p>

<p>The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, with children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's incursion into Russia, which entered a third day Thursday, appears to be an unprecedented assault which experts say could aim to draw Russian resources away from other areas or to undermine morale.</p>

<p>Ukraine has maintained an unusual silence, with no one officially acknowledging that an operation was even taking place. Top officials have declined to comment, even on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Russia has given only scarce updates as it seeks to strike a balance between denouncing the escalation and avoiding panic.</p>

<p>Here are some key issues surrounding the cross-border attack:</p>

<h3><strong>What has happened?</strong></h3>

<p>At about 8.00am (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, Ukrainian forces launched an assault into Russia's southwestern Kursk region, according to the Russian army.</p>

<p>Russia says Ukraine deployed around 1,000 troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks.</p>

<p>Russia accused Ukrainian forces of indiscriminately attacking civilian buildings, and rushed reinforcements, air and artillery firepower to repel the attack. A state of emergency has been declared in the region.</p>

<p>At least five civilians have been killed and 31 wounded since Tuesday, Russian officials said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Russia evacuated several thousand people from zones that have been shelled, while Ukraine announced a mandatory evacuation of around 6,000 people in the Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it special?</strong></h3>

<p>The assault seems unprecedented due to its reported scale, and because it appears to involve regular Ukrainian troops.</p>

<p>Fighters from Ukraine have made several brief incursions into Russia before. Some have been by units of Russians fighting in support of Kyiv -- the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.</p>

<p>In mid-March, during the Russian elections, Ukrainian assault groups repeatedly tried to gain control of territory in the Belgorod region, officials had said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's allies seem surprised by the assault, which had been surrounded in secrecy. The United States says it has reached out to Kyiv for information.</p>

<p>Ukrainian military expert Sergiy Zgurets, who runs his own consultancy, told AFP that "the photos of the destruction of Russian and Ukrainian equipment, helicopters, the use of aviation, the use of artillery on both sides" indicated a significant military operation.</p>

<h3><strong>What gains have Ukrainian forces made?</strong></h3>

<p>Ukrainian troops have advanced up to 10 kilometres (six miles) into Russia, the US-based Institute for the Study of War said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The advance has centred on the logistical hub of Sudzha, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants about eight kilometres (five miles) from the Ukraine border.</p>

<p>Russian military bloggers, who have links to the army, also reported Kyiv had made significant advances with some reporting that Ukrainian soldiers control some parts of Sudzha.</p>

<h3><strong>What could be the aim of this raid?</strong></h3>

<p>The goals of the assault are unclear, this early in the operation and without any official comment from Ukrainian forces, but experts suggest several hypotheses.</p>

<p>Some said the incursion may seek to draw Russian reserves away from the nearby Kharkiv front in Ukraine, where Russia launched an offensive in May.</p>

<p>"For now, this is a limited operation, whose direct consequence will be to reduce the stability of the Russian group attacking/hovering over Kharkiv," Ukrainian military analyst Oleksiy Kopytko said on social media.</p>

<p>"Judging by the scale and intensity of the Ukrainian operation, sooner or later, the enemy will be forced to pull troops from other operational areas," Ukrainian military observer Kostiantyn Mashovets said on Facebook.</p>

<p>The assault could also have a psychological effect -- boosting the morale of Ukrainians who have seen their troops suffer a string of setbacks while trying to destabilise Russia.</p>

<p>"Another goal is to show Russian society what it feels like when your territory is occupied," Sergiy Solodkyy, deputy director at Kyiv's New Europe Centre think tank, told AFP.</p>

<p>Finally, some argue that if Ukraine could hold the territory, it would gain leverage against Russia in hypothetical peace negotiations.</p>

<p>Gaining an edge is crucial to Ukraine ahead of the US presidential election in November. Republican candidate Donald Trump is a Ukraine-sceptic.</p>

<p>"This is coercion to peace... ideally, Russia should withdraw troops," Solodkyy said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the Democratic National Convention (DNC) stage in Chicago, Little Amara shouts, "Everybody over here, say 'Kama'." Then joins in her sister, Leela, "Everybody over here, say 'La'." The lesson continues, "Together 'Kama-la.'" The excited crowd shouts in unison, <em>"Kaama-la"</em>.</p>

<p>The two young women are the grand-nieces of the US Vice-President and the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. It's ironic that a nation that has seen its Vice President work tirelessly for the past three-and-a-half years still needs a lesson in pronouncing her first name. Even then, they don't get it right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pronunciation of her name is just scratching the surface. Kamala, in essence, is yet another example of how across the West, even if political leaders of colour manage to reach the top, they find themselves operating within systems that remain resistant to profound transformation and dominated by White leaders. Behind their historic achievements still lies that complex web of said and unsaid racism, bias, and discrimination, which continues to affect politicians and celebrities of colour, even at the highest levels of power. Barack Obama, Rishi Sunak, and even leaders who deny this reality, like Nikki Haley and Priti Patel, have all had to contend with it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Justifying Her Name, And Also Her Place In America</strong></h2>

<p>At the DNC, after that elaborate pronunciation lesson, 'Kaamala' - as the Americans pronounce it - went on to introduce herself to a nation she was born in 59 years ago. Daughter to immigrant parents, she tried to connect with her people emotionally. She spoke about herself, her beloved Indian mother, her sister, her Jamaican connection through her father, and her strong Indian links. The media was kind enough to say she "reintroduced" herself to all Americans. In her 40-minute-long speech, she urged people of colour to "never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are".&nbsp;</p>

<p>And yet, she dedicated her whole speech telling all Americans who she was. She had to. It was not enough for her country folks that in 2021 she shattered all glass ceilings by becoming the first woman, first Black American, and first Indian American to hold the office of Vice-President of the United States. She passionately declared in Chicago, "I promise to be a President for all Americans." And, as if unsure of the people's trust in her, Harris pleaded with the people to put faith in her, "You can always trust me to put country above party and self."</p>

<h2><strong>Biden Didn't Have To Re-Introduce Himself</strong></h2>

<p>The difference between President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is perhaps the fact that Biden was Obama's running mate twice, and both times, he did not have to get someone to tell the nation whether his name was pronounced as 'Biden', 'Beden', or 'Byden'. He did not have to "re-introduce" himself, and he did not have to punch above his weight.</p>

<p>Those privileges are not available to Kamala Harris.&nbsp;It has been a euphoric few days for Harris, and it's true that her party has welcomed her with open arms, and that she has so far been getting good press. But the question is, is America itself ready to accept a woman - and a person of colour - as President?</p>

<h2><strong>Obama Couldn't Escape Racism. Kamala Can't Either</strong></h2>

<p>When Barack Obama burst onto the political centre stage, campaigning for the coveted post in 2008, many had questioned whether America was ready for a Black President. He swept away the last racial barrier in American politics without much trouble. But even Obama faced questions about his birth certificate and legitimacy, something that has come to be known as the 'birther conspiracy'. It's a false and racist theory that claims Obama was not born in the United States and was therefore ineligible to be president. The theory was heavily promoted by former President and now Harris's Republican opponent Donald Trump, who was a private citizen at the time.</p>

<p>When he was finally elected, Obama offered hope and promised change-something Harris is repackaging today. But Trump, too, is repackaging his old playbook. He recently questioned Harris's racial identity in Chicago during a heated exchange at a convention for Black journalists; he had earlier even insinuated that Harris was "not American enough" to be the President. Kamala herself has spoken publicly about her experiences with racism and discrimination. In her memoir The Truths We Hold, she wrote about her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, teaching her and her sister how to cope with racism: "My mother would say, 'You will be faced with people who don't like you because of the colour of your skin. But you must never let that define you.'" In a 2020 speech, she spoke about the challenges of overcoming stereotypes: "As a woman of colour, I've had to fight to be seen, to be heard, and to be believed... But I've never let anyone define me or my potential."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Sunak's Story</strong></h2>

<p>The problem non-White politicians face is universal across the West. During the UK election campaign early last month, a leader of Nigel Farage's Reform Party passed racist comments against his own sitting Prime Minister, calling Sunak a "Paki". Sunak was angry, but he did not push back enough except to show his hurt during a media interview: "My two daughters have to see and hear Reform people who campaign for Nigel Farage calling me an 'effing P***'. It hurts, and it makes me angry, and I think he has some questions to answer."</p>

<p>There was jubilation all over the UK when Rishi Sunak became the Prime Minister in 2022. From relative obscurity in 2015, when he was elected as an MP for the first time, to becoming the country's first Indian-origin, Hindu Prime Minister, Sunak's was a fairytale story. Back then I had been told by White people, Pakistani and Bangladesh-origin people that Rishi Sunak was the right choice. His leadership was lauded as evidence of the UK's commitment to diversity and meritocracy. But despite his position, Sunak was subjected to racial slurs and scepticism about his loyalty and cultural affiliations. Even the office of the Prime Minister could not exempt him from the prejudices and challenges faced by other people of colour.</p>

<p>The experiences of Obama, Kamala, and Sunak, along with other politicians of Indian descent, such as Priti Patel in the UK or Nikki Haley in the US, illustrate a broader pattern where the representation of minority groups in politics is no doubt celebrated but does not necessarily translate into meaningful change for those communities. The control, decision-making powers and authority remain with the White masters - even if leaders like Patel and Haley continue to defend racist and discriminatory actions or remarks against the people of their communities.</p>

<h2><strong>The Battle Ahead For Kamala</strong></h2>

<p>Anyway, it has been smooth sailing for Kamala Harris so far. But she faces an opponent known for dealing in personal insults. Apparently, Trump knew before Joe Biden withdrew himself from the race that he would be replaced by Harris. He told a crowd about it much before her nomination, "I got him [Joe Biden] out of the race, and that means we have Kamala." Trump then added, "She's so bad. She's so pathetic." He has already questioned her racial identity, and is now on to find a nickname for her that sticks. &nbsp;His personal attacks continue as he keeps reminding his supporters that she laughs like a "lunatic" and is "crazy".</p>

<p>For Kamala Harris, after a fantastic first few weeks, the honeymoon will well and truly be over soon.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 102-year-old woman in Britain opted for a unique birthday celebration this year. On August 25, Manette Baillie, who was once married to a paratrooper and served in the Women's Royal Naval Service during World War II, skydived out of a plane to become the oldest woman to do so.</p>

<p>Ms Baillie jumped with UK Parachuting Services Ltd as part of a charity event, raising money for Benhall's village hall, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, and the East Anglian Air Ambulance, which once saved her son's life on the Isle of Wight after a diving accident in 1969. Her efforts have so far raised over £10,000 of her £30,000&nbsp;target, inspiring others to give back.</p>

<p>Soon after her jump from 7,000 feet above Beccles Airfield in East Anglia, Ms Baillie told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cvg3k02wlemo">BBC</a> radio that she was "breathless".</p>

<p>"It was a bit scary. I must admit I shut my eyes very firmly," she added.</p>

<p>On healthy ageing, she explained, "I just want other people who are getting towards 80 and 90 not to give up anything. Just keep going. I've been so lucky to be fit and well that I've got to do something with it, that's really the back of it," she said. I can't just waste it, other people are crippled with arthritis, and I'm not."</p>

<p>This wasn't the first time the former war veteran had sought an adrenaline rush. For her 100th birthday, she drove around Silverstone in a Ferrari at 130mph, setting another record. Speaking to Radio 4, she affirmed her fearless nature, saying, "I really don't do fear. It's no good. It's 130 miles per hour, to begin with, before they pull the rip cords for the parachute, and then it's gently floating down."</p>

<p>Ms Baillie was motivated to take on a skydiving challenge after a friend's 85-year-old father pulled off something similar. "If an 85-year-old man can do it, so can I," she remarked.</p>

<p>Prince William also commended Ms Baillie for her daring spirit, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/25/manette-baillie-britain-oldest-skydiver-suffolk">The Guardian</a> reported. In a heartfelt note, the Prince wrote, "Catherine and I hear you'll be marking your 102nd birthday with a parachute jump! Given your history of racing a Ferrari at 100, we're not surprised!"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have been in the United States for over four years, but looks like the Duke of Sussex is still struggling to make it his new home. He's said to have turned into "an angry boy" in America and "desperately" misses the United Kingdom, say his friends.</p>

<p>For Prince Harry, who turns 40 on September 15, things haven't "turned out how he wanted," says his close friend, who claimed he was one of the few people still receiving the "the odd WhatsApp" message from him, The <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-sunday-times-magazine/article/prince-harry-age-40-birthday-tqt9d2rdx">Sunday Times</a> reported.</p>

<p>"He's an angry boy. Things haven't turned out how he wanted. I think he misses being over here (in Britain) desperately and wants to be admired more. Anyone who knows him feels he'd rather be top of the pops here with everyone loving him, as they do with (Price) William and Kate," one of Harry's oldest friends told the publication.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan's friend circle began to rapidly shrink after they moved to the US in a bid to start anew.</p>

<p>Since then, the duo has been part of several projects, including their six-part documentary for Netflix, the bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey as well as Harry's memoir <em>Spare.</em></p>

<p>After leaving the UK, they have only returned a few times.</p>

<p>Another close friend of Harry told the news outlet that many were still unable to forgive him over his decision to air the family laundry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I can't believe he'd stoop so low. It's outrageously disloyal. Oprah, Netflix and then the book? Three strikes and you're out," the person said.</p>

<p>A friend of Harry and Meghan said the couple could have left the Royal Family with "dignity and decency and not trashed the institution."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The conclusion is they've made money from trashing his family," the person noted.</p>

<p>More people close to him have claimed that he was at a crossroads. "All he does is spend time looking back. If only he could wrench his neck around and look forward," one of his former advisers said.</p>

<p>In the Netflix series, released in December 2022, the 39-year-old talked in detail about moving to California with his family. "We are exactly where we are supposed to be," he said but added he missed the UK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A person, who has known him since his teenage years, said Harry has "ended up isolated from his family and most of his old mates" and is currently in an environment "where your friendships are not like the ones you forged as a young man."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">As the globe faces a rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria – making traditional antibiotics ineffective – specific viruses could offer a solution.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Viruses called bacteriophages, or phages, target bacteria but can't infect humans or other higher organisms. Phages inject their DNA into the bacterial cell, multiply to large numbers using the resources of the host, and then burst out to infect more bacteria in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Essentially, they are a naturally occurring, self-replicating and specific antibiotic. Discovered more than 100 years ago, their use against bacteria was largely sidelined in favour of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Our new research looked at one particular protein used by phages to bypass the natural defences of bacteria. We found this protein has an essential control function by binding to DNA and RNA.</p>

<p>This increased understanding is an important step towards using phages against bacterial pathogens in human health or agriculture.</p>

<h3><strong>Bacterial defence systems</strong></h3>

<p>There are hurdles to using phages to target bacteria. Much like our bodies have immune mechanisms to fight off viruses, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance">bacteria </a>have also evolved defences against phage infections.</p>

<p>One such defence is “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”, or <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr">CRISPR</a>, now better known for its applications in medicine and biotechnology. CRISPR systems in general act as “molecular scissors” by cutting DNA into pieces, be it in a lab-based setting or, in nature, inside a bacterium to destroy a phage.</p>

<p>Imagine wanting to use a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109452/">phage </a>against an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. The only thing standing in the way of that phage killing the bacteria and eradicating the infection might be the bacterium's CRISPR defence which renders the phages useless as an antimicrobial.</p>

<p>That's where knowing as much as possible about phage counter-defences becomes important. We are investigating so-called anti-CRISPRs: proteins or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06612-5">other molecules</a> that phages use to inhibit CRISPR.</p>

<p>A bacterium that has CRISPR might be able to stop a phage from infecting. But if the phage has the right anti-CRISPR, it can neutralise this defence and kill the bacterium regardless.</p>

<h3><strong>The importance of anti-CRISPRs</strong></h3>

<p>Our <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07644-1">recent research</a> focused on how an anti-CRISPR response is controlled.</p>

<p>When faced with a powerful CRISPR defence, phages want to automatically produce large amounts of anti-CRISPR to increase the chance of inhibiting CRISPR immunity. But excessive production of anti-CRISPR prevents the replication of the phage and is ultimately toxic. This is why control is important. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this control, phages have another protein in their toolbox: an anti-CRISPR-associated (or Aca) protein that frequently occurs alongside the anti-CRISPRs themselves.</p>

<p>Aca proteins act as regulators of the phage's counter-defence. They make sure the initial burst of anti-CRISPR production that inactivates CRISPR is then rapidly dampened to low levels. That way, the phage can allocate energy to where it is most needed: its replication and, eventually, release from the cell.</p>

<p>We found this regulation occurs at multiple levels. For any protein to be produced, the gene sequence in the DNA first needs to be transcribed into a messenger–RNA. This is then decoded, or translated, into a protein.</p>

<p>Many regulatory proteins function by inhibiting the first step (transcription into messenger-RNA), some others inhibit the second (translation into protein). Either way, the regulator often acts as a “road block” of sorts, binding to DNA or RNA.</p>

<p>Intriguingly and unexpectedly, the Aca protein we investigated does both – even though its structure would suggest it is merely a transcriptional regulator (a protein that regulates the conversion of DNA to RNA), very similar to ones that have been investigated for decades.</p>

<p>We also examined why this extra-tight control at two levels is necessary. Again, it seems to be all about the dosage of the anti-CRISPRs, especially as the phage replicates its DNA in the bacterial cell. This replication will invariably lead to the production of messenger-RNAs even in the presence of transcriptional control.</p>

<p>Therefore, it appears additional regulation is required to reign in anti-CRISPR production. This comes back to the toxicity of excessive production of this counter-defence protein, to the harm done when there's “too much of a good thing”.</p>

<h3><strong>Fine-tuned control</strong></h3>

<p>What does this research mean in the grand scheme of things? We now know a lot more about how anti-CRISPR deployment occurs. It requires fine-tuned control to enable the phage to be successful in its battle against the host bacterium.</p>

<p>This is important out in nature, but also when it comes to using phages as alternative antimicrobials.</p>

<p>Knowing every detail about something as obscure-sounding as anti-CRISPR-associated proteins might make all the difference between the phage succeeding or succumbing —and between life or death, not just for the phage, but also for a person infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tragedy struck in Manhattan on Saturday when a wrong-way crash claimed the life of Kirk Walker, a 38-year-old groom-to-be, just one day before his wedding. According to the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/25/us-news/kirk-walker-man-killed-in-nyc-wrong-way-crash-killed-the-day-before-his-wedding/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post</a></em>, Mr Walker and his cousin, Rob McLaurin, 40, were celebrating his bachelor party when their car was hit head-on by a pickup truck travelling in the wrong direction. Both men were transported to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital where they were pronounced dead. According to authorities, the driver responsible for the wrong-way crash fled the scene on foot and has not yet been caught. Meanwhile, a passenger in the vehicle was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment of their injuries.</p>

<p>Mr Walker, a father of three, was eagerly anticipating his special day, but his heartbroken bride was instead left to face unimaginable grief on what should have been the happiest day of her life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''I'm supposed to be in my wedding dress right now — not in mourning. I feel like this is a TV show and I'm going to wake up any minute and go back to my real life. Every hour since it happened, I'm having a different emotion take me over'', his fiancee Shauntea Weaver&nbsp;told<em> The Post.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Notably, the couple was set to tie the knot in a huge ceremony at the Royal Manor wedding venue in Garfield, New Jersey.</p>

<p>''Our ceremony was supposed to be at 5:00 p.m. today — in a few hours. He died 24 hours before our wedding. It's devastating, and not just for me. He has three children who loved him immeasurably. They are heartbroken that their father's been taken. He was such a generous, hard-working man. He had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody. Such a hard worker,'' Ms Weaver added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple had built a thriving car rental business together, which had flourished under Mr Walker's dedication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Weaver's focus has now shifted to seeking justice for her fiance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''They told me the driver left his DNA on the airbags. So they have that. Also, the passenger is in the hospital with broken legs and he needs to speak up. Two lives were lost in a reckless car crash,” she continued. They need to pay for killing two innocent people. Nothing will bring him back. But we are seeking justice,'' she said.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Lenovo computer salesman has found himself in a swirl of trouble, fired from his job after he says a bladder condition forced him to relieve himself in a lobby of his Times Square hotel.</p>

<p>Richard Becker, 66, is seeking at least $1.5 million from the American subsidiary of the Chinese computer giant after being dismissed for the wrongful wee, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in New York State Supreme Court and seen by AFP.</p>

<p>He accused the company of "discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of New York State and New York City human rights laws."</p>

<p>According to the suit, Becker was returning to his hotel near New York's Times Square after a work dinner in February when he found himself "overwhelmed" and forced to answer nature's call in a vestibule located on a separate floor from the main lobby.</p>

<p>"A coworker noticed Becker urinating, and -- out of apparent spite and malice -- promptly reported him to HR, even though Becker's conduct caused no harm to anyone whatsoever," the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>Becker said he has been dealing with a chronic bladder condition since 2016 and is under the treatment of a urologist. The court filing said Lenovo colleagues and managers were aware of his condition.</p>

<p>"No sympathy, let alone compliance with the law, would be forthcoming from Lenovo. Instead, within days, Becker was terminated by his employer, following a sham HR 'investigation' in which he was not even interviewed," the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>The Long Island man has been unemployed since.</p>

<p>Lenovo did not immediately respond to an after-hours request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry has found a new mentor and "father figure" in Canadian music icon David Foster, according to sources close to the pair, The Times reported. The 74-year-old music producer has become a close friend and confidant to the Duke of Sussex during his time in the US, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-sunday-times-magazine/article/prince-harry-age-40-birthday-tqt9d2rdx ">the report</a>.</p>

<p>Foster, who lives near Harry and Meghan Markle in Montecito, California, has apparently filled a void left by Prince Harry's strained relationships with his own family, particularly King Charles. Katharine McPhee, Foster's wife, described the bond between Harry and her husband as "like father and son".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How they became friends</strong></p>

<p>Meghan Markle attended the same Catholic middle school in Los Angeles as Foster's wife, Katharine McPhee. Although they weren't close friends at school, they reconnected in London when McPhee was starring in the musical Waitress on the West End. It was then that David Foster and Prince Harry hit it off.</p>

<p>Foster and McPhee helped the Sussexes find a place to stay in Canada after they left the UK in 2020. The 16-time Grammy winner helped the couple find a $14.1 million rental home in Victoria, British Columbia, while they looked for a permanent residence in California.</p>

<p>Foster told the Daily Mail back in 2020 that he was honoured to help the ex-royal couple, citing his Canadian roots and the commonwealth connection. "I was just happy through my friend to facilitate what I could for them, and it looked like they had a great rest," he said. "They are a young modern family. I'm sure they want to balance their commitment to the crown and be a 2020 family."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since then, Harry and Foster have been close friends. McPhee said, "My husband has a really, really beautiful relationship with Harry. They're so cute."</p>

<p>In October 2020, the Sussexes moved to Santa Barbara, and the two couples have been inseparable ever since. They were spotted <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/inside-harry-meghans-friendship-with-katharine-mcphee-david-foster/">enjoying a double date</a> at Lucky's Steakhouse in Montecito, where Katharine McPhee, then pregnant with her son Rennie, chatted with Meghan Markle about purchasing a home in the area.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov has founded wildly popular social networks as well as a cryptocurrency, amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune and locked horns with authorities not just in Russia but around the world.</p>

<p>Still a few months shy of his 40th birthday, the man once dubbed the "Russian Zuckerberg" after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg now finds himself under arrest in France after being sensationally detained at a Paris airport this weekend.</p>

<p>While still in his 20s, the Saint Petersburg native shot to fame in Russia after founding the VKontakte (VK) social network which catered to the needs of Russian-language users and outgunned Facebook throughout the former USSR.</p>

<p>After disputes with the Russian authorities and ownership battles, he sold out of VKontakte and founded a new messaging service called Telegram which rapidly gained traction but has also proved controversial with critics condemning an alleged lack of control on extreme content.</p>

<p>As these dramas raged, Durov remained a mercurial and at times mysterious figure, rarely giving interviews and restricting himself to sometimes enigmatic declarations made on Telegram.</p>

<p>A self-avowed libertarian, Durov has championed confidentiality on the Internet and encryption in messaging.</p>

<p>He has defiantly refused to allow the moderation of messages on Telegram, which allows users to post videos, pictures and comments on "channels" that can be followed by anyone.</p>

<p>Durov, 39, was targeted in France by a warrant over offences alleged to have been conducted on Telegram, ranging from fraud to drug trafficking, cyberbullying and organised crime, including promoting terrorism and fraud.</p>

<p>Investigations have been entrusted to the cyber unit of the French gendarmerie and the national anti-fraud office. He was still in police custody on Sunday, according to two sources close to the case.</p>

<h3><strong>'Thanks for all the fish'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In 2006, having just graduated from the University of Saint Petersburg, Durov launched VKontakte (VK), attracting users even while its founder remained a shadowy figure.</p>

<p>In a stunt typical of his unpredictable behaviour, Durov in 2012 showered high-denomination notes on pedestrians from VK's headquarters on top of a historic bookstore on Saint Petersburg's Nevsky Prospekt.</p>

<p>But after running into trouble with the Kremlin for refusing to hand over the personal data of users to the Russian security services (FSB), he sold out of the company and left Russia in 2014.</p>

<p>Durov resigned from VK with a typical flourish, posting a picture of dolphins and the slogan "So Long and Thanks for All the Fish", a title in the famous "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" science fiction series.</p>

<p>He developed the Telegram messaging service with his brother Nikolai while travelling from country to country and launched the service in 2013.</p>

<p>He settled in Dubai and obtained citizenship of the Caribbean island archipelago of Saint Kitts and Nevis, then, in August 2021, won French nationality following a low-profile procedure about which Paris remains highly discreet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Telegram enjoyed stratospheric success, presenting itself as a champion of individual freedoms, refusing "censorship" and protecting the confidentiality of its users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This rankled with authorities, especially in his home country and in 2018, a Moscow court ordered the blocking of the application. But the imposition of the measure was shambolic and three days later, protesters ironically bombarded the FSB headquarters with paper planes, the symbol of Telegram.</p>

<p>Since then, Russia has abandoned its efforts to block Telegram and the messaging service is used by both the Russian government and the opposition, with some channels boasting several hundred thousand subscribers.</p>

<p>Telegram also plays a key role in Russia's war against Ukraine, documented by bloggers from both sides who post their analyses and videos of the fighting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pro-Moscow channels run by so-called "Z-bloggers" who back the war have proved hugely influential and are sometimes critical of Russian military strategy.</p>

<h3><strong>'Love the privacy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Durov eschews traditional media interviews but in April sat down with ultra-conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson for an extensive discussion.</p>

<p>People "love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram," Durov told Carlson.</p>

<p>He is also not shy of posting messages on his own Telegram channel, claiming to lead a solitary life, abstaining from meat, alcohol and even coffee. Always dressed in black, he cultivates a resemblance to the actor Keanu Reeves in the film "Matrix".</p>

<p>In July, he boasted of being the biological father of more than 100 children thanks to his sperm donations in a dozen countries, describing this as a "civic duty" in an attitude to parenting that echoes that of a fellow tech mogul, the X and Tesla chief Elon Musk.</p>

<p>According to Forbes magazine's latest estimate, Durov's fortune is $15.5 billion. But toncoin, the cryptocurrency he created, has plummeted by more than 15 per cent since the announcement of his arrest.</p>

<p>Telegram has long been in the sights of European judicial authorities over allegations it spreads conspiracy theories, shared calls for murder and hosts drug sales platforms. Durov, however, insists that he responds to every request to remove content calling for violence or murder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

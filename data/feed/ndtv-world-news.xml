       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three brothers from the high-profile Alexander family, known for their influence in luxury real estate, have been arrested in Miami, US, on charges of sexual assault and rape. Twin brothers Oren and Alon Alexander, aged 37, and their elder sibling Tal Alexander, 38, are accused of luring, drugging and assaulting numerous women over more than a decade.<br />
<br />
Federal prosecutors in New York allege the brothers used their wealth and social standing to exploit women from 2010 to 2021. According to the indictment, they employed “deception, fraud and coercion” to entice victims to social events, often under the pretence of romantic interest.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who are the Alexander brothers?</strong><br />
<br />
Oren and Alon Alexander have long been prominent figures in the high-society circuit, frequently seen at glamorous events in Miami, New York and lavish parties across the Mediterranean. Oren and Tal Alexander manage the Alexander Team, a real estate group that claims to have facilitated sales exceeding $7 billion (around Rs 58,000 crore) in luxury markets such as New York, South Florida and Aspen, Colorado.<br />
<br />
The duo has facilitated sales for clients such as Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Tommy Hilfiger, billionaire Ken Griffin and ‘Hamilton' producer Sander Jacobs, according to the Los Angeles Times.<br />
<br />
Tal and Oren were prominent brokers at Douglas Elliman before launching their venture several years ago, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/12/11/alexander-brothers-real-estate-agents-for-ultrarich-arrested-on-sex-trafficking-charges/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. Their portfolio includes facilitating the sale of a condo in Miami Beach to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West in 2018 for $15.5 million (around Rs 129 crore). They also managed the sale of a mansion in London for $122 million (around Rs 1,012.6 crore).<br />
<br />
In 2016, they represented billionaire Leon Black in listing his Miami condo for $18.5 million (around Rs 1,536 crore). Apart from this, in 2019, Tal and Oren sold a $238 million (around Rs 19,800 crore) New York City penthouse to Griffin, marking the most expensive residential sale in US history.<br />
<br />
Known for their extravagant lifestyles, a Details magazine feature in 2013 described them as earning “rock-star salaries” and rubbing shoulders with the ultra-wealthy.<br />

The Forbes report said Alon holds an executive role at the family-owned security company, Kent Security.<br />
<br />
Tal and Oren Alexander embarked on their real estate journey in New York City in 2008. The brothers cultivated a network of ultra-wealthy clients. Their now-private social media accounts once showcased their attendance at high-profile events and luxury vacations.<br />
<br />
Oren Alexander was on the prestigious Forbes 30 Under 30 real estate list in 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This galaxy, which is stretched and magnified, glitters with 10 distinct star clusters that formed at different times.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has successfully detected and measured a galaxy that existed just 600 million years after the Big Bang, offering a striking glimpse into the early Universe. This discovery is particularly significant as the galaxy's mass closely resembles what the Milky Way's mass might have been during the same stage of its formation.</p>

<p>This galaxy, which is named the "Firefly Sparkle," is unique from the other galaxies observed by JWST at this point because it is lighter. The galaxy shines with star clusters, and researchers carefully studied 10 of these clusters to learn about its development.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it would be possible to resolve a galaxy that existed so early in the universe into so many distinct components, let alone find that its mass is similar to our own galaxy's when it was in the process of forming," said Lamiya Mowla, co-lead author of the paper and an assistant professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. "There is so much going on inside this tiny galaxy, including so many different phases of star formation."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/found-first-actively-forming-galaxy-as-lightweight-as-young-milky-way/"><em>NASA, </em></a>Webb was able to image the galaxy in crisp detail for two reasons. One is a benefit of the cosmos: A massive foreground galaxy cluster radically enhanced the distant galaxy's appearance through a natural effect known as gravitational lensing. And when combined with the telescope's specialisation in high-resolution infrared light, Webb delivered unprecedented new data about the galaxy's contents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Authorities in Queensland, Australia, have confirmed a "major historical breach of biosecurity protocols" after hundreds of virus samples went missing from a public health laboratory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Queensland, Australia, have confirmed a “major historical breach of biosecurity protocols” after hundreds of virus samples went missing from a public health laboratory. Queensland Health has been directed to launch an investigation into the incident, which is described as an unacceptable lapse in safety measures.<br />
<br />
According to an official statement by the Queensland government on Monday, 323 vials containing dangerous viruses, including Hendra virus, Lyssavirus and Hantavirus, went missing from the Queensland Public Health Virology Laboratory in August 2023.<br />
<br />
The Hendra virus, only found in Australia, is a zoonotic virus that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Lyssavirus is a family of viruses that includes rabies, which can be fatal without proper medical intervention. Similarly, Hantavirus can cause serious illness and death, as noted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br />
<br />
The laboratory where the breach occurred is responsible for providing diagnostic services, research, and surveillance for various pathogens, including viruses carried by mosquitoes and ticks. But it remains unclear whether the missing samples were stolen, destroyed or just lost. The government statement assures the public that there is “no evidence of risk to the community” at this time.<br />
<br />
In response to the breach, Queensland Health has launched an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident and prevent similar occurrences in the future. Timothy Nicholls, the Minister for Queensland Health, said in a statement, “With such a serious breach of biosecurity protocols and infectious virus samples potentially missing, Queensland Health must investigate what occurred and how to prevent it from happening again.” Nicholls added that the investigation would also examine the laboratory's current policies, procedures and staff conduct.<br />
<br />
Experts have expressed concern about the gravity of the situation. According to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/deadly-virus-samples-went-missing-lab-major-biosecurity-breach-say-authorities" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Fox News Digital</a>, Sam Scarpino, director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University, US, called the incident a “critical biosecurity lapse,” adding, “The pathogens reported missing are all high-consequence and could pose a threat to the public.”<br />
<br />
Scarpino pointed out that some strains of Hantavirus have case fatality rates of up to 15 per cent, far higher than the fatality rate of COVID-19.<br />
<br />
Despite the severity of these pathogens, Queensland's Chief Health Officer, Dr John Gerrard, reassured the public through a media statement that there is no evidence of a risk to public health, saying that the virus samples would “degrade very rapidly outside a low-temperature freezer and become non-infectious.”<br />
<br />
Dr. Gerrard also highlighted that Queensland has not had any reported human cases of Hendra or Lyssavirus in the last five years, and no confirmed Hantavirus infections have ever been recorded in Australia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Videos surfaced purportedly showing an aircraft crash, with claims suggesting the plane was carrying Assad when it crashed near Homs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria continues to face intense conflict, with heavy airstrikes targeting Aleppo, Homs, and nearby regions, leading to significant civilian casualties and displacement. Amid reports of Syrian rebels capturing key areas of Damascus, effectively ending Bashar al-Assad's decades-long rule, questions persist regarding his whereabouts. Adding to the uncertainty, a 7-second video (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/jenny.ingram.562/posts/2645363038996558/?rdid=rYhhhwBrgEGPJgwS" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/Minneapolis420/status/1865676657308119088" target="_blank">here</a>) has surfaced, purportedly showing an aircraft crash, with claims suggesting the plane was carrying Assad when it crashed near Homs. Let's investigate the authenticity of this video.</p>

<p>The archived post can be found <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/03000e34-7d7e-42a3-b420-5f8cfea9e100" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">her</a>e.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Visuals of an aircraft crash event that was carrying Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong>: The visuals in the video show the incident on 02 September 2024, when a MiG-29 fighter jet of the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed in Barmer, Rajasthan, during a routine training mission. The flight was owned by the Indian Air Force, and the crash was caused by a technical snag. The pilot ejected safely. The visuals have nothing to do with Syria. Though there have been unconfirmed reports about a flight from Syria disappearing from the radar, there is no definitive information whether Bashar al-Assad was in the flight. Hence the claim is <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>

<p>To investigate the authenticity of the video, we conducted a reverse image search on Google. This led us to the same 7-second video posted by the X handle "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/zarrar_11PK/status/1830665743916216649" target="_blank">Eagle Eye</a>" on 02 September 2024. The caption reads, "<em>A MiG-29 aircraft of the Indian Air Force crashed near the Uttarlai Airbase in Bandra, Barmer</em>." Barmer is located in Rajasthan, India, not near Homs in Syria.</p>

<p>Further research led us to a video posted by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV7GHG7uN84" target="_blank">NDTV</a> on YouTube on 02 September 2024. The video shows the crash of a MiG-29 aircraft, with the caption, "MiG 29 Crash | MiG-29 Fighter Jet Crashes In Rajasthan, Pilot Safe." The video clearly identifies the incident as occurring in Rajasthan, India, and confirms that the pilot was safe.</p>

<p>After conducting an in-depth review of the incident, we found multiple news reports (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mig-29-fighter-jet-crashed-near-barmer/article68598521.ece" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">here</a>, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iafs-mig-29-fighter-jet-crashes-near-agra-report-101730719376947.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mig-29-fighter-jet-crashes-in-rajasthan-pilot-safe-6476114" target="_blank">her</a><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mig-29-fighter-jet-crashes-in-rajasthan-pilot-safe-6476114" target="_blank">e</a>) confirming the details. On 02 September 2024, a MiG-29 fighter jet of the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed in Barmer, Rajasthan, during a routine night training mission. According to these reports, the crash was caused by a "critical technical snag," which prompted the pilot to eject safely. There were no casualties or damage to property, as the crash occurred in an area away from populated regions. The jet caught fire after the crash, but no fatalities were reported on the ground. A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the incident further.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx89reeevgo" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">BBC news</a>, following the fall of Damascus, Assad fled to Moscow, reportedly granted asylum after resigning.

However, there is no definitive information on whether Bashar al-Assad was on the flight</p>

<p>To sum up, the visuals of an IAF aircraft crashing in Rajasthan were falsely shared as the plane crash of Bashar al-Assad.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Australia is planning to come up with new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia is planning to come up with new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news. The new rules announced by the Australian government on Thursday will require social media platforms and search engines, whose annual Australian revenue is over $250m, to enter into commercial deals with media organisations or risk being hit with higher taxes.</p>

<p>The move succeeds the world-first law, passed by Australia in 2021, which was designed to make tech giants, such as Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google, pay local publishers for the links that lure readers and advertising revenue.</p>

<p>With new rules, the Australian government is planning to pile pressure on global tech giants to pay publishers or face the risk of paying millions to continue operations in Australia.</p>

<p>"The news bargaining initiative will ... will create a financial incentive for agreement-making between digital platforms and news media businesses in Australia," Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones said, according to a Reuters report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The charge will be offset for any commercial agreements that are voluntarily entered into between the platforms and news media businesses, Jones added.</p>

<p>The proposed new rules come as Australia toughens its approach to the mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Last month, Australia became the first country to ban children under the age of 16 from social media.</p>

<p>Canberra also plans to threaten the companies with fines for failing to stamp out scams.</p>

<p>That move is seen as setting a benchmark for other countries handling of big tech companies.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What's Next For Big Techs</strong></h3>

<p>Google, ByteDance through TikTok, and Meta through its various platforms would fall within the scope of the charges under the new rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, X, formerly Twitter, would not be covered under the regulations.</p>

<p>"The proposal fails to account for the realities of how our platforms work, specifically that most people don't come to our platforms for news content and that news publishers voluntarily choose to post content on our platforms because they receive value from doing so," a Meta spokesman said commenting on the proposed rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meta, which also owns Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, has been scaling back its promotion of news and political content globally to drive traffic and says news links are now a fraction of users' feeds.</p>

<p>In 2021, after Australia passed laws to make the US tech giants compensate media companies, Meta briefly blocked users from reposting news articles.</p>

<p>But, it later struck deals with several Australian media firms, such as News Corp and national broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corp.</p>

<p>However, the company said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024 and would discontinue the news tab on Facebook in Australia and the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company has already cancelled the tab last year in Britain, France and Germany. In 2023, it also blocked users in Canada from reposting news content after its government took similar action.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A postmortem examination revealed Sara had sustained 71 external injuries, including bruises, burns, and human bite marks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The father and stepmother of 10-year-old Sara Sharif have been convicted of her murder after subjecting her to over two years of "horrific suffering."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sara endured abuse that included being hooded, burned, and beaten before her body was discovered with numerous injuries at the family home in Woking, Surrey, last year, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0dper5nx4o" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A postmortem examination revealed Sara had sustained 71 external injuries, including bruises, burns, and human bite marks. She also suffered at least 25 fractures, including a broken hyoid bone in her neck and 11 fractures to her spine, inflicted by beatings with a cricket bat, metal pole, and mobile phone, The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/11/sara-sharif-child-suffering-years-abuse" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Guardian</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, her father, Urfan Sharif, 43, and stepmother, Beinash Batool, 30, were found guilty of murder, while her uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, was convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child.</p>

<p>Following the verdict, Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Chapman of Surrey Police stated that in his 30-year career, he had never encountered "such horrific suffering of a young person."</p>

<p>"It's one of those cases that touches every single person who's involved in it, and I'm sure has touched many members of the community as well," he told BBC.</p>

<p>Detective Chief Inspector Craig Emmerson described Sara's murder as "one of the most challenging and distressing" cases Surrey Police has ever encountered. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement delivered outside the Old Bailey, he said: "The murder of a child is utterly shocking, but the abuse Sara endured throughout her short life makes this case especially harrowing." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza emphasized that Sara's tragic death exposed "profound weaknesses in our child protection system." &nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that Sara was failed in the most devastating way by the safety net of services meant to protect her," she said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"From before her birth, she was known to social care, yet she slipped so completely off their radar that by the time she died, she was invisible to them all. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"We cannot afford any more reviews, strategies, or debates. When we say 'never again,' we must mean it. Let Sara's legacy be real change." &nbsp;</p>

<p>The commissioner called for significant reforms, including "proper oversight" for children like Sara who are being home-schooled. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The trial revealed that a post-mortem examination found Sara had suffered injuries including "probable human bite marks," an iron burn, and scalding from hot water before her death on August 8 last year. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Police discovered Sara's body in a bunk bed, alongside a note written in her father's handwriting that stated: "Whoever sees this note, it's me, Urfan Sharif, who killed my daughter by beating." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharif initially alleged that Batool was responsible for Sara's death, claiming he had falsely confessed in the note and a subsequent phone call to shield his wife. &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, during a dramatic shift under cross-examination, Sharif later admitted "full responsibility" for his daughter's death. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Meta Platforms, under CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has made a $1 million donation to US President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, The WSJ reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms, under CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has made a $1 million donation to US President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-donates-1-million-to-trumps-inaugural-fund-32a999c1 " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The WSJ</a> reported. The donation follows an election cycle where Trump openly threatened repercussions for any perceived meddling by technology leaders. He called for Zuckerberg to “spend the rest of his life in prison” if he tried to interfere with the 2024 election.<br />
<br />
Over the years, the Zuckerberg-Trump relationship has been a rollercoaster. From criticisms of Trump's immigration policies in 2017 to Facebook's suspension of Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riot, their interactions have swung between cooperation and confrontation. In 2021, Trump also accused Zuckerberg of trying to rig the election against him.<br />
<br />
Neither Zuckerberg nor Meta contributed to Trump's 2017 inaugural fund or President Biden's in 2021.<br />
<br />
But in recent years, Zuckerberg has strategically worked to bridge divides with Republicans, hosting dinners and meetings with key figures, including Trump at Mar-a-Lago. At one such dinner, he demonstrated Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and gifted a pair to the president-elect. This meeting was part of a series of discussions between Zuckerberg's advisers and Trump's team, including incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Sen. Marco Rubio.<br />
<br />
The $1 million donation was reportedly decided upon before this meeting and came amid an effort by Zuckerberg to reposition Meta as neutral in political matters. In the past, Republicans accused Zuckerberg of partisan behaviour, particularly during the 2020 election, when he donated $400 million to support election infrastructure. Zuckerberg denied the claims and said the funds were a one-time pandemic-related contribution.<br />
<br />
Zuckerberg has also taken steps to align more closely with Republican concerns. He criticised the Biden administration for pressuring Facebook to moderate COVID-19 content.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Publicly, Trump's opinion of Zuckerberg has varied, ranging from criticism over past disputes to recent praise for Zuckerberg's neutrality in election matters. The two have found common ground in recent months, with Zuckerberg lauding Trump's response to the assassination attempt on him as “badass.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, a disturbing video showing a man being publicly hanged went viral.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of a public execution has been circulating on social media, claiming to show Bashar al-Assad's cousin Suleiman Hilal al-Assad being publicly hanged.</p>

<p><strong>Claim: </strong>The video depicts the execution of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's cousin Suleiman Hilal al-Assad in public following the fall of his regime.</p>

<p><strong>Fact: </strong>The claim is false. The video shows the execution of Ammar Al-Asaad, a common citizen, who was sentenced to death by the Criminal Court in Daraa Governorate.</p>

<p>After the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, a disturbing video showing a man being publicly hanged went viral on social media. Sharing the video, users claimed that Assad's cousin Suleiman Hilal al-Assad was hanged in Latakia's public square in Syria.</p>

<p>An X user shared the video with the caption, "Bashar Assad's cousin Sulaiman Hilal Assad was hanged in Latakia's public square." (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/Lailafatimeh/status/1866250585831567671">Archive</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Fact Check</strong></p>

<p>NewsMeter found the claim to be false. The man executed has been identified as Ammar Al-Asaad, a common citizen from the Daraa Governorate in Syria.</p>

<p>A reverse image search of the viral video led us to a Facebook account named <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/people/%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A/100071899239367/">Haki Hourani</a>, which posted two videos on December 7 showing the execution of a man from different angles, similar to the now-viral clip. Upon further review of the account, we found two additional videos showing the execution of a woman. The account stated that the man and woman were executed in the public square of the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh in eastern rural Daraa. It identified the man as Ammar Al-Asaad and the woman as Diana, both convicted of murdering the young man Mohammed Ziad Al-Haj Ali. The account also mentioned that Diana was the wife of Mohammed Ziad Al-Haj Ali.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We confirmed that the viral video and the other videos posted by this account depict the execution of the same person. The outfit and the surroundings seen in the videos are identical.</p>

<p>We also found Facebook posts from other <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=1190506033080500&amp;id=100063633441229&amp;_rdr">Syrian accounts</a> dated December 7, alleging that Diana Batieh, the wife of the dead, conspired with Ammar Al-Asaad and facilitated his entry into the house. Ammar then killed Mohammed Ziad Al-Haj Ali by shooting him in the head while he was sleeping on August 11, 2024. The crime was uncovered the next day, and the suspects confessed, leading the Daraa court to issue a death sentence. They were executed in the presence of large crowds at Khirbet Ghazaleh.</p>

<p>The posts also carried a poster bearing the photo and name of the victim in Arabic. We found the same poster in the videos posted by the Facebook account Haki Hourani.</p>

<p>Following these leads, we conducted a keyword search and found a report published on December 7 by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://daraa24.org/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B4%D9%86%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D9%82-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%88-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%A8/">Daraa 24 Network</a>, a media outlet that covers news from southern Syria, particularly the Daraa Governorate. According to the report, on November 14, the Criminal Court in Daraa Governorate sentenced Ammar Al-Asaad and Diana to death for the murder of Mohammed Ziad Al-Haj Ali on the night of August 11. They were executed by hanging in the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh.</p>

Both reports stated that the viral video shows the execution of Ammar Al-Asaad, following the ruling by the Criminal Court in Daraa Governorate for his involvement in the murder of the young man Mohammed Ziad Al-Haj Ali, in collaboration with the latter's wife. The reports also clarified that the video does not show the execution of the ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's cousin.</p>

<p><strong>Conflicting Reports On Suleiman Hilal al-Assad's Death</strong></p>

<p>An Arabic report by Al Bawaba from December 9 stated that Assad's cousin, Suleiman Hilal al-Assad, was reportedly killed after being shot by armed men in central Latakia city, Syria. However, there has been no official confirmation of the death of Suleiman Hilal, according to another report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://almashhad.com/article/773112298002792-News/187408336486212-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B6-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%85-%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AF/">Al Mashhad</a>.</p>

<p>NewsMeter cannot confirm the death of Suleiman Hilal al-Assad due to conflicting news reports. However, our investigation found that the viral video shows the execution of Ammar Al-Asaad, a common citizen convicted on criminal charges. We could not independently verify whether he is related to Bashar al-Assad.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime has pushed Syria into a new era. The sudden collapse of the regime, in power for over half a century, has left many grappling with the practical and symbolic changes that will shape the future of the war-torn nation.</p>

<p>In Damascus, scenes of jubilation mingled with unease. Families stormed prisons in search of missing loved ones, while rebel factions continued to engage with each other, and foreign actors, to restore order. The collapse of the Assad regime leaves a power vacuum fraught with challenges.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively with NDTV, Syrian journalist and filmmaker Abdo Fayyad, in Damascus, says the culmination of the rebel offensive has its roots in 2016 in Idlib in northwestern Syria. Initially limited to Idlib city and its northern countryside, opposition offensives over the years brought control over these areas. This unprecedented sweep of victories marked the beginning of a post-Assad Syria.</p>

<p>"Since 2016, Idlib city and its northern countryside have been under opposition control," Mr Fayyad told NDTV. "Following offensives conducted by opposition forces the previous year, effective control over Idlib city and parts of its surrounding countryside was established. However, in 2019, opposition forces lost key cities, including Saraqib, Maarat al-Numan, and Khan Shaykhun. By late 2024, the opposition regained control of these cities, as well as Aleppo, Hama, Homs, and Damascus."</p>

<p>One pressing concern is the safety of Syria's diverse communities, including Christians, Druze, and other minorities. Cities like Aleppo, Hama, Damascus, and Lattakia - known for their cultural and religious diversity - have so far reported no instances of mistreatment, however, ISIS still remains active in some pockets of Syria even though they no longer hold large territories.</p>

<p>"Opposition forces have been actively reaching out to community leaders to ensure a harmonious transfer and transition in post-Assad Syria," Mr Fayyad said.</p>

<h2><strong>Operation 'Deter Aggression'</strong></h2>

<p>The opposition's military operations, termed "Operation Deter Aggression," are led by the armed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), and supported by various factions. Their primary aim is to facilitate the return of displaced Syrians and secure opposition-held territories. With 7.2 million internally displaced people and 6.3 million refugees abroad, this initiative holds significant implications for millions yearning to rebuild their lives.</p>

<p>There is also a big question hanging over the presence of Russian forces near the port city of Tartus and the Lebanese border. Rebel leaders, however, have taken a conciliatory approach, Mr Fayyad said. "The opposition assured diplomatic personnel of their safety and protection. Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, the leader of HTS has publicly reassured Iraq that the Syrian conflict would not spill over into its borders."</p>

<p>The rebel advance has prompted waves of displaced Syrians to return to their hometowns. Roads once dominated by military convoys are now filled with families carrying their belongings. For many, this marks the end of years of displacement. Checkpoints once manned by government forces now stand abandoned, replaced by opposition fighters trying to maintain order.</p>

<p>Rebel leaders have announced plans for a transitional government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, a seasoned administrator from rebel-held northwestern Syria. His immediate tasks include stabilising the capital, restoring public services, and addressing the fears of communities that once supported the regime.</p>

<p><strong>A New Flag</strong></p>

<p>Following the announcement on state television by Syrian rebels that Assad's 50-year family rule had come to an end, the opposition's green, white, black, and red flags were raised across the country. Similar celebrations erupted in Germany, Turkey, and Greece, with large crowds waving these flags in a show of solidarity.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The regime fell, so did the Syrian flag. A car in Damascus sports new colours.

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">The regime fell, so did the Syrian flag. A car in Damascus sports new colours. Photo: Abdo Fayyad</p>
</div>

<p>The flag adopted by the rebels features green at the top, white in the middle, and black at the bottom, with three red stars placed centrally. This flag is a modern adaptation of the one first introduced in 1932 when Syria gained independence from France.</p>

<p>"Originally, the three red stars represented the three districts of Syria: the 'states' of Aleppo, Damascus, and Deir ez-Zor. The red-banded flag was adopted in 1958 during the union between Syria and Egypt. In 2011, following the outbreak of the Syrian revolution against the regime, the old flag reemerged and was widely used by protesters across various provinces during demonstrations demanding the fall of the regime. This flag represents the revolution in Syria's history against all injustices against Syria and the aspiration of the Syrian people to be free," Mr Fayyad said.</p>

<h2><strong>The Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>Healthcare infrastructure in Syria has faced relentless targeting. World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a recent briefing expressed concern over the escalating crisis caused by the fighting. &nbsp;"The appointment in the last few hours of a transitional government in the Syrian Arab Republic is bringing new hope to a country that has suffered so much," he said.</p>

<p>Syria's healthcare system, already weakened by nearly 14 years of conflict, faces immense pressure as it tries to address the needs of displaced populations and those potentially returning to Syria.</p>

<p>"All of the injured people are treated as well as possible given that some of the hospitals have been targeted by Assad regime forces. Even with repeated targeting of emergency services, they have been able to provide treatment, but with great difficulty," Mr Fayyad told NDTV.</p>

</div>

<p>The Captagon trade, which flourished under the Assad regime, poses another challenge.</p>

<p>Under Assad, Syria became a major hub for the production and trafficking of Captagon, an addictive stimulant that is widely smuggled into Gulf states. Originally developed in 1961 by the German company Degussa Pharma Gruppe, Captagon was intended as a safer alternative to amphetamine and methamphetamine, which were used to treat conditions like narcolepsy, fatigue, and certain behavioral disorders. However, its addictive properties and harmful effects on mental and physical health led to its global prohibition by the 1980s.</p>

<p>While the Syrian government denied any involvement in the drug trade, analysts argue that the production and smuggling of Captagon have generated billions of dollars for Assa. Many highways and major roads in northwestern and eastern Syria are used for Captagon trade.</p>

<p>"The primary player in this trade is the Assad regime and its militias, which openly promoted and assisted in the growth of this dangerous drug trade. However, with Assad fleeing the country, these militias have been ended and those left will lack the resources and facilities to manufacture Captagon or smuggle it across borders," Mr Fayyad said.</p>

<h2><strong>What Now</strong></h2>

<p>Syria's new de facto rulers, led by HTS, are making some changes. Gone are the omnipresent images of Assad. Instead, the city now carries the mark of its new rulers, with police officers in newly issued uniforms, government buildings buzzing with activity, and public billboards announcing a shift in policy.</p>

<p>HTS leader Ahmed al-Shara, known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has publicly outlined the necessity of maintaining security and stability effort to avoid the fate of other post-revolutionary governments that quickly descended into chaos.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>The international community has responded with a mix of caution and engagement. While the United States and the United Nations have called for inclusive governance, regional powers like Israel and Turkey are working to protect their interests. Israeli airstrikes have targeted Syrian military assets, citing concerns over potential threats from the new leadership. Turkey has intensified its campaign against Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria.</p>

<p>"The journey ahead will be difficult," Mr Fayyad concluded. "But the resilience of the Syrian people offers a glimmer of hope."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[FBI Director Christopher Wray announced on Wednesday that he will resign in January before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray announced on Wednesday that he will resign in January before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.</p>

<p>"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down," Wray told bureau employees in remarks released by the FBI.</p>

<p>Trump, who is to be sworn in as president on January 20, has announced the nomination of staunch loyalist Kash Patel to replace Wray as the head of the top US law enforcement agency and he welcomed the FBI chief's resignation.</p>

<p>Wray was named by Trump in 2017 to head the 38,000-strong Federal Bureau of Intelligence but the incoming president has since soured on his choice.</p>

<p>Wray had three more years remaining in his 10-year term as FBI director but faced potentially being fired by Trump.</p>

<p>"The resignation of Christopher Wray is a great day for America as it will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.</p>

<p>"Under the leadership of Christopher Wray, the FBI illegally raided my home, without cause, worked diligently on illegally impeaching and indicting me, and has done everything else to interfere with the success and future of America," Trump said.</p>

<p>The FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in August 2022 to recover top secret documents taken without authorization from the White House.</p>

<p>Trump was indicted for mishandling classified documents and obstruction of justice but the case was dismissed by a Trump-appointed judge.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;'Above partisanship and politics'</strong></p>

<p>Wray, in his remarks to the FBI workforce, said stepping down "is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work."</p>

<p>"In terms of how we do the work, we've got to maintain our independence and objectivity -- staying above partisanship and politics," he said. "That's what the American people expect of us and that's what they deserve."</p>

<p>Patel, a former Trump advisor and Pentagon official, has been critical of the FBI and is known for his controversial views.</p>

<p>A fierce defender of the incoming president, Patel supports the Republican hardliner notion of an anti-Trump "deep state" of allegedly biased government bureaucrats working to stifle Trump from behind the scenes, even having written a book on the subject.</p>

<p>A son of Indian immigrants, Patel served in several high-level posts during Trump's first term including as a national security advisor and as chief of staff to the acting defense secretary.</p>

<p>Trump, in his Truth Social post, accused law enforcement officials of using "their vast powers to threaten and destroy many innocent Americans, some of which will never be able to recover from what has been done to them."</p>

<p>"Kash Patel is the most qualified Nominee to lead the FBI in the Agency's History, and is committed to helping ensure that Law, Order, and Justice will be brought back to our Country again, and soon," he said.</p>

<p>"I look forward to Kash Patel's confirmation, so that the process of Making the FBI Great Again can begin."</p>

<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray's "principled leadership" of the FBI, saying he had served "honorably and with integrity."</p>

<p>"The director of the FBI is responsible for protecting the independence of the FBI from inappropriate influence in its criminal investigations," Garland said in a statement. "That independence is central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The word polarization', which became an integral part of the socio-political discourse in 2024, is also Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word ‘polarization', which became an integral part of the socio-political discourse in 2024, is also <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year</a>. The concept, often heard in political debate and dialogue, has come to define the growing divisions in societies worldwide. But what exactly does it mean, and why has it become so significant this year?<br />
<br />
<strong>What is ‘polarization'?</strong><br />
<br />
According to Merriam-Webster, ‘polarization' is defined as “division into two sharply distinct opposites; especially, a state in which the opinions, beliefs, or interests of a group or society no longer range along a continuum but become concentrated at opposing extremes.”<br />
<br />
Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told AP, “Polarization means division, but it's a very specific kind of division. Polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the centre.”<br />
<br />
In 2024, the concept resonated deeply, particularly in the context of the US presidential election, which left many feeling more divided than ever, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/word-year-merriam-webster-2024-df39b7a3651f041ac6812155f1f67f45" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">AP</a>. “The 2024 presidential election has left our country more polarized than ever,” noted MSNBC, while Fox News discussed how issues like immigration have intensified “voter polarization.”<br />
<br />
While the term ‘polarization' is heavily associated with political divides today, it traces its roots in the physical world. According to Merriam-Webster, “Polarization, and the verb polarize, date back to the early 1800s when they first described light waves. That physical meaning of polarize — ‘to cause to vibrate in a definite pattern — led to the political and cultural meaning that helps define the world today.”<br />
<br />
The word is derived from the Latin polaris, meaning the Earth's poles, and is also linked to the North Star, Polaris.<br />
<br />
<strong>Significance of the 2024 Word of the Year</strong><br />
<br />
So, why did ‘polarization' stand out as Merriam-Webster's choice this year? According to Sokolowski, the term's increasing usage reflects a societal shift toward more pronounced divides. He described ‘polarization' as “a pretty young word” in the English language.<br />
<br />
At a time marked by fake news, Sokolowski sees the dictionary as a stabilising force. He said, “It's always been important to me that the dictionary serves as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody. It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Details of the possible new measures were still being worked out, but President Joe Biden's team was considering restrictions that might target some Russian oil exports, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.</p>

<p>That step was something Biden had long resisted over fears it could trigger a spike in energy costs, especially in the run-up to last month's presidential election. But with prices for oil slipping amid forecasts of a global surplus in 2025 and fears growing that Trump may seek to force Ukraine into a quick deal with Russia to end its nearly three-year-old war, the Biden administration is now open to more aggressive action, the people said.</p>

<p>The deliberations highlight how Biden's team is more willing to take risks in confronting Russia as it prepares to depart, especially with previous efforts to choke the Kremlin's energy revenues yielding mixed results and average US gasoline prices hitting their lowest level since mid-2021. In its waning weeks, the administration has also moved to surge military and financial support to Ukraine amid questions about Trump's commitment to continued US support.</p>

<p>The US already bans imports of Russian oil but new restrictions on the exports of one of the world's largest producers - which could involve singling out foreign buyers of its crude - would upend more than two years of policy set after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.</p>

<p>The administration was also weighing fresh sanctions aimed at the tanker fleet that Russia uses to transport its oil, the people said. The new limits on the so-called shadow fleet could be be unveiled in the coming weeks, according to the people.</p>

<p>The European Union is planning similar measures on Russia's shadow fleet before the end of the year. The bloc also is expected to target individuals involved in the trade.</p>

<p>Spokespeople for the National Security Council and the Treasury Department declined to comment on Tuesday.</p>

<p>It's clear the departing Biden administration will try to leave a "difficult legacy" in US-Russia relations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday, in response to a question on the prospect of tougher oil sanctions, the Interfax news service reported.</p>

<p>Oil prices barely budged on the news, underscoring the fact that Trump - who takes office on Jan. 20 - may want to avoid inflation catalysts in the same way that Biden did.</p>

<p>Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, Moscow has by and large managed to keep its oil flowing - albeit to customers in Asia rather than Europe where it mostly went before the attack.</p>

<p>For most of this year, prices for the nation's crude have also held above a Group of Seven-imposed cap that only permitted western services for cargoes purchased at $60 a barrel or less. That is in part because Russia turned to shadow-fleet tankers, often operating with unknown insurers or owners.</p>

<p>The price cap has tried to simultaneously restrict the flow of oil revenues while maintaining supplies, two goals that are in conflict with one another.</p>

<p>One model for broader US sanctions could be to impose restrictions similar to those on Iranian oil. In that case, buyers of the oil face US punishment. Such a move would be fraught with risk, given that powerful countries including India and China are major consumers of Russian crude.</p>

<p>Most immediately, such limits could spike oil prices, causing global economic strain. Crude futures have held to a tight range since mid-October, with international benchmark Brent trading below $75 a barrel, compared with more than $120 in the months after Russia's invasion.</p>

<p>It would also inflame tensions with adversaries and partners alike, whose help the US wants to limit exports of sensitive goods such as chips and other technology that fuel Russia's war machine.</p>

<p>While the moves would seek to capitalize on a softer oil market, they would also be aimed at ratcheting up the pressure on Russia before Trump takes office. The president-elect has pushed for negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, and current officials say they want to give the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as much leverage as possible heading into any talks.</p>

<p>With that in mind, squeezing President Vladimir Putin's finances even further could strengthen Ukraine's negotiating hand. There's a chance Trump could unwind measures if he felt they had inflated oil prices, but that risks the potential political cost of looking weak or offering Russia concessions too soon.</p>

<p>Russia has confounded predictions of an economic collapse after the US and its allies imposed unprecedented sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. After slumping initially, the economy rebounded strongly amid huge state spending on defense and measures to help shield domestic businesses from the sanctions. The economy may expand by 3.5% in 2024, according to a survey of 24 economists by Bloomberg News in November.</p>

<p>Still, Russia faces deepening challenges, with the ruble on the slide and the central bank hiking its key interest rate to a record 21% in October to try to curb inflation running at more than twice the 4% target. The bank has warned of the risks of stagflation as growth slows amid labor shortages while inflation remains high.</p>

<p>The latest move would follow restrictions the US rolled out last month on Gazprombank, the last major Russian financial institution that had been exempt from penalties. The Biden administration had previously decided not to levy sanctions against the bank, which European nations use to pay for the gas they still buy from Russia, for fear of causing turmoil in global commodity markets.</p>

<p>Already, Hungary, as well as other countries that rely on Russian gas imports, have warned the US decision poses a potential risk for energy security. Turkey has also sought a sanctions waiver.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly invited his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, despite his promise to slap high tariffs on China after taking office. Donald Trump will take oath as the 47th President of the United States on January 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incoming US president invited Mr Xi in early November, shortly after the election, CBS News reported quoting multiple sources. However, it is still not clear if the Chinese President will attend the ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Trump's invitation to the Chinese President is an unprecedented step, as&nbsp;the US does not have a tradition of inviting foreign leaders to Presidents' inaugural ceremonies. Official records dating back to 1874 show that no foreign leader attended a transfer-of-power ceremony in the US till now. which is typically attended by&nbsp;ambassadors and other diplomats.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the president-elect's team has raised the possibility of hosting other world leaders at the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol next month, for which inauguration officials are making plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"World leaders are lining up to meet with President Trump because they know he will soon return to power and restore peace through American strength around the globe," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-invites-china-xi-jinping-inauguration/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">CBS</a> quoted Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban is also "considering" whether to attend the ceremony. The far-right leader enjoys a warm relationship with Mr Trump and visited him at Mar-a-Lago this week.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>US-China Relations</strong></h2>

<p>The US remain a sharp critic of the Chinese government. After winning the presidential election, Mr Trump himself threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on BRICS countries, including China, if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.</p>

<p>His incoming administration has also imposed a deadline of January 19, the eve of the inauguration, for TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the social media app or face a ban in America.</p>

<p>But such a move is not unexpected from Mr Trump, who has long believed that close leader-to-leader relationships are key to international deal-making. The US President-elect recently&nbsp;said in an interview that he spoke to Mr Xi and "got along very well" with the Chinese President.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol vowed on Thursday to fight "until the very last minute" in a defiant address defending his shock decision to declare martial law and deploy troops to the country's parliament last week.</p>

<p>The South Korean leader is barred from foreign travel as part of a probe into his inner circle over the dramatic events of December 3-4 that stunned Seoul's allies and threw the country into some of its deepest political turmoil in years.</p>

<p>Yoon, staring down an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, vowed to "fight with the people until the very last minute".</p>

<p>"I apologise again to the people who must have been surprised and anxious due to the martial law," he said in a televised address.</p>

<p>"Please trust me."</p>

<p>Saturday's impeachment vote will take place at around 5:00 pm (0800 GMT).</p>

<p>It needs to win support from eight members of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) to secure the necessary two-thirds majority.</p>

<p>PPP leader Han Dong-hoon urged party members on Thursday to attend the meeting and vote "according to their conviction and conscience".</p>

<p>That came as police attempted another raid on Yoon's presidential office compound, Yonhap news agency reported, a day after a similar attempt was blocked by security guards.</p>

<p>The main opposition Democratic Party has said it would file legal complaints for insurrection against the president's staff and security if they continued to obstruct law enforcement.</p>

<p>Yonhap said Thursday's raid focused on the headquarters of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, which reportedly agreed to cooperate with the investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Escalating investigations</strong></p>

<p>South Korea's capital has been rocked by daily protests since last week, with thousands gathering to demand Yoon's resignation.</p>

<p>Members of Yoon's inner circle have come under intense scrutiny for their alleged role in last week's martial law declaration.</p>

<p>Police said on Thursday they had raided the headquarters of the military's capital defence command, which was deployed during the martial law declaration.</p>

<p>Former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who is accused of urging Yoon to impose martial law, tried to kill himself in prison on Tuesday, authorities said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kim was first detained on Sunday and later formally arrested on charges of "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".</p>

<p>The former interior minister and the general in charge of the martial law operation are also barred from foreign travel.</p>

<p>Two senior police officials were also arrested early on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The PPP has said that, pending Yoon's resignation, he has agreed to hand power to Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and party chief Han.</p>

<p>But Yoon remained defiant on Thursday, accusing the opposition of pushing the country into a "national crisis".</p>

<p>"The National Assembly, dominated by the large opposition party, has become a monster that destroys the constitutional order of liberal democracy," Yoon said in his televised address.</p>

<p>But, he said, he would "not avoid legal and political responsibility regarding the declaration of martial law".</p>

<p>Yoon had said his declaration of martial law was intended, in part, to safeguard South Korea "from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is rapidly launching new products. A few days ago, it introduced the lightning-fast chip Willow, and now it has unveiled Gemini 2.0, a more precise AI assistant. About ten months after the release of Gemini 1.5, Google is launching Gemini 2.0 on Wednesday. Currently, only one model-the smaller, more affordable Gemini 2.0 Flash-is being released, which Google describes as an "experimental preview."</p>

<p>Google claims Gemini 2.0 to be the most capable AI model developed by it so far, meant for what it calls the "agentic era." The model features multimodal output with native image generation and audio output, along with integrated tools like Google Search and Maps.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-ai-collection-2024/"><em>blog post by Google</em></a>, Gemini 2.0 Flash is an experimental version of this model, which has low latency and enhanced performance. Developers can start building with this model via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Meanwhile, Gemini and Gemini Advanced users worldwide can try out a chat-optimized version of Gemini 2.0 by using it in the model dropdown menu on desktop.</p>

<p>"We're also using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future capabilities of a universal AI assistant; Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as an experimental extension; and Jules, an experimental AI-powered code agent. We continue to prioritize safety and responsibility with these projects, which is why we're taking an exploratory and gradual approach to development, including working with trusted testers," the tech giant said in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-ai-collection-2024/"><em> the blog.</em></a></p>

<p>"This week, we started testing Gemini 2.0 in AI Overviews in Search, and early next year, we'll expand Gemini 2.0 to more Google products."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three brothers were charged by US authorities with sex trafficking on Wednesday, in a lurid case that alleges they used their high-profile connections in the luxury real estate world to assault women for years.</p>

<p>Oren and Tal Alexander are the founders of real estate firm Official, which has offices in Miami and New York. Alon Alexander -- Oren's twin -- worked at the family's private security firm, according to US media.</p>

<p>The brothers are alleged to have used "deception, fraud and coercion" -- including the promise of luxury travel accommodation -- to engage in sex trafficking as well as drugging, sexually assaulting and raping dozens of women.</p>

<p>They used "their wealth and prominent positions in real estate to create and facilitate opportunities" to do so, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement.</p>

<p>The assaults date from at least 2010 to at least 2021, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Just two years ago, Tal, 38, and Oren, 37, were the subject of a New York Times profile detailing their successful ventures as real-estate high rollers, including the sale of a 24,000 square foot (2,230 square meter) Manhattan penthouse for $234 million.</p>

<p>Tal Alexander flaunted a "no days off" lifestyle of constantly showing glamorous residences to wealthy clients.</p>

<p>Prosecutors painted a grim picture of all three brothers luring women to events and parties, then drugging them with cocaine, mushrooms and GHB, and assaulting them.</p>

<p>The Alexanders and those in their circle used "social media, dating applications, in-person encounters... and party promoters who would recruit women for these events," prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Susan Necheles, an attorney for Oren Alexander, said in a statement that her client was innocent and "the evidence will show that neither he nor his brothers ever committed a crime."</p>

<p>Alon, 37, Oren and Tal are charged with engaging in sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, which both carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

<p>Tal Alexander is also charged with a second count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia will force Meta and Google to pay for news shared on their platforms under a new scheme unveiled Thursday, threatening to tax them if they refuse to strike deals with local media.</p>

<p>Traditional media companies the world over are in a battle for survival as precious advertising dollars are hoovered up online.</p>

<p>Australia wants big tech companies to compensate local publishers for sharing news links that drive traffic to their platforms, an idea they have baulked at in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is important that digital platforms play their part. They need to support access to quality journalism that informs and strengthens our democracy," Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said.</p>

<p>Social media platforms with Australian revenue of more than US$160 million a year will be taxed a still-to-be-decided figure earmarked to pay for news.</p>

<p>But they can avoid paying the tax if they voluntarily enter into commercial agreements with Australian media companies.</p>

<p>It is the latest salvo in Australia's efforts to reign in the tech giants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australia last month voted for new laws that will ban under-16s from social media.</p>

<p>It has also mooted slapping fines on companies that fail to stamp out offensive content and the spread of disinformation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday appointed election denier Kari Lake to be the new director of Voice of America, the state-funded international media organization.</p>

<p>VOA has reach around the world, with programming in a slew of African, Asian and European languages, including Somali, Dari and French.</p>

<p>It receives US funding but is generally considered a reliable, independent media operation, covering global and US news for international audiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, previous leadership under Trump's first administration came under fire for politicizing the outlet.</p>

<p>Lake, a former television news anchor, is a hard-line conservative who ran in 2022 as the Republican candidate for governor of the southwestern state of Arizona and for US Senate in 2024, losing both times.</p>

<p>She has repeatedly refused to accept her past election defeats, as well as Trump's 2020 loss to Joe Biden.</p>

<p>As he prepares to take office in January, Trump's staffing announcements have consisted of close allies.</p>

<p>"I am pleased to announce that Kari Lake will serve as our next Director of the Voice of America," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website.</p>

<p>"She will be appointed by, and work closely with, our next head of the US Agency for Global Media... to ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media."</p>

<p>In his first term, Michael Pack, Trump's head of the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA, raised concerns when he moved in 2020 to strip an internal firewall at the organization meant to insulate the newsroom from political interference.</p>

<p>A VOA White House reporter was also investigated for supposed anti-Trump biases during Trump's first administration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deinococcus radiodurans, nicknamed 'Conan the Bacterium,' is known for its extraordinary ability to endure radiation doses 28,000 times higher than those lethal to humans. Researchers have found that the key to its survival lies in an antioxidant, revealing potential uses for human health on Earth and space exploration.</p>

<p>The study, published on December 9 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, revealed the bacterium's radiation resistance stems from a combination of metabolites, including manganese, phosphate and a small peptide made of amino acids. Together, these components form a potent trio that provides the bacterium with protection against radiation. This discovery could pave the way for similar protective measures for astronauts and those exposed to harmful radiation on Earth.</p>

<p>According to a report in&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/11/science/conan-the-bacterium-antioxidant/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>, co-author of the study, Brian Hoffman, a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University, US, said, "We've long known that manganese ions and phosphate together make a strong antioxidant, but discovering and understanding the 'magic' potency provided by the addition of the third component is a breakthrough. This study has provided the key to understanding why this combination is such a powerful - and promising - radioprotectant."<br />

The hardy nature of 'Conan the Bacterium' is already well documented. It holds the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-radiation-resistant-lifeform" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Guinness World Record</a> for being the most radiation-resistant life form and has shown it can survive in space, even spending three years outside the International Space Station. It can also endure extreme cold, dehydration and high acidity.</p>

<p>This new research builds on earlier studies co-authored by Hoffman and fellow scientist Michaely Daly. Their previous work showed that the bacterium could likely have survived on Mars for millions of years, protected by a similar set of antioxidants.<br />
<br />
For this latest study, Hoffman and Daly, in collaboration with other researchers, turned their attention to MDP (melatonin-derived protective), a synthetic antioxidant designed to mimic the radiation-resistant properties of Deinococcus radiodurans. MDP has been used in vaccines inactivated by radiation, and now researchers are studying how its components work together to form a highly effective radiation shield.</p>

<p>Dr. Tetyana Milojevic, an expert in exobiology at the University of Orleans, who was not involved in the study, said the research could revolutionise the understanding of radioprotective shields and their potential applications in health, industry and space exploration.</p>

<p>According to Daly, the MDP antioxidant could be a game-changer for astronauts on long-term space missions. "MDP, being a simple, cost-effective, nontoxic, and highly effective radioprotector, could be administered orally to mitigate these space radiation risks," he said.<br />
<br />
On Earth, MDP could offer a solution for those at risk of radiation exposure. The team is now eager to investigate whether other organisms have similar triple complexes in their cells and whether these components contribute to their own radiation resistance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 38-year-old man removed his shirt, threatened violence, and assaulted a flight attendant aboard a United Airlines flight on June 12. The man is facing federal charges for the midair incident on the Houston-New Jersey flight.</p>

<p>Kedus Yacob Damtew was charged with interference with flight crew members and attendants by assault or intimidation, a federal offence carrying a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, according to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/washington-man-charged-threatening-flight-attendants-airplane " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">US Attorney's Office in New Jersey</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly before the plane landed, Damtew reportedly took off his shirt, pushed his bare chest against a flight attendant, and pinned her against the aircraft's exit door while shouting threats of physical harm. The confrontation escalated when Damtew allegedly punched an aircraft oven, followed the flight attendant to the back of the plane, and threw a cup of water at her.</p>

<p>In response to a distress call over the plane's public address system, several passengers rushed to help the flight crew restrain Damtew. He was secured with flex cuffs and moved to the back of the aircraft, where he remained until the flight landed at Newark Liberty International Airport.</p>

<p>The FBI, led by Acting Special Agent in Charge Nelson I. Delgado, investigated with assistance from the Port Authority Police Department. US Attorney Philip R. Sellinger credited the swift action of passengers and law enforcement in ensuring the flight's safety.</p>

<p>Damtew appeared in federal court in Washington, D.C., on December 10 before Magistrate Judge Matthew J. Sharbaugh. He was released pending further legal proceedings.</p>

<p>In a similar incident last month, a 44-year-old United Airlines passenger was charged with assault after a violent incident aboard a San Francisco-Washington Dulles flight. The man reportedly <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/united-airlines-passenger-charged-after-violently-attacking-nonverbal-deaf-man-mid-flight-6945698">attacked a sleeping deaf and nonverbal passenger</a>, punching him repeatedly until the victim's nose was split and blood spattered the cabin. The attack, lasting a minute, ended when another passenger restrained him. He faced a federal charge of assault, punishable by up to a year in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris is poised to deliver the biggest speech of her political life on Thursday as she accepts the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago after a historic turnaround in the 2024 White House race.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old US vice president will focus on joyful "vibes" after electrifying her party in the space of a single heady month since President Joe Biden dropped out of the contest.</p>

<p>Now Harris will tell her personal story to the American people, using her televised address to the Democratic National Convention to contrast her optimism with the darker tone of Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"It's going to blow the roof off," said Amanda Taylor, a 47-year-old delegate from Missouri.</p>

<p>Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, also swapped messages on X on Thursday for their 10th wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>"To the best partner I could ask for: Happy anniversary, Dougie," the Vice President wrote, while he said: "Forever to go. Happy anniversary @VP. I love you."</p>

<p>Yet while Democrats' hopes are soaring and as Harris edges ahead in the polls, they know the battle is far from won.</p>

<p>From Barack and Michelle Obama to Bill Clinton, senior figures have warned all week that Harris has a brutal fight on her hands to beat the 78-year-old Trump.</p>

<p>The sheer speed of her astonishing rise to the top of the ticket also means Harris remains an unknown quantity to many US voters.</p>

<p>A trailblazer as the first woman, Black and South Asian vice president in US history -- and now bidding to become its first woman president -- her role has largely kept her in the background the last four years.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Fight for freedom' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris will seek to remedy that in her speech. She will talk about how she was raised by a working mother and knows the challenges facing families hit by inflation, a campaign official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>She will set her confident vision for America's future against what her campaign calls Trump's dark, conservative inspiration for a second term in the Oval Office, the official said.</p>

<p>Speaker after speaker has focused on the idea of freedom during the Democratic convention, as the party targets what it says are Republican plans to further limit abortion and clamp down on democratic institutions.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Harris's energetic running mate Tim Walz formally accepted the party's nomination, saying: "Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead."</p>

<p>But Harris has been short on policy announcements since taking over as the Democratic standard-bearer, particularly when it comes to the economy, a key issue in the election.</p>

<p>She has to take advantage of her first major speech in a presidential setting, as "you don't get a second chance to make a first impression," political analyst Larry Sabato told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Kamala vibes' -</strong></p>

<p>"Voters already have the Kamala vibes. Now they need the Kamala agenda," said Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia. A lack of economic policy "can defeat her faster than the border," he added.</p>

<p>But when it comes to vibes, Democrats are in full on celebration mode, unrecognizable from the party that was steeped in despair after the 81-year-old Biden's catastrophic debate performance against Trump.</p>

<p>The Obamas raised the roof in Chicago on Tuesday, with the ex-first lady declaring that under Harris "hope is making a comeback."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Clinton, television talk show host Oprah Winfrey and musicians Stevie Wonder and John Legend were the warm-up acts for Walz, the governor of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Biden's farewell address on Monday, when Harris made a surprise appearance on stage to give him a hug, already seems like a distant memory.</p>

<p>If the transition has been head-spinning for Biden and the Democrats, it has completely unsettled Trump.</p>

<p>In a roller-coaster summer he has survived an assassination attempt, and then seen what he thought was certain victory turned on its head by a new and far younger opponent.</p>

<p>Trump will be in Arizona on the Mexican border on Thursday to push Harris's weak spot on the issue of illegal immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Secretary-General hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ukraine will contribute to ending the war, his Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Asked for a reaction to Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine amid the war, Dujarric said, "We've seen a lot of heads of state and government travel to the region (and) we hope that all of these visits will bring us closer to an end of the conflict in line with General Assembly resolutions, international law, and the territorial integrity."</p>

<p>The General Assembly has demanded an end to the Russian invasion in at least three resolutions and in another to stop attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure. India has abstained on the resolutions.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to go to Ukraine on Friday where he is to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>The Kyiv visit follows his trip to Russia last month, where he discussed the Ukraine situation with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>According to reports, he will convey messages between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>An India-Russia joint statement at the end of Prime Minister Modi's Moscow visit said that the two leaders "highlighted the imperative of peaceful resolution of the conflict around Ukraine through dialogue and diplomacy including engagement between both parties".</p>

<p>The statement added cryptically, "They noted with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation and good offices aimed at peaceful resolution of the conflict in accordance with international law and on the basis of the UN Charter in its entirety and totality".</p>

<p>While India has kept up a veneer of neutrality by not voting for the condemnation of Russia's invasion at the UN, Prime Minister Modi has criticised it.</p>

<p>He told Putin at a 2022 meeting in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, "I know that today's era is not of war and we have talked to you many times over the phone on the subject that democracy and diplomacy and dialogue are all these things that touch the world".</p>

<p>On the day of Prime Minister Modi's arrival in Moscow in July, Russia's missile attack hit a children's hospital in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Reacting to it, Prime Minister Modi said, "Whether it is war, conflict or a terrorist attack, any person who believes in humanity is pained when there is loss of lives. But even in that, when innocent children are killed, the heart bleeds and that pain is very terrifying."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi and President Zelensky have spoken by phone several times since Russia's invasion began in February 2022.</p>

<p>After a conversation in March, the Prime Minister posted on X that he "conveyed India's consistent support for all efforts for peace and bringing an early end to the ongoing conflict. India will continue to provide humanitarian assistance guided by our people-centric approach".</p>

<p>Zelensky said in his X post that "Ukraine is interested in strengthening our trade and economic ties with India, particularly in agricultural exports, aviation cooperation, and pharmaceutical and industrial product trade".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nestle chief executive Mark Schneider is leaving the Swiss food group after eight years in charge and will be replaced by Latin America boss Laurent Freixe, the company said Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nestle chief executive Mark Schneider is leaving the Swiss food group after eight years in charge and will be replaced by Latin America boss Laurent Freixe, the company said Thursday.</p>

<p>Schneider "has decided to relinquish his roles as CEO and member of the Board of Directors", Nestle said in a statement, adding that the move would be effective September 1.</p>

<p>"Leading Nestle for the past 8 years has been an honor for me. I am grateful for what we have achieved, having transformed Nestle into a future-proofed, innovative and sustainable business," Schneider said in the statement.</p>

<p>Freixe, who joined Nestle in France in 1986, "successfully managed: the company's European zone during the 2008 financial crisis and until 2014, the statement said.</p>

<p>He was then named CEO of the Americas region being taking over at the newly created Latin America zone in in 2022, "where he has been successfully leading through challenging conditions".</p>

<p>Nestle said Freixe has been nominated as a candidate for the board of directors at its 2025 annual general meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>'Perfect fit'</strong></h3>

<p>Nestle, whose brands range from Nespresso coffee capsules to Purina dog food and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, lowered its sales growth outlook for 2024 last month as it slowed its price increases in the first half of the year.</p>

<p>The global packaged-food giant and its rivals had logged high sales growth in the past three years as they raised prices to make up for higher costs due to soaring inflation.</p>

<p>The company has also faced controversy in recent years, with Swiss NGO Public Eye accusing Nestle of selling baby food with high levels of added sugar in low-income countries but not in wealthier nations.</p>

<p>Nestle has counted that it had "no double standard" and applied the same nutrition and health principles everywhere.</p>

<p>It has also scrambled to ease any concerns over its Perrier brand after France's food safety watchdog recommended stricter monitoring of sites where Nestle extracts mineral water following the discovery of traces of "faecal" contamination.</p>

<p>The company has since said it has stepped up monitoring of the sites, and Schneider has said the group's water was safe to drink.</p>

<p>Nestle said Thursday that Schneider "has actively shaped the company's portfolio, in line with Nestle's strategy and with a focus on high-growth categories like coffee, pet care and nutritional health products".</p>

<p>Nestle chairman Paul Bulcke praised Freixe a "a talented leader with strategic acumen, extensive in-market experience and expertise as well as a deep understanding of markets and consumers".</p>

<p>"Laurent is the perfect fit for Nestle at this time," Bulcke added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passenger on Australian budget carrier Jetstar threw open an emergency door and exited by clambering over the wing and engine after landing in Melbourne on Thursday, officials said.</p>

<p>Australian federal police arrested the man following his unauthorised departure from the Sydney-Melbourne flight.</p>

<p>"We can confirm that a passenger opened the emergency exit door after arrival into Melbourne, which automatically deployed the slide," a Jetstar spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"The plane was parked at the gate."</p>

<p>After leaving by the emergency exit door, the man walked along the wing before making his way down to the ground via the engine, officials said.</p>

<p>Audrey Varghese, a fellow passenger on the flight, told Melbourne radio 3AW that the man had been exhibiting "quite strange behaviour", ignoring the seatbelt signs and multiple requests by flight attendants for him to remain seated.</p>

<p>"People thought that was quite strange. And then as soon as the plane had started to come to a stop, he immediately got up and basically charged to where the emergency exit row is," she said.</p>

<p>In the process, he was "shoving people, causing a bit of commotion," Varghese said.</p>

<p>He then "ripped open" the emergency door, deploying the slide, and "jumped off the plane".</p>

<p>Varghese said there were "screams and shrieks" from other passengers, who were obviously "very frightened".</p>

<p>"I think people were just screaming because of how strange this behaviour was."</p>

<p>Federal police said they arrested a man for "alleged aggressive behaviour and breaching aircraft safety protocols on a domestic service".</p>

<p>"The man was assessed by ambulance officers and later transferred to hospital for further assessment, where he remains," a police spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Police said they were still investigating but charges were likely to be laid "at a future date".</p>

<p>Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas, said it wanted to thank passengers for their "patience and understanding" during the incident.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A six-year-old boy missing for four days was found alive in a forest in a mountainous part of northern Vietnam, police said Thursday.</p>

<p>The child was reported missing on Saturday after he failed to return home with his siblings from a celebration at a relative's house in Yen Bai province.</p>

<p>Police in Lam Giang commune launched a search for the boy and "even dried up a pond as they were afraid he had fallen," an officer, who declined to give his name, told AFP.</p>

<p>Over the past four days, more than 200 people joined a search for the boy, according to state media.</p>

<p>He was finally found on Wednesday, the police official said.</p>

<p>"We were told that the boy was tired. They gave him things to eat and checked his health. He is ok now," the police official told AFP.</p>

<p>State media reported that a man had heard crying and discovered the exhausted boy covered in mud, sitting in a cassava bush in the forest.</p>

<p>Lam's mother, Ly Thi Phai, told the VietnamNet news site of her relief.</p>

<p>"I was so happy that my child had returned alive," she said.</p>

<p>"I cried because he looked thinner and weaker than before he disappeared."</p>

<p>According to state media, the boy said he had become lost in the forest and the more he walked, the more disorientated he became.</p>

<p>To survive, he said he drank water from a stream and picked leaves and wild fruits he recognised.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US talk show host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Wednesday, calling on her fellow independent voters to vote for "joy".</p>

<p>In an electrifying address to the US political party convention, Winfrey said: "We are so fired up we can't wait to leave here and do something".</p>

<p>"And what we're going to do is elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. And let us choose joy!" Winfrey said, a day after former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle addressed the DNC.</p>

<p>"Let us choose common sense over nonsense," said the 70-year-old television personality to applause from the thousands of attendees at the United Center in Chicago -- home of her globally acclaimed morning talk show.</p>

<p>"America is an ongoing project that requires commitment... and every once in a while it requires standing up to life's bullies."</p>

<p>"So I'm calling on all you independents and all you undecideds. You know this is true. You know I'm telling you the truth, that values and character matter most of all," she said.</p>

<p>Winfrey recounted her experiences witnessing racism, sexism and income inequality in the United States, adding that she had at times been on the receiving end of it.</p>

<p>She took a jibe at remarks by Republican Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick, J.D. Vance, who singled out Harris when he called Democrats a "bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives."</p>

<p>Harris has two stepchildren and the comments have sparked accusations that father-of-three Vance represents a backward Republican mindset.</p>

<p>"When a house is on fire, we don't ask about the homeowner's race or religion... We just try to do the best we can to save them. And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out too," Winfrey said.</p>

<p>"Let us choose common sense over nonsense. Common sense tells us Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect," she told the convention, where she was one of the warm-up acts to Walz's address, alongside musicians Stevie Wonder and John Legend.</p>

<p>"Very soon, we're going to be teaching our daughters and sons about how this child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father -- two idealistic, energetic -- how this child grew up to become the 47th President of the United States," she said.</p>

<p>"That is the best of America."</p>

<p>Harris is due to give her speech when she accepts the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's Supreme Court, which observers say is loyal to the government of President Nicolas Maduro, on Thursday declared him the winner of the disputed July 28 election amid opposition claims of widespread vote fraud.</p>

<p>In its ruling read by presiding judge Caryslia Rodriguez, the court said it had "indisputably certified election materials and validates the results of the July 28, 2024 presidential election issued by the National Electoral Council (CNE)," naming Nicolas Maduro as the winner.</p>

<p>Nicolas Maduro himself had asked the court earlier this month to weigh in on the election, in which he claims to have defeated opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia with 52 percent of ballots cast, according to the CNE.</p>

<p>The CNE did not provide a precinct-level breakdown of its results, saying it had been the victim of a cyberattack. Observers however say they believe the supposed hack is an excuse to not provide vote results.</p>

<p>The opposition says its own tally of polling-station-level results showed Gonzalez Urrutia, 74, had won more than two-thirds of votes.</p>

<p>"To the court's judges: no decision will replace the will of the people. The country and the world know about your bias and, as a result, your inability to resolve this conflict," Gonzalez Urrutia said earlier Thursday in a social media post.</p>

<p>"Your ruling will only make the crisis worse."</p>

<p>Rodriguez said earlier this month that the court's ruling would be "final."</p>

<p>Official sources have reported 25 people have been killed, 192 injured and 2,400 arrested in election-related protests.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new law threatening to drive thousands of migrants from Ukraine back to their home country or onto the streets has been implemented in Hungary. With effect from Wednesday, this legislative move denied Ukrainian refugees access to government-subsidised accommodation.</p>

<p>This new rule is the outcome of a decision made in June by Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban to restrict public assistance to refugees from areas of Ukraine that are not thought to be impacted by the war between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>The list, which will be updated monthly by the Hungarian government, includes thirteen regions in Ukraine. It is unknown how many of the 31,000 Ukrainians who are seeking refuge in Hungary will be impacted by the new legislation.</p>

<p>Government Commissioner Norbert Pal defended the change as "reasonable and proportionate" after two and a half years of war. He told the pro-government Magyar Nemzet newspaper that "those who wanted to get back on their feet in Hungary have been able to do so."</p>

<p>Privately-owned shelters have already started evicting refugees now ineligible for support, the Migration Aid group said.</p>

<p>In Kocs, north of Budapest, around 120 refugees were ousted from a guest house under police supervision on Wednesday, an AFP photographer saw.</p>

<p>Most were Roma women and children from Transcarpathia in western Ukraine, where there is a large Hungarian community.</p>

<p>"We are in a hopeless situation because we have nowhere to go," Marina Amit, a mother-of-five who fled to Hungary last year, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We cannot go home to Ukraine; I have a 17-year-old son," she added, saying she feared he would be conscripted into the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimated this week that 2,000-3,000 Ukrainians could lose access to subsidised accommodation.</p>

<p>The rule change will result in "job losses and impact school enrolment, jeopardising the positive integration achievements obtained so far," UNHCR said in a statement urging Hungary to reconsider.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepal on Thursday lifted its ban on TikTok nine months after suspending the popular video-sharing platform for disturbing "social harmony", the communications minister said.</p>

<p>TikTok, which has around one billion monthly users, has faced restrictions in many countries for allegedly breaking data rules and for its potentially harmful impact on youth.</p>

<p>"A decision to remove the ban on TikTok has been made," Minister for Communications and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung told reporters after a cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>The decision comes over a week after TikTok's South Asia division contacted the minister saying that it would follow Nepal's regulations, and requesting that the ban be lifted, according to ministry spokesman Gajendra Kumar Thakur.</p>

<p>Nepal had suspended TikTok in November last year, days after introducing a directive requiring social media platforms operating in the country to set up offices.</p>

<p>It also followed an anti-government demonstration, whose leader was popular on TikTok.</p>

<p>The ban was condemned not just by free speech advocates but by the owners of popular accounts whose lives were transformed by the platform, which had about 2.2 million users in the country.</p>

<p>"The news makes me very happy," Anjana Aryal, who went from homemaker to entrepreneur by sharing recipes on TikTok, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The ban had really affected many creators like me who had benefitted from the app."</p>

<p>Since the ban, Aryal and other prominent Nepali content creators had seen their revenue streams dry up, jeopardising their livelihoods.</p>

<p>"Many switched to Instagram and Facebook, but they don't have the same kind of reach. With TikTok back, I will be very busy again," she said.</p>

<p>Advocate Dinesh Tripathi, who had challenged the decision in court, said that the decision was a "victory for free speech".</p>

<p>"Free speech is integral to democracy. This is a good decision but we must stay vigilant against such attacks," he said.</p>

<p>In July, Nepal's Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, 72, was sworn in as prime minister after his Communist Party forged a coalition government with the centre-left Nepali Congress, shifting power in the country's often volatile parliament.</p>

<p>Owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok is one of the most popular social media platforms on the planet, but multiple countries have sought to tighten controls on social media due to their potential impact.</p>

<p>The United States recently sued TikTok, saying it had placed the safety of millions of children in jeopardy by collecting their personal data without parental permission.</p>

<p>TikTok is also battling a US law that calls on its Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the video platform or else face a nationwide ban on the app.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim government revoked the diplomatic passport of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina on Thursday, after she fled a student-led uprising by helicopter to India earlier this month.</p>

<p>The move to cancel Sheikh Hasina's documents leaves the former autocratic leader in potential limbo, and comes on the same day that a United Nations team arrived in Dhaka to assess whether to investigate alleged human rights violations.</p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed -- many by police fire -- during the weeks leading up to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, as crowds stormed her official residence in Dhaka and ended her iron-fisted 15-year rule.</p>

<p>The interior ministry said in a statement that Sheikh Hasina's passport and those belonging to former government ministers and ex-lawmakers no longer in their posts "have to be revoked".</p>

<p>It also poses a diplomatic dilemma for Sheikh Hasina's current host, regional powerhouse India.</p>

<p><strong>'Disproportionate force'</strong></p>

<p>Post the revolt and storming of her official residence on August 5, Ms Hasina fled to India</p>

<p>While India is hosting Sheikh Hasina, PM Modi has also offered his support to the new Bangladeshi leader, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who is heading the caretaker administration.</p>

<p>"The former prime minister, her advisers, the former cabinet and all members of the dissolved national assembly were eligible for diplomatic passports by virtue of the positions they held," Dhaka's home ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>"If they have been removed or retired from their posts, their and their spouses' diplomatic passports have to be revoked."</p>

<p>Dhaka's new authorities said that Sheikh Hasina, and other former top officials during her tenure, could apply for a standard passport, but that those documents were contingent on approval.</p>

<p>"When the aforementioned people apply afresh for ordinary passports, two security agencies have to clear their application for their passports to be issued," the ministry added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's government was accused of widespread abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of political opponents.</p>

<p>The UN rights office asessing the protest response had said in a preliminary report last week that there were "strong indications, warranting further independent investigation, that the security forces used unnecessary and disproportionate force".</p>

<p>Yunus has said his administration would "provide whatever support" UN investigators need.</p>

<p>Separately, a Bangladeshi war crimes tribunal set up by Sheikh Hasina has launched three "mass murder" probes into its founder over the recent unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan police offered a cash reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of a suspected serial killer who escaped from a Nairobi police cell.</p>

<p>Police launched a manhunt on Tuesday after Collins Jumaisi, who is accused of murdering and dismembering dozens of women, broke out of a police station in an upmarket area of the Kenyan capital along with 12 Eritreans.</p>

<p>Five officers appeared in court on Wednesday suspected of aiding Jumaisi's escape and have been freed on a 200,000 Kenyan shilling ($1,500) bond, despite prosecutors seeking an order to keep them in custody for 14 days.</p>

<p>The magistrate dismissed the prosecutor's arguments that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) had yet to retrieve surveillance footage.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old Jumaisi, described by police as a "vampire, a psychopath", was arrested last month after the gruesome discovery of a number of mutilated female bodies in a rubbish dump in Mukuru slum area in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.</p>

<p>Police say he has confessed to murdering 42 women over a two-year period from 2022, with his wife his first victim, but the suspect has claimed he was tortured after his arrest.</p>

<p>Officers said Jumaisi and the other men escaped by cutting through a wire mesh roof where he was being held, before scaling a perimeter wall.</p>

<p>"A significant cash reward will be provided to anyone with credible information leading to the suspect's arrest," the DCI said, without specifying an amount.</p>

<p>It is the second time in barely six months that a suspect in a high-profile case has escaped from custody in Nairobi.</p>

<p>The latest twist to the grisly story has appalled many Kenyans, with the bodies also found just 100 metres (yards) from a police station.</p>

<p>Kenya's police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority, has said it was looking into whether there was any police involvement or a "failure to act to prevent" the killings.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of carrying out unlawful killings or running hit squads, but few have faced justice.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim government has sought $1 billion from the World Bank as budgetary support.</p>

<p>The call came from the country's Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan's meeting with Abdoulaye Seck, the World Bank's Country Director for Bangladesh and Bhutan, in Dhaka on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He made the plea as the ministry owes more than 2 billion dollars to suppliers in import costs of power and energy, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Fouzul Kabir Khan mentioned that the interim government, which was formed with many pressing mandates, is due to settle a $2 billion debt left by the previous government in the power sector.</p>

<p>He said they have already suspended activities under the much-criticized Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply Act 2010 and abolished the government's power to set energy prices without any public hearing.</p>

<p>On August 5, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, was ousted from her country and power, ending her rule since January 2009.</p>

<p>This event was seen as a massive escalation, with what initially started as student's protests and resulted in a major crisis in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Earlier on August 8, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Romanian court has ordered internet personality Andrew Tate to be placed under house arrest, his representative said on Thursday, after he was among six people taken into custody in an investigation into human trafficking and sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>The former professional kickboxer and his brother Tristan were among six people detained on Wednesday for an initial 24 hours after Romania's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit DIICOT conducted four home searches in Ilfov county and the Bucharest municipality.</p>

<p>DIICOT asked the Bucharest court to arrest the Tate brothers for 30 days, but the judge decided to place Andrew Tate under house arrest and Tristan under judiciary control for that period, their representative Mateea Petrescu said.</p>

<p>"The Tates salute the decision and firmly deny all allegations levelled against them, emphasising that the accusations are baseless and unsupported by substantial evidence," Petrescu wrote in a statement.</p>

<p>Tate was already indicted in mid-2023 along with his brother and two Romanian female suspects for human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, allegations they denied.</p>

<p>Before their latest detention the brothers had been subject to a travel ban, under which they were free to travel within Romania but not leave the country.</p>

<p>A self-described misogynist, social media influencer Tate has gained millions of fans by promoting an ultra-masculine lifestyle that critics say denigrates women.</p>

<p>A post on Tate's account on social media platform X said "All they try to do is damage my name with complete bullshit", without specifying who was being referred to.</p>

<p>DIICOT said in a statement that it had ordered the detention of six people for crimes including forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.</p>

<p>It said that it had requested that three of the detained defendants remain in custody while another one be put under house arrest.</p>

<p>According to DIICOT, two of the accused used the "loverboy" method, which involves convincing victims that they are in a romantic relationship, to force 34 victims into making pornography which they then sold online for proceeds of over $2.8 million and 887,000 tokens.</p>

<p>DIICOT alleges that one of the defendants forced a 17-year-old minor to produce pornography in Britain and Romania creating profits of $1.5 million. It also alleges that the same defendant repeatedly had sexual relations with a 15-year-old victim.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese scientists have discovered a "brand-new method" of producing large quantities of water using lunar soil brought back from a 2020 expedition, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>In 2020, China's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/chinese-scientists-find-traces-of-water-in-lunar-soil-brought-by-chang-e-5-mission-6178348" target="_blank">Chang'e-5 mission</a> marked the first time humans retrieved lunar samples in 44 years. Researchers from the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered that the minerals in this 'moon soil' contain large amounts of hydrogen, which reacts with other elements when heated to very high temperatures, producing water vapour, CCTV reported.</p>

<p>"After three years of in-depth research and repeated verification, a brand-new method of using lunar soil to produce large amounts of water was discovered, which is expected to provide important design basis for the construction of future lunar scientific research stations and space stations," said CCTV.</p>

<p>The discovery could have important implications for China's decades-long project of building a permanent lunar outpost amid a U.S.-China race to find and mine the moon's resources.</p>

<p>NASA head Bill Nelson has repeatedly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasa-head-bill-nelson-says-china-hiding-military-presence-in-space-5466869" target="_blank">raised the alarm</a> about the rapid advances in China's space programme and the possibility of Beijing dominating the most resource-rich locations on the moon.</p>

<p>Using the new method, one tonne of lunar soil will be able to produce about 51-76 kg of water, equivalent to more than a hundred 500ml bottles of water, or the daily drinking water consumption of 50 people, the state broadcaster said.</p>

<p>China hopes that recent and future lunar expeditions will set the foundations to build the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), an initiative it is co-leading with Russia.</p>

<p>China's space agency has set 2035 as the date by when a "basic station" on the moon's south pole will be built, with a moon-orbiting space station added by 2045.</p>

<p>The announcement of the discovery comes at a time when Chinese scientists are already conducting experiments on lunar samples brought back in June by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinas-change-6-probe-carrying-samples-from-far-side-of-moon-returns-to-earth-5965227" target="_blank">Chang'e-6 mission.</a></p>

<p>While the Chang'e-5 mission brought back samples from the near side of the moon, Chang'e-6 retrieved lunar soil from the far side of the moon, which perpetually faces away from the Earth.</p>

<p>The importance of lunar water goes beyond making permanent human presence viable.

       <description><![CDATA[In his upcoming memoir retired US Army Lieutenant General Herbert Raymond McMaster alleges that Russian President Vladimir Putin manipulated former President Donald Trump by exploiting his ego.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herbert Raymond McMaster, a retired United States Army lieutenant general who served as the 25th National Security Advisor from 2017 to 2018, claimed in his new memoir how Russian President Vladimir Putin influenced former President Donald Trump during his time in office. He also claimed that Putin exploited Trump's ego for his own advantage.</p>

<p>All these bold claims appeared in McMaster's book <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/at-war-with-ourselves-h-r-mcmaster?variant=41223421394978"><em>'At War With Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House'</em></a>, which was published by HarperCollins and will hit the bookstalls on August 27.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/21/trump-putin-hr-mcmaster-memoir"><em>The Guardian</em></a> obtained a copy and outlined McMaster's account of the relationship between Putin and Trump. "Putin, a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump's ego and insecurities with flattery," McMaster writes.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-made-rs-2-crore-from-bible-sales-holds-rs-8-crore-in-crypto-report-6349300"><strong>Also Read | Donald Trump Made Rs 2 Crore From 'Bible' Sales, Holds Rs 8 Crore In Crypto: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>"Putin had described Trump as 'a very outstanding person, talented, without any doubt' and Trump had revealed his vulnerability to this approach, his affinity for strongmen, and his belief that he alone could forge a good relationship with Putin," McMaster continues.</p>

<p>"Like his predecessors George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Trump was overconfident in his ability to improve relations with the dictator in the Kremlin. The fact that most foreign policy experts in Washington advocated for a tough approach to the Kremlin seemed only to drive the president to the opposite approach," he writes.</p>

<p>McMaster clarifies that Trump developed his obsession with the Mueller report, which investigated Russian interference in the US presidential election in 2016. This fixation made it difficult to discuss anything related to Putin or Russia with him.</p>

<p>According to McMaster, Trump linked every topic involving Russia to the report and to accusations from Democrats and other critics that his campaign, and Trump himself, had colluded with Russia's disinformation efforts to influence the election.</p>

<p>Although special counsel Mueller found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy, he found out that the Trump campaign tried to conceal its contacts with Russian officials by hiding the truth several times. Further, Trump tried to interfere with or obstruct the investigation as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much-anticipated visit to conflict-hit Ukraine, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk said India could play an essential and constructive role in resolving the Russia-Ukraine war. Mr Tusk also said that PM Modi's visit to Ukraine will be "historic".&nbsp;PM Modi has expressed his concern over the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia, asserting that India supports dialogue and diplomacy for early restoration of peace and stability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poland PM also noted that PM Modi has confirmed his willingness that he is ready for a peaceful, and rightful end to war.</p>

<p>In a joint press meeting with PM Modi in Warsaw, Mr Tusk said, "We began with a clarification on very emotional issues. PM Modi confirmed his willingness that he is ready for peaceful, rightful and immediate end to war. We believe that India can play an essential and very constructive role. So, this announcement is very important for us. PM, in 10 hours you will visit Ukraine. We believe that your visit to Ukraine will be historic."</p>

<p>PM Modi today said India firmly believes that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/answer-to-any-problem-not-in-battlefield-pm-modi-on-ukraine-conflict-6393006">no problem can be solved on the battlefield</a>, adding that it is ready to provide all possible co-operation for the restoration of peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p>After<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-meets-polish-counterpart-donald-tusk-discusses-bilateral-ties-6392402"> holding wide-ranging talks with his Poland counterpart</a>, PM Modi said, "The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of deep concern for all of us.

<p>PM Modi arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the strategic ties between the two countries. This is the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Poland in nearly half a century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the second leg of his two-nation trip, PM Modi will be in Kyiv for around seven hours on Friday. He will leave for the Ukrainian capital onboard a train this evening and the journey will take around 10 hours. It will be the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Burundi has confirmed 171 cases of mpox, the health minister said on Thursday, following confirmation of the first cases in the country last month.</p>

<p>Formerly known as monkeypox, mpox is an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/explained-what-is-mpox-and-why-has-who-declared-it-a-global-health-emergency-826799" target="_blank">infectious disease</a> caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals that can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>"We already had a cumulative of 171 confirmed positive cases, 137 of which are still active," Health Minister Polycarpe Ndayikeza told AFP.</p>

<p>"So far there have been no deaths from mpox in Burundi," he added.</p>

<p>Three cases of mpox were detected in Burundi in late July, with the health ministry reporting 153 confirmed cases on August 18.</p>

<p>"The epidemic continues to gain ground," the ministry said last month, adding it was in the process of creating isolation wards in district hospitals to care for mpox patients.</p>

<p>An official told AFP the cases detected appeared to be the "new variant" spreading in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

<p>While mpox has been known for decades, a new more deadly and more transmissible strain -- known as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mpox-is-not-the-new-covid-says-who-6377283" target="_blank">Clade 1b</a> -- has driven the recent surge in cases.</p>

<p>Clade 1b causes death in about 3.6 percent of cases, with children more at risk, according to the World Health Organization, which has declared an international health emergency over the latest outbreak.</p>

<p>Cases are surging in the region with outbreaks reported in the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, but have also been detected in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mpox-virus-asias-1st-known-case-of-new-deadlier-mpox-strain-confirmed-in-thailand-6394012" target="_blank"> Asia </a>and Europe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asia's first known case of a new, deadlier Mpox virus strain has been confirmed in Thailand. The patient who has been tested positive for the new strain landed in Bangkok on August 14.</p>

<p>The patient had travelled from Africa to the United Kingdom before landing in Thailand.</p>

<p>After multiple lab tests on the 66-year-old European patient, it was confirmed that he was infected with mpox Clade 1b, according to The Department of Disease Control.</p>

<p>"Thailand's Department of Disease Control wishes to confirm the lab test result which shows mpox Clade 1b in a European patient," said the department in an official statement.</p>

<p>"We have monitored 43 people who have been in close contact with the patient and so far they have shown no symptoms, but we must continue monitoring for a total of 21 days," the department added.</p>

<p>Thailand so far has detected a staggering 800 mpox Clade 2 cases since 2022.</p>

<p>No mpox case has been detected in India as of now. In order to ensure safety of the nation's citizens, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/aiims-issues-protocol-for-handling-mpox-patients-as-cases-rise-globally-6379031" target="_blank">All India Institute for Medical Sciences</a> (AIIMS) has issued a protocol for handling suspected cases of mpox in India</p>

<p>For suspected, confirmed cases of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-airports-borders-on-alert-as-global-monkeypox-mpox-cases-rise-10-points-6372392" target="_blank">Mpox in India</a>, government hospitals in Delhi have been directed to set up isolation rooms</p>

<p>Authorities in airports, ports and borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan, have been directed by the centre to remain on high alert about passengers who show any symptoms of the virus.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is Mpox?</strong></h2>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines it as "an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick."</p>

<h2><strong>How Does The Virus Spread?</strong></h2>

<p>In Humans, it spreads through touch, kissing, or sex. In the case of a pregnant person being diagnosed with the virus, they may pass it on to their unborn child, says WHO. People diagnosed with diseases such as HIV are at an increased risk of facing complications from the virus</p>

<h2><strong>Can The Virus Be Prevented?</strong></h2>

<p>According to WHO, the virus "can be prevented by avoiding physical contact with someone who has mpox. Vaccination can help prevent infection for people at risk."</p>

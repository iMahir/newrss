       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst heightened diplomatic tensions between Canada and India, Elon Musk's reaction to posts on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has resonated with many social media users in India. In recent days, the billionaire has replied to or quoted several posts on X that criticise Mr Trudeau. Last week, Mr Musk predicted Justin Trudeau's downfall in the upcoming election, which is set to take place on or before October next year. "He will be gone in the upcoming election," Mr Musk wrote on X while responding to a user's request to help Canada get rid of Mr Trudeau.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The billionaire also reshared another post showing a graph on how Canada's GDP per capita has fallen under the Trudeau government. "Wow," he wrote while reacting to the tweet.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Reacting to Mr Musk's tweets, one Indian X user wrote, "He (Justin Trudeau) is another woke virus run by Khalistani terrorists. He has no respect anywhere." "We agree with you," said another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Cannot wait! Trudeau is a disaster! commented X user Udayan Mukherjee. "Hope your words turn into reality next yr," said user Shubham Chaudhary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Musk slammed the Justin Trudeau government last year as well for "crushing free speech" in the country. After the Canadian government made it compulsory for online streaming services to formally register with the government for "regulatory controls", Mr Musk called this policy "shameful" and wrote, "Trudeau is trying to crush free speech in Canada".</p>

<p>Before this, in February 2022, when Mr Trudeau invoked emergency powers - for the first time in the country's history - to arm his government with more power to respond to truckers protesting the vaccine mandates at that time, the billionaire compared him to Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Responding to an X post describing how Trudeau's government had ordered banks to help cut funding to the protesters, Mr Musk posted a meme of a photo of Hitler, with "Stop comparing me to Justin Trudeau" written above his head and "I had a budget" below it.</p>

<p><strong>Also read |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/amid-threats-of-protests-brampton-triveni-temple-cancels-consular-event-6997394">Temple In Canada Cancels Consular Event Amid Threat Of "Violent Protests"</a></strong></p>

<p>These comments by Mr Musk come amidst heightened political and diplomatic tensions between India and Canada. India has raised concerns over extremism and anti-India activities within Canada, calling for action to counter these issues. The strained ties worsened following accusations by Canadian leaders about the killing of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, leading India to recall its High Commissioner.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the past few months, the Indian community in Canada has also experienced a surge in violence and hostility, with reports ranging from vandalism of temples to verbal and physical assaults on individuals.</p>

<p>These recent events have raised alarm among Indian communities and their supporters. So naturally, Mr Musk's criticism of the Justin Trudeau government has resonated with many Indians, likely giving his popularity a boost in India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military has said it struck a rocket launcher in southern Lebanon after a barrage of 90 rockets crossed into the country from Lebanon, injuring three people.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah militants in Lebanon fired approximately 80 projectiles within five minutes at the Krayot, a cluster of towns north of Haifa, and the Galilee region, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Most of the projectiles were intercepted, and fallen projectiles were identified in the area," the military said, adding that two explosive drones from Lebanon were also intercepted in the Galilee area.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, another barrage of 10 rockets targeted the Western Galilee and Krayot, with some landing in open fields, the IDF noted.</p>

<p>Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service reported that strikes were identified in at least nine locations, injuring a 17-year-old boy, a 52-year-old man, and a 75-year-old man. Another man sustained injuries while rushing to a shelter.</p>

<p>Israel's National Fire and Rescue Authority reported that rockets set fire to several vehicles, with one projectile striking an apartment and another hitting a bus stop, causing damage.</p>

<p>Throughout Monday, a total of about 175 rockets have been fired by Hezbollah forces at northern Israel, according to the IDF.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid fears of an "extremely high level of violent protests," the Brampton Triveni Mandir and Community Centre has cancelled a Life Certificate Event.</p>

<p>The event, a consular camp, was scheduled to take place on November 17, where Indian-origin Hindus and Sikhs could renew essential life certificates.</p>

<p>The temple administration issued a statement on Monday, saying, "Please be advised that the Life Certificate Event scheduled at Brampton Triveni Mandir by the Indian Consulate on November 17, 2024, has been cancelled. This is due to official intelligence from Peel Regional Police, stating that there is an Extremely High and Imminent Threat Level of violent protests."</p>

<p>The authorities appologized to the community members, stating, "We apologize to all community members who were depending on the event. We are deeply saddened that Canadians now feel unsafe coming to Hindu Temples in Canada."</p>

<p>"We call on Peel Police to address the threats being circulated against Brampton Triveni Mandir and provide security guarantees to the Canadian Hindu Community and the general public," the temple administration added.</p>

<p>Brampton Triveni Mandir and Community Centre is a spiritual place for the gathering of all Hindus and like-minded people gather to participate in Puja, Kirtan, Sewa and Pravachan.</p>

<p>On November 3, an Indian consular camp at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, near Toronto, witnessed a "violent disruption". The incident sparked widespread criticism in and outside Canada.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the "deliberate attack" on Hindu temple in Canada and said that "cowardly attempts to intimidate" Indian diplomats were appalling and New Delhi expects Canadian authorities to ensure justice and uphold rule of law.</p>

<p>"I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India's resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law," PM Modi said on X.</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada took sharp downturn following Canadian leaders making allegations without providing evidence about an assassination on their soil.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The nomination of the hawkish congressman, who has Cuban heritage, would cap a remarkable turnaround in his relations with Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, The New York Times reported Monday night. It quoted three people as saying that the decision is not final, but that Trump appears to have settled on Rubio, a loyalist whom Trump passed over as his vice presidential running mate.</p>

<p>Rubio has been consistently named over the last week as one of the frontrunners to head US diplomacy, along with the abrasive former ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked if he was destined for a senior cabinet job, Rubio told CNN last week, "I always am interested in serving this country."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The nomination of the hawkish congressman, who has Cuban heritage, would cap a remarkable turnaround in his relations with Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2016, when they were competing for the Republican presidential nomination, Rubio called Trump a "con artist" and the "most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency."</p>

<p>Born to Cuban immigrants in Miami, he graduated with a political science degree from the University of Florida in 1993.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was elected to the US Senate in 2010 with his campaign buoyed by the Tea Party, a far-right contingent of Republicans that coalesced in the aftermath of Barack Obama's election as president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the most significant appointment yet for India from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump on Monday announced Mike Waltz, a Congressman from Florida who is the co-chair of the India Caucus, as his new National Security Adviser.</p>

<p>Waltz, 50, is a retired Army colonel who served as a Green Beret, an elite special forces unit of the US Army.</p>

<p>He has been a member of the US House of Representatives since 2019. He has been a forceful critic of President Joe Biden's foreign policy and serves on the House Armed Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the House Intelligence Committee this term.</p>

<p>He has called for Europe to do more to support Ukraine and for the US to be more stringent with its support, aligning with a key foreign policy goal of the President-elect. He has also been a staunch critic of the Biden administration's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Waltz has praised Trump for pushing Nato allies to spend more on defence, but unlike the President-elect has not suggested the US pull out of the alliance.</p>

<p>"Look we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations," Waltz said last month</p>

<p>Waltz is also on the Republican's China taskforce and has argued the US military is not as prepared as it needs to be if there is conflict in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Waltz had been open about his willingness to serve in the administration and was considered a candidate to lead the Pentagon. The role of National Security Adviser does not require Senate confirmation.</p>

<p>Waltz is also a co-chair of the India Caucus in the House, which is the largest country-specific group in the US Congress.</p>

<p>Trump has been moving swiftly to announce key personnel of his incoming administration, including Susan Wiles, his White House Chief of Staff who will be the first woman to hold the position.</p>

<p>Trump's other appointments include Stephen Miller, as a senior adviser, who is a known critic of the H-1b visa programme which he tried to kill in Trump's first administration.</p>

<p>The President-elect has been quickly assembling a roster of senior staff since winning last week's election. He has already announced Tom Homan as his "border czar," Elise Stefanik as US ambassador to the United Nations, and Lee Zeldin as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump is appointing immigration hawk Stephen Trump as his Deputy Chief of Staff. While Trump has not officially made the announcement, Vice President-elect JD Vance confirmed it in a post on X congratulating him on the appointment.</p>

<p>He said, "This is another fantastic pick by the President."</p>

<p>Miller was a policy adviser and speechwriter for Trump in his first term and resumed the function during his campaign, often travelling with Trump to his rallies.</p>

<p>Trump announced last week that he is appointing Susan Wiles, one of his main campaign managers as his Chief of Staff.</p>

<p>On Sunday night, he said that he was appointing Tom Homan as the "Border Czar" overseeing deportations and tightening border security.</p>

<p>Miller and Homan are expected to work closely on the crackdown on illegal migrants that Trump made the centrepiece of his campaign.</p>

<p>Their appointments being among the first is also a measure of the importance Trump places on immigration.</p>

<p>In media interviews, Miller has said that illegal migrants should be rounded up and detained in camps till they are deported.</p>

<p>"Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown," he warned in an interview with the New York Times last year.</p>

<p>The deportations will "begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office," he told Fox News last week.</p>

<p>One of Miller's controversial proposals is ending birthright citizenship -- conferring citizenship on anyone born in the US regardless of their parents' status -- which Trump has picked up.</p>

<p>His position does not require confirmation by the Senate.</p>

<p>Miller had worked for conservative Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachman and for Jeff Sessions when he was the Attorney General before joining Trump's 2016 campaign.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, Trump said he was naming Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as the permanent representative to the United Nations, the second Cabinet position he has announced after Wiles who has that rank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump will not be attending the traditional White House meeting on Wednesday with first lady Jill Biden, sources said.</p>

<p>Traditionally, when the outgoing President hosts the incoming President-elect in the Oval Office, the first lady hosts her successor for tea in the residence.</p>

<p>Michelle Obama hosted Melania Trump for tea in the Yellow Room after the 2016 election. However, Melania Trump did not meet with Jill Biden after the contentious 2020 race as Donald Trump repeatedly claimed he was the true winner.</p>

<p>Jill Biden extended Melania Trump the customary invitation last week as her husband also invited the President-elect to the Oval Office, a symbolic gesture to show the country and the world that there will be a peaceful transition of power -- and an implicit rebuke of Donald Trump, who refused Joe Biden the same meeting in 2020 as he contested that election's results. The two are set to meet on Wednesday at 11 a.m., according to the White House.</p>

<p>Melania and Jill have yet to speak in the aftermath of Kamala Harris' humiliating defeat, even though their husbands had a cordial phone call, sources confirmed.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Trump is not going, and they have not spoken," a source with knowledge said of the first ladies told DailyMail.com of Wednesday's presidential sitdown.</p>

<p>There was discussion about encouraging Melania Trump to come to Washington for the meeting, as some members of the President-elect's team felt it was important. But the incoming first lady, who spent her first four years in office redefining the role and what was expected, is laying an early marker indicating she will have even more autonomy the second time around.</p>

<p>Aside from 2020, it has been tradition for the current first lady to host the incoming first lady at the White House.</p>

<p>The last time Jill Biden and Melania Trump would have seen each other would have been at Rosalynn Carter's funeral in November of last year. All living former first ladies attended.</p>

<p>Four years ago, Donald Trump snubbed Joe Biden after Biden defeated him, refusing to invite him for the traditional Oval Office meeting and delaying the transition process. Melania Trump followed her husband's lead and didn't reach out to Jill Biden.</p>

<p>The Bidens, however, have promised a peaceful and orderly transition to the upcoming Trump Administration.</p>

<p>"The Bidens extended congratulations and a joint invite to the Trumps to meet at the White House," Jill Biden's office said.</p>

<p>Donald Trump and Joe Biden will meet on Wednesday in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>The Bidens will attend Trump's inauguration in January 2025, according to the White House.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the outgoing president welcomes the incoming one to the White House on the morning of the inauguration before riding together in the same vehicle to the Capitol building for the swearing-in.</p>

<p>Trump rode with then-President Barack Obama to his own inauguration. Biden attended that inauguration in his role as outgoing Vice President.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Black Friday? No. Cyber Monday? Nope. Prime Day? Absolutely not. The world's biggest shopping event happens in China each year - and it's called Singles Day.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Friday? No. Cyber Monday? Nope. Prime Day? Absolutely not. The world's biggest shopping event happens in China each year - and it's called Singles Day.</p>

<p>Originally a holiday to celebrate being single, as a counter to Valentine's Day, the event has grown into a weeks-long online shopping festival that this year began on Oct. 14 and peaked on Nov. 11 - making it the longest Singles Day sales period ever.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN DID THE IDEA OF SINGLES DAY ORIGINATE?</strong></p>

<p>The idea for Singles Day had originated at China's Nanjing University back in 1993 and was originally called "Bachelor's Day." On the day, single people treat themselves with gifts and presents, while also organising social gatherings and parties.</p>

<p><strong>HOW MUCH DO CONSUMERS SPEND?</strong></p>

<p>Last year, the total value of goods sold during the shopping bonanza - also known as "Double 11" - totaled 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.4 billion), according to data provider Syntun.</p>

<p>That is more than four times the $38 billion U.S. shoppers spent last year during Cyber Week, the period from Black Friday to Cyber Monday, per data from Adobe Analytics.</p>

<p>Cyber Monday immediately follows Black Friday, which falls on the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday, the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States.</p>

<p>But growth has been slowing even as overall sales for Singles Day hit record highs, with last year's 2% rise marking the slowest increase ever.</p>

<p>The event has in recent years lost some of its novelty with the rise of other shopping festivals in China, including the midyear "618" sales that are the country's second-largest and this year saw overall sales fall for the first time.</p>

<p>"Vendors are becoming more rational, gross merchandise value is not the core pursuit, profit is," said Lu Zhengwang, an independent e-commerce expert. "However, profit is hard to reach, the competition is still super intense, and only the cheaper price sells."</p>

<p><strong>WHAT MAJOR BRANDS AND PRODUCTS ARE SHOPPERS BUYING?</strong></p>

<p>While Alibaba started "Double 11" in 2009 to win over online shoppers with discounts and promotions, China's major e-commerce platforms now all take part in it.</p>

<p>JD.com joined in 2012 and PDD Holdings-owned Pinduoduo has also become a significant player, offering low cost products in competition with Alibaba-owned Tmall and Taobao platforms.</p>

<p>Last year, shoppers spent on necessities such as tissues, handwash, instant noodles and pet food, while trading down and buying less in discretionary or big-ticket categories such as home appliances and furniture.</p>

<p>This year, household appliances are likely to perform better than last year, benefiting from a national 150 billion yuan trade-in subsidy scheme announced in July to help boost consumption.</p>

<p>According to a Bain survey conducted before the beginning of the Singles Day sales festivals in late October, 49% of Chinese shoppers said they were excited by the event, down from 53% in 2023 and 76% in 2021.</p>

<p>About three-quarters of respondents said they would spend the same amount or less on Singles Day promotions in 2024.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DOES SINGLES DAY COMPARE TO BLACK FRIDAY?</strong></p>

<p>U.S. shoppers last year bought smart watches, toys and video games during the key Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping periods, according to Adobe.</p>

<p>From 2014 until 2021, Singles Day had posted growth rates of about 34% annually on average, versus Cyber Week's 17% average gain, according to data from consultancy Bain and from Adobe Analytics.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT OTHER COMPANIES HOPE TO BENEFIT?</strong></p>

<p>Several American companies from apparel maker Nike to cosmetics firm Estee Lauder and consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble have a big presence on Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Tmall and JD.com.</p>

<p>Aggressive discounting has been a hallmark of Chinese shopping festivals, especially since the end of the country's harsh COVID-19 restrictions in late 2022 with low prices leveraged to manufacture a consumption comeback that hasn't really eventuated.</p>

<p>This year, platforms offered low prices on Apple iPhone 16 models, with Tmall offering as much as 1,600 yuan off the phone with subsidies applied. JD.com discounts were similar and also included a free year of AppleCare+.</p>

<p>L'Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus on a post-earnings call with analysts in October said it was too soon to comment on "Double 11."</p>

<p>"The length - the duration of 11.11 has been extended. It's going to be the longest 11.11 ever, has been increased by 10 days," Hieronimus said. "We are determined to have our brands in the top rankings of this event."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Spirit Airlines jetliner headed for Haiti's troubled capital was hit by gunfire with one flight attendant suffering minor injuries, the US carrier said Monday.</p>

<p>Flight 951 from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Port-au-Prince was diverted and landed safely in neighboring Dominican Republic, Spirit said in a statement. An on-the-ground inspection revealed damage to the aircraft "consistent with gunfire," it added.</p>

<p>"No guest injuries were reported," the budget carrier said, adding that its service to Haiti has been suspended pending further evaluation.</p>

<p>The Haitian capital is largely controlled by powerful, well-armed gangs.</p>

<p>The damaged aircraft was taken out of service and Spirit was arranging for passengers to be returned to Fort Lauderdale on Monday.</p>

<p>The airport in Port-au-Prince has grounded all commercial flights, the Miami Herald reported.</p>

<p>American Airlines also announced it was suspending its flight service between Miami and Haiti's capital until Thursday.</p>

<p>The gunfire incident comes as the country prepared to swear in a new prime minister amid a new power struggle that threatens to plunge the impoverished, crisis-wracked nation into fresh chaos.</p>

<p>Haiti's transitional council has moved to replace Prime Minister Garry Conille, according to an official gazette bulletin seen Sunday by AFP.</p>

<p>The nine-member council's decision, dated for publication on Monday November 11, seeks to push out Conille after just five months in office and replace him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aime.</p>

<p>The council is a new body that is not featured in the constitution and it was not approved by parliament because Haiti does not have a sitting legislature.</p>

<p>The country has not held elections since 2016, widening a political vacuum that has worsened existing security and health crises.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich pledged on Monday to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank in 2025, calling Donald Trump's return to power in the United States "an important opportunity".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich pledged on Monday to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank in 2025, calling Donald Trump's return to power in the United States "an important opportunity".</p>

<p>"The year 2025 will be, with God's help, the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria," the far-right minister said, using the biblical name for the West Bank.</p>

<p>Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Palestinians claim the territory as part of a future independent state, and have repeatedly warned that Israeli settlements there are an obstacle to peace.</p>

<p>Smotrich, whose ministerial portfolio also includes some areas of the defence ministry's work, said he had ordered preparations for "applying sovereignty" over Israeli settlements.</p>

<p>Speaking at a meeting in parliament, he said he had "instructed the director of settlement affairs in the defence ministry and the Civil Administration... to prepare the necessary infrastructure for applying sovereignty".</p>

<p>Smotrich congratulated US President-elect Donald Trump on his "incredible and sweeping victory", which the far-right politician said "also brings an important opportunity for the State of Israel".</p>

<p>"During his first term, President Trump led dramatic moves," Smotrich said.</p>

<p>These included recognising Israel's sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, breaking with much of the international community by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, and brokering a set of normalisation deals between Israel and several Arab countries.</p>

<p>Before the normalisation agreements, dubbed the Abraham Accords, the Israeli government had said it would annex large Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank, before scrapping the plan as the deals were announced.</p>

<p>"We were on the verge of applying sovereignty over the settlements in Judea and Samaria," Smotrich said.</p>

<p>"Now it is time to do it."</p>

<p>He said he would push the government to work together with the new US administration on the matter.</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, Israel's newly appointed Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Palestinian statehood was not "realistic", after Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas reiterated his demand for a "sovereign" country.</p>

<p>"I don't think this position is realistic today and we must be realistic," Saar told reporters.</p>

<p>The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned Saar's remarks as an "extension of the war of extermination and displacement against our people".</p>

<p>It also said the comments were in "disregard for international legitimacy... and the international consensus on the two-state solution" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<p>Excluding east Jerusalem, the West Bank is home to three million Palestinians alongside around 500,000 Israelis living in settlement that are illegal under international law.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Monday nominated Lee Zeldin, a former congressman and early loyalist of the Republican, to oversee US environmental policy, the latest in a series of swift cabinet choices by the president-elect.</p>

<p>If confirmed by the US Senate as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Trump said Zeldin would be charged with making "swift deregulatory decisions" aimed at rolling back protections enacted by the Joe Biden administration.</p>

<p>"Lee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies," Trump said in announcing his pick.</p>

<p>A former four-term congressman from New York state, the 44-year-old Zeldin "will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet."</p>

<p>Trump is a global warming skeptic who has mocked Democrats over climate change policy. In 2016 during his first presidential run, he said of the EPA: "We are going to get rid of it in almost every form" and leave "little tidbits" in operation.</p>

<p>During his first term, the EPA faced considerable restructuring and budget cuts, and many of its regulatory roles were scaled back.</p>

<p>Over his own four years in office Biden has tightened environmental limits, including pollution standards for cars and light trucks aimed at reducing carbon emissions.</p>

<p>The outgoing Democrat also introduced regulations aimed at reducing industry emissions of planet-warming methane and toxic mercury.</p>

<p>Trump has long suggested that if elected his administration would take a hatchet to Biden's more restrictive environmental policies.</p>

<p>Zeldin thanked Trump on X, saying he will work to "restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs... while protecting access to clean air and water."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Israel has for years accused Iran of seeking to build nuclear weapons, but the Islamic Republic has repeatedly denied the claims.</p>

<p>The United States in 2018 under President Donald Trump -- who won re-election last week -- withdrew from a 2015 nuclear accord between Tehran and Western powers including Washington that sought to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>Tehran has since enriched uranium up to 60 percent, just 30 percent below atomic weapons grade.</p>

<p>Israel and Iran have traded tit-for-tat missile strikes, triggering fears of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Iran twice fired missiles directly on Israeli territory this year, prompting Israel to retaliate, most recently on October 26 when it hit Iranian military facilities.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arab and Muslim leaders demanded on Monday that Israel withdraw from occupied Palestinian territories as a precondition for regional peace, while denouncing "shocking" Israeli crimes in war-ravaged Gaza.</p>

<p>A summit meeting in the Saudi capital Riyadh gave the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation's 57 nations a chance to speak with one voice on turmoil engulfing the region, more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>It came less than a week after Donald Trump secured a second term as president of the United States, Israel's top military backer.</p>

<p>The summit's closing statement said that "a just and comprehensive peace in the region... cannot be achieved without ending the Israeli occupation of all occupied Arab territories to the line of June 4, 1967," referring to the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem as well as Gaza and the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The statement mentioned UN resolutions which have called on Israel to withdraw from these areas, and the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, in which Arab nations offered Israel normalised ties in return for a two-state agreement with the Palestinians along the 1967 lines.</p>

<p>The international community should "launch a plan with specific steps and timing under international sponsorship" to make a sovereign Palestinian state a reality, the statement said.</p>

<p>Hamas later urged Arab and Muslim nations to back up those pledges with action.</p>

<p>"The establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital would require more immediate efforts and practical solutions to force (Israel) to stop its aggression and genocide against our people," Hamas said in a statement.</p>

<p>The hard-right Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains opposed to Palestinian statehood and Israel's new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, dismissed the prospect as not "realistic".</p>

<p>Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich later Monday vowed to push for annexation of parts of the West Bank in 2025.</p>

<p>The Riyadh summit reiterated regional leaders' call for Palestinian territories -- including Gaza, which is separated from the West Bank by Israeli territory -- to be grouped together in a future state.</p>

<p>The leaders also condemned "horrific and shocking crimes" by Israel's army, saying they occurred "in the context of the crime of genocide".</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 last year, which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed more than 43,600 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasefire call</strong></p>

<p>Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran, began firing on Israel after the October 7 attack, in stated support of its Palestinian ally.</p>

<p>The regular cross-border exchanges escalated in late September. Israel has intensified its air strikes and later sent ground troops into southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Addressing Monday's summit, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the world must "immediately halt the Israeli actions against our brothers in Palestine and Lebanon" and condemned Israel's campaign in Gaza as "genocide".</p>

<p>Prince Mohammed, the Gulf kingdom's de facto ruler, also called on Israel not to attack Iran, highlighting improving ties between Riyadh and its regional rival Tehran.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati warned that his country was suffering an "existential" crisis and hit out at countries meddling in its internal affairs -- a thinly veiled swipe at Iran.</p>

<p><strong>A 'signal' to Trump</strong></p>

<p>Trump's election last week for a second term in the White House was likely on leaders' minds, said Anna Jacobs, senior Gulf analyst for the International Crisis Group think tank.</p>

<p>"This summit is very much an opportunity for regional leaders to signal to the incoming Trump administration what they want in terms of US engagement," she said.</p>

<p>Iranian First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref said in his remarks that "the world is waiting" for Trump "to immediately stop the war against the innocent people of Gaza and Lebanon".</p>

<p>The final statement included a call for a ban on the export and transfer of weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>Despite criticism of the impact Israel's military campaign has had on Gaza civilians, outgoing US President Joe Biden has ensured that Washington remains Israel's most important military backer during more than a year of fighting.</p>

<p>In his first term, Trump defied international consensus with a series of moves praised by the Israeli government but condemned by Palestinians.</p>

<p>He recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, moving the US embassy there, and endorsed Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia's crown prince and de facto ruler condemned what he called the "genocide" committed by Israel against Palestinians when he spoke at a summit of Muslim and Arab leaders on Monday.</p>

<p>"The Kingdom renews its condemnation and categorical rejection of the genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people," Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said at an Arab Islamic summit, echoing comments by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud late last month.</p>

<p>He urged the international community to stop Israel from attacking Iran and to respect Iran's sovereignty.</p>

<p>The crown prince said in September the kingdom would not recognise Israel unless a Palestinian state were created.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden's administration had sought to broker a normalisation accord between Saudi Arabia and Israel that would have included U.S. security guarantees for the kingdom, among other bilateral deals between Washington and Riyadh.</p>

<p>Those normalisation efforts were put on ice after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants from Gaza and Israel's subsequent retaliation.</p>

<p>In a press conference later on Monday, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit pointed to an article in a concluding statement to the summit that moved to freeze Israel's membership in the U.N. General Assembly.</p>

<p>He stated that freezing membership would not come under the Security Council's jurisdiction and could be decided by the General Assembly.</p>

<p>"We might witness soon the freezing of the membership (of Israel) through a UNGA majority decision," said Aboul Gheit.</p>

<p>The summit's concluding statement demanded all countries ban exports or transfers of weapons and ammunition to Israel and urged the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for civilian and military officials in Israel.</p>

<p>Israel's military assault on Gaza in the last 13 months has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly its entire population, caused a hunger crisis and led to allegations of genocide at the World Court, which Israel denies.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US climate envoy John Podesta on Monday urged governments to keep faith in the country's promise to combat global warming, saying Donald Trump can slow, not stop, the transition from fossil fuels when he returns to office in January.</p>

<p>The annual UN climate summit began on Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan, with many country delegations concerned Trump's victory in the US presidential election on Nov. 5 would hinder progress to limit planetary warming.</p>

<p>Trump has promised to again remove the United States, the world's biggest historic greenhouse gas emitter, from international climate cooperation and maximise the country's already record-high fossil fuel production.</p>

<p>"For those of us dedicated to climate action, last week's outcome in the United States is obviously bitterly disappointing," Podesta said at the summit.</p>

<p>"But what I want to tell you today is that while the United States federal government, under Donald Trump, may put climate action on the back burner, the work to contain climate change is going to continue in the United States."</p>

<p>He said the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden's landmark climate legislation providing billions of dollars in subsidies for clean energy, would continue to drive investments in solar, wind and other technologies, and that U.S. state governments would also push emissions cuts through regulation.</p>

<p>"I don't think that any of that is reversible. Can it be slowed down? Maybe. But the direction is clear," he said.</p>

<p>Although Trump has promised to rescind the IRA, to do so would require an act of Congress - and that could be elusive due to support from some Republican lawmakers whose districts benefit from IRA-linked investments.</p>

<p>AGENDA WRANGLING</p>

<p>As well as the U.S. election, the talks in Baku are vying for attention with economic concerns and wars in Ukraine and Gaza.</p>

<p>That complicates the summit's ambition to resolve the priority agenda item - a deal for up to $1 trillion in annual climate finance for developing countries, replacing a target of $100 billion.</p>

<p>U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell sought to whip up momentum.</p>

<p>"Let's dispense with the idea that climate finance is charity," he said at the Baku stadium. "An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest."</p>

<p>This year is on track to be the hottest on record. Rich and poor countries alike have been challenged by extreme weather events, including flooding disasters in Africa, coastal Spain and the U.S. state of North Carolina, and drought gripping South America, Mexico and the U.S. West.</p>

<p>But even agreeing one of COP29's first tasks proved a challenge: the agenda for negotiations was delayed by more than five hours before being approved.</p>

<p>Four sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions, asking to remain anonymous, said the European Union and small island countries had demanded nations discuss how to build on last year's deal to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Fossil fuel-producing Gulf states wanted to limit discussions to the elements of last year's COP28 deal related to finance, the sources said.</p>

<p>In the end, countries agreed they would discuss the COP28 agreement, but left open where these talks would focus.</p>

<p>They also endorsed a set of carbon credit quality standards seen as critical to launching a U.N.-backed global carbon market to fund projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>And countries sidestepped a spat over trade tensions, after China had asked to include concerns about some countries' trade policies on the COP29 agenda. Beijing withdrew its proposal, settling instead for informal talks on the issue with Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency.</p>

<p>Trade has gained importance as an issue for China, already facing EU tariffs, because of Trump's campaign promise to impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods, and 60% on Chinese goods.</p>

<p>Many also worry U.S. disengagement could lead other countries to backpedal on existing climate pledges or scale back future ambitions.</p>

<p>"People will be saying, well, the U.S. is the second biggest emitter. It's the biggest economy in the world ... If they don't set themselves an ambitious target, why would we?" Marc Vanheukelen, the EU's climate ambassador from 2019 to 2023, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Podesta said China, currently the world's biggest emitter, has an obligation to step up, in part by developing a plan to cut emissions that is aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement goal to limit planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>"They have an important role to play and I hope they play it," Podesta said.</p>

<p>Host Azerbaijan has lobbied governments to accelerate their move to clean energy while touting gas as a transition fuel. Its oil and gas revenues accounted for 35% of its economy in 2023, down from 50% two years earlier. The government says these revenues will decline to 22% by 2028.</p>

<p>President Ilham Aliyev has called Azerbaijan's fossil-fuel bounty "a gift of God," and Baku has proposed creating a Climate Finance Action Fund to collect voluntarily up to $1 billion from extractive companies across 10 countries including Azerbaijan.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Countries at the United Nations COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan will attempt to agree rules for a global system for trading carbon offset credits.</p>

<h2><strong>Here's what you should know:</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>WHAT ARE CARBON OFFSETS?</strong></h2>

<p>Some governments and companies may struggle to reduce their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to meet their climate targets. Supporters of carbon offsets see them as a key means to help meet these goals.</p>

<p>These offsets allow one nation or company to offset some of their emissions by paying for actions to cut emissions elsewhere. These actions might include rural solar panel installations or converting a fleet of petrol buses to electric.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS ARTICLE 6?</strong></h3>

<p>Article 6 of the Paris Agreement helps countries work together to reduce their carbon emissions. It sets out two options for countries and companies to trade offsets, helping them meet the goals they set to reduce planetary-warming gases in their climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).</p>

<p>One allows two countries to set their own terms for a bilateral carbon trading agreement, this is known as Article 6.2. The second aims to create a central, UN-managed system for countries and companies to begin offsetting their carbon emissions and trading those offsets, known as Article 6.4.</p>

<p>Article 6 is seen an important mechanism for delivering climate finance to developing countries, and a Paris Agreement carbon market, if launched, could continue operating even if the United States under Donald Trump withdraws support for the Paris Agreement.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT'S BEEN DECIDED SO FAR?</strong></h3>

<p>At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, negotiators reached a breakthrough agreement that established a broad rulebook to regulate trading of carbon credits.</p>

<p>But after two weeks of talks at COP28 in Dubai, countries failed to seal a deal on necessary details to operationalise a central carbon trading system or to clarify rules for nations wanting to make bilateral arrangements.</p>

<p>Some countries like Japan and Indonesia have decided to press ahead with bilateral agreements without those clarifications and are already preparing to trade carbon credits, known as "internationally transferable mitigation outcomes" (ITMOs). The UN says 91 agreements had been made between 56 countries as of October this year. Thailand and Switzerland completed the first sale in January, and the market for bilateral trade agreements is still quite small.</p>

<p>Some buyers are worried there are not adequate rules to stop countries changing the terms of the agreements, or revoking them, and that there is not a robust system to ensure that credits bought and sold are not being counted by both the buying and selling countries.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WILL BE DECIDED AT COP29?</strong></h3>

<p>Officials are keen to secure an early "win" on Article 6 at this year's climate conference.</p>

<p>Market watchers are hopeful an agreement can be reached to set guardrails for the bilateral agreements and to operationalise the UN-backed centralised marketplace.</p>

<p>Guardrails include checks and balances to provide assurance countries are buying and selling actual emissions reductions. Some countries for example want methods nations use to generate credits to be checked internationally.</p>

<p>Countries will also negotiate whether the UN's central registry can itself house credits that can be transacted and retired or whether it should operate just for accounting purposes.</p>

<p>An expert group elected under United Nations rules has already hammered out a framework for the multilateral trading system to ensure credits meet basic quality standards. But countries at COP29 can decide to either sign off on this standard, open up further discussions, or reject it.</p>

<p>After COP29, the technical expert group will meet again to agree which methodologies for generating carbon credits through cookstoves projects or reforestation for example can issue credits into the new Paris Aligned system.</p>

<p>If the key points are resolved this year, the system could launch as soon as 2025.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKET?</strong></h3>

<p>Some companies that are under no legal obligation to cut their emissions have set voluntary targets, which they can meet partially through buying credits on a voluntary carbon market. In 2022, the voluntary market was valued at about $2 billion worldwide. But the market value plummeted to $723 million last year after being shaken by repeated scandals.</p>

<p>Linking up carbon projects currently in the voluntary market with the Paris Agreement system could boost confidence.</p>

<p>Developers of projects like mangrove restoration to regenerative agriculture can apply to have their credits sold under the UN system, meaning that if approved, they could sell in either that system or on the voluntary market. Experts expect UN-approved credits to carry a higher price tag.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has begun the process of choosing a cabinet and selecting other high-ranking administration officials following his presidential election victory.</p>

<p>Here are the early picks and top contenders for some of the key posts overseeing defence, intelligence, diplomacy, trade, immigration and economic policymaking. Some are in contention for a range of posts.</p>

<p><strong>SUSIE WILES, chief of staff</strong></p>

<p>Trump on Thursday announced that Wiles, one of his two campaign managers, will be his White House chief of staff.</p>

<p>While the specifics of her political views are somewhat unclear, Wiles, 67, is credited with running a successful and efficient campaign. Supporters hope she will instil a sense of order and discipline that was often lacking during Trump's first four-year term when he cycled through a number of chiefs of staff.</p>

<p><strong>TOM HOMAN, 'border czar'</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced on Sunday night that Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement from his first administration, will be in charge of the country's borders.</p>

<p>Trump made cracking down on people in the country illegally a central element of his campaign, promising mass deportations.</p>

<p>Homan said on Monday he would prioritize deporting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites.</p>

<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said Homan will be "in charge of our nation's borders ("The Border Czar"), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security," including the deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p><strong>ELISE STEFANIK, U.N. ambassador</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced on Monday that Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, would be his ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p>Stefanik, 40, a U.S. representative from New York state and House Republican conference chair, took a leadership position in the House of Representatives in 2021 when she was elected to replace then-Representative Liz Cheney, who was ousted for criticizing Trump's false claims of election fraud.</p>

<p>"I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations," Trump said in a statement. "Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter."</p>

<p>Stefanik will arrive at the U.N. after bold promises by Trump to end the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>SCOTT BESSENT, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Bessent, a key economic adviser to Trump, is widely seen as a top candidate for treasury secretary. A longtime hedge fund investor who taught at Yale University for several years, Bessent has a warm relationship with the president-elect.</p>

<p>While Bessent has long favored the laissez-faire policies that were popular in the pre-Trump Republican Party, he has also spoken highly of Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool. He has praised the president-elect's economic philosophy, which rests on a skepticism of both regulations and international trade.</p>

<p><strong>JOHN PAULSON, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Paulson, a billionaire hedge fund manager and major Trump donor, is another top contender for treasury secretary. The longtime financier has told associates he would be interested in the job.</p>

<p>A longtime proponent of tax cuts and deregulation, Paulson's profile is broadly similar to that of other potential members of Trump's economic team. He has publicly supported targeted tariffs as a tool to ensure U.S. national security and combat unfair trade practices abroad.</p>

<p>One high-profile fundraiser hosted by Paulson in April raked in over $50 million for the former president.</p>

<p><strong>LARRY KUDLOW, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Fox Business Network personality Larry Kudlow, who served as director of the National Economic Council for much of Trump's first term, has an outside shot at becoming his treasury secretary and would likely have an opportunity to take a separate economics-focused position if he is interested.</p>

<p>While he is privately skeptical of broad tariffs, there is publicly little daylight between the policies Kudlow advocates and those of the president-elect.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>A loyalist who served as Trump's U.S. trade representative for essentially the then-president's entire term, Lighthizer will almost certainly be invited back. Though Bessent and Paulson likely have a better shot at becoming treasury secretary, Lighthizer has an outside chance, and he might be able to reprise his old role if he's interested.</p>

<p>Like Trump, Lighthizer is a trade skeptic and a firm believer in tariffs. He was one of the leading figures in Trump's trade war with China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term.</p>

<p><strong>HOWARD LUTNICK, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>The co-chair of Trump's transition effort and the longtime chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick is in the running for treasury secretary.</p>

<p>A bombastic New Yorker like Trump, Lutnick has uniformly praised the president-elect's economic policies, including his use of tariffs.</p>

<p>He has at times given elaborate, unvarnished opinions about what policies will be enacted in Trump's second term. Some Trump allies had privately complained that he too often presented himself as speaking on behalf of the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>LINDA McMAHON, potential commerce secretary</strong></p>

<p>Professional wrestling magnate and former Small Business Administration director Linda McMahon is seen as the frontrunner to lead Trump's Department of Commerce, three sources briefed on the plans said.</p>

<p>McMahon is a major donor and was an early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. This time, Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>McMahon is the co-founder and former CEO of the professional wrestling franchise WWE. She later served as director of the Small Business Administration, resigning in 2019, and went on to lead a pro-Trump political action committee that supported his 2020 reelection bid.</p>

<p><strong>RICHARD GRENELL, potential secretary of state&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Grenell is among Trump's closest foreign policy advisers. During the president-elect's first four-year term, he served as acting director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador to Germany. When Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in September, Grenell sat in on the private meeting.</p>

<p>Grenell's private dealings with foreign leaders and often-caustic personality have made him the center of multiple controversies, though significant Republican gains in the Senate mean he could likely be confirmed. He is also considered a top contender for national security adviser, which does not require Senate confirmation.</p>

<p>Among the policies he has advocated for is setting up an autonomous zone in eastern Ukraine to end the war there, a position Kyiv considers unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT O'BRIEN, potential secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>O'Brien, Trump's fourth and final national security adviser during his first term, maintains a close relationship with Trump, and the two often speak on national security matters.</p>

<p>He is likely in the running for secretary of state or other top foreign policy and national security posts. He has maintained close contacts with foreign leaders since Trump left office, having met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel in May.</p>

<p>His views are somewhat more hawkish than some of Trump's advisers. He has, for instance, been more supportive of military aid for Ukraine than many of his Republican contemporaries, and he is a proponent of banning TikTok in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>BILL HAGERTY, potential secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>A U.S. senator from Tennessee who worked on Trump's 2016 transition effort, Hagerty is considered a top contender for secretary of state. He has maintained solid relations with essentially all factions of the Republican Party, and could likely be confirmed with ease in the Senate.</p>

<p>He served as U.S. ambassador to Japan in the first Trump administration at a time when the president touted his warm relationship with then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>

<p>Hagerty's policies are broadly in line with Trump's. Earlier in the year, he voted against a major military aid package for Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>MARCO RUBIO, potential secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, is also a top secretary of state contender whose policies hew closely to those of Trump. Like Hagerty, he was a contender to be Trump's 2024 running mate.</p>

<p>Rubio has long been involved in foreign affairs in the Senate, particularly as it relates to Latin America, and he has solid relationships throughout the party.</p>

<p><strong>MIKE WALTZ, potential defense secretary</strong></p>

<p>A former Army Green Beret who is currently a U.S. congressman from Florida, Waltz has established himself as one of the foremost China hawks in the House.</p>

<p>Among the various China-related bills he has co-sponsored are measures designed to lessen U.S. reliance on critical minerals mined in China.</p>

<p>Waltz is on speaking terms with Trump and is widely considered to be a serious contender for secretary of defense.</p>

<p><strong>KEITH KELLOGG, potential candidate for national security adviser</strong></p>

<p>A retired lieutenant general who served as chief of staff to the National Security Council under Trump, Kellogg has Trump's ear and is a contender for national security adviser, among other national security posts.</p>

<p>During the campaign, he presented Trump with a plan to end the war in Ukraine, which involved forcing both parties to the negotiating table and ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine for the foreseeable future, among other measures.</p>

<p><strong>MARK GREEN, potential homeland security secretary</strong></p>

<p>A former Army flight surgeon and the current chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, Green is considered by some Trump allies in Washington as a contender for the top job at the Department of Homeland Security . His supporters describe him as a Trump loyalist and immigration hardliner who also has significant legislative experience.</p>

<p>Green was nominated by Trump during his first term to serve as secretary of the Army, but he withdrew his name as past statements, which were widely seen as transphobic and Islamophobic, drew more scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>JOHN RATCLIFFE, potential attorney general</strong></p>

<p>A former congressman and prosecutor who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's last year in office, Ratcliffe is seen as a potential attorney general, though he could also take a separate national security or intelligence position, such as CIA director.</p>

<p>The president-elect's allies view Ratcliffe as a hardcore Trump loyalist who could likely win Senate confirmation. Still, during his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe often contradicted the assessments of career civil servants, drawing criticism from Democrats who said he politicized the role.</p>

<p><strong>MIKE LEE, potential attorney general</strong></p>

<p>A U.S. senator from Utah, Lee is widely seen as another top candidate for attorney general. Though the former prosecutor declined to vote for Trump during the 2016 election, he later became an unwavering ally, and he has become something of an intellectual hero among some factions of Trumpworld.</p>

<p>Lee was a key figure in attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden and has spread unfounded conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p>

<p><strong>KASH PATEL, potential candidate for national security posts</strong></p>

<p>A former Republican House staffer who served in various high-ranking staff roles in the defence and intelligence communities during Trump's first term, Patel frequently appeared on the campaign trail to rally support for the candidate.</p>

<p>Some Trump allies would like to see Patel, considered the ultimate Trump loyalist, appointed CIA director. Any position requiring Senate confirmation may be a challenge, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patel has leaned into controversy throughout his career. In an interview with Trump ally Steve Bannon last year, he promised to "come after" politicians and journalists perceived to be enemies of Trump.</p>

<p>During Trump's first term, Patel drew animosity from some more experienced national security officials, who saw him as volatile and too eager to please the then-president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right up to Election Day, Donald Trump and his backers were issuing warnings of voter fraud. But once his decisive victory took shape, the flood of misinformation slowed to a trickle.</p>

<p>Experts said the shift points to what opponents have long argued was Trump's preemptive deployment of fraud claims in case he lost, setting the stage for him to challenge the results as he did in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>A sharp example came toward the end of voting on Tuesday when officials in the largest city of must-win Pennsylvania had to quickly deny Trump's unfounded claim that police were responding to "massive cheating" in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Those were the latest doubts the ex-TV star raised about election fraud. But the false accusations go back to his rejection of the 2020 results that ultimately led to his supporters trying to violently undo President Joe Biden's poll win.</p>

<p>"As soon as the vote came in swinging their way, Republicans stopped making claims of election fraud late Tuesday, proving yet again it was all a gift," Philip Mai, co-director of the Toronto-based Social Media Lab, told AFP.</p>

<p>The drop was particularly noticeable among members of the "Election Integrity Community," a group on X started by Elon Musk's America PAC, which encouraged its some 65,000 members to report irregularities.</p>

<p>When the polls opened on November 5, the group shared over 1,000 posts an hour, according to data collected by the nonprofit National Conference on Citizenship (NCoC).</p>

<p>The pace had fallen dramatically by the time the race was called for Trump in some crucial swing states early on November 6, blocking viable paths to victory for Vice President Kamala Harris.<br />
In the days since the election, the group has posted fewer than 100 posts per hour, NCoC said.</p>

<p>The fraud mentions on some platforms popular on the right began to drop the day before the election -- after rising considerably in the run-up, said Welton Chang, co-founder of Pyrra Technologies, a company that monitors fringe social networks.</p>

<p>"For one thing, Trump himself stopped talking about it," Chang told AFP. "Part of this is a follow-the-leader effect."</p>

<p>The drop-off in fraud narratives, researchers said, was particularly evident on alternative tech platforms catering to conservatives -- including Trump's own Truth Social.</p>

<p><strong>- Trump 'the conductor' -</strong></p>

<p>Not only did Trump go quiet on fraud claims after his Philadelphia allegations, but other Republicans have as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked on CNN whether he believed the election was free and fair, lawmaker and hard-line Trump ally Jim Jordan said "I do."</p>

<p>He declined to engage with the suggestion that Republicans only call foul when they lose.<br />
Trump won all seven battleground states and he is on pace to capture the popular vote, which he did not do in his shock election victory in 2016.</p>

<p>The Democratic leadership has not questioned the 2024 election's outcome, with both Biden and Harris conceding the loss and deeming the result a free and fair one.</p>

<p>However, there were 30,300 mentions of the hashtag #DoNotConcedeKamala with one of the words rigged, fraud, or stolen on Musk's social media platform X the morning after the election, data showed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Danielle Lee Tomson, research manager at the University of Washington Center for an Informed Public, said an isolated number of people on the left have cast doubt on the integrity of the vote.</p>

<p>"No major candidate or political organizer has amplified it," she told AFP. "It is diffuse and significantly smaller because there is no leadership spreading it, whereas on the right that was the case in 2020 and 2022."</p>

<p>She noted that on the right there was evidence from even the early voting period this year that Republicans and MAGA-affiliated influencers -- shorthand for Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan -- were discussing potential election fraud.</p>

<p>"Think of it like Trump is the conductor, (and) there's a symphony of media and legal infrastructure to really make sure that he won," Tomson said. "That's what they built."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two branches of Qatar's royal family began their fight over a diamond worth millions of dollars at London's High Court on Monday, with a company run by a cousin of Qatar's Emir trying to enforce his alleged right to buy the 70-carat gemstone.</p>

<p>The dispute over the "Idol's Eye" diamond pits art collector Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, cousin of Qatar's ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, against the relatives of former culture minister Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al Thani.</p>

<p>Sheikh Saud, who was Qatar's minister of culture between 1997 and 2005, was one of the world's most prolific art collectors and bought the Idol's Eye diamond in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>He lent the diamond to QIPCO, whose chief executive is Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah, shortly before he died in 2014.</p>

<p>The agreement gave QIPCO the option to buy the diamond with the consent of Elanus Holdings, a company ultimately linked to Sheikh Saud's relatives.</p>

<p>Elanus is ultimately owned by the Liechtenstein-based Al Thani Foundation, whose beneficiaries are Sheikh Saud's widow and three children.</p>

<p>The two sides disagree over how much the gem is worth.</p>

<p>QIPCO's lawyers say that a 2020 letter sent by the Al Thani Foundation's lawyer amounted to an agreement to sell the Idol's Eye diamond for $10 million and is asking the High Court to order Elanus to sell the gem to QIPCO.</p>

<p>Elanus, however, argues the letter was sent by mistake.</p>

<p>Elanus' lawyer Sa'ad Hossain said in court filings that Sheikh Saud's son Sheikh Hamad bin Saud Al Thani had "only sought to explore the possibility of a sale at the right price", but had not consulted with the foundation's other beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Hossain added that Elanus' diamond expert valued the gemstone at around $27 million, which QIPCO's lawyers said was an attempt to achieve a higher purchase price.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2024 is on course to become the hottest year ever recorded, with global temperatures reaching unprecedented levels, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) warned.</p>

<p>According to a report released on the opening day of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) here, the January-September global mean surface temperature was 1.54 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>This alarming surge, driven by an intense El Nino event and rising greenhouse gas concentrations, marks a critical threshold for climate change impacts worldwide.</p>

<p>The report titled "State of the Climate 2024" highlights the accelerating risks posed by global warming, particularly for vulnerable communities. "Climate catastrophe is hammering health, widening inequalities, harming sustainable development, and rocking the foundations of peace," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p>

<p>Guterres emphasised the urgent need for climate action to protect those most affected by these changes.</p>

<p>A major finding of the report is the unprecedented temperature increase. The average global temperature for the first nine months of 2024 exceeded the pre-industrial level by 1.54 degrees Celsius, temporarily surpassing the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal set in the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>Though long-term warming remains around 1.3 degrees Celsius, experts caution that every fraction of a degree compounds the intensity of extreme weather events and exacerbates climate risks.</p>

<p>Another key observation is the surge in ocean heat content, which reached a historic high in 2023 and shows no signs of abating in 2024.</p>

<p>Oceans have absorbed over 90 per cent of the extra energy from global warming, a trend that will have long-term implications for marine life and coastal communities.</p>

<p>Rising ocean temperatures also fuel extreme weather patterns, further intensifying climate challenges.</p>

<p>Sea levels, driven by thermal expansion and glacier melt, continue to rise at a rate more than double that observed between 1993 and 2002.</p>

<p>Although the rate of increase slightly slowed in 2024, the WMO warns that sea level rise remains a grave concern for coastal regions worldwide. This trend underscores the need for coastal communities to strengthen resilience against rising waters.</p>

<p>The WMO report also draws attention to unprecedented glacier loss, with a record 1.2 metres of water equivalent lost in 2023.</p>

<p>Glaciers in Switzerland, for example, lost approximately 10 per cent of their remaining volume over just two years. Such rapid glacier retreat impacts mountainous and polar regions, highlighting the urgency for climate adaptation measures in these vulnerable areas.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events have also intensified globally, with WMO attributing deadly heatwaves, severe floods, tropical cyclones, and persistent droughts to climate change. These events have led to economic losses, food insecurity, and forced migration, hindering sustainable development and causing significant human suffering.</p>

<p>Additionally, greenhouse gas concentrations reached record levels in 2023, with CO2 rising to 420 parts per million, marking a 51 per cent increase from pre-industrial levels. This trend has persisted into 2024, pushing atmospheric heat retention higher and driving further warming. Such findings underline the pressing need to curb emissions on a global scale.</p>

<p>The polar ice regions continue to experience dramatic changes. Antarctic sea ice extent in 2024 was the second lowest since satellite records began, with the Arctic also seeing near-record lows. The loss of polar ice contributes to global warming feedback loops, with cascading effects on ecosystems and weather patterns.</p>

<p>WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo emphasised the need for climate adaptation, particularly through initiatives like Early Warnings for All (EW4All), which aim to protect communities from extreme weather events.</p>

<p>As part of this initiative, 108 countries now report having a Multi-Hazard Early Warning System, a significant step towards enhancing resilience in vulnerable areas.</p>

<p>The WMO's findings underscore the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing effective climate policies. In response, a team of international experts has been convened to track and communicate climate goals relative to the Paris Agreement and guide policymakers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

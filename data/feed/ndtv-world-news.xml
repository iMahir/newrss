       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British singer Elton John told a theatre audience on Sunday that he had lost his sight, months after suffering a severe eye infection. One of the biggest-selling artists of all time, Mr John attended the launch of the "The Devil Wears Prada" musical in London's West End but said he had been unable to watch the performance.</p>

<p>"I haven't been able to come to many of the previews because, as you know, I have lost my eyesight," the 77-year-old singer told the audience at a charity gala performance of the musical based on the best-selling novel for which he has written the score.</p>

<p>"So it's hard for me to see it, but I love to hear it and, boy, it sounded good tonight," he said.</p>

<p>The "Tiny Dancer" and "Rocket Man" star thanked his husband, David Furnish, saying he "has been my rock."</p>

<p>The "Rocket Man" star posted on Instagram in September that an infection had "left me with only limited vision in one eye".</p>

<p>Last month, he told ABC News in the US that the infection had left him unable to see out of his right eye and that his left was "not the greatest," meaning he could no longer read or watch anything and putting his ability to record any new music in the future at risk.</p>

<p>"I am healing, but it's an extremely slow process and it will take some time before sight returns to the impacted eye," he added.</p>

<p>The music legend, whose piano-led rock songs and ballads such as "Candle in the Wind" have kept him in the spotlight since the 1970s, wound down a glittering live career with a global farewell tour in 2022 and 2023. He played his final show in his native UK at the Glastonbury Festival and his last-ever gig in Sweden and has since focused on his family.</p>

<p>In 1994, Mr John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for contributions to music and charity In 1998 gaining the title 'Sir'.</p>

<p>While he is officially retired from touring, he wrote the music for the musical "The Devil Wears Prada", which is based on the 2003 novel by Lauren Weisberger, which was also turned into a movie in 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thanksgiving, a family in southern Connecticut lost their waterfront mansion, valued at over $4 million, after a turkey fryer reportedly caused a fire in the garage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Weston Volunteer Fire Department reported that the fire occurred at a home near a large pond in Weston, about 65 miles southwest of Hartford, the state capital.</p>

<p>Weston Fire Chief John Pokorny told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/02/connecticut-mansion-fire-turkey-garage/76703986007/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>USA Today</em></a> that approximately 40 people were inside the house when the blaze began. Thankfully, no injuries were reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a news release from the fire department, crews were dispatched to Weston Road at 3:42 p.m. Thursday following a fire alarm activation. Upon arrival, firefighters found a fully involved garage fire that was quickly spreading to the rest of the home. Public Relations Officer Ryan Blake confirmed that everyone inside the house evacuated safely after the fire broke out.</p>

<p>"Firefighters attempted an aggressive fire attack however their efforts were thwarted by dangerous fire conditions and structural collapse," the agency wrote in the release. "In addition, a vehicle drove over the water supply hose on Weston Road, damaging the line, which completely stopped the flow of water for several minutes."</p>

<p>The agency reported that crews battled the fire for more than 16 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Weston Fire Marshal, however, based on the preliminary investigation it appears the fire began in the garage and was the result of frying a turkey," the agency wrote.</p>

<p>The mansion that caught fire was deemed uninhabitable and a total loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Zillow, the 11-bedroom, 9.5-bath, 9,378 square-foot home sold for $4,01,800.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I would like to thank all the Weston volunteer firefighters, Weston volunteer EMS, WPD, as well as the mutual aid fire departments from Westport, Easton, Wilton, Ridgefield, Georgetown, Redding, and West Redding, who battled the house fire during Thanksgiving," said Weston First Selectwoman Samantha Nestor. "Special thanks to the Weston Public Work, American Red Cross, Salvation Army of Danbury, Aquarion, Eversource and Soco Gas for their assistance. Thank you for your Service and I am grateful everyone is safe."</p>

<p>The official cause of the fire was still under investigation as of Monday, but a preliminary inquiry identified a turkey fryer inside the garage as the likely source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A post on Georgetown's Facebook page described the incident as "a stark reminder of the dangers of frying turkeys indoors."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Less than four years after taking the helm of Intel, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger resigned from the company on Monday following pressure from the board.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less than four years after taking the helm of Intel, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger resigned from the company on Monday, following pressure from the board. Mr Gelsinger reportedly left after the company's directors, during a board meeting last week, felt his costly and ambitious plan to turn Intel around was not working and the progress of change was not fast enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The board told Mr Gelsinger he could retire or be removed, and he chose to step down, news agency Reuters report quoting source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, Intel's communications chief, Karen Kahn, is also planning to leave the company.</p>

<p>With Mr Gelsinger gone, Intel has handed control of the company to two lieutenants--CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus-- as the faltering American chipmaking icon searches for a permanent replacement. The moves come less than a week after U.S. officials gave Intel $7.86 billion in subsidies.</p>

<h2><strong>Pat Gelsinger's Time At Intel</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Gelsinger in 2021 inherited Intel rife with challenges that he compounded. Setting lofty ambitions for manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients, Intel ultimately lost or cancelled contracts under his watch, and was unable to deliver the promised goods, according to a Reuters special report in October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He made optimistic claims about prospective AI chip deals that exceeded Intel's own estimates, leading the company to scrap a recent revenue forecast about a month ago. Under him, Intel, which was founded in 1968 and for decades formed the bedrock of Silicon Valley's global dominance in chips, has withered to a market value more than 30 times smaller than Nvidia, the leader in artificial intelligence chips.</p>

<p>Under his watch, the company's shares fell 0.5 per cent. The stock has reportedly lost over half of its value this year, and it was replaced last month by Nvidia on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average index. Other rivels including Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.6 per cent and the PHLX Semiconductor Index rose 2.6 per cent.</p>

<p>The sixty-three-year-old's departure comes well before the completion of his four-year roadmap to restore the company's lead in making the fastest and smallest computer chips, a crown it lost to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes chips for Intel rivals such as Nvidia.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What's Next For Intel</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Gelsinger's abrupt departure has opened the doors for the troubled company to consider potential deal options, including scenarios that the former CEO rejected during his time&nbsp;running the chipmaker.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg report, the company's board has discussed a range of possibilities in recent months, such as private equity transactions and even a split of Intel's factory and product-design businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the former CEO was opposed to breaking up the company and instead focused on his plan to restore Intel's technological edge and become a made-to-order manufacturer for outside clients. With Mr Gelsinger gone, there's a chance to reset the conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report said that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been helping Intel to explore its options, and may find a more receptive audience in new management.</p>

<p>The new management also gives the opportunity for suitors to take another look at the acquisition plans of some or all of the business. Bloomberg News has reported that Qualcomm Inc. had expressed some interest in a transaction before, though nothing got very far.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple has been accused in a new lawsuit of illegally monitoring its workers' personal devices and iCloud accounts while also barring them from discussing their pay and working conditions.</p>

<p>The complaint filed in California state court on Sunday by Amar Bhakta, who works in digital advertising for Apple, claims the company requires employees to install software on personal devices that they use for work allowing Apple to access their email, photo libraries, health and "smart home" data and other personal information.</p>

<p>At the same time, the lawsuit alleges, Apple imposes confidentiality policies that prohibit employees from discussing working conditions, including with the media, and engaging in legally-protected whistleblowing.</p>

<p>Bhakta, who has worked for Apple since 2020, says he was barred from talking about his work on podcasts and instructed to remove information about his working conditions from his LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>"Apple's surveillance policies and practices chill, and thus also unlawfully restrain, employee whistleblowing, competition, freedom of employee movement in the job market, and freedom of speech," the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>Apple in a statement provided by a spokesperson said the claims in the lawsuit lack merit and that its workers are trained annually on their rights to discuss their working conditions.</p>

<p>"At Apple, we're focused on creating the best products and services in the world and we work to protect the inventions our teams create for customers," the company said.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Bhakta also represent two women who filed a lawsuit in June accusing Apple of systematically underpaying female workers in its engineering, marketing, and AppleCare divisions. Apple has said it is committed to inclusion and pay equity.</p>

<p>Apple is also facing at least three complaints from a US labor board claiming it has illegally deterred employees from discussing issues such as sex bias and pay discrimination with each other and the media, including by restricting their use of social media and workplace messaging app Slack. The company has denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The new lawsuit was filed under a unique California law that allows workers to sue their employers on behalf of the state and keep 35% of any penalties that are recovered.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular rapper Dave Blunts' recent performance has left the internet worried. The 23-year-old rapper appeared on the stage at Chicago's United Center during the fourth annual Juide Wrld Day, while hooked to an oxygen tank. Mr Blunts, who is believed to weigh over 225 kilograms, sat on a couch through his performance, paying tribute to Juice Wrld, who died of an overdose in 2019. Sharing the video, an X user wrote, "Rapper Dave Blunts performs in front of a crowd while connected to an oxygen tank at Juice WRLD Day 2024 in Chicago. The event is put on every year to honour rapper Juice WRLD who d*ed from an overdose.</p>

<p>"I do this for Juice. I do this for me. We keep going no matter what," said Mr Blunts while addressing the audience. "I got demons, and a tank to prove it. Don't come for me when you have been blessed enough to be here that long; respect the struggle," he added.</p>

<p>The video of his performance went viral on social media with many of Mr Blunts' fans applauding his routine but also expressing concern that he needed to take care of his health.</p>

<p>"This isn't even about just being overweight, he cannot hard breathe because his body is suffocating him at this point. I hope he gets some help before too late. He's got a great voice when he can use it," said one user, while another added: "This is absolutely heartbreaking.He needs to get healthy ASAP or he won't be performing at all."</p>

<p>A third commented: "He's not going to make it another five years if he doesn't change something. Hoping he can get the help he needs."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple's XRP has surged to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, surpassing notable tokens such as Solana, USDT, and Binance Coin, as the landscape for crypto-friendly policies begins to shift in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>On Monday, XRP skyrocketed by an impressive 40% within 24 hours, reaching $ 2.80- a milestone it hadn't achieved in seven years. The cryptocurrency has attracted over $120 billion in new investments, pushing its market cap to $156 billion following the Nov. 5 election of Donald Trump and other pro-crypto candidates.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/17028189168194" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Crypto News</em></a> reports that the primary driver behind XRP's rally was Trump's victory, expected to usher in more favourable regulations for the crypto sector. This is particularly significant for Ripple Labs, embroiled in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission since 2020.</p>

<p>The election results have also revived hopes for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) by 2025. Earlier this week, asset manager WisdomTree, which oversees $111 billion in assets, applied for a spot Ripple ETF.</p>

<p>In a recent X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju emphasized that whale activity on Coinbase has been a major driver of the XRP rally, with exchange premiums rising between 3% and 13%. In contrast, South Korea's Upbit exchange- known for its significant XRP trading base-has shown no such premium during this period.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House said on Monday that President Joe&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;pardoned his son Hunter in part because of concern his political opponents would continue to persecute the younger&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;in the future, as a growing chorus of Democrats and Republicans criticized his decision.</p>

<p>Mr Biden, a Democrat whose term ends on Jan. 20 when Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office, signed an unconditional pardon for Hunter&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;on Sunday and said he believed his son had been selectively prosecuted and targeted unfairly by the president's political opponents.</p>

<p>Mr Biden&nbsp;said in the past that he would not pardon his son, including to ABC News in June when he was asked if he would rule out a pardon, and replied "yes."</p>

<p>His surprise move was panned by his Republican political opposition, but also by Democrats who say it threatens to undermine public trust in the rule of law, a concept Mr Biden&nbsp;and his party had used to criticize Trump.</p>

<p>Hunter was prosecuted for tax offenses and gun charges, after being targeted for years by Republicans in Congress who accused him of making business deals using his father's name but failed to establish any clear connections.</p>

<p>White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday defended the president's action and said Mr Biden&nbsp;believed Hunter faced further grief from his adversaries without naming them, and suggested it could continue even after the president left office. Ms Jean-Pierre was among the White House officials who had repeatedly said in the past Mr Biden&nbsp;would not pardon his son.</p>

<p>"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because they didn't seem like his political opponents would let go of it. It didn't seem like they would move on," she told reporters on Air Force One during a trip to Angola. "They would continue to go after his son. That's what he believed."</p>

<p>Ms Jean-Pierre stressed this was not the first time a president had pardoned a family member. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger before he left office, and Trump his daughter's father-in-law, Charles Kushner.</p>

<p>She said Mr Biden&nbsp;believed in the Department of Justice despite his statement that his son's process in the judicial system was "infected with politics."</p>

<p>"Two things could be true: the president does believe in the justice ... system and ... Department of Justice, and he also believes that his son was singled out politically," she said.</p>

<p>She declined to give further details on why or how Mr Biden&nbsp;had changed his mind, or whether the recent election that put Republicans in charge of the White House and both branches of Congress played a role.</p>

<p>Republicans have accused Mr Biden&nbsp;of corruption, while Democratic lawmakers have been split, with some suggesting he put family over country, and others pointing to Trump's nominees for judiciary positions as a rationale.</p>

<p>Hunter&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;pleaded guilty in September to federal tax charges in federal court in Los Angeles and was due to be sentenced Dec. 16 under Mark C. Scarsi, a judge nominated by Republican President-elect Donald Trump. A jury found him guilty in June of making false statements on a gun background check; he was due to be sentenced for those charges this month as well.</p>

<p>Mr Biden&nbsp;said on Sunday that his son had been selectively prosecuted and treated differently than others with similar situations. "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong," he said.</p>

<p>Late on Sunday, Hunter&nbsp;Biden's attorney filed to dismiss the indictments against him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>'<em>Rockstar</em>'-fame actor Nargis Fakhri's sister Aliya Fakhri has been arrested in the murder probe of her ex-boyfriend and his friend in Queens, New York. Aliya, 43, allegedly set a two-story garage on fire, which led to the death of Edward Jacobs, 35, and Anastasia Ettienne, 33.</p>

<p>Aliya Fakhri arrived at the garage early morning on November 2 and yelled "you're all going to die today" at Jacobs, who lived upstairs. A witness came out hearing her voice and found that the building was on fire, said District Attorney Melinda Katz.</p>

<p>Jacobs was sleeping during the incident. Ettienne came downstairs when alerted, but returned to save Jacobs. But neither of them could make it out of the burning building safely. Jacobs and Ettienne died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries, Ms Katz's office said in a press release.</p>

<p>Aliya Fakhri has been charged with four counts of murder in the first degree and four counts of murder in the second degree. She has also been accused of arson by a grand jury. She faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted of the top charge, the attorney said.</p>

<p>The court has remanded her and her next appearance is scheduled for December 9.</p>

<p>"As alleged in this indictment, this defendant maliciously ended the lives of two people by setting a fire that trapped a man and woman in a raging inferno. The victims tragically died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries," said Ms Katz.</p>

<p>A witness to the crime scene also narrated a disturbing account of events. Recalling that he smelled a sweet burning odour, the witness said he found the couch on the stairs on fire. They had to jump over the fire to escape the inferno. The witness said Ettienne had jumped across with him but went back in to save Jacobs.</p>

<p>Calling their relationship an abusive one, the witness also said that Ms Fakhri had previously threatened to burn Jacobs' house down.</p>

<p>Jacobs had broken up with Ms Fakhri about a year ago but she wasn't accepting the rejection, her mother Janet told the New York Post. She said her son was a plumber and was working on a project to convert the garage into an apartment.</p>

<p>Nargis Fakhri, best known for her role in the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer <em>Rockstar</em>, is yet to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>Their mother, however, couldn't believe Aliya Fakhri could murder someone. She said Aliya was a person who cared for and tried to help everyone. She also revealed that Aliya had struggled with opioid addiction after a dental mishap, which she believes may have led to her behaviour, according to multiple reports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday named billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his pick for US ambassador to Britain.</p>

<p>The longtime Republican donor was once reportedly opposed to Trump and gave money to a group dedicated to stopping him from winning his party's presidential primary in 2016.</p>

<p>Stephens, whose investment bank Stephens Inc is based in the southern state of Arkansas, has since funneled money into a political action committee that backed Trump's 2024 election campaign.</p>

<p>"Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time. I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America's most cherished and beloved Allies," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>The incoming president has made a raft of nominations for his administration in recent weeks ahead of his inauguration on January 20.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He recently named Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, as the US ambassador to France.</p>

<p>During his first term in the White House, Trump appointed another billionaire and campaign supporter, businessman Woody Johnson, as US ambassador to Britain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump will attend the weekend reopening of the restored Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, which was ravaged by a 2019 fire, he said Monday.</p>

<p>The 850-year-old edifice will welcome visitors and worshippers again this Saturday and Sunday, with several world leaders expected among the guests, after a sometimes challenging restoration.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago," Trump wrote on his Truth Social network.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron conducted an inspection of the restoration of the medieval cathedral on Friday, saying workers had done the "impossible" by healing a "national wound."</p>

<p>He had set the ambitious goal of rebuilding Notre Dame within five years and to make it "even more beautiful" than before, a target that French authorities say has been met.</p>

<p>Trump wrote that Macron had "done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!"</p>

<p>Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were brought in for restoration work costing a total of nearly 700 million euros (more than $750 million at today's rate).</p>

<p>It was financed from the 846 million euros in donations that poured in from 150 countries in a surge of solidarity.</p>

<p>Macron said in December 2023 he had invited Pope Francis to the reopening of the cathedral but the head of the Catholic church announced in September, to the surprise of some observers, that he would not be coming.</p>

<p>Instead, the pontiff is making a landmark visit the following weekend to the French island of Corsica.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President-elect JD Vance's photo with his wife Usha Vance's Indian family has gone viral on social media. In the picture, Mr Vance can be seen wearing a blue t-shirt and jeans while holding his son on his shoulder. His wife, dressed in a yellowish-brown outfit can be seen on the left side, holding their daughter. Alongside the couple, about 21 family members can be seen enjoying themselves in what appears to be a party in the backyard of a home.</p>

<p>Asha Jadeja Motwani, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, shared the undated pic and captioned it as saying: "JD Vance at Thanksgiving. Reminds me of the big fat Indian wedding."</p>

<p>As the post went viral, reactions poured in from all quarters with the majority appreciating the Ohio senator for his sweet and loving family.</p>

<p>"JD got a sense of real family," said one user, while another added: "Lots of respect to Vance here for spending time with his wife's fully Indian family. It can be hard for an outsider to adapt to Indian culture, especially with the older generation. Seems like they had a great time."<br />
A third added: "His son is sitting on his shoulder in a pure Indian way."</p>

<p>However, some white supremacists once again launched racist attacks on the Republican leader and his wife for the picture. Nick Fuentes, a far-right commentator, infamous for his absurd takes, posted the image and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/NickJFuentes/status/1863260808169283846" rel="noindex, nofollow">wrote</a>: "If you support JD Vance you are either being paid by Peter Thiel or you're ngmi."</p>

<h3><strong>JD Vance's love for India and Indian food</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking to popular podcast host, Joe Rogan, earlier this month, Mr Vance waxed lyrical about the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine and how his wife had influenced his food choices.</p>

<p>"For any vegetarian out there, indulge in paneer, rice, and chickpeas. Skip the nasty fake meat. If you want to embrace a vegetarian lifestyle, turn to Indian cuisine. It offers wonderful vegetarian options," said Mr Vance.</p>

<p>The Republican leader also recalled an early attempt at impressing Usha with homemade vegetarian food that didn't go as planned. "I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes." The result, he said, was "disgusting".</p>

<p>Usha Vance and JD met at the Yale University in 2014 while pursuing their law degree. JD's memoir describes Usha as his "Yale spirit guide" who helped him navigate life at the elite varsity. The couple has three children together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Monday announced a new $725 million military aid package for Ukraine that features a second tranche of landmines as well as anti-air and anti-armor weapons.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden's administration is working against the clock to provide billions of dollars in aid to Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, after which future assistance for Ukraine will be in doubt.</p>

<p>Less than two months before Trump is set to be sworn in, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the package was part of efforts "to ensure Ukraine has the capabilities it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression."</p>

<p>It includes anti-personnel landmines, ammunition for HIMARS precision rocket launchers, Stinger missiles, counter-drone systems, anti-armor weapons and artillery ammunition, Blinken said in a statement.</p>

<p>The United States announced a first shipment of landmines to Ukraine last month -- a major policy shift slammed by rights groups.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said that the decision was necessitated by Russian forces leading with dismounted infantry units instead of vehicles.</p>

<p>The Ukrainians "have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians," Austin told journalists last month.</p>

<p>The outgoing US administration is working to get as much aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump -- who has repeatedly criticized US assistance for Kyiv, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours -- takes over the presidency.</p>

<p>Trump's comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about the future of US aid, and Ukraine's ability to withstand Russian attacks in the absence of further American support.</p>

<p>The United States has been a key military backer of Ukraine, committing more than $60 billion in weapons, ammunition and other security aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his country needed security guarantees from NATO and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a statement on Elon Musk's X social media platform, Tesla said it would appeal the verdict.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge on Monday upheld her decision to reject Elon Musk's massive $55.8 billion compensation package at Tesla, denying an attempt to restore the pay deal through a shareholder vote.</p>

<p>In a court filing, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery ruled that Tesla's attempt to ratify Musk's compensation package through a June shareholder vote could not override her January decision striking down the package as excessive and unfair to shareholders.</p>

<p>McCormick found multiple flaws in Tesla's ratification attempt, including "material misstatements" in documents provided to shareholders about the effect of their vote.</p>

<p>"The motion to revise is denied," McCormick wrote.</p>

<p>"The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law," she added.</p>

<p>In a statement on Musk's X social media platform, Tesla said it would appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>"Shareholders should control company votes, not judges," said Musk, in a separate post.</p>

<p>The court also awarded $345 million in attorney fees, significantly less than the $5.6 billion requested by the lawyers of plaintiff Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder.</p>

<p>While acknowledging their calculation method was technically sound under Delaware law, which bases fees on the percentage of benefit achieved, McCormick ruled that such a large award would constitute an excessive windfall.</p>

<p>Shareholders originally backed the Musk compensation plan in March 2018 that was specifically designed to reward the 53-year-old founder for Tesla's significant growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a lawsuit, Tornetta accused the defendants of failing in their duties when they authorized the pay plan and alleged that Musk dictated his terms to directors, who were not sufficiently independent from their star CEO.</p>

<p>He also accused Musk of "unjustified enrichment" and asked for the annulment of a pay program that helped make the entrepreneur the richest man in the world.</p>

<p>During a trial in 2022, Musk countered that investors in Tesla were some of the "most sophisticated in the world" and able to keep tabs on his management.</p>

<p>He said Tesla had been the laughingstock of the auto industry, and it was only the massive success of the company's Model 3 that turned things around.</p>

<p>Musk insisted that he played no role in coming up with the package nor discussed his deal with the board members, some of them close friends, who ultimately signed off on it.</p>

<p>The Delaware Court of Chancery has been a pillar of US capitalism for more than a century and is the jurisdiction where roughly two-thirds of American Fortune 500 companies are registered.</p>

<p>Musk on Monday reposted other users' X posts calling for companies to leave Delaware.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harvey Weinstein was taken to hospital on Monday for treatment after an "alarming" blood test result that required immediate medical attention, and he is expected to stay there until his condition stabilizes, his lawyer said.</p>

<p>The disgraced Hollywood movie mogul's lawyers have previously said he is beset with health problems. He was rushed to the hospital from New York City's Rikers Island jail on Sept. 8 to undergo heart surgery.</p>

<p>A jury found Weinstein, 72, sexually assaulted former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and raped aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. They are among more than 80 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the New York case, and to 16 years in prison for the separate California case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which seized Aleppo in a shock offensive over the weekend, is an Islamist movement that has long ruled swathes of the country's northwest.</p>

<p>The group has sought to moderate its image in recent years, including by cutting ties with its one-time sponsor Al-Qaeda, but it faces an uphill battle convincing Western governments it has fully renounced hardline jihadism, experts say.</p>

<p>Aleppo had been held by Syrian government forces since late 2016.</p>

<p>HTS says it no longer has any links to Al-Qaeda after severing them in 2016, five years into Syria's civil war.</p>

<p>It took on its current name the following year, arresting Al-Qaeda and Islamic State group jihadists, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank.</p>

<p>But it remains blacklisted by the United States and the European Union.</p>

<p>In large parts of the northwestern Idlib province it has controlled since 2019, it has set up a so-called "salvation government" that controls the rebel stronghold's economy and whose judges are largely loyal to HTS.</p>

<p>"Throughout parts of northwestern Syria, the rebels have started setting up and building upon already established proto-governance structures, indicating their ambition to govern and maintain control," wrote the New-York-based Soufan Center.</p>

<p>"Some of these efforts date back years, with sophisticated attempts to subsidise the cost of food and stabilize the banking and energy sectors in the areas under HTS control."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Insurgent group' -</strong></p>

<p>Jerome Drevon, a jihadism expert at ICG, said HTS "provides basic services to the population", coordinating with US aid agencies helping to funnel humanitarian aid to the millions in need in territories it holds.</p>

<p>Even if some view it as authoritarian, "it provides homogeneous governance, which contrasts with other regions in Syria", he told AFP.</p>

<p>French journalist Wassim Nasr met HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani last year.</p>

<p>"He and his group are no longer committed to whatever is meant by international jihad, that was crystal clear. They consider that it 'only brought destruction and failure to their communities'," he told a publication of the Combating Terrorism Center linked to US military academy West Point.</p>

<p>"Women go to school, women drive, you see people smoking in the street. Of course, they far from espouse democratic values or those of a liberal free society, but it's a shift."</p>

<p>Drevon said that, whatever the reasons for HTS breaking ties with Al-Qaeda years ago -- whether it was tactical to avoid unwanted US attention or not -- "now it behaves like an insurgent group" with domestic aims, without any "dimension of international terrorism".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Incredibly opportunistic' -</strong></p>

<p>Several experts, however, warned the group has not fundamentally broken with its past despite its rebranding.</p>

<p>Tammy Lynn Palacios, of the New Lines Institute, said HTS "has demonstrated that it is incredibly opportunistic in its allegiances and associations".</p>

<p>It "remains a jihadist organisation until HTS leadership successfully omits connections of its rank and file with more hardline jihadist groups and individuals", she told AFP.</p>

<p>"Al-Qaeda is not done with HTS, no matter how much HTS is done with al-Qaeda and thus nothing short of public and formal disavowal of al-Qaeda will truly lessen the threat of jihadist extremism in northwest Syria," she added.</p>

<p>The Soufan Center also points out that "while there are signs that minorities and non-Sunnis will be respected by even extreme elements of the rebels such as HTS, terrorist organizations' participation in the offensive causes some alarm".</p>

<p>Like the Taliban in power in Afghanistan since 2021 but not recognised in the West, HTS will likely struggle to leave Western "terrorist" lists.</p>

<p>Hans-Jakob Schindler, the director of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), said this was justified.</p>

<p>"If you have to ask for permission before you break ties with al-Qaeda, from the leadership of Al-Qaeda, the sincerity of the ideological reorientation is in question," he told AFP.</p>

<p>He pointed to the case of a young Austrian man who Munich police shot dead in September after he opened fire at the Israeli consulate in the German city.</p>

<p>Investigators last year found three videos he had recorded in 2021, showing scenes from a computer game "with Islamist content", according to Austrian prosecutors.</p>

<p>In one of them, the suspect had used an avatar with a flag of the "al-Nusra Front", the name of HTS before it severed ties with Al-Qaeda in 2016.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no debate about the fact that they should remain listed as a terrorist group," Schindler said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Israeli air force also "struck the Hezbollah launcher in the area of Berghoz in southern Lebanon shortly" after the militant group targeted an Israeli position. "Israel demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfill their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah's hostile activity," the army said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said there would be "hell to pay" in the Middle East if hostages held in the Gaza Strip were not released prior to his Jan. 20 inauguration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday warned Gaza militants of massive repercussions if hostages are not released by the time he takes office.</p>

<p>The threat comes after exhaustive diplomacy by outgoing President Joe Biden's administration that has so far failed to secure a deal that would both end Israel's war in Gaza and free hostages seized 14 months ago.</p>

<p>"If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>"Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!"</p>

<p>Trump has vowed staunch support for Israel and to dispense with Biden's occasional criticism, but has also spoken of his desire to secure deals on the world stage.</p>

<p>Hamas staged the deadliest ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The assault resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants seized 251 hostages during the attack, some of whom were already dead. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 35 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 44,429 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Monday issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and 93 others in a case related to last week's protests in Islamabad by his party supporters.</p>

<p>Khan, who has been incarcerated since 2023, had on November 13 issued a "final call" for nationwide protests to be held on Nov 24, demanding the restoration of the PTI's electoral mandate, the release of detained party members, and the reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.</p>

<p>The main protest in Islamabad ended in clashes in which 12 PTI supporters were killed, according to the party, while hundreds were arrested.</p>

<p>The Islamabad Police submitted a list of 96 suspects in the Islamabad-based Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC), including prominent leaders of PTI, such as Khan, Bibi, Gandapur, former president Arif Alvi, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, PTI Chairman Gohar Khan, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and several others.</p>

<p>It asked the court to issue their arrest warrants and ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra accepted the request and issued non-bailable arrest warrants for 96 suspects.</p>

<p>The first information report (FIR) registered after the protest included various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act.</p>

<p>It accused the PTI leaders of attacking police personnel under a "conspiracy" and using government employees for their purposes during the protest. It also said that the actions of protesters led to locals being trapped in their homes and spread fear and panic.</p>

<p>Khan was already sent to jail on judicial remand in seven cases related to protests between September 28 and October 5.</p>

<p>Dozens of cases have been registered against him since his government fell in April 2022 due to a no-confidence vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

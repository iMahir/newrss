       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In war-torn Sudan, women are being forced to have sex with soldiers to get food to feed their families, a report by The Guardian said. Over two dozen women who fled the Sudanese city of Omdurman said that having sex with soldiers was the only way they could access food or goods that they could sell to raise money to feed their families.</p>

<p>One woman who spoke to the Guardian said the assaults took place in factories across the the city where the food is stockpiled. “Both of my parents are too old and sick and I never let my daughter go out to look for food. I went to the soldiers and that was the only way to get food – they were everywhere in the factories area," said a woman, who was forced to have sex with soldiers at a meat-processing factory in May last year.</p>

<p>The assaults reportedly began soon after a civil war broke out in the country which has seen the country's army face off against paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Reports of rape by armed men emerged within days of the conflict starting on 15 April last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates placing the death count as high as 150,000. The war has created the world's worst displacement crisis -- with more than 11 million uprooted and brought the country to the brink of famine.</p>

<p>Several women have come forward sharing harrowing tales of RSF fighters sexually abusing them in a systematic manner in areas under their control. The soldiers have also demanded sex in exchange for access to abandoned houses where it is still possible to loot items to sell in local markets, the women told the Guardian.</p>

<p>One woman said that she was allowed to take food, kitchen equipment and perfumes from empty houses after she had sex with soldiers. “What I went through is indescribable, I would not wish it on an enemy … I only did it because I wanted to feed my children," she said.</p>

<p>Residents of the city claimed they see soldiers bringing women to abandoned houses where they were made to queue up as soldier picked the ones "they liked the look of". "A lot of women come and queue outside our neighbourhood. I sometimes hear screaming but what can you do? Nothing," one resident said.</p>

<p>Another woman told the Guardian that once she refused to have sex with the solider they tortured her and burned her legs. The 21-year-old said she had had sex with soldiers in exchange for being allowed to loot houses for food and goods, but went she refused to do so again the soldiers held her down and burned her legs.</p>

<p>A soldier, who denied ever assaulting a woman himself, said he had witnessed his colleagues. “It's awful. The amount of the sins in this city can never been be forgiven," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris wasted no time launching her 2024 presidential campaign, seeking the support of fellow Democrats with the backing of President Joe Biden after he pulled out of the race amid concerns about his age and health.</p>

<p>Her campaign officials and allies made hundreds of calls on behalf of Harris on Sunday, urging delegates to the Democratic Party convention next month to join in nominating her for president in the Nov. 5 election against Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Multiple sources said the calls, aimed at blocking would-be Democratic challengers, began almost immediately after the 81-year-old Biden abandoned the race.</p>

<p>At the same time, Democratic state party chairs backed Harris in a phone call, several participants said.</p>

<p>Harris spoke with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a potential vice presidential running mate, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Congressional Black Caucus chair Representative Steven Horsford, said a source familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Harris, a 59-year-old woman who is Black and Asian-American, would fashion an entirely new dynamic with Trump, 78, offering a vivid generational and cultural split-screen.</p>

<p>The United States has yet to elect a woman president in its 248-year history.</p>

<p>"Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been," Trump asserted on CNN shortly after Biden's announcement.</p>

<p>Biden, the oldest person ever to have occupied the Oval Office, said he would remain in the presidency until his term ends on Jan. 20, 2025, while endorsing Harris to run for president in his place.</p>

<p>The White House said Harris would deliver remarks on the South Lawn at 11:30 a.m. ET (1530 GMT) on Monday at an event celebrating the NCAA 2023-24 college championship teams.</p>

<p>Facing mounting questions about his mental acuity, Biden is the first sitting president to give up his party's nomination for reelection since President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War in March 1968.</p>

<p>Biden's withdrawal leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign. Prominent Democrats, including potential Harris challengers such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, immediately backed the vice president.</p>

<p>"My intention is to earn and win this nomination," Harris said in a statement. "I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party — and unite our nation — to defeat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Despite the early show of support for Harris, talk of an open convention when Democrats gather in Chicago Aug. 19-22 was not totally silenced.</p>

<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama did not announce endorsements, although both praised Biden.</p>

<p>Two other potential challengers - Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear - made no mention of the vice president in their statements.</p>

<p>With Democrats wading into uncharted territory, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.</p>

<p>What is certain is that Biden's withdrawal has again reshaped a White House contest shaken repeatedly during the last month.</p>

<p>On June 27, Biden's poor performance in a debate with Trump led many Democrats to urge him to drop out. Then on July 13, a gunman attempted to assassinate former President Trump.</p>

<p>And last week Trump named hardline Republican U.S. Senator J.D. Vance, 39, to serve as his vice presidential running mate.</p>

<h3><strong>ABORTION RIGHTS LEADER</strong></h3>

<p>A former attorney general of California and former U.S. senator, Harris ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2020.</p>

<p>Biden won the nomination, picked Harris to be his vice president, and went on to beat Trump.</p>

<p>Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights, an issue that resonates with younger voters and progressives.</p>

<p>She is expected to stick largely to Biden's foreign policy playbook on such issues as China, Iran and Ukraine, but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she tops the Democratic ticket and wins the November election.</p>

<p>Proponents argue she would energize those voters, consolidate Black support and bring sharp debating skills to prosecute the political case against the former president.</p>

<p>But some Democrats were concerned about a Harris candidacy, in part because of the weight of a long history of racial and gender discrimination in the United States.</p>

<p>Polling shows that Harris performs no better statistically than Biden had done against Trump.</p>

<p>In a head-to-head match-up, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted immediately after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

<p>Trump led Biden 43% to 41% in that same poll, though the 2 percentage point difference was not meaningful considering the poll's 3-point margin of error.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign had $95 million on hand at the end of June, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. Campaign finance law experts disagree on how easily that money could be shifted to a Harris-led campaign.</p>

<p>Small-dollar donors raised more than $46.7 million on ActBlue in the first five hours of Harris' presidential campaign, the fundraising platform said on X on Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>LAST-MINUTE SHIFT</strong></h3>

<p>Biden, who said he would address the nation this week, has not been seen in public since testing positive for COVID-19 last week. He was isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.</p>

<p>"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote on X.</p>

<p>Congressional Republicans argued on Sunday that Biden should resign as president immediately, which would turn the White House over to Harris and put House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, next in line in succession.</p>

<p>"If he's incapable of running for president, how is he capable of governing right now? I mean, there is five months left in this administration. It's a real concern, and it's a danger to the country," Johnson told CNN on Sunday before Biden's announcement.</p>

<p>During the 2020 campaign, Biden described himself as a bridge to the next generation. Some interpreted that to mean he would serve one term, a transitional figure who beat Trump and brought his party back to power.</p>

<p>But Biden decided to seek reelection, believing he could beat Trump again. His campaign was already struggling and ran into deep trouble after his debate performance raised serious concerns about his ability to win the election or stay on as president for another four years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A post by tech billionaire Elon Musk, showing an AI generated video of world leaders including PM Narendra Modi, US president Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin walking down a ramp in futuristic clothing, has gone viral on social media.</p>

<p>"It's time for an AI fashion show," the SpaceX CEO said in the post on X, which has amassed a whopping 35 million views.</p>

<p></p>

       <description><![CDATA[Analysts at Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's biggest believers in AI's potential, expect "growth and earnings to accelerate with the AI revolution and the wave of transformation" it is causing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the next two weeks, the quarterly results of Big Tech giants will offer a glimpse on the bankability of artificial intelligence and whether the major investments AI requires are sustainable for the long haul.</p>

<p>Analysts at Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street's biggest believers in AI's potential, expect "growth and earnings to accelerate with the AI revolution and the wave of transformation" it is causing.</p>

<p>The market generally agrees with this rosy AI narrative. Analysts forecast double-digit growth for heavyweights Microsoft and Google, in contrast to Apple, a latecomer to the AI party, with only three percent growth expected.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker, which releases its results on August 1, unveiled its new Apple Intelligence system only last month and plans to roll it out gradually over the next months, and only on the latest models.</p>

<p>CFRA analyst Angelo Zino believes that the impact of these new features will not be felt until the iPhone 16 launches in September, the first to feature the new AI powers built-in across all options.</p>

<p>But he expects Apple's upcoming earnings to show improvement in China sales, a black spot since last year.</p>

<p>"Apple's forecasts for the current quarter will be important" in assessing the company's momentum, said Zino.</p>

<p>But "if there's one that we were maybe a little bit more concerned about, versus the others, it would be Meta," he said.</p>

<p>He pointed out that Mark Zuckerberg's company raised its investment projections last April as it devoted a few billion dollars more on the chips, servers and data centers needed to develop generative AI.</p>

<p>CFRA expects Meta's growth to decelerate through the end of the year. Combined with the expected increase in spending on AI, that should put earnings under pressure.</p>

<p>As for the earnings of cloud giants Microsoft (July 30) and Amazon (August 1), "we expect them to continue to report very good results, in line with or better than market expectations," said Zino.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Crucial' bet&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft is among the best positioned to monetize generative AI, having moved the fastest to implement it across all its products, and pouring $13 billion into OpenAI, the startup stalwart behind ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Winning the big bet on AI is "crucial" for the group, said Jeremy Goldman of Emarketer, "but the market is willing to give them a level of patience."</p>

<p>The AI frenzy has helped Microsoft's cloud computing business grow in the double digits, something that analysts said could be hard to sustain.</p>

<p>"This type of growth cannot hold forever, but the synergies between cloud and AI make it more likely that Microsoft holds onto reliable cloud growth for some time to come," Goldman said.</p>

<p>As for Amazon, "investors will want to see that the reacceleration of growth over the first quarter wasn't a one-off" at AWS, the company's world-leading cloud business, said Matt Britzman of Hargreaves Lansdown.</p>

<p>Since AWS leads "in everything data-related, it should be well placed to capture a huge chunk of the demand coming from the AI wave," he added.</p>

<p>The picture "might be a little less clear" for Google parent Alphabet, which will be the first to publish results on Tuesday, "because of their search business" online, warned Zino.</p>

<p>"Skepticism around AI Overviews," introduced by Google in mid-May, "is certainly justified," said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.</p>

<p>This new feature, which offers a written text at the top of results in a Google search, ahead of the traditional links to sites, got off to a rocky start.</p>

<p>Internet users were quick to report strange, or potentially dangerous, answers proposed by the feature that had been touted by Google executives as the future direction of search.</p>

<p>According to data from BrightEdge, relayed by Search Engine Land, the number of searches presenting a result generated by AI Overviews has plummeted in recent weeks as Google shies away from the feature.</p>

<p>Still, many are concerned about the evolution of advertising across the internet if Google pushes on with the Overviews model, which reduces the necessity of clicking into links. Content creators, primarily the media, fear a collapse in revenues.</p>

<p>But for Emarketer's Mitchell-Wolf, "as long as Google maintains its status as the default search engine across most smartphones and major browsers, it will continue to be the top destination for search, and the top destination for search ad spending."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will try to show swing voters that his likely new rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has her fingerprints all over two issues he is counting on for victory in November: immigration and the cost of living.</p>

<p>Sources within the Trump campaign said it will cast Harris, the likely Democratic candidate after President Joe Biden quit the race on Sunday, as the "co-pilot" of administration polices it says are behind both sources of voter discontent.</p>

<p>Biden's sudden exit and endorsement of Harris has upended the race, just eight days after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally.</p>

<p>Sources told Reuters that Trump's campaign had for weeks been preparing for Harris should Biden drop out and she win her party's nomination.</p>

<p>"Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been," Trump told CNN shortly after Biden's announcement on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has signaled it will tie her as tightly as possible to Biden's immigration policy, which Republicans say is to blame for a sharp increase in the numbers of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally.</p>

<p>The second line of attack will revolve around the economy. Public opinion polls consistently show Americans are unhappy with high food and fuel costs as well as interest rates that have made buying a home less affordable.</p>

<p>"She's the co-pilot of the Biden vision," said one Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity during last week's Republican National Convention, where a unified party anointed Trump as its nominee in the White House race.</p>

<p>"If they want to switch to Biden 2.0 and have 'Cackling' Kamala at the top of the ticket, we're good either way," the adviser said, repeating an insult the campaign has been trying out for weeks focused on how the vice president laughs.</p>

<p>Make America Great Again Inc, a super PAC backing Trump, said on Sunday it was pulling anti-Biden television ads that had been set to run in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania and replacing them with an ad attacking Harris.</p>

<p>The 30-second ad accuses Harris of hiding Biden's infirmity from the public, and it seeks to pin the administration's record solely on her. "Kamala knew Joe couldn't do the job, so she did it. Look what she got done: a border invasion, runaway inflation, the American Dream dead," the narrator says.</p>

<p>Trump, known for using insulting and sometimes offensive language to attack his opponents, gave supporters at a rally in Michigan on Saturday a taste of the insults he is likely to fling at Harris in the coming days.</p>

<p>"I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch a laugh? She's crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She's crazy. She's nuts," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>ALTERED RACE</strong></h3>

<p>The Democratic Party has yet to determine how to move forward, and there is as yet no guarantee that Harris will emerge as the party's nominee despite Biden's endorsement.</p>

<p>Harris as the Democratic nominee would alter the race in perhaps unforeseen ways, political strategists said.</p>

<p>A 59-year-old woman who is Black and Asian-American would fashion an entirely new dynamic with Trump, 78, offering a vivid generational and cultural split-screen. The United States has yet to elect a woman president in its 248-year history.</p>

<p>Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist and longtime congressional aide, said Harris would be able to mount "a more energetic campaign with excitement from younger voters and people of color" after Biden struggled to energize these important Democratic Party voting blocs.</p>

<p>A former prosecutor and California attorney general as well as a former U.S. senator, Harris would be able to use "her years of litigation experience to effectively prosecute Trump in the court of public opinion," Mollineau said.</p>

<p>Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist, cautioned that it would be a mistake for the Trump campaign to assume Harris could serve as a simple stand-in for Biden, because of her potential appeal to different parts of the electorate.</p>

<p>Recent polls have shown Harris to be competitive with Trump. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll.</p>

<p>Before Sunday, the Trump campaign had already begun discussions about how they would redeploy campaign resources should Biden drop out of the race, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>

<p>Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican political consultant, said despite the contrasts Harris would bring to the ticket, her close ties to Biden would be a drag on her candidacy.</p>

<p>Harris "doesn't represent the change America is looking for," Hoffman said.</p>

<p>MAGA Inc CEO Taylor Budowich said his group has commissioned opposition research on several possible Democratic candidates. "MAGA Inc is prepared for all outcomes of a Democrat Party who has only brought chaos and failure," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he decided to give up running for re-election as president of the US and endorsed his deputy Kamala Harris to be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American businessman-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy had predicted some eight months ago that incumbent President Joe Biden would not be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-drops-out-of-us-presidential-election-race-says-it-is-in-best-interest-of-country-for-me-to-stand-down-6156671#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Joe Biden</a> announced on Sunday that he decided to give up running for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/live-updates-joe-biden-withdraws-from-us-presidential-race-6156785">re-election as president of the United States</a> and endorsed his deputy <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-kamala-harris-joins-presidential-race-who-will-be-her-running-mate-6158830#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Kamala Harris</a> to be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>“Best way to predict the future: just follow the incentives. It's shocking how precisely right you can be, right down to the exact timing,” Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old Republican, said in a social media post along with the video interview with Fox News last November, soon after Biden announced his decision.</p>

<p>In his interview with Fox News, Ramaswamy had said: “I think that the reality is the managerial class around Biden has lost their use for him. This has been obvious to me since last year to play out the incentives. He is not the strongest candidate they can put up. And these people, they have stopped at nothing to keep Donald J Trump out of office,” he said.</p>

<p>The Indian-American, who then was the Republican presidential candidate in the primaries along with former president Donald Trump, said that two candidates – Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama – were possibly to be picked by the Democrats.</p>

<p>“Let's give credit where credit is due. For almost a year one man has been saying “Biden won't be the Democratic nominee” and predicting a last-minute blindside. People called him crazy,” Tristane Tate, a social media influencer, said, applauding Ramaswamy for his prediction coming true. Ramaswamy had made a similar prediction during one of the Republican presidential debates.</p>

<p>He also posted a compilation of videos of his predictions and said, "The anatomy of how a “conspiracy theory” became reality, in just 18 months."&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee. The sudden change is similar to a development predicted years ago in the popular animated series <em>The Simpsons.</em></p>

<p>In the 17th episode of the 11th season, which aired in 2000, Lisa Simpson became the first female president of the US. She is seen in an outfit similar to what Kamala Harris wore at Joe Biden's inauguration, hinting at her rise to the presidency in future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The episode also points to a predecessor who left behind a budget crisis for President Lisa to manage, strongly suggesting a real estate mogul (Donald Trump) had previously held the office.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The Simpsons has a history of making eerily accurate and satirical references to global events. Some of their previous predictions include the rise of smartwatches, Donald Trump's presidency, Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox and Finnish economist Bengt R Holmstrom winning the Nobel Prize for his work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most recently, a cartoon showing the former president lying in a coffin went viral. This comes after the recent <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fact-check-did-the-simpsons-predict-trump-assassination-attempt-6115400 ">attempted assassination</a> of Trump.</p>

<p>Joe Biden <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-drops-out-of-us-presidential-election-race-says-it-is-in-best-interest-of-country-for-me-to-stand-down-6156671">dropped out of the US presidential race</a> on Sunday, saying it was in the "best interest of my party and the country" to step aside. His withdrawal was widely anticipated following his abysmal performance in the June debate against Trump. The announcement came unexpectedly while he was recovering from COVID-19 at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kamala Harris received significant backing from key Democratic figures, including Hillary Clinton and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is also a potential rival for the nomination.</p>

<p>The Democratic fundraising group ActBlue reported Harris received $27.5 million in small-donour contributions within just five hours.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia is working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compatible with current U.S. export controls, three sources familiar with the matter said.<br />
<br />
The AI chip giant in March unveiled its "Blackwell" chip series, which is due to be mass produced later in the year. Within that series, the B200 is 30 times speedier than its predecessor at some tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.</p>

<p>Nvidia will work with Inspur, one of its major distributor partners in China, on the launch and distribution of the chip which is tentatively named the "B20", two of the sources said.</p>

<p>The sources declined to be identified as Nvidia has yet to make a public announcement.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment. Inspur did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Washington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge semiconductors to China in 2023, seeking to prevent breakthroughs in supercomputing that would aid China's military.</p>

<p>Since then, Nvidia has developed three chips tailored specifically for the Chinese market.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Vietnamese property and aviation tycoon charged with $146 million in fraud and stock market manipulation went on trial in Hanoi Monday, the latest corruption case targeting the communist country's business elite.</p>

<p>Trinh Van Quyet, who owned the FLC empire of luxury resorts, golf courses, and the budget Bamboo Airways, had nearly $2 billion in stock market wealth before his arrest, according to state media estimates.</p>

<p>But on Monday the 48-year-old -- handcuffed and dressed in a white shirt -- was led into court by police officers.</p>

<p>The trial comes just days after the death of former Communist Party of Vietnam leader Nguyen Phu Trong, who is credited with spearheading a crackdown on graft at the highest levels.</p>

<p>Trong, 80, died on Friday at a military hospital in Hanoi "due to old age and serious illness", the party said, a day after announcing he was standing down to seek medical care.</p>

<p>Tycoon Quyet is accused of illegally pocketing more than $146 million between 2017 and 2022.</p>

<p>Following his arrest in March 2022, 49 other alleged accomplices were picked up -- including his two sisters and the former chairman of the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange and its chief executive officer.</p>

<p>According to the prosecution indictment, Quyet set up several stock market brokerages and registered dozens of family members to, ostensibly, trade shares.</p>

<p>But police said while orders to buy shares were placed in hundreds of trading sessions -- pushing up the value of the stock -- they were cancelled before being matched.</p>

<p>The case is part of a national corruption crackdown that has swept up numerous officials and members of Vietnam's business elite in recent years.</p>

<p>In April, a top Vietnamese property tycoon sentenced to death in a $27 billion fraud case, launched an appeal against her conviction.</p>

<p>The head of one of Vietnam's top soft drinks companies, meanwhile, was jailed for eight years in April in a $40 million fraud case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Zealand coroner has formally linked four deaths to the sale of "suicide kits" bought online from a former Canadian chef, according to findings published Monday.</p>

<p>Coroner Alexandra Cunninghame found that three students, aged 18 to 21, and one 40-year-old personal trainer killed themselves after buying kits from businesses linked to Canadian <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canadian-man-charged-with-murder-for-assisting-100-suicides-across-40-nations-4659337">Kenneth Law</a>.</p>

<p>Canadian police believe Law sent as many as 1,200 "suicide kits" to people in more than 40 countries between 2020 and his arrest last year -- specifically targeting vulnerable people online.</p>

<p>Canadian prosecutors allege the kits contained a food additive that can kill if misused.</p>

<p>Law was arrested in May 2023 and charged in Canada with 14 counts of murder and a further 14 counts of aiding and counselling suicide.</p>

<p>He has denied the charges.</p>

<p>Alerted by Interpol, several other countries have launched investigations.</p>

<p>In Britain, at least 272 people purchased products from Law's websites and 88 of them died, police there have said.</p>

<p>In Italy, nine buyers have been identified and at least one victim has died.</p>

<p>The Canadian victims were both male and female between the ages of 16 and 36, according to police.</p>

<p>New Zealand's Suicide Prevention Office has asked internet service providers to block Law's website in New Zealand, the coroner added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Barack Obama, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have yet to make their stand clear on endorsing Kamala Harris for the Presidential nomination. This even as a slew of Democrat Party leaders on Sunday displayed a show of support for Vice President Kamala Harris as their new presidential candidate, Politico reported.</p>

<p>Former President Barack Obama in a post on the platform Medium said "We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges."</p>

<p>The statement, however, stops just short of officially backing Harris for the top job. Obama's endorsement of Harris will be critical given that the Democratic National Convention is being held between August 19 to 22 on Obama's home turf of Chicago.</p>

<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reaction to the withdrawal of Joe Biden from the presidential race was one of effusive praise for Biden but had nothing to suggest that she had endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>"President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history. With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfilment," she said on X.</p>

<p>After President Joe Biden endorsed her to be the new Presidential nominee, Harris got support from several Democrats like former President Bill Clinton, and former Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In a statement, the Clintons said "We are honoured to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever to support her."</p>

<p>Congressman Ro Khanna also endorsed Kamla Harris saying "I am proud to endorse Kamala Harris as our nominee. Her trailblazing candidacy as the first African American woman and first Asian American will be a jolt of energy in our party. Our party can now run on a message of hope and a vision for the future."</p>

<p>Congressman Jim Clyburn representing South Carolina's 6th Congressional district said he echoed President Biden's endorsement of Harris.</p>

<p>"I echo the good judgement he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud today to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party's 2024 nominee for President," he said.</p>

<p>The goal now for the supporters of Harris is to get enough backers on board to help her win the nomination when the Democratic National Convention gets underway.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who has been spoken of as a potential Vice Presidential running mate to Harris called for the party to unite behind her and focus on winning the election.</p>

<p>"The best path forward for the Democratic Party is to quickly unite behind Vice President Harris and refocus on winning the presidency. the contrast in this race could not be clearer and the road to victory in November runs right through Pennsylvania this collective work began. I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States," Shapiro said in a statement on X.</p>

<p>With barely a month to go before the Democratic party convenes in Chicago the task before them is tough, Donald Trump already has a head start and only a united front can hope to wrest the initiative from him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden did the “right thing” by dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, prominent members of the Indian-American community have said, noting that this must have been a hard decision for him to make but one he took to put “America first.”</p>

<p>Biden, 81, announced on Sunday that he decided to give up running for re-election as president of the United States and endorsed his deputy Harris to be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>“While I acknowledge President Biden's decision to drop out of this race, I accept that decision as his last act to preserve American exceptionalism and as an ‘America First' decision,” New York-based eminent Indian-American attorney Ravi Batra told PTI.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Joe Biden, for doing what must have been the hardest decision for you, and yet what every soldier on the battlefield does - give our last best measure to America,” he said.</p>

<p>Al Mason, prominent New York-based global real estate advisor and entrepreneur who also advises international education institutions, said that it was expected that Biden would drop out of the 2024 presidential race.</p>

<p>“He did the right thing. He is a good man, but he could never win against Trump. In fact Biden's endorsed candidate Kamala Harris too cannot beat Trump. She has no appeal in the battleground states,” Mason said.</p>

<p>Batra said Biden has served the United States with distinction and his 50-year career, especially as Senate Foreign Relations chair and then as President Barack Obama's vice president are “remarkable”. He added that the citizens of the country are at their core not Democrats or Republicans or Independents but are Americans first.</p>

<p>Biden has done his “finest duty by dropping out, knowing that he cannot be a standard bearer for the Democratic Party and win against” Republican presidential nominee former US President Donald Trump who after being shot at during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, “in a moment of extreme personal crisis had the strength of heart and mind on the stage with a face bloodied to put up his fist and say ‘Fight'.” “After all, that's what all we Americans do. We fight for democracy. We fight for meritocracy, because if we don't fight it's all over. It's game over,” Batra said.</p>

<p>Mason said Trump is “impossible” to beat, even more so now with his 39-year-old Vice Presidential candidate Senator J D Vance, who has great appeal in states like Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after President Joe Biden announced his decision to step down from the 2024 race to the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris, in a statement on X, said was "honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination."</p>

<p>With Ms Harris' entry in the US Presidential elections, the speculation about who could be her Vice President pick has begun. Among the names doing the rounds is Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Within minutes of Harris' post, Senator Kelly put out a message on the microblogging site X sharing his support for her. "Kamala Harris is the right person to defeat Donald Trump and lead the country into the future." he said.</p>

<p>Senator Kelly was elected in December 2020 as a senator from Arizonan to fill out the remainder of John McCain's term. A navy veteran, who served as a combat pilot in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq and Kuwait, the lawmaker is also a former NASA astronaut. His first space mission was in 2001 aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour and a decade later, he commanded the Space Shuttle's final mission.</p>

<p>Senator Kelly has taken on the Republicans over issues like abortion and said Trump and his running mate JD Vance need to be kept out of office to restore abortion rights. In October last year, he travelled to Tel Aviv with a group of Senators and was reported to have pledged support for Israel in its war against Hamas.</p>

<p>Another possible running mate for Ms Harris, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has also backed her nomination. "She has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity," he said.</p>

<p>With a background in law, he took over as Attorney General in 2000. He was elected Governor in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. Governor Cooper has worked to combat the opioid crisis in North Carolina and is credited with launching the state's first Opioid Action Plan in 2017. He also helped formulate Carolina's first children's health insurance initiative.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro also endorsed Harris even as his name cropped up as a possible Vice Presidential candidate. Governor Shapiro said he will do everything he can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States. As the Governor of the state where Donald Trump was shot at a week ago, Governor Shapiro condemned the attack saying, "Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable."</p>

<p>Governor Shapiro assumed the office of the Governor of Pennsylvania last year in January. In 2016, he &nbsp;was elected as Pennsylvania's Attorney General. In 2020, when the Republicans alleged the election was rigged, he defended Pennsylvania's election result, winning in court dozens of times before and after Election Day. During his tenure as Attorney General, he exposed the Catholic Church's decades-long cover up of child sexual abuse, identifying 301 predator priests and thousands of victims - and spurring investigations across the United States.</p>

<p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear is another leader speculated to be Ms Harris' running mate. At 46, he is one of the youngest Governors in US. Before being elected Governor, he served as the Attorney General. As Governor he has acted against legislation banning abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in South Africa have arrested four individuals, including two Mexican nationals, after discovering a multimillion-dollar drug manufacturing lab on a farm in the country's north, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/20/africa/south-african-police-uncover-meth-lab-farm-intl/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>The South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks, raided the property in Groblersdal following reports of suspicious activity, according to a SAPS statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon searching four structures on the farm, police discovered large quantities of chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs, such as acetone and crystal meth, with an estimated street value of 2 billion South African rand ($109.4 million).</p>

<p>The four suspects arrested on Friday include the farm owner and two Mexican nationals. Police added that the Hawks are not ruling out the possibility of further arrests.</p>

<p>"What makes this different from other [seizures] is the involvement of Mexican citizens," Katlego Mogale, national spokesperson for the Hawks told Reuters, adding: "It means that our task has just become very difficult."</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the seized drugs were meant for the South African market or export.</p>

<p>The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that its embassy in South Africa had not received the necessary consular notification and is in contact with local authorities to gather details about the case and the alleged involvement of Mexicans.</p>

<p>The suspects are scheduled to appear in Groblersdal Magistrate's court on Monday to face charges of manufacturing, dealing, and possessing illicit drugs, according to the police.</p>

<p>In January, police reported that around 131 drug labs had been shut down across the country since 2019. During the festive season last year, more than 19,000 people were arrested for drug possession.</p>

<p>So far this year, the Hawks have discovered 10 secret drug labs and arrested 34 people as part of their ongoing war on drugs in the country, the statement said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic fundraising group ActBlue said Sunday evening that it had seen its biggest single-day haul of the 2024 election after US President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"As of 9pm ET, grassroots supporters have raised $46.7 million through ActBlue following Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign launch. This has been the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle," said a post on X by the group, which facilitates online fundraising for Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>Biden's withdrawal had been widely expected at some point. The announcement finally came with no warning as he recovered from Covid at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>In a letter posted on X, Biden said it had been the "greatest honor of my life" to be president. He said he would address the nation later this week. The White House later said he had no public events scheduled for Monday.</p>

<p>"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," he wrote.</p>

<p>Shortly after, he offered his "full support and endorsement" for Harris, with his campaign filing official notice to change its name to "Harris for President."</p>

<p>Endorsements began streaming in for Harris almost immediately from Democratic big shots as well as those seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Indian-American businessman Vinod Khosla and billionaire Elon Musk had a public war of words hours after US President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee</p>

<p>While the stunning move throws Democrats into fresh turmoil ahead of the November 5 election. But it could also reenergize the demoralized party, with Kamala Harris swiftly confirming her goal to become America's first woman president and to "defeat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Soon after the announcement, Vinod Khosla called for an "open convention" for the Democrats to decide on "a more moderate" candidate.</p>

<p>Time to have an open convention and get a more moderate candidate who can easily beat @realDonaldTrump. @GovWhitmer and @GovernorShapiro would be a great thing for America not held hostage between MAGA extremists and DEI extremism. Unique opportunity for a better moderate path. Every socially liberal, climate and fiscal voter should want it to balance our approach,"&nbsp;&nbsp;the ace venture capitalist posted on X - earlier known as Twitter.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Responding to the post, Elon Musk - the CEO of X, Tesla and SpaceX - made a strong pitch for former US president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance.</p>

<p>"Come on, Vinod. Trump/Vance LFG!!," Musk posted on X.</p>

<p>In response, Mr Khosla asked Elon Musk if he would want his children to be like the Republican presidential contender and said that he can't support someone (Donald Trump) who "lies, cheats and demeans women".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hard for me to support someone with no values, lies, cheats, rapes, demeans women, hates immigrants like me. He may cut my taxes or reduce some regulation but that is no reason to accept depravity in his personal values. Do you want President who will set back climate by a decade in his first year? Do you want his example for your kids as values?," Mr Khosla said.</p>

<p>A venture capitalist, Vinod Khosla is the co-founder of Sun Microsystems. Mr Khosla is known to be a prominent Democratic political donor, and has contributed over $1.4 million in the current campaign.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Elon Musk shot back, saying Trump doesn't hate him. "In fact, I think he likes you. Meet him and find out for yourself. I'm not suggesting that Trump is without flaws, however we need an administration that is more likely to be meritocratic and promote individual freedoms over the heavy hand of government," he argued.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO said many years ago, that was the Democratic Party, but now, "the pendulum has swung to the Republican Party".</p>

<p>Vinod Khosla replied: "But abandon climate and "drill baby drill? Be MAGA (Make America Great Again) and abandon NATO and American leadership and moral authority? I was a socially liberal registered fiscal Republican till climate made me switch to Independent."</p>

<p>Musk retorted that civilisation does need oil and gas for quite some time. "I don't think we should demonise an industry that is essential for humanity to function. However, as you know, sustainable energy production and consumption is growing very rapidly and is tracking to exceed use of hydrocarbon fuels. That will happen no matter what Trump does," he argued.</p>

<p>He further said that for NATO, the amount contributed by the United States is "absurdly higher than other allies".&nbsp;"Why are American taxpayers paying for the defense of Europe when Europe is fully capable of doing so itself?" said Musk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years Kamala Harris faced criticism that she was not up to the job of being a heartbeat away from the US presidency. Now, she finds herself feted by Democrats as their best hope to stop Donald Trump's comeback.</p>

<p>Despite blazing a trail as the first woman, Black and South Asian vice president in the nation's history, the 59-year-old Democrat long struggled with approval ratings as bad or worse than President Joe Biden's.</p>

<p>The last 12 months, however, have revealed a transformed Harris.</p>

<p>And with Biden's endorsement in hand, after he stunned the world by dropping his own reelection bid Sunday, she's suddenly on the cusp of history.</p>

<p>In a statement full of plaudits for Biden's achievements in office -- it was "unmatched in modern American history," she said -- Harris vowed to "earn and win" the nomination.</p>

<p>"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump," she said.</p>

<p>Harris will hope she has done the hard work to earn her full party's backing in the midst of the political crisis.</p>

<p>As the aging Biden seemed to visibly fade over the last year, his "veep" emerged as a force on the campaign trail, pushing for abortion rights and reaching out to core voters, including suburban women and Black men.</p>

<p>With a fondness for the f-bomb and her family nickname of "Momala" going viral, she has also finally started to cut through the noise to voters who previously paid scant attention.</p>

<p>Harris has won praise in party circles by staying loyal to the 81-year-old president even as political vultures began circling his candidacy.</p>

<p>She now appears likely to face Trump -- a brutal battle against a candidate who defeated Hillary Clinton in her bid to become the first female president in 2016.</p>

<h2>'Ready to serve'</h2>

<p>A child of immigrant parents -- her father was from Jamaica and her mother from India -- Harris grew up in Oakland, California, in an activist household that saw her attend her first rallies in a stroller.</p>

<p>Her focus on rights and justice saw her build an impressive CV, becoming California's first Black attorney general and the first woman of South Asian heritage elected to the US Senate.</p>

<p>Harris then went up against Biden in the 2020 primaries. In one stinging attack, she criticized him for allegedly opposing the busing of students to segregated schools.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me," she said in a barbed attack on her future boss.</p>

<p>But as his running mate, she consolidated the coalition that helped defeat the incumbent Trump in 2020.</p>

<p>Her transition to the White House, however, proved difficult.</p>

<p>Critics said she was underwhelming and gaffe-prone in a job that has been known to flummox many officeholders.</p>

<p>Struggling to carve out a role, she was tasked by Biden with getting to the roots of the country's illegal migration problem, but fumbled and then got defensive in response to a question during a visit to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>Unusually high staff turnover fed rumors of discontent in the vice presidential office.</p>

<p>And Republicans -- often resorting to stereotypes her supporters branded as sexist and racist -- relentlessly targeted her as being unfit to take over, should the worst happen to America's oldest-ever president.</p>

<p>Harris told the Wall Street Journal in February: "I am ready to serve. There's no question about that."</p>

<h2>'Momala'</h2>

<p>Things began to change as the 2024 race got underway.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign repeatedly deployed Harris to battleground states to hammer home the party's message on abortion rights; she became the first vice president to visit an abortion clinic.</p>

<p>Gradually, she began to draw more engaged and fired-up crowds.</p>

<p>Some of the outreach was, however, cringe-inducing. Earlier this year, she was mocked after she told chat show host Drew Barrymore that her family sometimes called her "Momala," and Barrymore replied, "We need you to be Momala of the country."</p>

<p>But voters seemed to be switching on.</p>

<p>A clip of her quoting her mother as often saying, "You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?" became a meme, with a rising sense among supporters that now could be her time.</p>

<p>If elected, Harris would break one of the highest glass ceilings left for women in the United States -- that of occupying the country's top office.</p>

<p>Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, would also be breaking new ground, moving from being the current Second Gentleman to the country's first First Gentleman.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading Democrats were quick to hail Joe Biden's legacy on Sunday after the US president's historic decision to end his reelection bid, while Republicans instead demanded his resignation.</p>

<p>From former presidents to current lawmakers, Biden's party faithful rallied around him as he passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, endorsing her to take on Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris herself praised Biden's "selfless and patriotic act," saying in a statement that his accomplishments are "unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office."</p>

<p>In a joint statement, former president Bill Clinton and ex-secretary of State Hillary Clinton said they "join millions of Americans in thanking President Biden for all that he accomplished."</p>

<p>With less than a month until the party's scheduled nominating convention, they too threw their weight behind Harris.</p>

<p>"Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her. America's future depends on it," the Clintons said.</p>

<p>Barack Obama, who picked then-senator Biden as his running mate in 2008, called him a "patriot of the highest order," but warned of "uncharted waters in the days ahead" -- and stopped short of endorsing Harris.</p>

<p>Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who still wields immense influence among Democratic lawmakers and had reportedly been pushing for Biden's exit, called him "a patriotic American who has always put our country first."</p>

<p>"His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history," the California representative said in a statement, expressing her "love and gratitude."</p>

<p>The two top Democratic leaders in Congress also praised Biden's legislative accomplishments without endorsing a replacement.</p>

<p>"President Joe Biden is one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement.</p>

<p>"His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.</p>

<h3><strong>Republican fury&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Republican leaders, including Trump, slammed Biden's presidency and called for the 81-year-old to resign.</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve -- And never was! ... We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Trump, 78, posted on his Truth Social network.</p>

<p>Senator JD Vance, Trump's pick for running mate, said Biden "has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way."</p>

<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson meanwhile said that "if Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president."</p>

<p>"He must resign the office immediately," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>Many Republicans in recent days openly called for Biden, who was trailing Trump in polling, to stay in the race -- arguing replacing him would be "undemocratic."</p>

<p>Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, claimed "the Democratic Party has been busy in recent weeks trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country."</p>

<p>"We cannot afford four more years of failure," he added in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>Family&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's family offered loving support to their patriarch figure, as his five-decade political career now heads to a close.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden reposted her husband's statement on X announcing his exit with a simple two-heart emoji.</p>

<p>Granddaughter Naomi Biden said on X she is "nothing but proud today of my Pop, our President, Joe Biden, who has served our country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction."</p>

<p>Hunter Biden, the president's son, said his father's "unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent."</p>

<p>His statement, shared by his daughter Naomi, concluded: "Thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines and China have agreed on an "arrangement" for resupplying Filipino troops stationed on a South China Sea reef, Manila said Sunday, after a series of escalating confrontations in the disputed waters.</p>

<p>A remote outpost on Second Thomas Shoal has been a focus of clashes between Chinese and Philippine ships in recent months as Beijing steps up efforts to push its claims to almost the entire South China Sea.</p>

<p>A Filipino sailor lost a thumb in the latest June 17 confrontation when Chinese coast guard members wielding knives, sticks and an axe foiled a Philippine Navy attempt to resupply its troops.</p>

<p>Sunday's announcement follows talks between the Philippines and China this month when they agreed to increase the number of communication channels to resolve maritime disagreements between them.</p>

<p>"The Philippines and the People's Republic of China have reached an understanding on the provisional arrangement for the resupply of daily necessities and rotation missions to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal," the Philippine foreign ministry, using the Filipino name for Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry did not provide details of the arrangement, but said both sides recognised the need to "de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea and manage differences through dialogue and consultation".</p>

<p>China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>A handful of Filipino troops are stationed on the rusty BRP Sierra Madre warship that was deliberately grounded on Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to assert Manila's claims to the area.</p>

<p>They require frequent resupplies for food, water and other necessities as well as transport for personnel rotations.</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, Manila said the resupply missions would remain a Philippine operation, after Washington vowed to "do what is necessary" to support them.</p>

<p>"As far as the RORE (rotation and resupply mission) is concerned, we're keeping it as a purely Philippine operation utilising Philippine ships, personnel and leadership," National Security Council assistant director-general Jonathan Malaya told AFP.</p>

<p>"That may change depending on the guidance from top management but that's the direction or policy at present."</p>

<p>Malaya's remarks came after White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States "will do what is necessary" to ensure the Philippines can continue to resupply its troops on the contested atoll.</p>

<p>"We will continue to support the Philippines and stand behind them as they take steps to be able to ensure that," Sullivan said during the Aspen Security Forum conference in Colorado.</p>

<p>Malaya said the National Security Council appreciated the US offer and the Philippines would continue consultations as treaty allies.</p>

<p>Manila has a mutual defence pact with the United States which requires both parties to come to the other's defence in case of an "armed attack" against vessels, aircraft, military and coast guard anywhere in the Pacific theatre, which Washington says includes the South China Sea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

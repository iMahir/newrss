       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new report has shown that the US Secret Service is responsible for security failures in the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, which led to one death and multiple injuries.</p>

<p>An internal review by the agency revealed on Friday that agents neglected to use technology that could have identified the attacker when he flew a drone over the rally site hours before the incident, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The report highlighted failures by the Secret Service's advance team and its coordination with state and local law enforcement prior to the attack. The Secret Service, responsible for overseeing Trump's security, failed to instruct local police snipers to secure a nearby rooftop.</p>

<p>Former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned amid widespread outrage over the agency's failure to prevent the incident, was previously grilled by multiple lawmakers at a Congressional hearing on why the agency failed to secure the rooftop.</p>

<p>At a news briefing on Friday, Acting Director Ronald Rowe highlighted a "lack of clarity" from the Secret Service in their security planning for Trump's rally.</p>

<p>At the rally, just shortly before shots were fired into the crowd, some people saw the suspect climbing on top of the roof and alerted local police, but Trump's protective detail had no idea police were searching for the suspicious person.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents and local law enforcement operated on different radio frequencies and were stationed in separate locations, which hindered their ability to quickly share information.</p>

<p>"It's important that we hold ourselves accountable for the failures of July 13th, and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again," Rowe said.</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt of Trump in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service allocated additional resources not typically provided to someone in Trump's position.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a man was arrested after a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence at the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida and "engaged" with him. Trump was unharmed in what appears to be the second assassination attempt in about two months.</p>

<p>Just days after the second assassination attempt, the US House of Representatives on Friday unanimously approved a bill that aims to enhance Secret Service protection for the presidential nominees and their respective vice presidential candidates.</p>

<p>The bill would require the Secret Service to "apply the same standards for determining the number of agents required to protect presidents, vice presidents, and major presidential and vice presidential candidates".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Travis King's lawyer said he was later released because of good behavior and time served.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US soldier who crossed into North Korea last year pleaded guilty to desertion as part of a plea agreement Friday and was sentenced to 12 months of confinement, his lawyer said. Because of good behavior and time served, the soldier was released, according to the lawyer.</p>

<p>Travis King was facing 14 charges related to him fleeing across the border from South Korea into the North in July 2023 while on a sightseeing tour of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean Peninsula, and prior incidents.</p>

<p>But he pleaded guilty to just five -- desertion, assault on a noncommissioned officer, and three counts of disobeying an officer -- as part of a deal that was accepted on Friday by a military judge.</p>

<p>"The judge, under the terms of the plea deal, sentenced Travis to one year of confinement, reduction in rank to private (E-1), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge," a statement from King's attorney Franklin Rosenblatt said.</p>

<p>"With time already served and credit for good behavior, Travis is now free and will return home," the statement said.</p>

<p>"Travis King has faced significant challenges throughout his life, including a difficult upbringing, exposure to criminal environments, and struggles with mental health," Rosenblatt said. "All these factors have compounded the hardships he faced in the military."</p>

<p>In a statement, the US Army's Office of Special Trial Counsel confirmed King's guilty plea as part of a deal and said that "pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, all other charges and specifications were dismissed."</p>

<p>"The outcome of today's court martial is a fair and just result that reflects the seriousness of the offenses committed by Pvt. King," prosecutor Major Allyson Montgomery said in the statement.</p>

<p>At the time of the incident, King had been stationed in South Korea, and after a drunken bar fight and a stay in South Korean jail, he was supposed to fly back to Texas to face disciplinary hearings.</p>

<p>Instead of doing so, he walked out of the Seoul-area airport, joined a DMZ sightseeing trip and slipped over the fortified border where he was detained by the communist North's authorities.</p>

<p>Pyongyang had said that King had defected to North Korea to escape "mistreatment and racial discrimination in the US Army."</p>

<p>But after completing its investigation, North Korea "decided to expel" King in September for illegally intruding into its territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The trigger for the conflict between the two most powerful factions of the Sinaloa Cartel dates back to July when Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada was arrested in the US.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some 53 people have been killed and 51 others are missing in Mexico's western Sinaloa state since rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel began clashing on September 9, local authorities said on Friday, with gruesome violence showing no signs of abating. The trigger for the conflict between the two most powerful factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug gang, dates back to July, when legendary trafficker and leader of one of those groupings, Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, was arrested in the United States.</p>

<p>Zambada, 74, alleges that a senior member of the Los Chapitos, another faction of the cartel, kidnapped him and then flew him to the United States against his will.</p>

<p>Since fighting broke out on Sept 9, shootouts have disrupted daily life in the capital, Culiacan, where schools have had to close on some days while restaurants and shops shuttered early.</p>

<p>Sinaloa governor Ruben Rocha Moya on Friday said more than 40 people have been arrested in recent days, while more than 5,000 food packages have been handed out across Sinaloa.</p>

<p>Mexico's military, which has struggled to calm the violence, on Thursday arrested the alleged head of security for Ivan Archivaldo Guzman, the leader of Los Chapitos and son of jailed former Sinaloa kingpin, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.</p>

<p>Fernando Perez Medina, known as "El Piyi", was captured in Culiacan, according to a federal security source.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mexico's Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (Profepa) said it was providing resources to local authorities to feed a tigress tied to a tree. Senior Sinaloan narcos often keep tigers as pet animals.</p>

<p>Profepa said in a statement that vets in Sinaloa had declined to assist due to security fears, and it had provided military officials with a "cage, a dart rifle and darts". But the violence had prevented the military from rescuing it.</p>

<p>Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday said that the United States was partly responsible for the instability because they "carried out this operation", referencing the prior surrender talks between U.S. officials and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the trafficker who kidnapped Zambada.</p>

<p>U.S. officials have privately confirmed that they held talks with Guzman but U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, last month said that American officials were surprised to discover Zambada on U.S. soil.</p>

<p>Salazar added that no U.S. resources or personnel were involved in the July 25 kidnapping of Zambada.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[She speaks seven languages, has a PhD in particle physics, an apartment in Budapest plastered with her own pastel drawings of nudes, and a career that took her around Africa and Europe doing humanitarian work.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She speaks seven languages, has a PhD in particle physics, an apartment in Budapest plastered with her own pastel drawings of nudes, and a career that took her around Africa and Europe doing humanitarian work.</p>

<p>What Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono, 49, the Italian-Hungarian CEO and owner of Hungary-based BAC Consulting, says she hasn't done is make the exploding pagers that killed 12 people and wounded more than 2,000 in Lebanon this week.</p>

<p>After her company was revealed to have licensed the design for the pagers from their original Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo, Barsony-Arcidiacono told NBC News that she didn't make them.</p>

<p>"I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong," she said.</p>

<p>Since then, she has not appeared in public. Neighbours say they haven't seen her. She did not respond to messages seeking comment. Her flat in a stately old Budapest building, where a door to a vestibule had been open earlier in the week, has been shuttered.</p>

<p>Discussions with acquaintances and former work colleagues paint a picture of a woman with an impressive intellect, but a peripatetic career in a string of short-term jobs in which she never quite settled down, despite embellishing her CV along the way.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of hers, who like others who knew her socially in Budapest asked not to be identified, said she seemed like someone who "could easily be used". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Good-willed, not a business type, more like someone who often tries something new, who quickly believes things and then gets enthusiastic about that," the person said, adding that Barsony-Arcidiacono had been looking for income as she wanted to leave another job.</p>

<h3><strong>'ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES OF MY LIFE'</strong></h3>

<p>Kilian Kleinschmidt, a veteran ex-U.N. humanitarian administrator who hired Barsony-Arcidiacono in 2019 to run a six-month Dutch-funded programme to train Libyans in Tunisia in subjects such as hydroponics, IT and business development, described her as a "bullying" manager, and said he released her before her contract was over.</p>

<p>"Cristiana. That was one of the biggest mistakes of my life, I think," Kleinschmidt told Reuters. "It was simply awful on a personal level... Then at some point I said enough is enough. I should probably have done it sooner. I said that's enough and I sent her home a month early."</p>

<p>Barsony-Arcidiacono has not responded to Reuters calls and emails and there was no answer when Reuters visited her private address in downtown Budapest.</p>

<p>At her Budapest home, a steel outer gate encloses a small vestibule where life drawings of nudes sketched in red and orange pastels can be seen taped up on the wall. An inner door leading into her apartment was ajar when Reuters first visited the building on Wednesday, and closed when the reporter returned on Thursday. No one answered the bell.</p>

<p>A woman living in the building for the past two years said Barsony-Arcidiacono was already a resident when she moved in, and described her as kind, not loud, but communicative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She practiced her drawing as part of a Budapest art club, though she hadn't attended for a couple of years, said the organiser of the group, who said she seemed like more of a businesswoman than an artist but was upbeat and outgoing.</p>

<p>A schoolmate of Barsony-Arcidiacono said she grew up in a family with a working father and housewife mother in Santa Venerina, near Catania in eastern Sicily, and attended high school nearby. He described her as a quite reserved youngster.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s she earned her PhD in physics at University College London, where her dissertation on positrons - a subatomic particle with the mass of an electron and a positive charge - remains available on the UCL website. But she appears to have left without pursuing a scientific career.</p>

<p>"As far as I know she has not done scientific work since then," Akos Torok, a retired physicists who was one of her professors at UCL and published papers with her at the time, told Reuters by email.</p>

<p>A resume she used to get the job working for Kleinschmidt included references to other post-graduate degrees, in politics and development, from the London School of Economics and the School of Oriental and African Studies, which Reuters was not able to verify. She then went on to describe a string of jobs working on NGO projects in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<p>In a separate CV on the BAC Consulting website, she described herself as a "Board Member at the Earth Child Institute", an educational and environmental charity in New York. The group's founder, Donna Goodman, told Reuters Barsony-Arcidiacono had never held any role there.</p>

<p>"She was a friend of a friend of a board member, and contacted us about a job opening" in 2018, Goodman said. "But she was never invited to apply."</p>

<p>That CV also described her as a former "Project Manager" at the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2008-2009, who organised a nuclear research conference. The IAEA said its records indicated she had been an intern there for eight months.</p>

<p>On BAC Consulting's website, which was taken down by the end of this week, the company gave little idea of its actual business in Hungary. Its registered address is a serviced office in a Budapest suburb.</p>

<p>"I am a scientist using my very diverse background to work on interdisciplinary projects for strategic decision-making(water &amp; climate policy, investments)," Barsony-Arcidiacono wrote on her CV.</p>

<p>"With excellent analytical, language, and interpersonal skills, I enjoy working and leading in a multicultural environment where diversity, integrity, and humour are valued."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Israel announced Friday that it killed Ibrahim Aqil, commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, in a precision airstrike on Beirut. The attack targeted a meeting of senior commanders, killing at least 14 people, including 10 high-ranking officials.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Aqil, a senior <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-inside-lebanon-politics-hezbollah-iran-and-a-larger-battle-for-hegemony-6588884" target="_blank">Hezbollah military figure</a> wanted by the United States for his role in the 1983 bombings of the US Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, was hailed by Hezbollah as one of its key leaders. Hezbollah confirmed his death, calling him a "great jihadist leader."</li>
	<li>The United States had placed a $7 million bounty on Aqil for his involvement in the 1983 bombings that killed hundreds of Americans in Lebanon. Aqil was also implicated in the kidnapping of American and European hostages in the 1980s.</li>
	<li>The airstrike, which struck Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut, left significant damage, including a massive crater and a destroyed high-rise building. Rescue workers continued to search the rubble for survivors. &nbsp;In response to the airstrike, Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets at Israeli military positions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Aqil's death marks a serious blow to Hezbollah's leadership, especially as it comes just weeks after the death of Fuad Shukr, another senior Hezbollah commander, in a similar Israeli airstrike. Both men were top figures within Hezbollah's military operations and played key roles in planning attacks against Israel.</li>
	<li>The strike follows two days of explosions earlier in the week, which targeted Hezbollah's communication devices and killed 37 of its members.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Israeli military officials said that Aqil was killed while meeting with other commanders to plan further attacks against Israel, including a potential invasion of northern Israeli territories. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the meeting as part of Hezbollah's "Conquer the Galilee" plan, an operation aimed at infiltrating Israeli communities.</li>
	<li>The United Nations and regional actors expressed concern over the growing escalation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, called for restraint from all sides. The strike has also drawn strong condemnation from Iran, which supports Hezbollah, accusing Israel of broadening the war's geography.</li>
	<li>Iran's foreign ministry denounced the attack as a violation of international law, while Hezbollah vowed retribution. Israel, however, defended the operation as necessary for its national security. Admiral Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, stressed that Israel did not seek a broader conflict but was determined to neutralise threats to its citizens.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged fire almost daily along the Israel-Lebanon border since the Gaza war began in October. The war, sparked by Hamas' deadly attack on Israel on October 7, has drawn Hezbollah into the conflict. Hezbollah has launched rocket attacks into northern Israel, which have intensified in recent weeks.</li>
	<li>Lebanon's Health Ministry reported that the strike killed 14 people and wounded 66 others, and they expect the death count to rise. Local residents have described the bombardment as some of the heaviest in years.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With more than a month to go before the November 5 presidential election, some Americans are already lining up to cast their ballots in this tightly contested race.</p>

<p>Early in-person voting kicked off Friday in the US states of Virginia, South Dakota and Minnesota as voters pick between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"You just feel that we're part of the process," said 56-year-old Tom Kilkenny, who came to a polling station in Arlington, Virginia, where people were lining up before it even opened early in the morning.</p>

<p>His wife Michelle, 55, said she was happy to set a good example for her friends and neighbors by voting early.</p>

<p>"When you... speak with them, I can myself say 'I voted already' and then start spreading the word," said Michelle Kilkenny, whose blue T-shirt was covered in Democratic Party pins.</p>

<p>Each of the country's 50 states has its own voting procedures: early voting by mail or in person, election day voting or a combination of the three.</p>

<p>For some Americans casting their ballot as soon as it becomes possible is a family tradition.</p>

<p>Nick Vucic and his wife Becca brought their three daughters to the polling station in Arlington.</p>

<p>"We want them to be engaged as soon as possible," said Vucic, 38.</p>

<p><strong>- Clashing worldviews -</strong></p>

<p>In Arlington, just across the Potomac River from the US capital, the city center was dotted with Harris and Trump signs and posters. Activists set up information booths, while voters, mostly Democrats, chatted with one another.</p>

<p>Besides electing their next president, voters are also casting ballots in local and state-wide elections.</p>

<p>Following a rollercoaster election campaign -- which saw President Joe Biden drop out of the race to pass the torch to Harris, two apparent attempts on Trump's life, and explosive televised debates -- the stakes could not be higher.</p>

<p>"I can't believe we can pick Donald Trump, when I think about it, I become very worried," said Ann Spiker, 71. "That's why we're out and doing what we can."</p>

<p>But an hour west of Washington in the Virginia city of Fairfax, some voters have a different worldview.</p>

<p>Arthur Stewart, a 58-year-old heating and air conditioning technician, said he cast his ballot to return Trump to the White House.</p>

<p>"He already has a record with the economy when he was here before, and I believe he's going to continue that," said Stewart, who has a shaved head and a soft smile. "One of the other issues is the border, security of the border. He was very good on that."</p>

<p>Stewart also echoed Trump's unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen from the Republican billionaire.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to make sure that I voted early, in case there was some issue with fraud this time," he said.</p>

<p>But one thing does seem to unite Americans on both sides of the political divide. Whether they support Harris or Trump, once they've cast their ballots, they are given an "I voted" sticker that they proudly wear on their chests.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ryan Routh, 58, was charged with two gun-related crimes in a federal court in Florida on Monday, a day after he was spotted with a rifle hiding in shrubbery on the property line of Trump's golf course. More charges are expected.</p>

<p>Officials have not cited any possible motives.</p>

<p>Routh mocked President Joe Biden on social media and suggested in a 2023 self-published book that he voted for Trump in 2016. But he then wrote that backing Trump was a "terrible mistake" and at various points described the former president as a "fool," a "buffoon," and an "idiot."</p>

<p>Addressing Iran, Routh wrote that "you are free to assassinate Trump" for the former president's decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.</p>

<p>In his 291-page book "Ukraine's Unwinnable War," Routh argued that democracy needed defending around the world and the United States had its own "catastrophe" on Jan 6, 2021, "perpetrated by Donald Trump and his undemocratic posse."</p>

<p>Court records showed Routh has a long history of breaking traffic laws, not paying his taxes on time and writing bad checks. But it was in 2002 that he lost his right to own a gun when he pleaded guilty to a felony in North Carolina for possessing an illegal explosive device in April.</p>

<p>Months after his arrest in that case while released on a bond, Routh fled from a traffic stop by a police officer near his home in Greensboro, North Carolina, and barricaded himself inside his roofing business for several hours before police were able to arrest him for having a concealed handgun without a permit, according to court records and a 2002 news article by the Greensboro News &amp; Record.</p>

<p>A few days later, Routh pleaded guilty to possession of what court records described as a "binary explosive with a 10-inch detonation cord and a blasting cap," which is defined in North Carolina law as a weapon of mass destruction and is a felony punishable by up to 59 months in prison, according to the county district attorney's office and the Guilford County Superior Court clerk's office. He was sentenced to probation.</p>

<p>Eight years later, he again pleaded guilty to felonies after he was charged with possession of stolen goods: a blowtorch, a pull-cart and a power cord, according to the district attorney's office. As the owner of several roofing companies, he has been repeatedly sued by people accusing him of not paying his bills.</p>

<p>The FBI said on Monday that it received a tip in 2019 that Routh was a felon in possession of a firearm - prohibited by federal law - but that the person who made that tip would later not confirm the information during an interview with agents.</p>

<p>The FBI relayed the tip to local authorities in Hawaii, where Routh moved in 2018 after decades in North Carolina.</p>

<p><strong>POSTS ON UKRAINE, DEMOCRACY</strong></p>

<p>Reuters found profiles on X, Facebook and LinkedIn for a Ryan Routh, and public access to the Facebook and X profiles was removed hours after the shooting.</p>

<p>The three accounts bearing Routh's name showed he supported Ukraine in its war against Russia.</p>

<p>On April 21, Routh directed an X message to Elon Musk, writing: "I would like to buy a rocket from you. I wish to load it with a warhead for Putins Black sea mansion bunker to end him. Can you give me a price please."</p>

<p>The New York Times reported it had interviewed Routh in 2023 for an article about Americans who were volunteering to help the Ukraine war effort. Routh told the Times he traveled to Ukraine, spent several months there in 2022 and was trying to recruit Afghan soldiers who fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine.</p>

<p>One current and another former U.S. volunteer serving with the foreign legion of Ukraine's army said they recalled Routh and believed that he spent time in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk. Both of them said he exhibited odd behavior.</p>

<p>Routh was blocked from the "Volunteers for Ukraine" chat group on Signal last year and blacklisted, after appearing "delusional" with promises to bring foreign volunteer recruits to the country despite having no military background, said a former U.S. volunteer with the legion, who asked not to be named.</p>

<p>While on leave in the west from battle in Ukraine, he and fellow volunteers tried their best to avoid Routh and others who made such grand promises, the volunteer told Reuters.</p>

<p>The International Legion, where many foreign fighters in Ukraine serve, said it had no links with Routh.</p>

<p><strong>MOCKING BIDEN</strong></p>

<p>On X in 2020, Routh expressed support for Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and mocked Biden as "sleepy Joe."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Routh tagged Biden in a post on X: "@POTUS Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose."</p>

<p>North Carolina voting records showed no party affiliation for Routh, though he did vote in this year's Democratic Party primary.</p>

<p>A former neighbor of Routh in Greensboro, North Carolina, Kim Mungo, said he was known to occasionally shoot weapons outside his home on holidays, though not in a threatening manner.</p>

<p>She occasionally cooked in his home and said, "He was cool to me."</p>

<p>Mungo, 53, who said she lived next to Routh for about a decade, said he had moved away several years ago. But he reappeared in May and was cleaning out the house, apparently intending to sell it.</p>

<p>"I ain't seen him in a while," Mungo said. "I don't know what his mindset was."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Security Council has met in an emergency session on Lebanon, following an uptick in cross-border fire between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, and deadly wireless device explosions targeting members of the militant group.</p>

<p>Rosemary DiCarlo, UN under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, said on Friday that alarming developments in Lebanon and the region have come after nearly one year of hostilities on an almost daily basis across the Blue Line, a buffer zone separating Israel and Lebanon, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"These exchanges have been a repeated breach of the cessation of hostilities and in violation of (Security Council) resolution 1701," she said.</p>

<p>Abdallah Bou Habib, Lebanon's foreign minister, said "Israel, through this terrorist aggression, has violated the basic principles of international humanitarian law ... and indiscriminately targeted civilians."</p>

<p>Denouncing Israel as "a rogue state," he called on the council to condemn the recent attacks, implement resolution 1701 and stand on the right side of history.</p>

<p>"Isn't this terrorism when you target a whole population while they tend to their daily life and not fighting on the front?" he asked.</p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, Syria's permanent representative to the United Nations Koussay Aldahhak said the devastating recent attacks were deployed without any regard to international law or to humanity.</p>

<p>He said the Arab Group demands the Security Council condemn this cyberterrorism and Israel's aggressions against the Palestinian people in Gaza and attacks on other countries, including Syria.</p>

<p>In his national capacity, Aldahhak said Syria condemns the aggression and ongoing terrorism against the Lebanese people.</p>

<p>Speaking in his national capacity, Samuel Zbogar of Slovenia, which holds the Security Council presidency for September, said "We are stepping in a dangerous new territory and as new technology is being used and developed, we underline the need to respect the existing legal obligations."</p>

<p>He called on the Security Council to act before the situation in the region spirals beyond control, emphasizing that diplomacy must be the only path forward.</p>

<p>Danny Danon, Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, said his country did not seek the war, stating that on October 8, when Israeli citizens in the south were being "slaughtered" by Hamas, Hezbollah "unleased hundreds of rockets" in the north against civilians.</p>

<p>He said that since then, more than 8,000 rockets have "rained down" on Israel, killing 46 people and injuring a further 294. Danon added that Israel's objective is to "restore security to our northern borders" and "bring our people home."</p>

<p>"We are very concerned at the heightened escalation across the Blue Line, including the deadly strike we saw on Beirut today," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said at a daily briefing.</p>

<p>He urged all parties to de-escalate immediately, exercise "maximum restraint" and "immediately return to the cessation of hostilities and to fully implement Security Council resolution 1701."</p>

<p>Warning that the region is "on the brink of a catastrophe," he said all efforts should focus on finding a diplomatic solution.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah on Friday night mourned the acting commander of its Elite Radwan Force, Ibrahim Akil, who was killed earlier in the day by an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>"Today, the great jihadist leader Ibrahim Akil joined the procession of his brothers, the great martyr leaders, after a blessed life full of jihad, work, wounds, sacrifices, risks, challenges, achievements, and victories," read a statement released late Friday by Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the local MTV channel reported that the body of Akil was found along with seven other members of Hezbollah's Elite Radwan Force.</p>

<p>The channel reported earlier that the whole command committee of the Elite Radwan Force was meeting in the building that was targeted by the Israeli airstrike.</p>

<p>Civil defence teams are still searching for bodies under the rubble, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service on Friday detailed a litany of failures uncovered by its review of the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump at a rally in July.</p>

<p>Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to open fire from a nearby rooftop at the outdoor event held by Republican election candidate Trump, who narrowly escaped death and suffered a wound to his right ear.</p>

<p>The review "identified deficiencies in the advanced planning and its implementation," Acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr. said at a press briefing.</p>

<p>"While some members of the advance team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols."</p>

<p><strong>- Alerts 'not relayed' -</strong></p>

<p>Among the failures identified by Rowe were poor communication with local law enforcement, an "over-reliance" on mobile devices "resulting in information being siloed" and line of sight issues, which "were acknowledged but not properly mitigated."</p>

<p>"At approximately 18:10 local time, by a phone call, the Secret Service security room calls the countersniper response agent reporting an individual on the roof of the AGR building," Rowe recounted.</p>

<p>"That vital piece of information was not relayed over the Secret Service radio network."</p>

<p>Two attendees of the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania were injured from gunfire and a third, 50-year-old firefighter Corey Comperatore, died as a result.</p>

<p>Crooks was shot dead on the roof by Secret Service personnel.</p>

<p>Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of the dramatic incident, and several Secret Service agents have been put on leave.</p>

<p>Rowe said the Secret Service needed additional funding, personnel and equipment to complete a "paradigm shift...from a state of reaction to a state of readiness."</p>

<p>The Congressional task force investigating the attempted assassination of Trump issued a statement Friday encouraging Rowe to "follow through" on holding employees accountable and to cooperate with its independent investigation.</p>

<p>"Complacency has no place in the Secret Service," the task force said.</p>

<p>The US House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill Friday to boost Secret Service protection for presidential candidates to the same level as sitting presidents and vice presidents.</p>

<p>The bill now awaits a vote in the Senate and a signature by President Joe Biden before it becomes law.</p>

<p>Rowe said that Trump is now being given the same levels of protection as the president.</p>

<p>The increased demand for security came into sharp focus again after a second apparent assassination attempt on Trump's life at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida last weekend.</p>

<p>"What occurred on Sunday demonstrates that the threat environment in which the Secret Service operates is tremendous," Rowe said.</p>

<p>The gunman in Florida did not have a line of sight on the former president and failed to fire a shot before he was discovered and arrested, officials say.</p>

<p>Trump has sought political advantage by blaming -- without evidence -- Biden and Democratic election rival Kamala Harris for fueling motivation behind the plots, citing their "rhetoric" about him endangering democracy.</p>

<p>Both Biden and Harris have repeatedly denounced the assassination bids and any political violence, with Biden calling for Congress to provide more resources for the Secret Service.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The QUAD summit has plans to expand the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness initiative from South East Asia to the Indian Ocean Region, the White House said Friday.</p>

<p>The QUAD leadership summit begins Saturday in Wilmington, Delaware, with participation of the four member states -- India, US, Japan, and Australia.</p>

<p>The maritime initiative which seeks to keep a check on illegal activities on seas was first launched at the QUAD Leaders Summit in Tokyo two years ago.</p>

<p>A formal announcement about the expansion will be made in Wilmington on Saturday, a senior administration official told reporters on condition of anonymity Besides the expansion, the partnership will now include "new sophisticated technologies to improve the maritime domain picture", as well as new training programmes, the official said.</p>

<p>Another senior administration official said the expansion of the IPMDA to the Indian Ocean "provides opportunities, not just for Australia to coordinate with us in the Pacific, but also with India to coordinate more with a lot of our partners in the Indian Ocean region." "We are also going to be launching as part of our new quad development, increased work together on logistics cooperation. The advent of the QUAD was responding to humanitarian disasters.</p>

<p>"All of our countries have a lot of capacity when it comes to logistics, in the air, at the sea, to respond to these kinds of disasters. We are really pleased that we're going to be piloting this next year with some new work that will allow us to work more closely in this space," the official said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question, the official expressed confidence in the QUAD countries' long term future as like-minded democracies.</p>

<p>"We are, of course, four leading democracies and political change is baked into the cake," the person said.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden will host Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan for the fourth in-person Quad Leaders' Summit on Saturday, September 21.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris on Friday attacked Republican rival Donald Trump and his party as "hypocrites" over abortion, as the first voters cast their ballots for November's knife-edge US election.</p>

<p>The Democrat unleashed one of the most forceful speeches of her campaign so far as she blamed Trump for an abortion ban in the battleground state of Georgia that she said had caused the deaths of two women.</p>

<p>"And these hypocrites want to start talking about how this is in the best interest of women and children," the vice president told a rally in Atlanta, Georgia to cheers from a mainly female audience.</p>

<p>"Well, where have you been? Where have you been when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America, where have you been? How dare they."</p>

<p>Since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket two months ago, Harris has repeatedly focused on what she calls "Trump abortion bans."</p>

<p>Trump has frequently bragged on the campaign trail that his three Supreme Court picks paved the way for the 2022 overturning of the national right to abortion.</p>

<p>At least 20 states have since brought in full or partial restrictions, with Georgia banning most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.</p>

<p>Harris led the crowd in chanting the name of Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year-old mother-of-one from Georgia who developed a rare complication from abortion pills and died during emergency surgery in 2022.</p>

<p>An official state committee blamed the fatal outcome on a "preventable" lag in performing a critical procedure.</p>

<p>"We will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic," said Harris, who met Thurman's family during a campaign event hosted by chat show star Oprah Winfrey on Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Excited' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris's abortion speech came as three US states -- Virginia, Minnesota and South Dakota -- began early voting 46 days before election day in what is an agonizingly close race.</p>

<p>Former president Trump has previously cast doubt on early voting and mail voting to back his false claims that he won the 2020 election against Biden.</p>

<p>Most US states permit in-person voting or mail-in voting to allow people to deal with scheduling conflicts or an inability to cast their ballots on election day itself on November 5.</p>

<p>Dozens of people waited at a polling station in the center of Arlington, Virginia, just outside the capital Washington.</p>

<p>A number had "Harris-Walz" shirts, while there were also some "Trump-Vance" signs in front of the building.</p>

<p>"I'm excited," said Michelle Kilkenny, 55, adding that voting early, "especially on day one, helps the campaign and raises the enthusiasm level."</p>

<p>Ann Spiker, 71, told AFP she usually cast her ballot by mail "but I'm going to vote today because it's so exciting."</p>

<p>The Democratic supporter added: "I can't believe we can pick Donald Trump, when I think about it I become very worried. That's why we're out and doing what we can."</p>

<p>Trump, 78, faces criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 result, after which his supporters assaulted the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>- 'Abhorrent' -</p>

<p>Every vote will count in the race, whose result Trump has once again refused to say he will accept.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, has erased Trump's lead since sensationally replacing President Biden as Democratic candidate in July, but remains neck-and-neck with the Republican.</p>

<p>The result is expected to hinge on just seven crucial swing states, including Georgia.</p>

<p>Trump however sought to lay the blame for any potential loss at the door of Jewish American voters, sparking outrage on Friday.</p>

<p>"If I don't win this election... in my opinion the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss," Trump told an anti-Semitism event on Thursday, repeating his grievance that Jewish voters have historically leaned towards the Democrats.</p>

<p>The White House slammed his comments.</p>

<p>"It is abhorrent to traffic in dangerous tropes or engage in scapegoating at any time -- let alone now, when all leaders have an obligation to fight back against the tragic worldwide rise in anti-Semitism," White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations on Friday denounced the detonation of hand-held communication devices used by Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon this week, saying the attack violated international law and could constitute a war crime.</p>

<p>"International humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby-trap devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects," the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, told the Security Council, adding that it "is a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror among civilians."</p>

<p>The blasts that killed at least 37 people and wounded nearly 3,000 over two days targeted communication devices used by the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.</p>

<p>Pagers and walkie-talkies exploded as their users were shopping in supermarkets, walking on streets and attending funerals, plunging the country into panic.</p>

<p>Hezbollah blamed Israel for the blasts.</p>

<p>"I am appalled by the breadth and impact of the attacks," said Turk.</p>

<p>"These attacks represent a new development in warfare, where communication tools become weapons," he added.</p>

<p>"This cannot be the new normal."</p>

<p>Israel has not commented on the operation but has said it will widen the scope of its war in Gaza to include the Lebanon front.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters on Friday, Israel's ambassador to the UN refused to comment on the device blasts.</p>

<p>"But I can tell you that we will do everything we can to target those terrorists," Danny Danon said.</p>

<p>He spoke after Israel announced it had killed the commander of Hezbollah's elite unit in a strike on Beirut on Friday.</p>

<p>"We have no intention to enter a war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, but we cannot continue the way it is," Danon said, noting that Israel prefers a diplomatic solution and wants to "prevent" further escalation.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah is an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has been fighting a war in Gaza since its October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>For nearly a year, the focus of Israel's firepower has been on Gaza but its troops have also been engaged in near-daily clashes with Hezbollah militants along its northern border.</p>

<p>Hundreds have been killed in Lebanon, most of them fighters, and dozens in Israel, including soldiers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A day before Sri Lanka votes for the next President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who currently occupies the post spoke to NDTV. During the interview, he spoke about his country's special bond with India and how he aims to strengthen ties, if re-elected.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>"India and Sri Lanka have to have a close economic relationship. The vision statement that Prime Minister Modi and I had issued mentions this," Mr Wickremesinghe, who is seeking another term as President, told NDTV.</li>
	<li>Speaking further about areas of shared investment and development, Mr Wickremesinghe said, "India has a huge demand of renewable energy, as do we. That is an area we seek to strengthen ties. When the Singapore-India pipeline (via Andaman and Nicobar Islands) is complete, we too can look for opportunity in it."</li>
	<li>Other significant area that he said Sri Lanka aims partner with India for is to enhance port infrastructure and to get more tourists from India. "We want to encourage more investments from India and more tourists from India. We are working together with India on infrastructure projects like the Trincomalee Harbour," he said.</li>
	<li>Speaking about the social and cultural ties shared by the two countries, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, "that has been happening for thousands of years". He also said that the two nations share very strong people-to-people ties and that it is the people's mutual regard and appreciation that is the bedrock of India-Sri Lanka relations. "There will always be some groups who may make anti-India remarks, what needs to be done is to minimise it. As far as the India-Sri Lanka friendship is concerned, it is decided by the people and they have already decided it. So, let's further strengthen (the bond)."</li>
	<li>India's economy has "taken off", the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ahead-of-sri-lankan-elections-president-ranil-wickremesinghe-tells-ndtv-about-chinas-growing-presence-6604052" target="_blank">Sri Lankan President told NDTV</a>, adding that Sri Lanka would also like to benefit from it, after all India is "just 20 miles away" and the two nations have shared deep cultural and historical ties. Mr Wickremesinghe further said that "Sri Lanka will deal with China as well to fulfill its national objectives, but at the same time, we will always keep India's interests in mind."</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ibrahim Aqil, the Hezbollah operations commander killed in an Israeli strike on Friday, had a $7 million bounty on his head for two 1983 Beirut truck bombings that killed more than 300 people at the American embassy and a U.S. Marines barracks.</p>

<p>Two security sources in Lebanon confirmed the veteran fighter was killed in an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs during a meeting of the elite Radwan unit of the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group.</p>

<p>Aqil, who has also used the aliases Tahsin and Abdelqader, was the second member of Hezbollah's top military body, the Jihad Council, to be killed in two months after an Israeli strike in the same area targeted Fuad Shukr in July.</p>

<p>Israel escalated its attacks on the group this week after months of border fighting triggered by the conflict in Gaza that began on Oct. 7 with a deadly raid and hostage-taking in Israel by Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p>Like Shukr, Aqil is a veteran of Hezbollah, which was founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in the early 1980s to battle Israeli forces that had invaded and occupied Lebanon.</p>

<p>Born in a village in Lebanon's Beqaa valley sometime around 1960, Aqil had joined the other big Lebanese Shi'ite political movement, Amal, before switching to Hezbollah as a founding member, according to a security source.</p>

<p>The United States accuses him of a role in the Beirut truck bombings at the American embassy in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and a U.S. Marine barracks six months later that killed 241 people.</p>

<p>It further accused him of directing the abduction of American and German hostages in Lebanon and listed him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2019, putting the $7 million bounty on his head.</p>

<p>Referring to the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks and other attacks on Western interests in Lebanon in the 1980s, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a 2022 interview with an Arabic broadcaster that they were carried out by small groups not linked to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Aqil's cohort of founding Hezbollah operatives helped turn the group from a shadowy militia into Lebanon's most powerful military and political organisation, pushing Israel from its occupation of the south in 2000 and fighting it again in 2006.</p>

<p>When Shukr was killed in July, it was seen as the heaviest blow to its command structure since the 2008 assassination of Imad Mughniyeh, remembered by Hezbollah as a legendary commander but by Israel and the United States as a terrorist.</p>

<p>Aqil, whose bounty was set by the United States at an even higher value than that of Shukr's, may prove a similar blow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lethal hack of Hezbollah's Asian-branded pagers and walkie-talkies has sparked an intense search for the devices' path, revealing a murky market for older technologies where buyers may have few assurances about what they are getting.</p>

<p>While supply chains and distribution channels for higher-margin and newer products are tightly managed, that's not the case for older electronics from Asia where counterfeiting, surplus inventories and complex contract manufacturing deals can sometimes make it impossible to identify the source of a product, analysts and consultants say.</p>

<p>The response from the companies at the centre of the booby-trapped gadgets that killed 37 people and wounded about 3,000 in Lebanon this week has underlined difficulties in discerning how and when they were weaponised.</p>

<p>Taiwan-based Gold Apollo put the blame on a Europe-based licensee of its pager, sparking investigations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Norway and Romania into the origins of the deadly device. Japan's Icom said it could not tell if the walkie-talkies bearing its name were real, in a market awash with fake products.</p>

<p>"If the supply chain was compromised to put explosives inside ... it's incredible engineering to do that. But the actual supply chain compromise is not that hard. Probably the easiest part was the supply chain compromise," said David Fincher, a China-based technologist and consultant.</p>

<p>He said counterfeit products are prevalent, especially in big manufacturing centres like China where fake components can be easily produced, adding that it isn't a big leap to go from fake components to supply chain compromise.</p>

<p>"As the technologist I am, I can tell you getting a little explosive in a radio is not that hard."</p>

<p>Hezbollah acquired the devices around five months ago, according to a security source, who added that the armed group thought it was buying the pagers from Gold Apollo.</p>

<p>The hand-held radios, which the source said were purchased around the same time as the pagers, had labels bearing the name of Osaka-based Icom and the phrase "Made in Japan", images of one exploded device showed.</p>

<p>Both companies have ruled out the possibility that any of the deadly components were made in factories in either of their home locations.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei has also said the components used in the pagers that detonated in Lebanon were not made in Taiwan.</p>

<p>A preliminary investigation by Lebanese authorities into the devices found that the explosives were implanted before they arrived in the country, according to a letter to the U.N. Security Council by Lebanon's mission to the United Nations.</p>

<p><strong>FAKE GOODS</strong></p>

<p>But, for now, that's about all anyone is certain of. It's not clear how or when the pagers and walkie-talkies were weaponised so they could be remotely detonated.</p>

<p>Joe Simone, partner with Chinese intellectual property firm East IP, said part of the problem is that smaller brands tend to invest less in policing counterfeits, due in large part to costs that could impact their profitability.</p>

<p>"Authorities are happy to deal with low-tech counterfeits but the IP owners need to monitor, investigate and file complaints and that doesn't always happen as much as it might for high-tech and bigger technology brands," he said.</p>

<p>For Icom, one problem is that it stopped making the IC-V82 model in question a decade ago, around the time it started introducing holographic stickers as a protection against counterfeit products, the company said.</p>

<p>The company has long warned about imitation products, especially of its older models.</p>

<p>In fact, more than 7% of firms in Japan reported business losses from counterfeit products in 2020, according to the latest available report by the Japan Patent Office, with around a third of cases linked to China.</p>

<p>Icom has urged that customers only use its official distributor network to ensure they are buying genuine products.</p>

<p>But in China, there are dozens of shops selling Icom-branded walkie-talkies on e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba.com, Taobao, JD.com and Pinduoduo, including in some cases the IC-V82 model, according to Reuters checks.</p>

<p>Among three China-based vendors of Icom products on Alibaba.com, none of which were listed as official suppliers on Icom's website, Guangzhou Minxing Communications Equipment Co and Chengdu Bingxin Technology Co Ltd both said they sell authentic products, while Quanzhou Yitian Trading Co acknowledged selling "Chinese made imitations" in addition to original products.</p>

<p>Icom has said it makes all its products in its factories in Japan. It did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Icom-branded products sold in Chinese online sites.</p>

<p>The discontinued IC-V82 model is also sold in Vietnam on e-commerce platform Shopee, a Reuters check showed, indicating wide availability of such products.</p>

<p>For Gold Apollo, which licensed its brand to Budapest-based BAC, the supply chain devolved into a mysterious production trail that authorities in various countries are now trying to piece together.</p>

<p>"The widespread availability of cheap, second-hand manufacturing equipment meant counterfeiters were increasingly able to go beyond single components and even make full-fledged products," said Diganta Das from the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Lifecycle Engineering, who studies counterfeit electronics.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call it counterfeiting anymore, it's like illegal manufacturing," Das said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russell Bentley, a US national who went missing in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine early this year, is believed to have been tortured to death by Russian soldiers who are now set to go on trial, Russia's top investigative body said on Friday.</p>

<p>Bentley died in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in April, Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia's state media outlet RT, wrote at the time, saying he had been "fighting there for our guys" and working with Russia's Sputnik news service.</p>

<p>Bentley, born in 1960, was a self-declared supporter of Russian-backed forces in Ukraine. The Russian state news agency RIA reported that he had joined pro-Russian fighters in eastern Ukraine in 2014, later working with Sputnik and obtaining Russian citizenship.</p>

<p>The Investigative Committee said in a statement that it had completed its probe and accused three Russian servicemen of torturing Bentley to death in Donetsk on April 8.</p>

<p>It said two of the soldiers had then put his body in a car and blown it up. A fourth soldier had been ordered the following day to move Bentley's remains to another location in an attempt to conceal the crime.</p>

<p>The Committee's statement said the accused soldiers, whom it named, were familiarising themselves with the allegations before the indictment was sent for approval.</p>

<p>It said they would variously be tried on charges ranging from exceeding their authority, using physical violence and torture, and causing death by negligence, to attempted concealment of a serious crime. It did not say whether or not they had denied the accusations.</p>

<p>Russian media outlets have suggested that the soldiers may have mistaken Bentley - the subject of a 2022 interview with Rolling Stone magazine titled "The Bizarre Story of How a Hardcore Texas Leftist Became a Frontline Putin propagandist" - for a US spy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US Secret Service probe found communication gaps and a lack of diligence ahead of the July attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>"There was complacency on the part of" some agents "that led to a breach of security protocols," Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters on Friday, adding that agency employees will be held accountable.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt against Trump at the July 13 rally led to widespread criticism of the Secret Service and the resignation of its former director. Critics raised concerns about how the suspect was able to access a nearby rooftop with a direct line of sight to where the former president was speaking.</p>

<p>Trump's ear was wounded, a rally attendee was killed and two others were wounded in the shooting. The Secret Service has since said it was "ashamed" of the security lapse.</p>

<p>Authorities are also probing a separate apparent assassination attempt against Trump in Florida on Sunday. In that case, the Secret Service caught the suspect and no shots were fired at Trump.</p>

<p>Rowe said that Trump was getting the same level of protection as President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, his rival in the Nov. 5 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka, which is slowly recovering from its worst-ever economic crisis, will vote to elect the next President on Saturday. While current President Ranil Wickremesinghe is seeking another term in office, he is being challenged by the key Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.</p>

<p>Mr Premadasa, 57, is the son of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa. He leads the Samagi Jana Balawegaya party or SJB, that separated from Ranil Wickremesinghe's party - United National Party or UNP in 2020.</p>

<p>Mr Premadasa's centrist, more left-leaning party has called for major changes to the $2.9 billion bailout programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and has outlined plans of his own to adjust some targets, such as changing taxes to reduce the cost of living. He plans a very different approach to that of Mr Wickremesinghe.</p>

<p>Mr Premadasa favours a mix of interventionist and free-market economic policies, and has promised subsidies and has been accused of promising freebies too at his election rallies. But he says he has a different vision for Sri Lanka and has a plan for how he will achieve them.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Mr Premadasa spoke about how his vision is different from the current regime, how he plans to revive the economy differently from how the current President is doing, how he views the India-Sri Lanka relationship and how he plans to tackle China.</p>

<h2><strong>Here are the key highlights of his interview to NDTV:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Q) What according to you makes these elections so significant and crucial?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> Sri Lanka is facing multiple crises. In the economic sphere, the social sphere, the political sphere - and we don't have a legitimate government in the sense that the present administration is an extension of the administration that was primarily responsible for making Sri Lanka bankrupt. It is the very same parliamentary majority that led to the bankruptcy. So the Sri Lankan people are eagerly waiting to express their opinions and provide their mandate for change. Change that will make the country prosperous.</p>

<p><strong>Q) It is acknowledged widely that the incumbent President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, is credited for bringing stability to the economy, but you are saying he is part of the problem and not the solution - that is a serious charge. Can you please elaborate?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> If one takes out their laurels and gets on to the streets and talks to the poor, the downtrodden, the self-employed, the labour force, the entrepreneurs, the rural and urban estate sectors; if you look at the major sections of society, other than those who are super rich, people who have been impacted detrimentally, and if I may provide you with some statistics... stats which were ascertained by the government statistical department has Illustrated that more than 260,000 micro, small and medium sized enterprises have closed. Millions have become unemployed, millions more have become poor, and the government does not have a strategy to deal with it.</p>

<p>The micro, small, and medium sized enterprises contribute to 50% of GDP, employs over 4 million, so people are suffering from the policies of a government that has basically suffocated the people. So, if you achieving stability at great human cost... at a cost where people are suffering,&nbsp; then I don't think that's the right way to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Q) So, in comparison, what is your action plan?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> Where we defer, is that we will grow ourselves out of the problem. We have to go on a massive economic growth trajectory. Huge amounts of FDI coming into Sri Lanka, restructuring of society to ensure that entrepreneurs thrive. That the hold of the bureaucracy, which has basically suffocated entrepreneurship, must be ended. Ensure that businesses flourish... ensure that the micro, small, and medium sized industry are given adequate support. What you have right now is not inclusivity, it's exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>Q) So, how do you plan to ensure all this? How do you go about solving the funding problem? And furthermore, ensure that the economy grows and not shrinks because of the fund crunch?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> You're quite correct in stating that the economy is fragile. That fragility does not give an excuse to be corrupt... to loot the public treasury. Shold we be elected, what we propose to do is to ensure that we follow good governance practices... ensure that the major indices that have a contributing factor with regard to foreign direct investment, good governance indices, ease of doing business... We should have a responsible government, a transparent government, and a&nbsp; government that is accountable - All three are lacking at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Q) One of the criticisms your party has faced largely, is that you are promising large subsidies and freebies to people at a time when the economy is facing a fund crunch. Where will the funds come from? Would that not jeopardise the economy further?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> We will eradicate the crony-capitalist structure that is existing at present. We will ensure that growth is the major phenomenon in our economic program. This government doesn't understand growth. They are contracting growth. To show everybody that the economy is stable, you're making everything smaller - That is not the way to go. We have to grow ourselves out of the problem. So, stability with malnutrition, stability with huge unemployment, stability with growth contraction, stability while losing livelihoods, stability while having lower standards of living... I'm sorry, I don't agree with that. The difference between the government and us is that we don't just focus on macroeconomics, we also look at the microeconomics. So, we are taking an overarching integrated approach, whereas this government is only keen on showing to the whole world and to a particular class in our country that everything is stable and fine.</p>

<p><strong>Q) India has strategic interests in the region. India had and still has very close ties with Sri Lanka. How do you view the India-Sri Lanka relationship from here on?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> When you talk of recovery, I must say in these very difficult and dire times, India has been one of the countries that has been very generous, and very supportive... and I would like to extend a very big thank you to the Indian government, PM Modi's government, and also to the people of India... and to the various states that have come forward to help our country. So, a big thank you. Having said that, I don't think Sri Lanka is on the correct path to recovery. So, we will ensure that we have a very balanced policy. Where India comes in, is that our External Affairs policy will be to promote our national interest. We will do what is right for our country, and it is in the interest of our country to have cordial relation with India and the rest of the powers in the world.</p>

<p>We do what recognise that we have a special relationship, a kinship, a camaraderie between our two countries and we have a history of positive progressive and good relationship. We have to build upon that and I think we will ensure that mutual interests that matter to both of us are accomplished.</p>

<p><strong>Q) China is a significant player in the region and the last couple of years has seen a rise in Chinese Investments and&nbsp; rise in Chinese naval presence in the region. How do you view the China equation for Sri Lanka?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> As I mentioned to you, in our external relations, we have a special relationship with India. But we also have to work with all of the other nation states. I'm the only politician (from Sri Lanka) who has proposed that India must be included in the United Nations Security Council. Having said that, we as a country will work with all other countries, all other democracies, all other nation states to ensure that Sri Lanka's national interests are achieved. We will in no way work towards downgrading the security and geopolitical interests of others.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What is your reasoning of wanting India as a veto power in the UN Security Council?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> Well, that is a major reflection of global geopolitical reality and I must say it's not just China... all the five permanent members of the UN Security Council have veto power. Sri Lanka as a whole has been very balanced. We want to make sure that we protect our interests and also ensure that interests of other nation states are also not compromised and neutralised. So we are very sensitive to ensure that we don't interfere in the affairs of other nations.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What would be your number one expectation or demand from India, keeping in mind your vision for Sri Lanka and the region?</strong><br />
<strong>A)</strong> First and foremost, I must say I don't demand. I always use uh the power to persuade. I will use all available skills at my disposal to persuade India to invest more in Sri Lanka, to support Sri Lanka to come out of this problem, to help the people of Sri Lanka... ensure that social and economic stability are protected. So, I would use my power to persuade your great country, India, to protect Sri Lankan people's human rights, not just political and civil rights, but their economic rights, their social rights, their right to life, right to alleviate poverty, right to alleviate unemployment... and that's the arena in which we hope to cooperate with India.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of the French town where a man for over a decade brought strangers to rape his wife apologised on Friday for remarks that were criticised for playing down the ordeal of the victim.</p>

<p>Louis Bonnet, 74, mayor of Mazan in southern France, told broadcaster BBC in an interview that "after all, no one died" about the mass rape for which dozens of men are on trial.</p>

<p>They are accused of raping Gisele Pelicot at the invitation of her then-husband Dominique Pelicot who drugged her first.</p>

<p>"It could have been far more serious," Bonnet told the BBC. "There were no kids involved. No women were killed."</p>

<p>Bonnet's remark caused a storm of indignation on social media in France and beyond.</p>

<p>"People say I minimised the serious nature of the abject crimes of which the defendants are accused," Bonnet said in a statement posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>"I understand that people are shocked by these remarks and I am truly sorry."</p>

<p>The mayor said his apologies were addressed "notably to women who were hurt by the clumsy words that were pronounced under the pressure felt in front of the microphone of a foreign media".</p>

<p>Mazan and its 6,000 residents had been under "constant media pressure" since the start of the mass rape trial this month, he said.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging Gisele Pelicot into unconsciousness and inviting strangers to rape her.</p>

<p>She has become a feminist icon since demanding a public trial.</p>

<p>The trial has horrified France, partly because 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot's co-defendants include apparently ordinary men such as a fireman, a nurse and a journalist, many of them with families.</p>

<p>Forty-nine co-defendants are accused of raping or attempting to rape Gisele Pelicot, and one is accused of imitating Dominique Pelicot to sexually assault his own wife.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

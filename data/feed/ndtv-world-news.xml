       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid escalating tensions in West Asia (Middle East), the Indian Embassy in Israel has cautioned all Indians to stay vigilant and follow safety protocols advised by local authorities. The advisory was issued within hours of Iran threatening an attack on Israel in the aftermath of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah being killed in an Israeli missile attack.</p>

<p>Iran followed up on the threat by launching over a hundred rockets at Israel, Iran's state media confirmed. Israel's defence forces said that its nationals were already in bunkers, taking shelter from the attack.</p>

<p>The nearly year-long conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza strip has intensified with Tel Aviv going after Hezbollah - an Iran-backed militant organisation which supports Hamas. Iran had vowed to avenge the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, killed last week, and had warned Israel of an imminent ballistic missile attack against it.</p>

<p>"In view of the prevailing situation in the region, all Indian nationals in Israel are advised to stay vigilant and adhere to safety protocols as advised by the local authorities," The Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv said in its advisory.</p>

<p>"Please exercise caution, avoid unnecessary travel within the country and stay close to safety shelters," it added.</p>

<p>The Embassy also shared round-the-clock helpline numbers where Indian nationals can call in case of emergency. "The Embassy is closely monitoring the situation and remains in regular touch with Israeli authorities to ensure the safety of all our nationals," it said, adding, "In case of any emergency, please contact the 24x7 helpline of the Embassy - +972-547520711 and +972-543278392."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran launched missiles at Israel as alarms sounded across the country and Israelis rushed for shelter. The Iran Guards, meanwhile, threatened 'crushing attacks' if Israel responded to missiles. It said the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rockets-fired-from-iran-on-israel-civilians-hiding-in-bomb-shelters-says-israel-defence-forces-6694961">attack on Israel </a>was a response to the killings of Guards commander and other leaders</p>

<p>Earlier, the military had announced that any ballistic missile strike from Iran was expected to be widespread and told the public to shelter in safe rooms in the event of an attack.</p>

<p>The firing of missiles came after Israeli troops launched ground raids into Lebanon, in the biggest escalation of regional warfare since fighting erupted in Gaza a year ago.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran has fired missiles at Israel and all civilians in the country are in bomb shelters, the Israeli military said on Tuesday.&nbsp;The attack comes amid Israel's ground offensive in Lebanon to target Hezbollah and days after the militant outfit's commander Hassan Nasrallah and a top official from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed in Israel strikes in Beirut. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli foreign ministry also cited the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and said at 10.08 pm IST that the missiles were fired a "short while ago". Confirming the attack, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said it was in response to the killing of Nasrallah, Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and its own senior commander Abbas Nilforoushan. Reuters quoted Israeli media as saying that as many as 100 missiles had been launched.</p>

<p>Videos showed debris from missiles intercepted by Israel's famed Iron Dome and Arrow defence systems raining down on Tel Aviv. The Israeli defence forces also confirmed that blasts had been heard in "Jerusalem and elsewhere". There have been no reports of any casualties so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Iran's attack is continuing. You are requested to remain in a protected space until further notice. The explosions you are hearing are from interceptions or fallen projectiles," the army said in a statement to Israelis, a report by news agency AFP said.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[It's believed that the portrait is of Dora Maar, a French photographer and painter who was Picasso's mistress and muse.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A junk dealer's discovery in a Capri cellar has turned out to be an original Picasso portrait. According to a <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/01/painting-found-by-junk-dealer-in-cellar-is-original-picasso-experts-claim">Guardian</a></em> report, Luigi Lo Rosso found the painting in 1962, took it home to Pompeii, and hung it in his living room despite his wife's distaste for it. For decades, the painting remained a mystery, until Lo Rosso's son Andrea started researching art history and noticed the distinctive signature in the top left corner.&nbsp;The family then sought the advice of a team of experts, including a well-known art detective, Maurizio Seracini.&nbsp;Cinzia Altieri, a graphologist and member of the Arcadia Foundation's scientific committee, confirmed the painting's distorted style as classic Picasso. The art piece is now valued at 5 million pounds (Rs&nbsp;55,71,18,527).</p>

<p>''After all the other examinations of the painting were done, I was given the job of studying the signature. I worked on it for months, comparing it with some of his original works. There is no doubt that the signature is his. There was no evidence suggesting that it was false,'' Mr Altieri told the <em>Guardian.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's believed that the portrait is of Dora Maar, a French photographer and painter who was Picasso's mistress and muse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lo Ross died, but his son Andrea, who is 60 now, pursued his quest to discover the artist behind the painting.</p>

<p>''My father was from Capri and would collect junk to sell for next to nothing. He found the painting before I was even born and didn't have a clue who Picasso was. He wasn't a very cultured person. I kept telling my father it was similar, but he didn't understand. But as I grew up, I kept wondering,''&nbsp;Andrea Lo Rosso told The <em>Guardian.</em></p>

<p>Mr Rosso also revealed that his family considered disposing of the painting due to his mother's strong dislike. "She found it repulsive and repeatedly urged us to get rid of it," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His quest to validate his father's discovery faced a significant hurdle when the Picasso Foundation in Málaga repeatedly dismissed his claims as false. Despite this setback, experts, including graphologist Cinzia Altieri, have now confirmed the painting's authenticity.</p>

<p>Notably, Picasso frequently visited Capri, where the painting was discovered, and the estimated creation period between 1930 and 1936 aligns with his stylistic evolution. Notably, Picasso created over 14,000 works during his lifetime, leaving room for unknown pieces to emerge.</p>

<p>The painting, now stored in a Milan vault, awaits official recognition from the Picasso Foundation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Quad, a strategic security grouping which was formed to maintain peace, stability and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, is facing a major challenge from an unofficial, unnamed alliance led by China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Quad, a strategic security grouping which was formed to maintain peace, stability and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, is facing a major challenge from an unofficial, unnamed alliance led by China, especially after the chronology of events in recent months leading up to, and beyond the latest Quad Summit in the United States.</p>

<p>The Quad, short for the Quadrilateral, is a group comprising India, the United States, Japan, and Australia. The grouping was formed with an aim to maintain security and freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The Quad was first set up in 2007, but ceased to exist in 2008 following the withdrawal of Australia. The group was re-established in 2017 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then US President Donald Trump, then Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, and then Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull.</p>

<p>China, which considers the grouping a threat to its expansionist policies in the South China Sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions, is now leading an unofficial, unnamed group to counter the Quad. The group comprises of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.</p>

<p>Russia, which is facing an isolation from the West, especially United States and most of Europe over the Ukraine war, finds itself in a situation where it is heavily dependant on China, both economically as well as supply of select weaponry. Iran and North Korea too, find itself under heavy US sanctions and find itself in depending significantly on China.</p>

<p>Beijing, which aims to replace the United States as the leading global power, is leading its assertive, aggressive and expansionist policies by leveraging the ally's which are dependant on it.</p>

<h2><strong>Here are the chronology of provocative events led by China to send a message to the Quad:</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES</strong></h3>

<p>China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from its territory deep into the Pacific Ocean on September 25, the first such test since 1980. The launch came days after the annual Quad Leaders' Summit was held in Delaware in the US. The ICBM can reportedly target any location in the US in less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Beijing has downplayed the incident calling the test - a first in 44 years - "routine".</p>

<p>China's Ministry of National Defence or MND said, "The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) launched an ICBM carrying a dummy warhead to the high seas in the Pacific Ocean at 08:44 on September 25th, and the missile fell into expected sea areas. This test launch is a routine arrangement in our annual training plan. It is in line with international law and international practice, and is not directed against any country or target."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/ja1odglo_china-icbm-reuters-_625x300_01_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The missile hit the desired target near the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia, not far from the Marquesas Islands. China sent its Yuan Wang 5 tracking ship near the landing site to collect data. New Zealand described the ICBM test as an "unwelcome and concerning development". The US Air Force too deployed an RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft to collect optical and electronic data on the missile and its warhead about halfway along its flight path.</p>

<p>The ICBM's desired target was 12,000km from the launch site. The distance between China's Hainan Island and Los Angeles in the US is just 12,100km. China therefore effectively demonstrated its ability to reach the US with this type of nuclear weapon in under 30 minutes. Beijing's newer DF-41 has an even longer range.</p>

<p>This latest provocative test came at a time of heightened tensions with neighbours like Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately tweeted, "PLA's 1st ICBM launch in 44 years exposes the regime's expansionist ambitions &amp; malign nature. Taiwan vehemently condemns the PRC for its reckless moves destabilising the region &amp; urges China to exercise restraint &amp; cease all actions that undermine global efforts for peace." This was more than a routine test. China was sending a signal, an intimidating one at that, Teipei said.</p>

<p>China has a 2009 agreement with Russia for each side to notify the other of ballistic missile launches, but so far China has rejected all such suggestions for a similar mechanism with the US.</p>

<h3><strong>MESSAGE TO JAPAN</strong></h3>

<p>On September 21 - the day that the Quad Summit was held in the US - China began joint naval exercises in the Sea of Japan. Russia's Pacific Fleet had said, "A joint detachment of warships of the Pacific Fleet and Chinese Navy set out from Vladivostok to conduct the joint Russian-Chinese "Beibu/Interaction - 2024" naval exercise," adding that the naval exercises will include anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons.</p>

<p>Two days into the joint naval exercise near Japan, Tokyo protested a major provocation by Moscow, when a Russian patrol aircraft entered Japan's airspace - not once, not twice, but three times. Japan's Defence Minister Minoru Kihara had said, "We confirmed today that a Russian Il-38 patrol aircraft has violated our airspace over our territorial waters north of Rebun Island, Hokkaido, on three occasions."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em>Japan had scrambled its F-35 fighter jets to warn the Russian military. (Photo: Lockheed Martin)</em></p>
</div>

<p>Japan had scrambled its F-15 and F-35 fighter jets to warn the Russian military over radio during the first two airspace breaches. Finally the Japanese Air Force jets had to resort to firing flares when the third incursion happened. This even prompted Tokyo to call Moscow through diplomatic channels to ensure such provocation doesn't happen again. The Russian government has not commented on the air incursions.</p>

<p>A similar incident happened a month earlier, in August, when Japan had to fly out its air force jets when Chinese military aircraft entered its airspace. Tokyo had warned Beijing, calling it a "serious violation of our sovereignty."</p>

<p>The China-Russia joint naval drill was also the "largest of its kind for three decades," Vladimir Putin had said.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of these China-backed provocations, Japan, Australia and New Zealand sent a strong message to Beijing as their naval ships passed through the Taiwan Strait. JS Sazanami's, a destroyer of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and a navel vessel each from Australia and New Zealand - the HMAS Sydney (DDG 42) and HMNZS Endeavour (A11) - transited the Strait of Taiwan. This was the first ever that such an incident by Japan, Australia and New Zealand took place.</p>

<p>China reportedly sent five of its naval ships to close proximity of the Australian and New Zealand ships and carried out surveillance activity.</p>

<p>With regard to the incident by Japan, Beijing issued a statement via its foreign office spokesperson, who said, "China's response to Japanese Maritime SDF vessel's passing through the Taiwan Strait: The Taiwan question is a red line that must not be crossed. Japan must honor its commitment and be prudent on this issue, and not create disturbance for China-Japan ties and cross-Strait peace."</p>

<h3><strong>CHALLENGE TO FREEDOM ON NAVIGATION IN INDIAN OCEAN</strong></h3>

<p>China, Russia and Iran have also increased their cooperation and activities in West Asia (Middle East). Last year, Beijing brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, highlighting its presence in the Middle East. Both Beijing and Moscow have also condemned the killing of Iran-backed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, in a stand against Israel.</p>

<p>Russia and Iran are also reportedly negotiating terms to arming Houthis in Yemen who are targeting merchant shipping vessels in and around the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. However, they are not targeting Chinese and Russian ships, reports suggest. With a rise in the number of attacks by Houthis, it poses a massive threat to freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Iran-backed and Yemen-based Houthi terrorists have attacked and hijacked ships in the region for many months, affecting the global trade and maritime operations. These incidents are on the rise amid Israel's ongoing war against Hamas and Hezbollah, both backed by Iran.</p>

<p>According to the US Maritime Administration, Houthis have launched over 50 attacks on shipping, resulting in casualties, vessel seizures, and disruptions to global trade routes. The campaign has forced shipping firms to seek alternative routes, impacting approximately 12 per cent of global trade that traverses the Red Sea.</p>

<h3><strong>THE NORTH KOREA THREAT</strong></h3>

<p>In the last few months, North Korea, which is reportedly backed by Beijing, has fired multiple ballistic missiles at the US, Japan and South Korea.</p>

<p>The projectiles were believed to have fallen into the sea. The development comes in the wake of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seen inspecting a uranium enrichment facility in mid-September.</p>

<p>The US Indo-Pacific Command in statement said it was aware of Pyongyang's "ballistic missile launches and are consulting closely" with South Korea and Japan, as well as other regional allies and partners.</p>

<p>"The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts. While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to US personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>A New York Times report has said that US President Joe Biden had in March this year approved a classified document ordering US forces to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.</p>

<p>Amid these developments, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said that Japan faces its "most severe" regional security situation in the post-WWII era. "The security environment surrounding our country is the most severe since the end of World War II," he said last month in his first speech as prime minister.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran is preparing an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel, the United States said on Tuesday, warning that any such assault would have "severe" consequences for Tehran.</p>

<p>The warning came as Israel said it had launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to target the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, whose leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli air strike last week.</p>

<p>"The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel," a senior White House official told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack."</p>

<p>The United States and other western allies stepped in to help defend Israel against a combined Iranian missile and drone attack in April, which Tehran launched in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.</p>

<p>The US official added: "A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran."</p>

<p>Iran has said that Nasrallah's killing would bring about Israel's "destruction," though the foreign ministry said Monday that Tehran would not deploy soldiers to confront Israel.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile issued a stark warning to Iran on Monday, saying there was "nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach."</p>

<p>Netanyahu also said that a future "when Iran is finally free" would "come a lot sooner than people think".</p>

<p>An attack on Israel by Iran would gravely compound fears of a wider regional conflict that the United States and other world powers have said they want to avoid in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The United States has cautiously backed Israel's move to dismantle Hezbollah's ability to attack northern Israel, even as President Joe Biden has called for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington was "tracking events in the Middle East very closely."</p>

<p>"The United States is committed to Israel's defense," Blinken said Tuesday morning while meeting his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita at the State Department.</p>

<p>Washington said Monday that it was boosting its forces in the Middle East by a "few thousand" troops, by bringing in new units while extending others that are already there.</p>

<p>It was also deploying more fighter jets, the Pentagon said.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin late Monday offered support to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant for "dismantling attack infrastructure" belonging to Hezbollah along the border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began low intensity strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas, which is also backed by Iran, staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, which triggered Israel's devastating assault on the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Cross-border fire from Israel and Hezbollah continued throughout Israel's war in Gaza.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces have been carrying out raids into southern Lebanon for months, uncovering Hezbollah tunnels and weapon caches under homes and uncovering invasion plans by the group, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hagari said the details were being declassified, hours after Israel announced a ground operation against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Dozens of such operations had uncovered detailed plans by Hezbollah to enter Israel and carry out an attack similar to the one led by the Palestinian Hamas in southern Israel on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>"Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructure; exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapons caches and seized and destroyed the weapons including advanced, Iranian-made weapons," Hagari said.</p>

<p>The findings and evidence discovered under homes in villages in southern Lebanon during the raids will be presented to the international community, Hagari said.</p>

<p>Hagari showed videos filmed on troops' body-cameras from what he said were Hezbollah tunnels under three Lebanese villages that lie across the border from three Israeli towns. The forces also found maps marking Israeli communities and army posts, he said.</p>

<p>"The operations that we de-classified tonight are only a small number of dozens of operations that we will reveal going forward, including the destruction of Hezbollah's strategic assets and capabilities," he said.</p>

<p>Hagari said that the ground raids would continue until tens of thousands of uprooted Israelis living near the border are able to return safely to their homes, but that the military's aim was to complete them as fast as they can.</p>

<p>"We're not going to Beirut. We're not going to the cities in southern Lebanon. We are focusing on the area of those villages next to our border," said Hagari.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Survivors of the monsoon floods that ravaged Nepal at the weekend criticised the government on Tuesday for inadequate relief efforts during a disaster that killed at least 225 people.</p>

<p>Deadly floods and landslides are common across South Asia during the monsoon season from June to September but experts say climate change is making them worse.</p>

<p>Entire neighbourhoods in the capital Kathmandu were inundated at the weekend, along with villages in remote pockets of the Himalayan country that were still awaiting relief efforts.</p>

<p>"There is no road, so no one has come," Mira KC, who lives in a village in Kavre district to Kathmandu's east, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Even if they do, those who died are dead already and the damage is done. All they will do is offer condolences, what will they do?"</p>

<p>The floods disproportionately hit Kathmandu's poorest residents living in haphazard slums along the banks of the Bagmati river and its tributaries, which run through the city.</p>

<p>Slum resident Man Kumar Rana Magar, 49, told AFP that authorities had provided shelter at a school for him and his neighbours after their homes were inundated.</p>

<p>However, he said they had been forced to leave before they were ready to return to their homes when the school reopened for classes.</p>

<p>"We are so close to the seat of the government. If they cannot take care of the poor this close, what will they do about others?" he said.</p>

<p>At least 225 people were killed in the floods, with another 24 still missing, according to police. More than 4,000 others were rescued.</p>

<p>Nepal's weather bureau said preliminary data showed 240 millimetres (9.4 inches) of rain fell in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, the biggest single-day downpour in more than two decades.</p>

<p><strong>'Precautions ignored'</strong></p>

<p>Experts said authorities did not prepare adequately for the disaster despite forecasts of intense storms.</p>

<p>"Precautions that should have been taken were ignored," climate expert Arun Bhakta Shrestha, of Kathmandu-based think tank International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, told AFP.</p>

<p>Nepali disaster management expert Man Bahadur Thapa said gaps in coordination and resources had also hindered the rescue process.</p>

<p>"We could have saved a lot more lives if we prepared and built the capacity of our responders," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was visiting the United States during the floods and was roundly criticised on social media for not cutting his trip short when the scale of the disaster became clear.</p>

<p>"At a sensitive time like this we all have to work together realistically, not criticise just for the sake of it," he told reporters on his return to Nepal on Monday.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains bring widespread death and destruction in the form of floods and landslides across South Asia every year.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change has worsened their frequency and intensity.</p>

<p>More than 300 people have been killed in rain-related disasters in Nepal this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><strong>(The following is an excerpt from the book 'Inside the Terrifying World of Jaish-e-Mohammed' by Abhinav Pandya. The book examines the JeM's origins, ideology, organisational structure, financing, strategies, radicalisation methods and more.)</strong></em></p>

<p>After his arrest, it took the authorities some time to ascertain Masood Azhar's real identity for he was carrying a Portuguese passport. He was interrogated several times by the IB, R&amp;AW and the J&amp;K state police. Later, after five Western backpackers were kidnapped in Kashmir by Al Faran (a splinter group of the HuA) in a bid to release Masood, the FBI also interrogated him. In his interrogations, he displayed a mild and cooperative demeanour.</p>

<p>He gave the impression of a religious scholar and an intellectual. With his long experience in journalism, he was smooth in his interviews with the media too; however, he was not comfortable giving interviews to female journalists. He did not look into their eyes because it was deemed un-Islamic.</p>

<p>Chanchal Singh, the jail superintendent at Kot Bhalwal Jail at the time of Masood's release, said that he was treated like an ordinary terrorist. He was kept in a different cell, separate from HM terrorist Mushtaq Zargar and another Jaish militant Omar Saed Sheikh, his aides, who were also released with him. However, some officers suggest he was addressed as 'Azhar sahab' in the jail. Mostly, the jail staff say, he prayed in his cell and distributed small amulets (<em>taweez</em>) to jail inmates. Sometimes, visitors came to him for spiritual healing - looking for relief from their medical and family issues. It is believed that Masood began sermonising in jail and radicalised some of his fellow inmates.</p>

<h2><strong>When Masood Feigned Ignorance About Another Terrorist</strong></h2>

<p>Avinash Mohananey, a former Intelligence Bureau (IB) official who interrogated Masood, revealed that his initial confessions were about how Deobandi clerics inspired him. He said that Masood was very communicative and forthcoming in sharing knowledge about Pakistan's jihadi groups and their networks, including how they recruited terrorists, their training and the ISI's role. However, he feigned ignorance about Omar Saed Sheikh, who had already led a failed attempt, along with Ilyas Kashmiri, to get Masood released by kidnapping three British and one American national from Delhi in October 1994.</p>

<p>Delhi Police arrested Omar Saed Sheikh while Ilyas Kashmiri escaped, becoming one of the most lethal terrorists, masterminding Musharraf's assassination plot later. Omar Saed Sheikh's growing importance and popularity disturbed Masood's inflated ego. Mohananey says Masood feigned ignorance about Omar Saed Sheikh because he might not have actually known him. However, he might have also done it because of his expertise in the tradecraft of terrorism. He shared many generic things about the jihadi landscape but cleverly hid what mattered. During my own field research in Kashmir, I interviewed many militants and OGWs (overground workers), presently or formerly associated with terrorist groups. I found it a common tendency among them to be liberal in sharing generic information about jihadi organisations' clandestine worlds, which may impress a person who is not an insider. However, they never shared anything substantial about operational details.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why He Was Disappointed With Pak Organisation</strong></h2>

<p>Masood was highly disappointed with his organisation in Pakistan for providing him with a misleading picture of the ground realities in Kashmir that led to his arrest. He also severely criticised the returning mujahids, called '<em>ghazis</em>' (victors) in Pakistan, for narrating all kinds of false stories of how Kashmir was on the verge of freedom, and the Indian forces were demoralised and on the back foot. In his interrogations, he said, 'I had imagined an Afghanistan-like situation, where mujahideen groups created a liberated belt, and one could travel to and from Pakistan without much difficulty. On the contrary, I found <em>mujahideens </em>on the continuous run, avoiding security forces.'</p>

<p>Mohananey also said that Masood was aware and boastful about his importance. He apparently claimed that when he landed at Heathrow Airport in London, a massive crowd of followers came to see him, resulting in a two-hour traffic jam. Masood further said that he was too important for Pakistan and that India would not be able to keep him in prison for long. Masood knew that his ability to infuse a highly radical and violent jihadi fervour in Kashmir made him indispensable to the ISI. His ego was hurt when Al Faran, during the second kidnapping attempt (July 1995), demanded the release of HuJI chief Nasrullah Manzoor Langaryal, along with him, in exchange for four foreign nationals. He felt it eroded his stature and importance as Nasrallah was a mere 'foot soldier, a person of low intellect', in his view.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Relations Strained With Sajjad Afghani</strong></h2>

<p>Masood was unfit for a combat role ever since the beginning of his career as a mujahideen. He travelled by plane into India using a Portuguese passport because he could not cross into Kashmir from the snowy and mountainous LoC on foot. His physique stopped him from running away and therefore, he was arrested in Anantnag. Initially, after his arrest, Sajjad Afghani told the police that they had nothing to do with each other. However, Masood, not used to handling physical torture, gave away the identity of his colleague in thirty minutes - right after an army soldier slapped him. He allegedly said, 'My father had never slapped me, but for the first time, an army jawan did so even before asking me any question.' Their relations remained strained the entire time they were jailed together because Masood had revealed Sajjad's identity to the Indian Army.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A zookeeper in Nigeria was mauled to death by a lion after he failed to secure the locks on its enclosure when he went to feed it. According to the <em>BBC</em>, the victim, identified as a 35-year-old man named Babaji Daule, worked at the Presidential Library Wildlife Park, owned by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta. He was bitten in the neck on Saturday after agreeing to take guests into the enclosure even though they arrived after hours at the wildlife park.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The zookeeper, apparently, feeling comfortable with the animal, left the safety protection gate open and proceeded to feed the animal. He was mauled by the animal and died on the spot," the park management said in a statement, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e9zv1ypxko" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, local police spokesperson Omolola Odutola said that the "lion inflicted serious fatal injuries to the man's neck". He said that the lion was shot dead "to release its grip on the handler".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is important to state that this activity fell completely outside the standard feeding routine of the park," the wildlife park stressed in its statement.</p>

<p>The police described the 35-year-old as a trained lion handler. It is not clear if Mr Daule had permission to take the guests into the closure when it was supposed to be closed. Either way, he "carelessly neglected to secure the locks and barricade the lion's enclosure before approaching the cage to feed the animal," Mr Odutola said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This negligence allowed the lion to escape and attack the handler, resulting in fatal injuries to the handler's neck and eventual death. The wild lion was shot to release its grip on the handler," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The management of the wildlife park expressed condolences to the deceased's family, and reassured the public of its commitment to ensuring the safety of its employees, visitors, and the animals themselves, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/world-news/zookeeper-mauled-to-death-by-lion-while-feeding-it-after-hours/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this incident comes less than a year after another zookeeper was attacked and killed by a lion at the Obafemi Awolowo University, in Nigeria. Olabode Olawuyi was a veterinary technologist who had been taking care of the lions since they were born on campus about nine years ago. Tragically, in February, one of the male lions killed the man when he was feeding them. His colleagues tried to save him but by the time they could do anything, one of the lions had already fatally wounded him, the university said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive 43-foot-tall naked statue of Donald Trump suddenly appeared alongside the Las Vegas Strip highway over the weekend, only to vanish just as mysteriously. This gigantic effigy, dubbed "Crooked and Obscene," was strategically placed on a plot of land off a highway in Nevada, about 28 miles away from the Trump International Hotel, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/us-news/pop-up-exhibit-43-foot-naked-nevada-trump-effigy-vanishes-after-roadside-ruckus/">New York Post</a></em> reported. Its location was near the highway connecting Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, but far enough from main traffic points, likely due to its explicit nature.</p>

<p>The statue, made of foam over rebar and weighing around 6,000 pounds, was designed as a marionette with movable arms.&nbsp;The identity of the person or group behind the provocative installation remains unknown, and the only clue is that the landowner is a trust registered in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the anonymous artist behind the work said the installation is "43ft tall, 10ft wide… weighs 6,000lbs, and is made of foam over rebar," adding that it intended to "ignite conversations".The statue was due to be removed by Monday night and will be moved to "key swing states," the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The mysterious artwork has generated significant attention, with mixed reactions on social media ranging from amusement to outrage. Some conservatives condemned the display and accused it of inciting violence against the former president.</p>

<p>The Nevada unit of Trump's Republican party described the pop-up as an ''offensive marionette.'' In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nevadagop.org/press-release-the-nevada-republican-party-strongly-condemns-the-deplorable-statue-of-president-donald-j-trump/">press release,</a> the party said, ''While families drive through Las Vegas, they are forced to view this offensive marionette, designed intentionally for shock value rather than meaningful dialogue. President Trump and Republicans are focused on delivering results that matter—reducing inflation, securing our borders, creating jobs, and ensuring a brighter future for all Americans. While Democrats, especially Kamala Harris, continue to prioritize shock value over substance. President Trump is the only candidate in this race standing up for working men and women across Nevada.''</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time a naked Trump statue has made headlines. In 2016, several similar statues popped up in cities across the US, including New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. A baby blimp of Trump was also floated in London ahead of the 2020 election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel announced Tuesday it had launched a ground offensive targeting Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, days after killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike on a bunker in Beirut.</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of what is known about Israel's ground operation so far.</p>

<p><strong>When did the offensive begin</strong></p>

<p>Late Monday, Israel's military began what it called "limited, localised and targeted raids" against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon's border areas.</p>

<p>Its ground forces are backed by fighter jets and artillery fire.</p>

<p>The military formally announced the start of the ground offensive hours after the United States said Israeli forces were conducting limited operations in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The military did not reveal how many soldiers were involved in the incursion, but said its 98th division - including paratroopers and commando units - was taking part.</p>

<p>The division had been previously deployed in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces continue to battle Palestinian militants led by Hamas.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, the military declared three areas along the northern border with Lebanon a "closed military zone", providing the first indication of a possible ground offensive.</p>

<p><strong>What are Israel's targets?</strong></p>

<p>The military said it was acting on "precise intelligence" targeting Hezbollah positions and infrastructure in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel," it said.</p>

<p>The ground assault comes after Israeli air strikes killed several top Hezbollah commanders in recent weeks, including Nasrallah on Friday.</p>

<p>"The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the final one," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday, hours before the offensive was announced.</p>

<p>"We will use all the means that may be required - your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land," Gallant told soldiers in the north.</p>

<p><strong>What are Israel's goals?</strong></p>

<p>Since October 8, Hezbollah has been firing rockets from across the border, displacing more than 60,000 residents in northern Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said it was acting in solidarity with its Islamist ally Hamas in Gaza, following the unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The ensuing cross-border clashes have intensified in recent weeks.</p>

<p>While Israel engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas in Gaza, Gallant announced on September 18 that the "centre of gravity" of the war was now pivoting to the north.</p>

<p>"It was now time to ensure that those displaced from the north would be able to return to their homes," he said.</p>

<p>Other officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have repeatedly vowed to return those displaced back to their homes.</p>

<p>"We will continue to hit Hezbollah... the one who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his home will not have a home," Netanyahu said in a statement last month.</p>

<p><strong>How has Hezbollah responded?</strong></p>

<p>Since the ground offensive began, Hezbollah has fired several rockets into Israel, with explosions heard in the commercial city of Tel Aviv on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A statement said it had "launched salvoes of Fadi 4 rockets at the Glilot base of the military intelligence's unit 8200 and the Mossad headquarters located on the outskirts of Tel Aviv".</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it also targeted Israeli troop movements in Metula in northern Israel "with artillery shells" and later a "gathering of enemy soldiers" in the same area with rockets.</p>

<p>Israeli troops in northern Israel's Avivim were also targeted, the group added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Hawaii has filed a lawsuit against a North Shore Oahu homeowner after his luxurious property partially collapsed into the ocean, the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/real-estate/hawaii-sues-homeowner-because-his-house-fell-into-the-ocean-despite-efforts-to-save-it/">New York Post</a> </em>reported. On September 25, 2024, the state filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against Josh VanEmmerik, seeking to hold them accountable for the damage.&nbsp;A shocking video circulating on social media shows the precarious state of the house, prompting widespread concern. In the footage, a voice can be heard warning onlookers, "Be careful where you're standing. The whole roof is gonna come down right now," highlighting the danger posed by the collapsing structure.&nbsp;Glass, metal and wood can be seen strewn across the sand as the waves pull debris into the sea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands reported that waves destroyed the Haleiwa home, causing debris to fall onto state land and into the ocean. Officers responding to the scene found large parts of the structure on state land and debris washing into the sea.</p>

<p>''On September 24, 2024, large pieces of cement, wood, glass, electrical components, rebar, geotextile fabric, and other unidentified solid materials cover the State land spanning between the property boundary line and the ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;An unknown quantity of solid material from the dwelling on Subject Property 2 entered the ocean and was taken away from the location due to the ocean's natural processes,'' the complaint reads.</p>

<p>Notably, VanEmmerik's beachfront property purchase in 2021 for $1 million came with a warning about erosion, which ultimately led to the house collapsing into the ocean. Despite the risks, he remodelled the property and listed it for $2.5 million, later reducing the price to $2 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Private landowners take a risk when they allow structures to be so close to the shoreline. The people of Hawaii are now confronted with the consequences of property owners' failures to take heed of the ocean's warning signs of erosion,'' &nbsp;Deputy Attorney General&nbsp;Danica Swenson told&nbsp;<em><a data-link="native" href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/09/26/state-files-legal-action-against-homeowner-whose-house-partially-collapsed-into-ocean/">Hawaii News Now</a>.</em></p>

<p>This isn't the first time the property owner has faced issues with the state. Last year, they received a $110,000 penalty for "erosion control violations" related to sandbags placed at the residence.</p>

<p>Hawaii's coastal erosion problem has been an ongoing issue, with nearly a third of beachfront homes on O‘ahu's North Shore sitting precariously close to the shoreline. Many locals are frustrated with both VanEmmerik and the state government, accusing them of dragging their feet in addressing the erosion issue.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has targeted Indian-American billionaire Vinod Khosla in a sharp social media exchange. Musk called him “dumb” and disputed Khosla's claims about Argentina's economic state under its new conservative president, Javier Milei. The argument, which quickly went viral, stemmed from Khosla's criticism of Milei's policies, much to the dismay of Musk, a vocal admirer of the Argentinian leader.</p>

<p>Vinod Khosla posted on X, linking President Milei's austerity programme to economic downturns and likening it to former US President Donald Trump's policies. “Argentina's unemployment rate soars to 52% under Mileis dictatorial austerity program. Same will happen under @realDonaldTrump&nbsp; as he slashes spending. His tariffs will simultaneously increase inflation.” Khosla wrote, sharing a Financial Times article about Argentina's worsening poverty rate.</p>

<p>Musk, a strong supporter of Milei's libertarian approach, responded bluntly, calling Khosla “dumb” for what he probably deemed a misleading post.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">You are dumb</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1839904894339236261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>X's community notes also fact-checked Khosla's claims, pointing out that Argentina's unemployment rate had actually decreased to 7.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, down slightly from the previous period's 7.7 per cent – far from the 52 per cent unemployment figure Khosla cited.</p>

<p>The exchange escalated when another commenter questioned how Khosla could make such an outlandish claim, writing, “How did Khosla not think this through? A 52% unemployment rate is just absurd; it should have triggered something in his brain to say this doesn't seem right.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk jumped in with a sarcastic reply, saying, “seriously.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Seriously</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1840180420203200948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Vinod Khosla, refusing to back down, responded directly to Musk's post. &nbsp;“Poverty is gross underemployment. Too nuanced for macho brains to understand. My nuance vs. your outright posting of false pics? I get a community comment and yours didn't. I thought you were above this kind of bias at X,” Khosla fired back, accusing Musk of selective bias on the platform he now owns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/business/argentina-poverty-rate-increase-50-percent/index.html">CNN report</a> noted that under President Milei, Argentina's poverty rate surged to nearly 53 per cent, the worst level in two decades. The country's economic challenges have left approximately 3.4 million more Argentinians living in poverty in 2024 alone.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A luxury round-the-world cruise ship beset with technical delays and docked in rainy Belfast since May finally departed from the Northern Irish capital late Monday, prompting celebration among its passengers.</p>

<p>"We are going to have one heck of a time tonight, we are going to party like there's no tomorrow," beaming passenger Joe Martino told AFP before boarding.</p>

<p>The Odyssey residential cruise ship pulled out from Belfast harbour at 2240 GMT as passengers cheered on board.</p>

<p>But even Monday's departure was hit with yet another technical hiccup.</p>

<p>Dozens of passengers were left waiting in Belfast's cruise terminal beyond the scheduled boarding time as a last piece of required paperwork was held up.</p>

<p>After Mike Petersen, head of the US-based firm Villa Vie Residences that owns the Odyssey ship, at last, announced the green light for the ship's exit passengers shrieked with elation and hugged each other.</p>

<p>"The exhilaration of getting on that ship, when it takes off it will be the feeling of a lifetime," said Martino, 61, an actor from Chicago who spent the last four months waiting in Belfast.</p>

<p>Passenger Holly Hennessy, holding her cat named "Captain", said ecstatically: "I've been in Belfast for four months and two days, but hey, who's counting!"&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Everything went wrong'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Odyssey was scheduled to set sail from the Northern Irish capital on May 30 on a three-and-a-half-year cruise.</p>

<p>But outfitting, certification processes and engine repairs all took much longer than expected.</p>

<p>"Everything that could go wrong went wrong," Martino said.</p>

<p>The ship had undergone repairs for engine trouble in drydock at Belfast's Harland &amp; Wolff, the famed shipyard where the doomed Titanic was built more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Further delay was caused by the shipbuilder going into financial administration this month.</p>

<p>Passengers are able to either buy or rent long-term cabins on the so-called "residential" cruise ship, with the promise of unlimited voyages around the globe.</p>

<p>During the long wait, passengers could spend all day on board the ship but were not allowed to sleep there, so spent the nights in hotels or rented apartments instead.</p>

<p>Some decided to explore Northern Ireland, while others took the opportunity to travel in Europe or join other cruises while the Odyssey remained stuck.</p>

<p>They then flocked back to Belfast in recent days for the expected departure, which will see the ship head first to Brest, then Bilbao, the Azores, and across the Atlantic towards the Caribbean.</p>

<p>The floating town, which can accommodate around 600 passengers, is due to visit all seven continents with more than 425 stops in 147 destinations planned.</p>

<p>Port stays will last between two to seven days.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A devastating fire tore through a Thai bus carrying 44 students and teachers on a school trip Tuesday, officials said, with up to 25 feared dead.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said there were fatalities and offered condolences to the victims' families.</p>

<p>Transport minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit said the number of fatalities was not clear but 25 people were unaccounted for after the blaze.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Initial reports said there are 44 on board, 38 students and six teachers. As far as we know now, three teachers and 16 students got out," he told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For those still missing, we are not clear yet."</p>

<p>The bus was carrying students from Uthai Thani province when a tyre burst on a highway in a northern Bangkok suburb, sending the vehicle crashing into a barrier, a rescue worker said in footage broadcast on local TV.</p>

<p>The bus was running on compressed gas and the crash ignited its fuel tanks, the rescue worker said.</p>

<p>Video footage from the scene showed flames engulfing the bus as it burned under an overpass, huge clouds of dense black smoke billowing into the sky.</p>

<p>"I have learned of the fire on a bus carrying students from Uthai Thani... resulting in deaths and injuries," Paetongtarn wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"As a mother, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of the injured and deceased."</p>

<p>The blaze has been put out but rescue workers have had to wait for the bus to cool down before searching it for bodies, a rescue worker said.</p>

<p>Thailand has one of the worst road safety records in the world, with unsafe vehicles and poor driving contributing to the high annual death count.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

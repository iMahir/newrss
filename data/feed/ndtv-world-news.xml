       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Palestinian Hamas group said on Wednesday that its negotiators reiterated its readiness to implement an "immediate" ceasefire with Israel in Gaza based on a previous U.S. proposal without new conditions from any party.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group said in a statement that their negotiation team, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, met mediators on Wednesday including Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel in Doha to discuss the latest developments in Gaza.</p>

<p>Talks have so far failed to reach a deal to end the 11-month-old war. Lingering issue include control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow stretch of land on Gaza's border with Egypt, persisting.</p>

<p>CIA Director William Burns, who is also the chief U.S. negotiator on Gaza, said on Saturday that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days.</p>

<p>The previous proposal put forward by U.S. President Joe Biden in June laid out a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>The recent war in Gaza started after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7 killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's offensive has thus far killed at least 41,084 Palestinians and wounded 95,029 others, the Gaza health ministry says.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany's foreign ministry mocked US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's false assertion about immigrants eating pets in a post on the social platform X on Wednesday while pushing back against his criticism of German energy policy.</p>

<p>Trump amplified a false claim in Tuesday's debate with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris that numerous Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.</p>

<p>He also attacked Harris' bid to move the country towards what she says will be a more diverse and sustainable mix of energy sources, saying Germany had tried and failed to give up fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"Like it or not: Germany's energy system is fully operational, with more than 50% renewables. And we are shutting down - not building - coal &amp; nuclear plants. Coal will be off the grid by 2038 at the latest," the foreign ministry said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>"PS: We also don't eat cats and dogs. #Debate2024"</p>

<p>The economy ministry, which is also run by the Greens party, retweeted the post, saying: "New coal-fired power plants? No way!"</p>

<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not directly endorsed Harris but praised her in July as a "competent and experienced politician who knows exactly what she is doing" and who could well win the US election.</p>

<p>Germany was a frequent focus of Trump's ire during his 2017-21 term as president due to its trade surplus with the United States and low spending on defence.</p>

<p>Trump vows to impose higher tariffs on imports if elected and to condition US support for members of the NATO military alliance on them spending the agreed 2% of GDP on defence. German officials have said they expect to meet the 2% target this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's foreign minister said on Wednesday that Tehran had not delivered any ballistic missiles to Russia and sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and three European powers would not solve any problems between them.</p>

<p>"Once again, US and E3 act on faulty intelligence and flawed logic. Iran has NOT delivered ballistic missiles to Russia. Period... Sanctions are not a solution, but part of problem," Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The E3 comprises of Britain, Germany and France.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran and was likely to use them in Ukraine within weeks. Cooperation between Moscow and Tehran threatened wider European security, he said.</p>

<p>The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline Iran Air.</p>

<p>The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed reports that Iran had shipped missiles to Russia, saying claims about various arms transfers were baseless.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Netherlands summoned the Iranian ambassador, and Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said on X that it was calling for "new, robust EU sanctions".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia and Ukraine will have to resolve their conflict by negotiating off the battlefield and India is willing to advise them, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishakar's remarks came at a time when National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is in Moscow for a crucial meeting of NSAs. Sources have said that Mr Doval is carrying a peace plan proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he will share with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

</div>

<p>Whether or not Russia and Ukraine accept India's proposal is not known yet, but India has offered to help end the conflict. During his visit to Ukraine, PM Modi told President Volodymyr Zelensky that India is ever ready to play an "active role" in every effort to restore peace and he would like to contribute personally in ending the conflict.</p>

<p>PM Modi is perhaps one of the very few leaders who shares friendly ties with both Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky and was warmly welcomed by both leaders during his recent visits to both nations.</p>

<p>The foreign minister was speaking at the Annual Ambassadors' Conference of the German Foreign Office in Berlin, a day after he held a "useful conversation" with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov at the margins of the India-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) foreign ministers' meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>"We don't think this conflict is going to be resolved on the battlefield. At some stage, there's going to be some negotiation. When there is a negotiation, the main parties - Russia and Ukraine - have to be at that negotiation," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>He cited Prime Minister Modi's visits to Russia and Ukraine and how the Indian leader had once told the Russian President that this was not "an era of war".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We don't think you're going to get a solution out of the battlefield. If you want advice, we are always willing to give it," Mr Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>The minister also spoke about Quad, which he said has been a successful experiment. Quad is a strategic security dialogue between India, United States, Australia and Japan.</p>

<p>"We have revived the Quad. It is a major diplomatic platform and India is committed to it," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that India is among the three countries he is constantly in touch over the Ukraine conflict and said they are sincerely making efforts to resolve it.</p>

<p>"If there is a desire of Ukraine to carry on with the negotiations, I can do that." Mr Putin's remarks came within two weeks after Prime Minister Modi's historic visit to Ukraine, where he held talks with President President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>"We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India. I constantly keep in touch with our colleagues on this issue," Mr Putin was quoted as saying by Russia's TASS news agency.</p>

<p>Last week, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told daily newspaper Izvestia that India could help in establishing a dialogue on Ukraine.</p>

<p>He spoke about the "highly constructive, even friendly relations" between PM Modi and President Putin and added the Indian leader can "lead the line on getting first-hand information from the participants in this conflict," as he "freely communicates with Putin, Zelensky and the Americans."</p>

<p>"This gives a great opportunity for India to throw its weight in world affairs, to use its influence that would drive the Americans and Ukrainians towards using a greater political will and entering the peaceful settlement track," Mr Peskov said, adding that there are "no specific plans" for PM Modi to mediate on the issue.</p>

<p>PM Modi, on his visit to Ukraine last month, told President Volodymyr Zelensky that both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the ongoing war and that India was ready to play an "active role" to restore peace in the region.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also talked about India's relations with China at the conference in Berlin, saying that India is not "closed to business from China", but the issue is in which sectors the country does business with Beijing and on what terms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said Wednesday that an army helicopter crashed in the south of war-ravaged Gaza overnight, killing two soldiers and injuring seven.</p>

<p>"An initial inquiry... indicates that the crash was not caused by enemy fire... Two IDF (Israeli) soldiers were killed as a result of the crash," the military said in a statement, adding that the seven injured had been evacuated to hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The military said it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred when the helicopter was landing near the southern city of Rafah.</p>

<p>The latest deaths bring the military's losses in the Gaza campaign to 344 since the start of the ground offensive on October 27.</p>

<p>The war erupted after Hamas operatives attacked southern Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures, which also include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>During the attack, Hamas operatives abducted 251 people, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,020 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>The United Nations human rights office says most of the dead in Gaza are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Twelve-year-old Heba Dawas lost her footwear in the chaos while fleeing Israel's military offensive in Gaza. So her carpenter father made wooden-soled sandals for her so she can tread more safely through the tonnes of rubble.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twelve-year-old Heba Dawas lost her footwear in the chaos while fleeing Israel's military offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p>So her carpenter father made wooden-soled sandals for her so she can tread more safely through the tonnes of rubble, hot sand and twisted metal of the besieged Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>"When we were displaced, we started running and the sandals broke," said Heba, who lives in a tent camp with her family in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>"I threw them off and started running. Our feet became very hot. So, we had to make sandals from wood," she said, walking on hot sand with her new footwear.</p>

<p>Her father Saber Dawas, 39, came up with the idea after finding the price of sandals too expensive. Now his daughter does not have to go barefoot amid the ruins of Gaza.</p>

<p>"I had to make a tailored size for each daughter," he said.</p>

<p><strong>SANDALS IN DEMAND</strong></p>

<p>Soon enough, his neighbours noticed him making the sandals and started asking him to make some for their children.</p>

<p>Using basic carpentry tools, he made them for "a symbolic price," he says.</p>

<p>The sandals have a wooden sole and a strap made of a rubber strip or fabric. But there was a challenge in finding more wood because Palestinians needed it for cooking and fires.</p>

<p>"Everything here in Gaza is difficult to find," Dawas said, rubbing the base of a sandal with one of his young daughters watching by his side.</p>

<p>Making wooden sandals may ease the pressure of the war but life is still fraught with challenges in Gaza, where the Israeli offensive against Hamas has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.</p>

<p>Nearly 2 million people have been displaced, often repeatedly, Gazan health officials say.</p>

<p>Hamas triggered the war on October 7 when the Palestinian group attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>A humanitarian crisis has gripped Gaza since then with Palestinians struggling to find food, water and fuel as they move up and down the territory seeking a safe place to shelter.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt have failed to secure a ceasefire through mediation after many attempts.</p>

<p>The border crossing with Egypt has been shut, bringing the flow of aid and basic goods such as shoes to a halt.</p>

<p>"People now are walking around with mismatched shoes," said Momen al-Qarra, a Palestinian cobbler repairing old shoes in a little market in Khan Younis.</p>

<p>"If the situation continues like this for two weeks or a month at the most, without the opening of the border, people will be barefoot."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers have been observing one of the most curious cosmic incidents: the possible collision between supermassive black holes in the nearby galaxy MCG-03-34-64, approximately 800 million light-years away, according to <em>Universe Today.</em> Using the Hubble Space Telescope, three bright optical 'hot spots' were identified in this galaxy. Following this observation with Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio data, scientists have established that two of these hot spots would be more likely caused by a pair of closely spaced supermassive black holes.</p>

<p>The discovery provides a rare snapshot of galaxy collisions in the modern universe. The two black holes are expected to meet their demise in about one hundred million years, sending gravitational waves rippling through space and triggering vigorous galactic activity, including bursts of star formation.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.universetoday.com/168439/two-supermassive-black-holes-on-a-collision-course-with-each-other/#more-168439">the news portal, </a>understanding the merger of close-together AGNs such as the ones seen in MCG-03-34-64 offers a unique window into the final stages of what astronomers call "SMBH binary coalescence." Such events are and will continue to be a major way to measure the effects of these mergers. They'll offer a rich field of study using observatories sensitive to light across the spectrum, as well as future gravitational wave detectors.</p>

<p>This result is of much use to provide insight into the very last stages of mergers of black holes and glimpses into future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The study helps clarify several concepts about galaxy evolution and those that involve supermassive black holes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump shook hands Wednesday at New York's 9/11 memorial to mark the anniversary of the attacks, hours after they clashed in a combustible TV debate.</p>

<p>The Democratic vice president delivered a strong performance against her Republican rival, most analysts said, as the two head toward the November election neck-and-neck in the polls.</p>

<p>Both candidates declared victory after coming face to face for the first time on the biggest night so far of the campaign -- although any major shift in support may be unlikely.</p>

<p>The ABC News-hosted debate in Philadelphia was punctuated by tense exchanges, with Harris focused on policy while Trump's answers were littered with wild falsehoods and were often about his past grievances.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Trump came out swinging in an early morning interview with Fox News, claiming -- without evidence -- that the debate was "rigged" against him.</p>

<p>"It was a rigged deal, as I assumed it would be, because when you looked at the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her," he complained.</p>

<p>Republican strategist Liam Donovan said Harris scored points on Trump, and the Republican "largely whiffed" in his efforts to tie his opponent to President Joe Biden, instead "going on angry tirades."</p>

<p>"It will surely boost morale at a time when Democrats are getting anxious," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>9/11 memorial</strong></p>

<p>After replacing Biden as the candidate in July, Harris rode a wave of enthusiasm through the Democratic convention that boosted her popularity and gave her record fundraising numbers.</p>

<p>And with Biden gone, 78-year-old Trump finds himself as the candidate facing questions about his advanced age, with renewed focus on his eccentric and often rambling speeches.</p>

<p>But Harris, 59, had seen her polling momentum begin to stall ahead of the debate.</p>

<p>The Democrat has been reaching to the center, showcasing a parade of anti-Trump Republicans -- most recently former vice president Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, who was thrown out of the House leadership over her opposition to the tycoon.</p>

<p>Trump has largely appealed to his own base, with apocalyptic warnings about migrant criminals and painting a dark picture of a country in "decline" that only he can save.</p>

<p>In a threatening social media post at the weekend, Trump vowed to prosecute Democratic donors, lawyers and elections officials who engage in behavior he deems "unscrupulous" in November.</p>

<p>He used the debate on Tuesday to double down on his bogus voter fraud claims from 2020.</p>

<p>In New York on Wednesday, Biden looked on as Harris and Trump greeted each other again, with all three wearing blue commemorative ribbons.</p>

<p>They watched as the names of the almost 3,000 victims of the attacks were read out.</p>

<p>"We stand in solidarity with their families and loved ones. We also honor the extraordinary heroism on display that fateful day by ordinary Americans helping their fellow Americans," Harris said in a statement.</p>

<p>Harris heads Thursday to North Carolina -- one of a handful of states expected to decide the election, where she has erased a six-point Trump lead to draw level.</p>

<p>Trump is due onstage in Tucson, Arizona on Thursday focusing on "our struggling economy and the rising cost of housing."</p>

<p>Harris's running mate Tim Walz will travel to Michigan and Wisconsin from Thursday to Saturday, as his Republican opposite number J.D. Vance deals with the fallout from another round of controversial remarks.</p>

<p>The Republican vice presidential nominee amplified a false claim Monday that Haitian immigrants are abducting and eating pets in Ohio.</p>

<p>In the debate, Trump repeated the bizarre claim, which has been debunked by local authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Burj Azizi, set to become the world's second-tallest skyscraper at 725 meters, will feature the highest nightclub on level 126 and a seven-star all-suite hotel celebrating global cultures.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's highest nightclub will be constructed on the 126th floor of Burj Azizi in Dubai, according to <em>The Metro.&nbsp;</em>Upon completion, this building will stand as the world's second-tallest tower, reaching a height of 725 meters (2,379ft). Until 2028, this $1.63 billion-worth tower will be completed with its total 131 floors. The Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, stands at 2,723 feet. This building will have a seven-star all-suite hotel with a focus on cultural themes, as well as penthouses, apartments, and vacation homes.</p>

<p>This building will have the world's tallest restaurant, observation deck, and hotel lobby, besides many other already famous attractions. The sales will start from February 2025 onwards, and construction is now going on full speed. While prices for the apartments have not yet been announced, it is expected you'll have to fork out quite a lot of money for them. This tower will boast the only freehold building on Sheikh Zayed Road, along with Dubai's tallest hotel room, a vertical shopping complex, an opulent ballroom, and a beach club.</p>

<p>"Our investment in Burj Azizi, surpassing AED 6 billion, represents more than just the creation of an iconic structure; it is a commitment to transforming Sheikh Zayed Road and elevating Dubai's skyline to new, unparalleled heights," Mr Mirwais Azizi, Founder &amp; Chairman of Azizi Developments, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/10/dubai-skyscraper-will-host-worlds-highest-nightclub-21580637/#:~:text=Imagine%20partying%20it%20up%20at,Azizi%20in%20Dubai%20by%202028."><em>The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>"Burj Azizi is not merely about its towering stature or prime location, and with its innovative design and cutting-edge technology, this tower will offer ultra-luxury residences, a unique vertical shopping mall, the world's highest observation deck, and a wealth of amenities and dining experiences, all set at extraordinary elevations."</p>

<p>"The seven-star hotel, crowned by the world's highest lobby, will embody Dubai's spirit, celebrating the world's seven major cultures through its intricate interior design."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US wants to build a "BFF (best friends forever) relationship" with India, and a change of guard at the White House will not change ties between the two countries, US Ambassador Eric Garcetti said on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US wants to build a "BFF (best friends forever) relationship" with India, and a change of guard at the White House will not change ties between the two countries, US Ambassador Eric Garcetti said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Without naming China, Eric Garcetti said if New Delhi has to contend with "regional competitors", it will have to reduce the dependence on a single country and added that such a reliance is not just an economic risk, but a security risk as well.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Milken Institute event here at a time when five pension funds with USD 1.8 trillion of assets under management are scouting for investment opportunities in India, Eric Garcetti exhorted the Americans to invest more in the country for their own good.</p>

<p>Borrowing the acronym of the pension funds' tour christened Building Financial Futures, Eric Garcetti made clear American intent on India-US ties.</p>

<p>"We want to build a BFF (best friends forever) relationship between the US and India," he said.</p>

<p>Deploying a colloquial phrase popular on social media, Eric Garcetti said the relationship's nature has changed from one where it could be called as complicated to a new status where it can be called as "definitely dating".</p>

<p>He also made it clear that the relationship will not face any setbacks in the immediate future.</p>

<p>"We will have a new president in the United States, but one thing won't change which is America's devotion to and friendship to India," he said.</p>

<p>However, this was quickly followed by some advice for India.</p>

<p>"We recognise that for India to reach its full growth potential, as the largest democracy on earth, and to contend with regional competitors, among others, several things need to happen," he said.</p>

<p>"If we're overly dependent on any one country, we will all see economic risk, not just security risk," the ambassador added.</p>

<p>He cited India's struggles with buying machinery for manufacturing photovoltaic cells used in solar projects as a case in point where dependence on a single country is hurting.</p>

<p>"Similarly, during the pandemic as well, we saw people struggling to procure masks and critical medical equipment, Eric Garcetti said.</p>

<p>Garcetti said he met Indian Navy officials earlier in the day and added that a lot of opportunities exist for cooperation.</p>

<p>He also welcomed India's commitment on the small modular reactors and called nuclear sector as a good prospect for cooperation.</p>

<p>The politician-turned-diplomat welcomed India's attempts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

<p>Asked about the controversial meeting of American officials in Srinagar with political parties, Garcetti said, "we are here to listen and learn", and added that the US has always stood with India in times of crisis like the one with China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday said his country wants good relations with India and other neighbouring nations it should be on the basis of "fairness and equality".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim government chief Dr Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday said his country wants good relations with India and other neighbouring nations but it should be on the basis of "fairness and equality".</p>

<p>In a televised address, Muhammad Yunus said after he took oath as the head of the administration, he received congratulatory calls and messages from different heads of governments who promised to enhance bilateral relations with Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif were among the heads of government with whom I communicated by telephone," he said.</p>

<p>"We want good relations with India and other neighbouring nations, but the relations must be based on fairness and equality," the Chief Adviser said.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old Nobel laureate took oath as the head of the interim government on August 8 after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India following widespread protests against her government.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh has already started "high-level" talks with India for bilateral cooperation on flood management.</p>

<p>"I have also taken the initiative to revive SAARC to enhance regional cooperation in South Asia," he said.</p>

<p>SAARC comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>"We want the world to recognise Bangladesh as a respected democracy," he said.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus said the interim government has taken steps to form six commissions to overhaul in six key sectors, including the electoral system, in a bid to reform Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The other sectors are police administration, judiciary, anti-corruption commission, public administration, and the constitution.</p>

<p>The commissions are expected to start their functions from October 1 and they are expected to complete their work within the next three months, Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>Underlining that the core aim of the reforms is to ensure equal rights for all, he said, "We have a lot of work ahead of us. We want to move forward together toward the same goal. We want to create a structure that enables the untapped talents within us, especially within our new generation, to be expressed without obstacles, with the support of the state and society." Muhammad Yunus dedicated several paragraphs of his speech paying tributes to those killed or injured in the mass protests that led to the ouster of the Hasina government.</p>

<p>"I recall those who embraced deaths standing like Himalayas in front of (police's) lethal weapons to protest injustice, received wounds or lost their eye sights," he said, promising to rehabilitate the families of the victims.</p>

<p>But at the same time, Muhammad Yunus made an ardent call "not to take laws in one's own hand" and warned that anyone doing so will have to face punitive actions. He also asked everyone to maintain communal harmony in the country.</p>

<p>"We are a country of communal harmony. None of you must do anything in any way which can affect religious harmony," Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>Slamming the previous "facist" government of Hasina and its "tyranny, misrule, corruption", he announced that the deposed premier's official Ganobhaban residence will be turned into a museum as a mark of the "centre-point of autocracy".</p>

<p>The Ganobhaban became the focal point of public fury after Prime Minister Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana fled Bangladesh with military support, with an enraged mob inflicting extensive damage on the building in the hours that followed.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus, however, also appreciated the armed forces for standing by the people's side instead of the "tyrannical" government and protecting the country's sovereignty.</p>

<p>He also praised their acts in maintaining law and order during the chaotic situation and also their role during the recent unprecedented flooding in the northeastern, eastern and northwestern region of the country.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus said his government recently signed an UN convention against enforced disappearance. He said his government has already formed a commission to investigate incidents of enforced disappearance during the past 15 years of the "fascist rule, shutting down all secret jails dubbed as 'aina ghar'".</p>

<p>Multiple media outlets have reported that numerous individuals, including former military officers, who held dissenting views, were abducted by plainclothes agents and detained for years in secret facilities without their families' knowledge. Although some were released after the collapse of Hasina's regime, many remain unaccounted for, and are feared to have died or been killed while in captivity.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus further said the restoration of a "destroyed public administration" system was his major but most challenging achievement in the past one month as it required a thorough restructuring through removing and appointing officials at the top positions to fulfil people's will.</p>

<p>At the same time, he said restoring order in the economic system remained as a major challenge for the country while "we took initiatives to bring back the money which were looted and smuggled abroad" as well as formed a banking commission to re-establish discipline in the banking sector.</p>

<p>"We have just done major works in the first month, many more remains to be done," Muhammad Yunus said, adding controlling the unprecedented inflation was one such major task.</p>

<p>He said to stabilise Bangladeshi currency Taka against US dollar, the foreign exchange rate was made market-based and "enethical permission" for whitening black money was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus said the country's forex reserve is in a poor condition and budget support has been sought from development partners to enhance the reserve.</p>

<p>"Requests have been made to reduce the interest rates on loans from Russia and China alongside extension of the repayment period...an additional USD 3 billion has been sought from the International Monetary Fund, and additional USD 1 billion each from the World Bank and JICA," he said.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus said the national revenue authorities were asked to consider reducing taxes on essentials to reduce pressure on consumers alongside expanding safety nets for most vulnerable people.</p>

<p>"In line with the peoples' expectations, all ongoing negotiations, project selection process and procurement process in power, energy and mineral resources sector have been halted temporarily...in the past one-and-a-half decade, tens of millions of taka was looted from the sector using a law," Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>The interim government chief said his administration is in line with the task entrusted to them by the people who want to carry on reforms "but my ardent request to you (people), don't take the spectators gallery, giving us the heavy duty".</p>

<p>"Be with us. We will carry on the reform works together. A nation's reform cannot be done with the reform of the government alone. If you are a businessman, bring reform to your business...If you are a labourer, do the required reform in your field...if you are a political leader or activist, do the reform in your field. I appeal all to take it as an opportunity as we want to proceed afresh through reforms," he said.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus, however, gave no deadline on the tenure of his government but said after massive sacrifices by millions a "fascist government" was ousted, simultaneously warranting a national reform with its centre point being introduction of a proper electoral system and good governance.</p>

<p>"I will not tell you to keep patience at all. We all became impatient pondering when all these tasks will be finished...but we will have to work correctly, we will keep no mark of impatience in our works," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>September 11, 2001</strong></h2>

<p>At 5:45 am (US time) Mohammed Atta and Abdul Aziz al-Omari pass through security at Portland Airport in Maine and board a commuter flight - American Airlines Flight 11 - to Boston airport. Five hijackers were on board when the flight took off at 7:59 am.</p>

<p>At 8:15 am, United Airlines Flight 175 took off from Boston and headed for Los Angeles. There are 51 passengers, nine crew members and five hijackers on the aircraft. Four minutes later, the ground personnel are alerted by flight attendant Betty Ann Ong of the hijacking. At 8:20 am, American Airlines Flight 77 takes off from Dulles outside Washington DC for Los Angeles with five hijackers on board.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://millercenter.org/remembering-september-11/september-11-terrorist-attacks" rel="no follow, no index">At 8:42 am</a>, United Flight 93 took off from Newark, New Jersey, and headed for San Francisco, with four hijackers in the plane. Four minutes later, Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Centre's North Tower, killing all passengers. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03 am, Flight 175 crashed into WTC's South Tower.</p>

<p>President George Bush, who was in an elementary school classroom in Florida was informed at 9:05 am about the biggest attack on American soil since Pearl Harbour during World War II. At 9:37 am, Flight 77 &nbsp;crashed into the Pentagon, the biggest office, killing all passengers and 125 civilian and military personnel. Flight 93 crashed into an empty field in Pennsylvania after the hijackers failed to direct the flight to its intended target, likely the White House or the US Capitol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nineteen terrorists, most of them Saudis, had hijacked four planes. From the moment the first flight took off to the crash of Flight 93, in just two hours, the US was shaken to its core. The attack orchestrated by Osama Bin- laden's Al Qaeda killed 3,000 people.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Immediate Aftermath</strong></h2>

<p>President George Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan. The objective was to destroy Al Qaeda and kill or capture its leader, Osama bin Laden, and other senior figures in the terrorist group and the Taliban.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the 9/11 Commission Report, Bin Laden, in an interview with ABC-TV in 1998 said, "It is far better to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities...We believe the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. We do not differentiate between military and civilian...They are all targets."&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>Bin Laden found a haven in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan, after moving from Sudan. He was behind attacks on Americans in the Middle East and Africa. The 1998 bombing of the US Embassy in Kenya, which killed hundreds, and the sinking of USS Cole in 2000 in which 17 crew members were killed were part of his war on America.</p>

<p>On October 7, 2001, the US invaded Afghanistan and in two months, the American-led coalition emerged victorious. The Taliban had fallen, but Osama Bin Laden escaped to Pakistan through the network of caves and tunnels in Tora Bora, only to be hunted down in Pakistan's Abbottabad in 2011. The Americans established a pro-US regime led by the Northern Alliance, stationed themselves for 20 years and reportedly spent $2 Trillion to rebuild Afghanistan, only to leave a power vacuum and bring the Taliban back to power in 2021.</p>

<p>The US war on terror expanded to Iraq and the American-led invasion began in 2003 to find "Weapons of Mass Destruction" and end the dictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein. When WMD proved illusory, a violent insurgency arose. Saddam was captured, tried, and hanged and democratic elections were held. In the years since there have been over 4,700 U.S. and allied troop deaths, and more than one hundred thousand Iraqi civilians have been killed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Toll On People In America</strong></h2>

<p>The visuals of the planes crashing the Twin Towers are etched in the minds of people. 9/11 took a devastating emotional toll. The CIA went on a hunt to track down and eradicate the intricate network of sleeper cells in the mainland and the establishment of Guantanamo Bay in 2002, a detention camp where hundreds of terrorism suspects and "illegal enemy combatants" were kept and reportedly tortured for years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The facility held roughly 800 prisoners at its peak, but they have since slowly been repatriated to other countries. Biden pledged before his election to try to shut down Guantanamo, but it remains open.</p>

<p>Abdul and Mohammed Rabbani were freed from the prison after more than 20 years. Abdul Rabbani was born in 1967 and was believed to have been one of the oldest inmates at the facility on a US base in Cuba. Mohammed Rabbani, born in 1969, was accused of recruiting his older brother into extremist circles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, a judge at the US military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay ruled that a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ramzi-bin-al-shibh-man-accused-of-aiding-9-11-attack-too-mentally-damaged-for-trial-us-judge-4413150">Yemeni detainee</a> who was tortured by the CIA is unfit to stand trial in a death penalty case. The judge said the prisoner was too psychologically damaged to help defend himself.</p>

<h2><strong>23-Years-Later</strong></h2>

<p>A memorial exists where the Twin Towers once stood to remember those who lost their lives in the terror attack. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/09/02/two-decades-later-the-enduring-legacy-of-9-11/" rel="no follow, no index">Pew Research</a> in its study said, "It is difficult to think of an event that so profoundly transformed US public opinion across so many dimensions as the 9/11 attacks."</p>

</div>

<p>The 9/11 attacks resulted in changes to the federal government and an expansion of executive power. A new cabinet department, the Department of Homeland Security, was created, and the intelligence community was consolidated under the Director of National Intelligence to improve coordination between various agencies and departments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New legislation, such as the US Patriot Act expanded domestic security and surveillance, disrupted terrorist funding by cracking down on activities such as money laundering, and increased efficiency within the U.S. intelligence community.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan alone, over 2,000 US soldiers died in 20 years of war out of 176,000 casualties, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/" rel="no follow, no index">Watson Institute's</a> study. The report states that 940,000 people were killed directly in the violent post-9/11 attack wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Post-9/11, approximately 38 million people have been displaced, making them refugees as a result of the wars the US fought on terror since 2001. The Watson Institute said, "This exceeds those displaced by every war since 1900, except World War II."</p>

<p>In 2022, Al Qaeda Chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, one of the world's most wanted terrorists and a mastermind of the September 11 attacks, was killed in a drone strike carried out by the US in the Afghan capital Kabul.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the 2020 Doha deal, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launchpad for terrorism, but experts believe the group never broke their ties with Al-Qaeda. Zawahiri had been on the run for 20 years since the 9/11 attacks. He took over Al-Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American voters broadly agree that Vice President Kamala Harris outperformed Donald Trump during Tuesday's presidential debate, according to a CNN poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS, an independent research firm.</p>

<p>Viewers of the debate voted in favour of Harris, 63% to 37%, saying she performed better. Prior to the debate, a poll by The New York Times and Siena College had shown both candidates were neck-and-neck in the race. Afterward, 96% of Harris supporters who watched the debate said that their candidate had done a better job, while only 69% of Trump supporters said he did better.</p>

<p>The Democrat candidate is said to have baited her opponent into angry responses on issues ranging from abortion to foreign policy. Mr Trump said afterwards that this was his "best debate", contrary to what the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/election-poll-trump-harris-debate/index.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">flash polls</a> have shown. Ms Harris' campaign has challenged him for a second debate in October.</p>

<p>This marks a major shift from June's debate when President Joe Biden was in the running. Back then, polls indicated, 67% to 33%, that Mr Trump outperformed his rival.</p>

<p>However, these polls only represent the views of the debate watching public and not the overall views of the full voting public.</p>

<p>Post the debate, the 59-year-old vice president also earned the endorsement of pop star Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>Viewers of the debate were closely divided over which candidate understands their problems better, with 44% saying Ms Harris does and 40% voting for Mr Trump. On the other hand, debate watchers also gave Mr Trump a 23-point advantage over who they think will handle immigration and the role of commander-in-chief better. They gave Ms Harris a 9-point edge on protecting democracy and abortion rights, the flash poll showed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Taylor Swift, a self-declared "childless cat lady" and one of the world's most popular and influential stars, has endorsed Kamala Harris for president of the United States.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift, a self-declared "childless cat lady" and one of the world's most popular and influential stars, has endorsed Kamala Harris for president of the United States.</p>

<p>Swift broke her silence Tuesday, voicing support for Harris over Donald Trump, and calling the Democratic candidate a "steady-handed, gifted leader."</p>

<p>"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election," she wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>The post landed in the minutes following the televised presidential debate that saw the two candidates face off for the first time, which the singer said she tuned in to.</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Swift said.</p>

<p>"I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos."</p>

<p>She signed off her Instagram post by dubbing herself a "childless cat lady," a swipe at a much-mocked sentiment expressed by Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, which he had wielded in a bid to insult Democratic women.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Trump criticised Swift for the endorsement in an appearance on Fox News.</p>

<p>"I was not a Taylor Swift fan... she's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Conjured up fears'</strong></p>

<p>Until Tuesday, Swift had been conspicuously quiet on the 2024 race, even as many of her fans began organizing under the banner "Swifties for Kamala."</p>

<p>But the 34-year-old said discovering AI-generated images of her falsely endorsing Trump -- which "conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation," she said -- had inspired her to speak up.</p>

<p>"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter," she said.</p>

<p>"The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth."</p>

<p>She encouraged her legions of loyal fans to "do your research."</p>

<p>Swift, fresh off the European leg of her blockbuster "Eras" tour, balked at explicitly telling her ardent supporters to vote Harris, instead saying "I've done my research, and I've made my choice."</p>

<p>"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make."</p>

<p>She also shared the post to her Instagram "stories" with a voter registration link.</p>

<p>The artist voiced special support for Harris's running mate Walz, praising the Minnesota governor for "standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades."</p>

<p>Team Harris has been quick to latch on to any boost she can get from the pop world, which generally skews left, and a number of stars have publicly backed her.</p>

<p>Beyonce has not outright endorsed the Democrat but she allowed the Harris camp to use her song "Freedom" in advertisements and on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>And British artist Charli XCX saw her smash album "brat" become core to the early Harris campaign, as the Democrats vie to stay on social media's pulse.</p>

<p><strong>'With love and hope'</strong></p>

<p>A global celebrity with hundreds of millions of loyal fans, Swift's influence is vast and her approval coveted.</p>

<p>For years the "Blank Space" singer stayed out of politics, including in 2016 when Trump won the presidency.</p>

<p>Speculation abounded that she was a closet Republican until 2018, when she endorsed the Democratic opponent of far-right politician Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.</p>

<p>Blackburn won anyway, but it ushered in a new chapter for Swift.</p>

<p>She later explained that handlers had urged her against voicing political opinions, telling her it could damage her career -- particularly in the country music industry, which is often associated with conservatism.</p>

<p>Since then, Swift endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and has conveyed pro-LGBTQ messages through her songs and music videos.</p>

<p>She also condemned the Supreme Court's reversal of the federal right to abortion, and has encouraged her fans to register to vote.</p>

<p>Speaking out on her own terms gripped the news cycle within seconds on Tuesday night, and her post notched more than two million "likes" after just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>"With love and hope, Taylor Swift," she concluded her message.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the first debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday, a new topic of discussion emerged on social media. Several users on X focused on Harris's unique earrings,&nbsp;sparking speculation about their purpose. Many X users, particularly Trump's supporters, claimed that the earrings might be earphones, implying they could have been used to receive assistance during the debate.&nbsp;These earrings, which&nbsp;resemble Nova H1 audio earrings, are designed to appear as stylish accessories while functioning as wireless earphones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''It appears Kamala Harris was being coached by using earphones embedded in her earrings during the ABC presidential debate against President Trump,” one user wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another person commented, ''I think Kamala did a great job tonight in the debate against Trump, who I think is a great orator and debater himself. But her earrings intrigued me a lot. Maybe because I got reminded of similar-looking ones from some tech article on an earphone that looks like earrings.''</p>

<p>Meanwhile, others suggested that the earrings worn by Kamala Harris might be Tiffany HardWear pearl earrings, pointing out subtle design distinctions that differentiate them from the Nova H1 audio earrings. One user shared a picture of Tiffany earrings which were identical to the ones Harris wore.&nbsp;They retail for over USD 3,300 but are no longer sold on Tiffany's website.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Some also noted that the vice president often wears pearls as a nod to her affiliation with Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Additionally, photos of her wearing similar pearl earrings at various public events suggest that this style may be a personal fashion preference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite social media buzz, there is no credible evidence to suggest that Harris used earphones to receive assistance during the debate.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-are-the-nova-h1-earrings"><strong>What are the Nova H1 earrings?</strong></h2>

<p>The Nova H1 Audio Earrings, as described on <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nova-audioearrings/audio-earrings-earphones-made-earrings">Kickstarter</a></em>, are an innovative wearable device that combines traditional pearl earring design with advanced audio technology. These clip-on earphones feature Bluetooth&nbsp;connectivity, built-in microphones, discreet music listening and digital assistant access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''NOVA H1 Audio Earrings—the first and only wireless earphones embedded in a pair of pearl earrings,'' the product description reads.</p>

<p>According to the startup's Kickstarter page, the earrings "are placed on the earlobes and project the sound from inside the pearl straight into your ear canal." It adds that "two tiny high-end microphones are integrated into each Earring providing the user with crystal clear phone calls and wind-noise cancellation."</p>

<p>At present, the companies involved have not issued an official statement or response to these claims.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A recent incident at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, where a visitor dropped a half-empty bag of Cheetos, highlights the damaging effects of littering on fragile ecosystems.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's a known fact that single-use plastic waste people leave behind after outdoor events and activities has a detrimental effect on the environment. No matter if it is a plain, a riverside, a desert, or a hilltop, it seems travellers have left behind plastic waste in all natural locations. Littering is emerging as a huge problem that is threatening these locations for their fragile ecology and aesthetic value.</p>

<p>Last week at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, in United States, one visitor tossed away an open bag of Cheetos. It served as a snack for the mould of the cave. One of the most visited places in New Mexico, the cave in the park welcomed almost 400,000 visitors last year.</p>

<p>In response, park rangers painstakingly removed mould and microbial growth along the path leading to the cave, which is biggest cave chamber by volume in North America-for 20 minutes. And all this was because of the bag of Cheetos dropped by the careless visitor.</p>

<p>The National Park's social media account now shared a statement regarding the incident, explaining that we affect the world around us in subtle ways, whether it be purposeful or not.</p>

<p>The post reads, "To the owner of the snack bag, the impact is likely incidental. But to the ecosystem of the cave, it had a huge impact."</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="737" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCarlsbadCavernsNPS%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02gVZQZQfmnJ3RzfcGD1z1tkJwgTzJZh3xh6XRMYfmv47mN6rzM66G41WcjHUWdEmil&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>"The processed corn, softened by the humidity of the cave, formed the perfect environment to host microbial life and fungi. Cave crickets, mites, spiders, and flies soon organise into a temporary food web, dispersing the nutrients to the surrounding caves and formations. Moulds spread higher up the nearby surfaces, fruit, die, and stink. And the cycle continues."</p>

<p>"Rangers spent twenty minutes carefully removing the foreign debris and moulds from the cave surfaces. Some members of this fleeting ecosystem are cave dwellers, but many of the microbial life and moulds are not. At the scale of human perspective, a spilt snack bag may seem trivial, but to the life of the cave, it can be world-changing. Great or small, we all leave an impact wherever we go. Let us all leave the world a better place than we found it."</p>

<p>This eye-opening incident is a reminder that our reliance on convenience comes at a significant cost to the planet, and mindful travel is more important than ever.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The procedure involved extracting 23 teeth and inserting 12 implants in a single day using the "immediate restoration" method.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent case in eastern China has raised concerns about dental procedure safety. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3277773/china-father-dies-heart-attack-after-having-23-teeth-extracted-12-implants-placed-1-day" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em>, a man surnamed Huang, underwent an extensive dental procedure on August 14 at Yongkang Deway Dental Hospital in Jinhua, Zhejiang province. The procedure involved extracting 23 teeth and inserting 12 implants in a single day using the "immediate restoration" method.&nbsp;Two weeks later, he suffered a sudden heart attack and died on August 28. The case was brought to light through an online post by his daughter Shu on September 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huang revealed that her father, whose age has not been disclosed, experienced persistent pain following the treatment. ''I never thought my dad would pass so quickly. He did not even get the chance to drive the new car we bought him,'' stated his daughter.</p>

<p>In response to the incident, an official from the Yongkang Municipal Health Bureau stated on September 3 that the cause of death is still being investigated, citing the 13-day gap between the dental procedure and the man's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Three days later, a&nbsp;clinic staff member told <em>SCMP</em> ''We will not be responding to this matter now as it has been handed over to our lawyer. If there are any updates, we will issue a statement; however, the investigation is ongoing.''</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">According to Xiang Guolin, director of the Dental Medicine Centre at the Hospital of Universal Love in Wuhan, there are no established official guidelines for the maximum number of teeth that can be extracted in a single procedure. However, in general practice, the limit is typically considered to be around 10 teeth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Extracting 23 teeth is quite a lot. It requires a clinic and dentist with sufficient qualifications and experience. It's also essential to consider the patient's physical capacity to handle such an extensive procedure,'' he said.</p>

<p>Many social media users expressed shock and disbelief upon learning about the case. One person questioned the decision to extract 23 teeth in a single day, sharing their own experience of being refused by a dentist when requesting the removal of two wisdom teeth simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another user wrote, ''I'm a dentist, and I never extract more than three teeth at one time unless they're very loose. The doctor must have lost his mind. It sounds more like a human experiment than a dental procedure.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two employees in China were terminated from their jobs after they were caught having an extramarital affair and kissing each other openly at work. The employees have now filed a lawsuit against their former employer, alleging wrongful termination. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3277304/china-colleagues-both-married-others-fired-kissing-office-sue-company">South China Morning Post,</a></em> the man, known as Liu, and the woman, identified as Chen, were both employed in the same department of a pharmaceutical company in Sichuan province, southwestern China.&nbsp;Their relationship became public knowledge after Liu's wife shared their chat records with the company's chat group and management in March 2020.</p>

<p>The records included messages such as “I love you” and “I want to look at you all the time.'' Following this, Liu requested leave to address personal matters, and Chen's husband confronted the couple at the workplace. Despite warnings, the romantic relationship between Liu and Chen continued, and they were again seen kissing at work.</p>

<p>In October 2020, a coworker confronted Chen about the behaviour, leading to a disagreement. The incident prompted seven colleagues to submit a joint letter to the general manager, expressing concerns about the situation. As a result, the company terminated Liu and Chen's employment, citing violations of the employee handbook and company rules.</p>

<p>Liu and Chen have each filed separate lawsuits against their former employer. Chen is seeking compensation of 26,000 yuan (approximately Rs 3 lakh), while Liu, who held a more senior position, is seeking over 230,000 yuan (approximately Rs 27 lakh) in damages.</p>

<p>The company defended its decision to terminate their employment, referencing its employee handbook, which permits termination for behaviour deemed unethical. The&nbsp;handbook clearly states it has ''the right to break the labour relationship with employees who are morally corrupt, tarnish the company's reputation and have a negative influence on the company.''</p>

<p>The court ultimately ruled in favour of the company, dismissing the lawsuits filed by Liu and Chen.</p>

<p>On social media, the incident has generated widespread discussion, with many users criticising the employees' behavior. One user wrote, ''Obviously they did not work hard enough if they had the energy to find colleagues attractive.'</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Another commented, ''Shame on them to even sue the company.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a dramatic moment, a Carnival cruise ship made contact with a chunk of ice in Alaska's Tracy Arm Fjord last Thursday but emerged unscathed. Despite one passenger likening the incident to a "Titanic moment," a thorough inspection of the hull revealed no damage, according to a statement from Carnival Cruise Line. ''The ship was struck with an errant piece of drifting ice last Thursday while sailing in Tracy Arm Fjord, Alaska,'' the company operating the cruise said in a statement to&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/social-media-users-get-dramatic-carnival-cruise-ship-hits-ice-alaska-titanic-moment"><em>Fox Business</em>.</a></p>

<p>The Carnival Spirit sustained no damage after striking ice in Alaska and completed its 7-day voyage as scheduled, without any delays. Carnival said, "The vessel&nbsp;continued on its cruise and there has been no impact to operations."&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the incident drew a dramatic comparison to the Titanic moment from one passenger.&nbsp;"If we die, it was damn well worth it. It's a Titanic moment," passenger Cassandra Goskie said in a video she posted in a private Carnival VIFP Club Members Facebook group. In the video, she is heard saying, ''Oh, we are hitting it,'' as the ship makes contact with the ice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another passenger shared pictures on X and wrote, ''From April Futrell “Good evening James! We are on the carnival spirit and hit an iceberg just outside of Sitka and Tracy arm fjord! Here's some pictures! We are safe and after assessing for damage we are back on track headed to Skagway!''</p>

<p>One image captures a tugboat trailing behind the Carnival Spirit as it navigates through icy waters, gliding smoothly over the partially submerged ice.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A planet relatively close to Earth could be the first ever detected with a potentially life-sustaining liquid ocean outside our Solar System, according to scientists using the James Webb space telescope.</p>

<p>More than 5,000 planets have been discovered outside of the Solar System so far, but only a handful are in what is called the "Goldilocks zone" -- neither too hot or too cold -- that could host liquid water, a key ingredient for life.</p>

<p>The exoplanet LHS 1140 b is one of the few in this habitable zone, and has been thoroughly scrutinised since it was first discovered in 2017.</p>

<p>It sits 48 light years from Earth, which equates to more than 450 trillion kilometres (280 trillion miles) -- relatively close in the vast distances of space.</p>

<p>The exoplanet had been thought to be a small gas giant called a "mini-Neptune" with an atmosphere too thick with hydrogen and helium to support alien life.</p>

<p>However, new observations from the Webb telescope have confirmed that the exoplanet is in fact a rocky "super-Earth".</p>

<p>It is 1.7 times bigger than Earth, but has 5.6 times its mass, according to a study published late Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<p><strong>'Best bet' for ocean world</strong></p>

<p>The Webb telescope was able to analyse the planet's atmosphere as it passed in front of its star.</p>

<p>There were no signs of hydrogen or helium, which ruled out that the planet was a mini-Neptune.</p>

<p>The density of the planet indicates that it "actually has large quantities of water," study co-author Martin Turbet of France's CNRS scientific research centre told AFP.</p>

<p>It could be a truly immense amount of water.</p>

<p>All the water in Earth's oceans represent only 0.02 percent of its mass. But 10 to 20 percent of the exoplanet's mass was estimated to be water.</p>

<p>Whether or not this water is in liquid or ice form depends on the planet's atmosphere.</p>

<p>"We do not have direct evidence that it has an atmosphere, but several elements point in that direction," Turbet said.</p>

<p>Lead study author Charles Cadieux, a PhD student at the University of Montreal, said that "of all currently known temperate exoplanets, LHS 1140 b could well be our best bet to one day indirectly confirm liquid water on the surface of an alien world".</p>

<p>One positive is that the planet is gently warmed by its red dwarf star, which is one-fifth the size of the Sun.</p>

<p>The exoplanet's surface temperature should be fairly similar to that on Earth and Mars, Turbet said.</p>

<p>The presence of gasses such as carbon dioxide will play a key role in determining whether the planet is covered in ice or water.</p>

<p><strong>Bull's-eye ocean</strong></p>

<p>One possibility is that the surface is mostly ice, but there is a vast liquid ocean where the planet is most exposed to its star's heat.</p>

<p>This ocean could measure about 4,000 kilometres in diameter, around half the surface area of the Atlantic Ocean, modelling suggested.</p>

<p>Or the liquid water could be hidden under a thick shell of ice, like on the moons Ganymede, Enceladus or Europa orbiting around Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<p>Webb's instrument spotted signs that suggest "the presence of nitrogen," Cadieux said, adding that more research was needed to confirm the finding.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is found everywhere on Earth, and is thought to be another potentially ingredient for life.</p>

<p>The researchers are hoping to get a few more hours of the Webb's telescope's precious time to find out more about LHS 1140 b.</p>

<p>It will take at least a year to confirm whether the exoplanet has an atmosphere, and two or three more to detect the presence of carbon dioxide, the researchers estimated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The plane caught fire upon landing at Peshawar's Bacha Khan International Airport, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.</p>

<p>According to CAA spokesperson Saifullah, air traffic controllers witnessed smoke and sparks emanating from the left-hand side landing gear of the aircraft as it landed and alerted the pilots.</p>

<p>India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war is well-established: it advocates for a cessation of hostilities and prefers dialogue over conflict, a position consistently articulated in international forums. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow, his camaraderie with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the pledge to enhance bilateral trade and defence cooperation signify a strategic shift in stance.</p>

<p>The visit aims to send a strong message to India's Western allies that while navigating complex global issues, India remains committed to safeguarding its national interests. After all, India's Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) saved over $10 billion from April 2022 to May 2024, largely due to Russian crude imports, as per an analysis by the Indian Express. Additionally, it underscores India's enduring friendship with Russia amidst geopolitical dynamics, including a pointed message to China.</p>

<p>PM Modi has demonstrated adeptness in making bold foreign policy moves, exemplified by strong ties fostered with Gulf countries during his tenure. While India values its friendships with the US and other Western nations, it is steering its own course to protect its national interests. This is a trajectory which is set to accelerate in Modi's third term. The agreement to establish Indo-Russian joint ventures for defence production and facilitating military exports to mutually agreed friendly nations exemplifies this forward-looking approach.</p>

<p>Following his Russian trip, Modi's subsequent visit to Austria marks India's Prime Minister's first official trip since 1983, illustrating a pattern of seeking new allies. This trend has been evident since Modi took office a decade ago.</p>

<p>Modi's third term is distinct in its recent foreign policy decisions. From inviting all neighbouring countries except China and Pakistan to his swearing-in ceremony, to strategic engagements at the G-7 summit in Italy, and now visits to Russia and Austria, Modi is making significant statements on the global stage. Foreign policy remains a cornerstone of Modi 3.0's agenda.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fire broke out Thursday in the spire of the cathedral in northern French city Rouen, its mayor said, sharing a photo of a column of smoke rising from the Gothic landmark.</p>

<p>The fire's "origin is unknown at this point," mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol posted on X, adding that "all public resources are mobilised" to fight the fire.</p>

<p>Local fire service SDIS76 said the alarm was raised around midday (1000 GMT) and that 33 vehicles and 63 firefighters were on the scene.</p>

<p>"Fire broke out at the tip of the spire, which isn't made of wood, but rather metal," the prefecture of the Seine-Maritime department told AFP.</p>

<p>The monument is "currently undergoing restoration work," it added.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear whether the wood frame of the spire was ablaze.</p>

<p>Fire in the wooden frame of the roof was behind the massive 2019 damage to the world-famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, where repairs are only now nearing completion.</p>

<p>The Our Lady of the Assumption cathedral has been evacuated and a security perimeter set up, the prefecture said.</p>

<p>People should "stay away to give space for emergency responders to work," it added.</p>

<p>Construction began on Rouen's cathedral in the 12th Century, according to its website, with work lasting several centuries until it achieved its present form.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Villagers in Vaideeni at the foot of Romania's Carpathian mountains are fuming at French luxury brand Louis Vuitton for "stealing" the design of their traditional blouse.</p>

<p>Maria Gioanca, 69, one of two dozen women who still hand sew the black-and-white garment in the village, told AFP she "won't let the costume be stolen" for fancy beach wear.</p>

<p>Calls for luxury brands to acknowledge the inspirations of their designs have grown in recent years, as the fashion industry has been faced with accusations of cultural appropriation and exploiting the heritage of minority groups.</p>

<p>In Romania, the activist group La Blouse Roumaine (The Romanian Blouse) has been asking brands since 2017 to come clean and "credit" the places of origin when their clothes are similar to or inspired by Romanian folk costumes.</p>

<p>Dedicated to promoting the traditional "ie" blouse -- known to have inspired fashion designers like Yves Saint-Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Kenzo -- their complaints have yielded mixed results.</p>

<h3><strong>'Violating cultural rights'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In Vaideeni, many of the seamstresses had not heard of Louis Vuitton, but noticed the similarity to their traditional "ie" blouses right away when they saw a photo of the French brand's white linen blouse embroidered with black motifs for their new "LV by the Pool" collection.</p>

<p>"Why mock our stuff?" said Ioana Staniloiu, 76, scoffing at the blouse created by star designer Nicolas Ghesquiere and advertised on the Louis Vuitton website as "airy" and having "a fresh, bohemian look".</p>

<p>"Next to our blouse, it's ugly," she said.</p>

<p>Accusing the French company of "violating the cultural rights of the communities", La Blouse Roumaine founder Andreea Tanasescu said people felt offended that a blouse traditionally worn on special occasions is used as beach wear.</p>

<p>"You have to be very careful... It's better you go and talk to the community, spend time there," the former casting director, 49, told AFP, adding fashion could help "protect and promote cultural heritage" if there was an exchange.</p>

<p>Romania's culture minister asked the company last month to acknowledge the heritage.</p>

<p>Louis Vuitton declined to comment when contacted by AFP, but confirmed media reports that it apologised to Romania and stopped selling the blouse.</p>

<p>It no longer appears on the brand's website, and 20 as-yet unsold blouses have been put aside, according to reports.</p>

<h3><strong>'Scared' for future&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In the past, La Blouse Roumaine convinced US designer Tory Burch to change the description of a coat crediting its Romanian inspiration. They didn't get any reply from Dior in a similar case.</p>

<p>Romanian traditional clothes and textiles have "an exceptional, special aesthetic", according to textile specialist Florica Zaharia, pointing at the blouse's "discretion and elegance".</p>

<p>"There is a beauty that we cannot ignore," said Zaharia, who opened the first textiles museum in Romania in 2018 after almost 30 years working at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>

<p>But critics say these controversies don't end up helping communities to save their dying crafts.</p>

<p>It's like "airing dirty laundry in public", Romanian Peasant Museum curator Horatiu Ilea said, adding "the only thing" that could help is for young people to learn the crafts.</p>

<p>While the making of the Romanian blouse was added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage in 2022, there is no patent on it, and there are different styles even among the same group of seamstresses.</p>

<p>In Vaideeni, some women have recently taken up the craft they learned from their elders, but it is far from easy.</p>

<p>It takes at least a month to sew a blouse selling for around 300 to 400 euros ($320-$430), and they don't exactly sell like hotcakes.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit scared (about the future), but we won't give up here," said Staniloiu, whose daughter and four granddaughters have all left the village to look for work elsewhere.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Revelations that cooking oil has been transported in containers also used to carry fuel have sparked outrage in China, the latest scandal in a country where fears about food safety are widespread.</p>

<p>Local state-backed outlet the Beijing News last week published an investigation into what it called an "open secret" in the transportation industry.</p>

<p>The outlet found that several tanker trucks had transported edible cooking oil immediately after unloading coal oil, with no cleaning process in between journeys.</p>

<p>Truck drivers told the newspaper the practice helped to cut costs in the face of increasing competition.</p>

<p>The outlet also quoted food science expert Zhu Yi as saying that long-term consumption of coal oil, which consists mainly of hydrocarbons, could lead to poisoning.</p>

<p>Authorities have vowed to crack down, with the central government announcing Tuesday that it would launch an investigation.</p>

<p>Beijing has in recent years pledged to do much more to tighten food safety regulations and strengthen public trust.</p>

<p>The Chinese public is no stranger to scandals around food safety.</p>

<p>Milk adulterated with the chemical melamine killed six infants and poisoned hundreds of thousands of children in 2008.</p>

<p>In 2022, Chinese pork-processing giant Henan Shuanghui apologised after unhygienic work practices such as packaging meat that had dropped on the floor and workers wearing dirty uniforms were exposed.</p>

<p>And last year, top beermaker Tsingtao opened an investigation after a video that appeared to show a factory employee urinating on raw ingredients went viral.</p>

<p>Social media users expressed outrage at the latest contamination scandal.</p>

<p>"After reading these issues that have been exposed, I am not shocked at all!" said one user on the X-like social media platform Weibo.</p>

<p>"From melamine to drinking kerosene, what have we not experienced?"</p>

<p>Another user said they hoped for a "quick" investigation and a "clear explanation" from authorities.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, I really don't know what oil to buy," they wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you tried manifesting? It's hard to escape on social media – the idea that you can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/edth.12653">will what you desire</a> into reality through the power of belief. This could be financial success, romantic love or sporting glory.</p>

<p>Singer Dua Lipa, who headlined Glastonbury festival in June 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwo9IoXVZ-4">has said that</a> performing on Friday night at the festival was “on her dream board”. “If you're manifesting out there, be specific – because it might happen!”</p>

<p>Manifesting gained popularity quickly during the pandemic. By 2021, <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a38802302/how-to-manifest/">the 3-6-9 manifestation method</a> was famous. A TikTok viewed <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wtffffkenzie/video/7280676541657320746?lang=en">over a million times</a>, for instance, explains this “no fail manifesting technique”. You write down what you want three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon and nine times before you go to bed and repeating until it comes true. Now, content creators are explaining countless methods to speak your dreams into reality.</p>

<p>But the idea that if you wish for something hard enough it will happen isn't new. It grew out of the self-help movement. Some early popular books that peddled this idea include Napoleon Hill's <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/think-and-grow-rich/napoleon-hill/9781785042416">Think and Grow Rich</a> from as long ago as 1937, and Louise Hay's <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/you-can-heal-your-life/louise-hay/9780937611012">You Can Heal Your Life</a> from 1984.</p>

<p>The trend really took off with Rhonda Byrne's <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/The-Secret/Rhonda-Byrne/The-Secret-Library/9781847370297">The Secret</a>, a book published in 2006 which claims you can bring about whatever you desire through the power of manifestation. It has sold more than 35 million copies and boasts many celebrity fans. Drawing upon the “law of attraction”, Byrne proclaims: “Your whole life is a manifestation of the thoughts that go on in your head.”</p>

<h2>Manifesting as an intellectual vice</h2>

<p>But there is a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/edth.12653">dark side</a> to manifesting. Popular trends such as the 3-6-9 manifestation method promote obsessive and compulsive behavioural patterns, and they also encourage flawed thinking habits and faulty reasoning.</p>

<p>Manifesting is a form of wishful thinking, and wishful thinking leads to false conclusions, often through the inaccurate weighing of evidence. The wishful thinker overinflates their optimism about the likelihood of a preferred outcome. In philosophical terms, this kind of thinking is called an <a href="https://archive.philosophersmag.com/intellectual-vices/">“intellectual vice”</a>: it blocks a rational person's attainment of knowledge.</p>

<p>Manifesting urges people to dream big and imagine in detail everything they desire. This sets people's expectations unnaturally high, setting them up for failure and disappointment. It's arguably a form of <a href="https://theconversation.com/lucky-girl-syndrome-the-potential-dark-side-of-tiktoks-extreme-positive-thinking-trend-198439">toxic positivity</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe your own thoughts have the power to create reality, you may end up downplaying or ignoring practical actions and the efforts of others. You might manifest by saying: “I attract positive things to me”. But in doing so, you may not notice or credit the role of luck, chance, privilege and circumstance in explaining why some things happen and others do not.</p>

<h2>Logical errors</h2>

<p>Manifesting leads to logical errors. Someone who practices manifesting – and who finds that something they manifested comes true – is likely to attribute these desired outcomes to their prior hoping or wishing. But this does not mean hoping was the cause of the outcome. Just because one came before the other does not mean it was the cause: correlation does not imply causation.</p>

<p>If you believe the power of wishing for something results in what you want coming true, you will disproportionately attribute your mental activity with causal efficacy over other causes.</p>

<p>For instance, if you study hard for an exam and achieve a good grade, you might end up attributing this outcome to the daily mantra or repeated affirmations you said leading up to the test, rather than crediting the effort you put into studying. For your next test, you might keep on manifesting, but study less.</p>

<p>And when a hoped-for outcome does not occur, you might find yourself accounting for it in positive or fatalistic terms: the universe has something better planned. The negative outcome becomes additional evidence that you should still think positively, and so you won't change your approach.</p>

<p>While it may seem initially appealing, manifesting may also encourage victim blaming: that if someone had thought more positively, an outcome would have been different. It also fails to encourage people to make backup plans, leaving them vulnerable to luck and circumstance.</p>

<p>Manifesting is very self-involved. The wants of the manifester are central to their focus and the use of their mental energy and time.</p>

<p>If you rely solely on mental power to achieve your desires, you will not succeed. Try to consider the various factors that support and resist your goals. Finally, remember that sometimes the thoughts we think are imaginative, fictive, fanciful or fantastic. It is enriching and positive that in many cases, our thoughts do not come true.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is working on a joint project with the US' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to send an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/exclusive-fashion-technologists-explain-indian-astronauts-uniform-design-5205122" target="_blank">Indian astronaut</a> to space. Of the four astronauts that India had chosen, two will be sent to NASA for training, and one of them will be selected for the space mission, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-nasa-to-train-2-indian-astronauts-send-one-of-them-to-space-isro-chief-s-somanath-to-ndtv-5997637" target="_blank">ISRO chief Dr S Somanath told NDTV</a> last month.</p>

<p>The two space agencies have also collaborated for NISAR (NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar), a joint Earth-observation mission.</p>

<p>"India and the US have had much success working together to explore the stars. And our future together could not be brighter," Sunita Williams said in her video message to the US embassy in Delhi on America's Independence Day from the ISS, which orbits some 400 kilometers above Earth.</p>

<p>"NASA and the ISRO continue to work toward the launch of NISAR, which will launch from India this year to measure changes in our planet's surface," she said.</p>

<p>"After returning to Earth, we look forward to meeting Indian astronauts training at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Our partnership with India and the countries around the world will help expand humanity's reach for the sky," Williams added.</p>

<p>She was joined by her fellow astronauts Tracy C Dyson and Jeanette J Epps.</p>

<h3><strong>NASA To Train 2 Indians, Send One Of Them To Space</strong></h3>

<p>The ISRO's work to send an astronaut to space in a joint project with NASA is going on as scheduled, the Indian space agency's chief Dr S Somanath told NDTV in an exclusive interview on June 29.</p>

<p>Of the four astronauts that India had chosen, two will be sent to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for training, and one of them will be selected for the space mission, he said.</p>

<p>"Similarly, the other two will also get training of a different kind... So all four of them will go through certain levels of training through this programme. Many engineers will also be trained by NASA to handle other aspects of space flight," Dr Somanath said.</p>

<p>He said the ISRO's eventual goal is human space flight, and the learnings from the whole programme with NASA will feed into the Indian space agency's experience in finally sending humans to space.</p>

<p>"When we get the capability, if a head of state wants to fly to space, for example, it must be on our vehicle, from our land. I will wait for our Gaganyaan to be ready, to be proven, to be qualified to do that," the ISRO chief told NDTV when asked whether key leaders would be eligible to fly to space in the far future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian father faced triple murder charges Thursday, accused of setting his home ablaze and locking the door with his seven children and their mother inside.</p>

<p>Three of the children -- two boys aged two and six and a five-month-old baby girl -- died in the weekend blaze in western Sydney's Lalor Park, police said.</p>

<p>The four other young children are in a stable condition in hospital and their 29-year-old mother has been released after treatment, police added.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old father, who is in hospital under police guard after emerging from an induced coma, was refused bail in a Sydney court on three counts of murder and five of attempted murder, court documents showed.</p>

<p>"Police will allege this man is solely responsible for setting fires inside the premises," New South Wales detective superintendent Daniel Doherty told a news conference after the court hearing.</p>

<p>An accelerant had whipped up "a large amount of fire and smoke" in the home and the doors "had been locked" to prevent the family escaping, he said.</p>

<p>A neighbour "very courageously" forced his way inside, rescuing two boys aged four and seven and a nine-year-old girl, as well as the mother, Doherty said.</p>

<p>But the father allegedly prevented the neighbour from saving an 11-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Police then arrived, however, and "had to wrestle with this man and wrestle the boy from his grasp because he was holding on to him, allegedly, and the boy was then rescued", the detective said.</p>

<p>A domestic dispute may have led to the "horrendous murderous act", Doherty said.</p>

<p>Most of the children were the accused man's biological children but in any case "they are his family, they are his kids", he said.</p>

<p>"It's not something that I will forget about very quickly."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden will Thursday give his first press conference since his debate disaster against Donald Trump, in a pressure-cooker moment that could seal the fate of his reelection bid.</p>

<p>The eyes of the world will be on the 81-year-old at a NATO summit as he tries to calm growing calls from his Democratic party to step aside over his age and health.</p>

<p>The White House has dubbed it a "big boy" press conference, and Biden will be under severe pressure to show he can handle what has become a rare unscripted moment in his presidency.</p>

<p>Any missteps by Biden at the 5.30 pm (2130 GMT) event at a Washington DC conference centre could turn the trickle of Democrats who have so far urged him to abandon his 2024 election bid into a flood.</p>

<p>The walls closed in further on Wednesday when Hollywood actor and supporter George Clooney called on Biden not to stand, just weeks after holding a glitzy fundraiser for the president.</p>

<p>Party heavyweight and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi also subtly twisted the knife by stopping short of backing Biden, saying only that he should make a decision after the NATO summit.</p>

<p>The first Democratic senator, Peter Welch of Vermont, meanwhile joined at least eight House Democrats in openly urging the man who beat Trump in 2020 not to stand again.</p>

<p>But many Democrats are believed to be waiting to see if Biden pulls off his first solo press conference since November 2023, or whether it will be a repeat of the debate.</p>

<p>Biden has given fewer news conferences than his predecessors. His recent appearances have been joint appearances with foreign leaders restricted to two questions each.</p>

<p>Coupled with a lack of interviews, it has led critics to accuse the White House of shielding the effects of age on America's oldest president from the public.</p>

<h3><strong>'Devastating'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has repeatedly promised Thursday's "big boy press conference" -- a phrase first used by a journalist that she has since adopted -- will feature multiple questions.</p>

<p>A poor performance will pour fuel on the flames of the concerns about Biden's age and health that were sparked when he appeared listless and often incoherent against Republican Trump, 78.</p>

<p>NATO allies have also been seeking reassurance about Biden's leadership abilities, and over fears that a return of the isolationist Trump could spell trouble for the alliance.</p>

<p>Biden has blamed his debate meltdown on a bad cold and jet lag after two weeks of gruelling foreign travel.</p>

<p>But Clooney said in a coruscating New York Times piece on Wednesday that the signs were already there at a June 15 fundraiser in Los Angeles that he co-hosted with actor Julia Roberts.</p>

<p>"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010," wrote Clooney.</p>

<p>"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate."</p>

<p>Clooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>Biden has insisted that he is committed to running in November, and with the Democratic party primary votes under his belt there is no real way of forcing him out.</p>

<p>But the New York Times reported on Wednesday that some Democratic grandees like Pelosi are trying a different tack -- appealing to his rational side rather than inflaming the stubbornness that has driven his political career.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is widely seen to be the frontrunner to replace Biden if he steps aside, but any move would have to be before the Democratic convention in Chicago in August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China is staging army drills with Belarus this week at NATO's eastern border, in a sign of escalating tensions between Beijing and the US-led defence alliance.</p>

<p>The joint "antiterrorist" exercises on Russian ally Belarus's soil near the Polish border come as NATO leaders gather for a summit in Washington, with the war in nearby Ukraine high on their agenda.</p>

<p>With relations between NATO on the one hand and China and Russia on the other at a low ebb, analysts believe that Beijing wanted to send the alliance a warning message with the timing of the drills.</p>

<p>Sino-Belarusian exercises have taken place before, but this is the first time since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, a NATO ally, in February 2022.</p>

<p>The exercises began July 8 in Brest, a city right on the border with Poland, according to a statement issued on Wednesday by the Chinese defence ministry.</p>

<p>The statement said the manoeuvres will last until mid-July, but did not give the exact number of Chinese soldiers involved.</p>

<p>Both sides are working to "improve combat techniques and deepen cooperation and communication between the two armies", the statement added.</p>

<p>Chinese diplomatic officials insisted that the exercises were "not aimed at any country in particular".</p>

<p>But Poland's defence ministry slammed the timing of the exercises.</p>

<p>It warned of "the risk of the operations in question being used for disinformation and propaganda purposes... to coincide with the NATO summit".</p>

<p>However small in scale, the exercises still involve China deploying troops on NATO's doorstep, and to a country Russia used as a launchpad for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>And the exercises come as Beijing, one of Moscow's key partners is also experiencing increasingly tense relations with NATO.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategic signal&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Analysts believe that the date and location of the exercises were not chosen by chance, arguing that China wanted to send NATO a message.</p>

<p>"Multilateral exercises are often used to send political signals," Kelly Grieco of the Stimson Center foreign policy and defence think tank told AFP.</p>

<p>Indeed, she argues that when it comes to military drills, "it's much more about political signal more than for the exercise itself".</p>

<p>She points out that China had already carried out anti-terrorism exercises in Belarus four times between 2011 and 2018, but had not done so since.</p>

<p>That they are taking place "that close to the border is part of the signalling" too, she added.</p>

<p>Countries often organise their joint exercises to coincide with developments abroad -- not least of them China, added Alice Ekman, senior analyst for Asia at the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS).</p>

<p>"In April 2023, the Chinese held exercises with Russia in the East China Sea, close to Japanese islands, on the eve of a trilateral US-Japan-South Korea summit to signal their opposition to such a summit being held," Ekman told AFP.</p>

<p>Similarly, China staged military manoeuvres in the South China Sea in May 2024 as the US-Japan-Philippines-Australia meeting was in full swing, she added.</p>

<p>As well as moving closer to Russia, China is becoming increasingly hostile to NATO.</p>

<p>It accuses NATO of working to contain China at Washington's instigation, with Beijing worried about the alliance's expanding role in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Moreover, China has never forgiven the bombing of its embassy in Belgrade by a NATO plane in 1999.</p>

<p>It also believes that the alliance has already overstepped its geographical sphere of influence in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>NATO is perceived by China as "clearly hostile for historical reasons", Ekman said.</p>

<p>But those reasons were becoming "increasingly strategic as the threat from China becomes an integral part of the organisation's strategic thinking", she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tiny wires of Neuralink's brain chip implant used in the first participant in a trial run by Elon Musk's company have become "more or less very stable", a company executive said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The company had in May said that a number of tiny wires inside the brain of Noland Arbaugh, who is paralyzed from the shoulders down due to a 2016 diving accident, had pulled out of position.</p>

<p>"Once you do the brain surgery it takes some time for the tissues to come in and anchor the threads in place, and once that happens, everything has been stable," said Neuralink executive Dongjin "D.J." Seo.</p>

<p>So far, Arbaugh, based in Arizona, was the only patient to have received the implant, but Musk said he hopes to have participants in the high single digits this year.</p>

<p>The company is now taking risk mitigation measures such as skull sculpting and reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the blood to normal levels in patients, the company's executives said in a live stream on social media platform X.</p>

<p>"In upcoming implants, our plan is to sculpt the surface of the skull very intentionally to minimize the gap under the implant... that will put it closer to the brain and eliminate some of the tension on the threads," Matthew MacDougall, Neuralink's head of neurosurgery, said.</p>

<p>Neuralink is testing its implant to give paralyzed patients the ability to use digital devices by thinking alone. The device works by using tiny wires, which are thinner than a human hair, to capture signals from the brain and translating those into actions such as moving a mouse cursor on a computer screen.</p>

<p>Musk said during the livestream that the device doesn't harm the brain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in initially considering the device years ago, had raised safety concerns, but ultimately granted the company a green light last year to begin human trials.</p>

<p>So far, the device has allowed Arbaugh to play video games, browse the internet and move a cursor on his laptop by thinking alone, according to the company's blog posts and videos.</p>

<p>Neuralink is also working on a new device that it believes will require half the number of electrodes to be implanted in the brain to make it more efficient and powerful, the executives said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating after the pilots mentioned experiencing "multiple blown tyres."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video captured the dramatic scene of an American Airlines plane suffering a tyre blowout during takeoff. Smoke and flames were visible as the aircraft aborted takeoff. Thankfully, emergency vehicles quickly reached the scene on the runway.</p>

<p>American Airlines reported that flight 590 had a "mechanical problem" before leaving the ground. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating after the pilots mentioned experiencing "multiple blown tyres."</p>

<p>Most importantly, all 180 people on board (174 passengers and 6 crew members) disembarked safely and were transported back to the terminal. There were no injuries reported.</p>

<p>The passengers were re-accommodated on a replacement flight from Tampa. "We never want to disrupt our customers' travel plans and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused," the airline said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sources informed ABC that the fire seen in the video is a controlled occurrence designed to prevent further damage and a major explosion during a high-energy stop.</p>

<p>In a statement, FAA said, "American Airlines Flight 590 aborted its takeoff from Tampa International Airport around 7:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday, July 10, after the crew reported multiple blown tyres. Passengers deplaned on the taxiway and were bused to the terminal. The flight was headed to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The FAA will investigate. Please contact the airline for additional information."</p>

<p>"American Airlines flight 590 with service from Tampa (TPA) to Phoenix (PHX) experienced a mechanical issue on the runway prior to taking off. Customers safely deplaned and were bussed to the terminal. We never want to disrupt our customers' travel plans and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused," the airline also issued a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States was "cautiously optimistic" about Gaza ceasefire talks, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Wednesday, adding that gaps between the two sides could be narrowed.</p>

<h3><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></h3>

<p>"We are cautiously optimistic that things are moving in a good direction," Kirby said when asked if a ceasefire deal was close.</p>

<p>"There are still gaps remaining between the two sides. We believe those gaps can be narrowed, and that's what Brett McGurk and CIA Director Bill Burns are trying to do right now," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></h3>

<p>President Joe Biden in late May detailed a proposal of three phases aimed at achieving a ceasefire, the release of hostages in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and the rebuilding of the coastal enclave.</p>

<p>Burns and U.S. Middle East envoy McGurk are in the Middle East meeting with regional counterparts to discuss a ceasefire deal.</p>

<h3><strong>CONTEXT</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas has accepted a key part of a U.S. plan, dropping a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing the agreement.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the deal must not prevent Israel from resuming fighting until its war objectives are met. At the outset of the war, he pledged to annihilate Hamas.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told McGurk on Wednesday he was committed to securing a Gaza ceasefire deal provided Israel's red lines were respected, his office said.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when fighters led by Hamas, which controlled Gaza, attacked southern Israel. They killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry says that since then over 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the coastal enclave, which has displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pair of US astronauts stuck waiting to leave the International Space Station said Wednesday they were confident that the problem-plagued <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-boeings-starliner-can-bring-astronauts-back-to-earth-5969239">Boeing Starliner</a> they rode up on would soon bring them home, even as significant uncertainties remain.</p>

<p>Butch Wilmore and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-it-is-about-what-isro-chief-s-somanath-message-for-sunita-williams-said-5997341">Sunita Williams</a> blasted off on June 5 aboard the brand new spaceship that NASA is hoping to certify to ferry crews to-and-from the orbital outpost.</p>

<p>They docked the following day for what was meant to be roughly a week-long stay, but their return was pushed back because of thruster malfunctions and helium leaks that came to light during the journey.</p>

<p>No date has been set for the return, but <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronaut-sunita-williams-return-to-earth-delayed-again-what-nasa-said-5979727">NASA</a> officials said Wednesday they were eying "late July."</p>

<p>Asked during a live press call from the station whether they still had faith in the Starliner team and the spaceship, mission commander Wilmore replied: "We're absolutely confident."</p>

<p>"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem," added <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronaut-sunita-williams-may-have-to-wait-months-in-space-what-nasa-is-planning-now-5994474">Sunita Williams</a>.</p>

<p>She said they were continuing to enjoy their time aboard the ISS, performing tasks like changing out the pump on a machine that processes urine back into drinking water, and carrying out science experiments such as gene sequencing in the microgravity environment.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/737zWM5COQ0?si=I6fJCgxoF_L9guzF" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>They have also tested Starliner as a "safe haven" vehicle in case of problems aboard the ISS and checked out how its life support performs when four people are inside.</p>

<h3><strong>Lingering uncertainty</strong></h3>

<p>Before Wilmore and Williams can come home, however, engineering teams need to run more simulations of similar thrusters and helium seals on the ground, to better understand the root causes of some of the technical issues Starliner experienced -- and modify the way it will fly down, if necessary.</p>

<p>It was known there was one helium leak affecting the spaceship before the launch, but more leaks emerged during the flight. Helium, while non-combustible, provides pressure to the propulsion system.</p>

<p>What's more, some of Starliner's thrusters that provide fine maneuvering initially failed to kick in during its approach to the station, delaying docking.</p>

<p>Engineers are not sure why the craft's computer "deselected" these thrusters, though they were able to restart all but one of them.</p>

<p>In a subsequent press call, Boeing executive Mark Nappi told reporters that the "working theory" for the thruster malfunction was overheating due to excessive firing.</p>

<p>Theories on the cause of the helium leaks ranged from debris entering the propulsion system to Boeing possibly installing seals that were undersized for the task.</p>

<p>NASA and Boeing insist Starliner could fly home in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain thrusters that control orientation.</p>

<p>They have no concerns over any of the more powerful thrusters responsible for the "deorbit burn" that will bring the spaceship back.</p>

<p>But much remains unclear -- including whether the orientation control thrusters that malfunctioned have become degraded, which would make it necessary to rely on other thrusters during descent, NASA official Steve Stich said.</p>

<p>He insisted that NASA wasn't yet considering bringing Williams and Wilmore back on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, in what would amount to a major humiliation for the aerospace giant Boeing, whose reputation has taken a hit in recent years over the safety crisis affecting its commercial jets.</p>

<p>"The prime option today is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner," said Stich, while conceding that a return flight on a SpaceX spaceship can't be ruled out.</p>

<p>In 2014, both SpaceX and Boeing were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts by NASA to develop crewed spaceships after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program. SpaceX carried out a successful crewed test in 2020 and has flown dozens of people since.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This year, the US firm OpenAI released GPT-4o, which understands voice, text and image commands in several languages.</p>

<p>The generative gadget, along with others such as Google's Gemini, is part of a fast-growing field that experts say could make education, employment and everyday services more accessible.</p>

<p>Following the streets' tactile paving, Masahiro Fujimoto -- who goes by his online handle Mashiro -- used his stick adorned with a small monkey mascot to find his way from the station.</p>

<p>As he went, he spoke to GPT-4o like a friend, receiving its answers through an earpiece in one ear, leaving the other side free to listen out for cars.</p>

<p>Having asked for basic directions, he added: "In fact, I am blind, so could you give me further details for blind people?"</p>

<p>"Of course," the bot replied. "You might notice an increase in crowd noise and the sound of activities as you get closer."</p>

<p>The journey, 20 minutes for sighted people, took Mashiro around four times as long with several U-turns.</p>

<p>When it started to rain heavily, he requested help from his friend, who is partially sighted, to finish the journey.</p>

<p>"Arrival!" finally shouted Mashiro, who has microphthalmos and has been blind since birth, using only sound to demolish his opponents on "Street Fighter 6".</p>

<h3><strong>'Enormous potential'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>AI can cater to specific needs better than "one-size-fits-all" assistive products and technologies, said Youngjun Cho, an associate professor in computer science at University College London (UCL).</p>

<p>"Its potential is enormous," said Cho, who also works at UCL's Global Disability Innovation Hub.</p>

<p>"I envisage that this can empower many individuals and promote independence."</p>

<p>People with hearing loss can, for example, use AI speech-to-text transcription, while chatbots can help format a resume for someone with learning disabilities.</p>

<p>Some tools for visually impaired people, such as Seeing AI, Envision AI and TapTapSee, describe phone camera images.</p>

<p>Danish app Be My Eyes, where real-life volunteers help via live chat, is working with OpenAI to develop a "digital visual assistant".</p>

<p>But Masahide Ishiki, a Japanese expert in disability and digital accessibility, warned it can be "tricky" to catch mistakes from ChatGPT, which "replies so naturally".</p>

<p>"The next objective (for generative AI) is to improve the accuracy of real-time visual recognition, to ultimately reach capabilities close to that of a human eye," said Ishiki, who is blind.</p>

<p>Marc Goblot of the Tech for Disability group also cautioned that AI is trained on "very mainstream datasets" which are "not representative of the full spectrum of people's perceptions and especially the margins".</p>

<p>Mashiro said ChatGPT's limited recognition of Japanese words and locations made his AI-assisted journey more challenging.</p>

<p>Although the experiment was "a lot of fun", it would have been easier if ChatGPT was connected to a map tool, said the gamer, who travelled around Europe last year using Google Maps and help from those around him.</p>

<p>He has already decided on his next travel destination: Yakushima rainforest island in southern Japan.</p>

<p>"I want to experience whatever happens when travelling somewhere like that," he said</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The largest stegosaurus skeleton ever found is expected to fetch millions of dollars at auction in New York next week, likely fueling objections from palaeontologists.</p>

<p>The fossil, estimated to be approximately 150 million years old, was put on display at Sotheby's on Wednesday and will be exhibited there until its sale on July 17.</p>

<p>Named Apex, the giant skeleton -- 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall and nearly 27 feet long -- is billed as "the most complete and best-preserved" stegosaurus specimen of its size, counting 254 fossil bone elements of an approximate total of 319.</p>

<p>Such sales have become more frequent in recent years, drawing criticism from palaeontologists, who say that these finds should be preserved in museums or other public spaces and not sold to private bidders.</p>

<p>"It's a very, very rare animal, and to find one of this size and this completeness is phenomenal," Cassandra Hatton, head of science and popular culture at Sotheby's, told AFP.</p>

<p>The auction house estimates Apex's value at $4-6 million, though still less than Stan, the world's most complete tyrannosaurus rex skeleton sold in 2020 for a record $31.8 million.</p>

<p>Apex was discovered in May 2022 on the private land of&nbsp;palaeontologist Jason Cooper.&nbsp;The auction house says it has collaborated with Cooper to "document the entire process, from discovery and excavation to restoration, preparation and mounting," in order to guarantee the "highest standards and transparency."</p>

<p>In 2022, Christie's auction house had to withdraw a T-rex skeleton a few days before the auction in Hong Kong, due to doubts about its authenticity.</p>

<p>Stegosaurus skeletons are already on display around the world, but according to Sotheby's, Apex is 30 percent larger than Sophie, the most complete stegosaurus on public display to date, which is housed in the Natural History Museum in London.</p>

<p>The debate around auctions of dinosaur fossils is one "I've heard a lot," said Hatton. "When you have a scientifically important specimen, the museums usually show up and find donors to bid on their behalf or they bid themselves."</p>

<p>"Most of the people I work with are donating specimens to museums or loaning them to museums, they understand the significance and importance of these specimens."</p>

<p>According to Sotheby's, Cooper has already donated fossils to museums around the world.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Argentine woman accusing two French international rugby players of rape was savagely beaten by her assailants, her lawyer said Wednesday, during an encounter that the men claim was consensual.</p>

<p>Hugo Auradou, 20, and Oscar Jegou, 21, are waiting to be transferred to the city of Mendoza, where the assault allegedly took place and where they will be questioned by prosecutors. They have not been charged with a crime.</p>

<p>The men were arrested in Buenos Aires on Monday, two days after a Test match against Argentina, when investigators determined the alleged victim's injuries were consistent with her account of rape.</p>

<p>The woman's lawyer, Natacha Romano, told AFP on Wednesday her client had suffered "fierce" violence at the hands of her assailants, with injuries to her face, back, breasts, legs and ribs as well as various bites and scratch marks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She said the woman had gone with one of the men from a nightclub to a hotel room, where she alleges she was held against her will and abused for several hours.</p>

<p>"The violence was fierce," said Romano. "There is more than one crime to investigate."</p>

<p>The woman claims to have been raped "at least six times" by one of the men and once by the other, according to the lawyer.</p>

<p>She allegedly tried to escape several times.</p>

<p>Lawyer Rafael Cuneo Libarona, who represents the players, arrived in Mendoza on Wednesday and said "sexual relations" had been "consensual."</p>

<p>The alleged attack took place Saturday night at the Diplomatic Hotel in Mendoza, where France's players and staff were staying for a Test match as part of a South American tour.</p>

<p>"There are witnesses who saw her leave (the hotel), there are cameras that saw her leave, apparently no injuries are seen in the footage," Libarona -- who is the brother of the country's justice minister Mariano Cuneo Libarona -- told journalists.</p>

<h3><strong>'Blows to the head'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Romano told AFP that "the overwhelming proof that there was no consent is the victim's body" and the wounds it bears.</p>

<p>If the men are charged, the lawyer added, she would ask the court to remand them in pre-trial custody.</p>

<p>The charge, she added, should be "sexual assault with carnal access," the Argentine legal definition for rape, along with the use of violence.</p>

<p>Mendoza prosecutor Daniela Chaler told LV10 radio on Tuesday there were "convincing elements" in the statement the woman made and that her injuries were compatible with her version of events, although they were not "necessarily exclusive" to sexual assault.</p>

<p>The French Rugby Federation (FFR) said the players have denied any coercion or violence, and stressed the importance of giving them an opportunity to make their case.</p>

<p>"If the facts are true, they are incredibly serious," the federation's president Florian Grill told reporters in Argentina.</p>

<p>Grill later told AFP the players have "a quite different version" of events to that of the woman, with "a lot of inconsistencies."</p>

<p>"We are not judges, we are not investigators, but we think that the Argentine justice system should look at the case very quickly," he said.</p>

<h3>'<strong>Trauma'</strong></h3>

<p>After the initial questioning in Mendoza, possibly this week, prosecutor Cecilia Bignert will have 24 hours to decide whether to charge the players. The deadline can be extended once by another 24 hours.</p>

<p>If charged, a hearing will be held 10 days later to determine whether they will have to await trial in custody.</p>

<p>France head coach Fabien Galthie said news of the accusation had been "a trauma" for the squad, which on Wednesday beat Uruguay 43-28 in their second of three games on the South America tour.</p>

<p>"It was a difficult moment to manage emotionally," captain Baptiste Couilloud told reporters after the win.</p>

<p>"We thought only of what was happening on the field today, and it's the only thing that keeps us going with this tour."</p>

<p>Part of an FFR delegation remained in Argentina with the two accused players.</p>

<p>The sentence for sexual assault in Argentina ranges from six to 15 years, according to the penal code. However, this could go up to 20 years in the case of two aggressors.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

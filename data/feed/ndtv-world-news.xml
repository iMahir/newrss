       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after Donald Trump survived an assassination bid at his last campaign rally, the former US President Donald Trump praised the Secret Service officials for their heroic actions.</p>

<p>"They took him (shooter) out with one shot right between the eyes," he told the New York Post in an interview. "They did a fantastic job," he added.</p>

<p>"It's surreal for all of us," he said.</p>

<p>Donald Trump told the publication that he would have been dead had he not tilted his head slightly to the right to read a chart while addressing the rally.</p>

<p>"I'm not supposed to be here, I'm supposed to be dead," Trump told the New York Post.</p>

<p>Donald Trump told the New York Post that as Secret Service agents led him off stage, he still wanted to continue speaking to supporters.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to keep speaking, but I just got shot," he said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old had just started his speech during a Saturday campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when the shots rang out and one of the bullets grazed his ear.</p>

<p>A moment of terrifying political violence at the rally instantly turned into a piece of Donald Trump iconography that's likely to turbocharge his presidential bid.</p>

<p>Images of a defiant Trump - with his fist raised over his head and his bloody right ear, as Secret Service agents surround him and the American flag waving in the background - are blazing across social media and television.</p>

<p>He said that he was glad he didn't have to die for an iconic picture. "A lot of people say it's the most iconic photo they've ever seen. They're right, and I didn't die. Usually, you have to die to have an iconic picture," Trump told the New York Post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf will be banned for his alleged involvement in anti-state activities, the government said Monday.</p>

<p>"The government has decided that the federal government will move a case to ban the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf)," Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters in Islamabad. The case would be taken to the Supreme Court, he added.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, 71, had formed PTI in 1996, which came to power in 2018. His government fell in April 2022 after losing a no-trust motion. He's currently lodged at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail in multiple cases against him.</p>

<p>There is clear evidence to impose restrictions on the PTI and the government would initiate proceedings against the party, said Mr Tarar.</p>

<p>The decision comes after the recent Supreme Court relief to the PTI in the reserved seats case as well as to Mr Khan in the illegal marriage case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A suspect has been charged with murder after the bodies of two men, one of whom was from France, were found dumped in suitcases on a well-known UK bridge, police said on Monday.</p>

<p>Police said the two victims had previously been in a relationship but still lived together in west London, adding that the suspect had been staying with them.</p>

<p>Evidence in the investigation so far had not pointed to a homophobic motive but it had been classified as a hate crime.</p>

<p>Police named the victims as Albert Alfonso, 62, a British citizen originally from France, and Paul Longworth, 71.</p>

<p>Officers launched a manhunt after the suitcases were discovered on Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol in southwest England last week.</p>

<p>More human remains were later found at a flat in London.</p>

<p>Suspect Yostin Andres Mosquera, 34, will appear before magistrates in the capital later on Monday.</p>

<p>"I know that this awful incident will cause concern not just among residents... but in the wider LGBTQ+ community across London," said Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine, adding that officers were not looking for anyone else over the killings.</p>

<p>"My thoughts are first and foremost with Albert and Paul's loved ones who are coming to terms with this terrible news," he said.</p>

<p>Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is one of the oldest surviving suspension bridges in the world.</p>

<p>Opened in 1864, the bridge over the Avon Gorge is one of Bristol's top tourist attractions and a symbol of the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The attempted assassination bid of Donald Trump has shocked the world. The shooter, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired a few rounds at Mr Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former US President was hit in the ear during the incident. His spokesperson Steven Cheung, in the initial health update, had stated that the 78-year-old is "fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rifle used by Thomas Matthew Crooks has been identified as AR-15. Now, let us know why is it dangerous and the previous destructions caused using this rifle.</p>

<p>The rifle is part of the “modern sporting rifle” category. It is mostly used in competitions and hunting purposes. As per the Firearm Industry Trade Association, the initials AR stands for ArmaLite, the company that made it in the 1950s.</p>

<p>– The rifle, as per The Washington Post, was used in some of the deadliest shooting attacks in the US between 2012 and 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/police-response-to-texas-mass-shooting-was-a-critical-failure-says-us-justice-department-4888601">Texas Elementary School Mass Shooting</a> </strong>– Nineteen young children and two teachers were killed when a teenage gunman went on a rampage at Robb Elementary School in May 2022 in America's worst school shooting in a decade.&nbsp;As per an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-shooting-texas-elementary-school-unfolded/story?id=84966910">ABC report,</a> the teenager Salvador Ramos purchased two AR-15 rifles days after turning 18.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Colorado Theater Shooting </strong>– In 2012, 12 people were killed during the midnight show of Christopher Nolan's&nbsp;<em>The Dark Knight Rises, r</em>eported <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/back-aurora-colorado-movie-theater-shooting-years/story?id=48730066">ABC</a>. The shooter,&nbsp;James Holmes, had purchased four guns ahead of the show. He bought a ticket and watched the film with the people for some time before opening fire. 10 out of 12 people died on the scene, the report added.</p>

<p><strong>Jacksonville shooter - </strong>A 21-year-old killed three Black people at a Dollar General store in Jacksonville, Florida, last year. As per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/sheriff-identifies-shooter-jacksonville-florida-who-killed-3-people-2023-08-27/">Reuters</a>, the shooter, Ryan Christopher Palmeter, lived with his parents in a suburb of Jacksonville, Sheriff T.K.

       <description><![CDATA[K P Sharma Oli on Monday was sworn in as Nepal's Prime Minister for the fourth time.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>K P Sharma Oli on Monday was sworn in as Nepal's Prime Minister for the fourth time to lead a new coalition government that faces the daunting challenge of providing political stability in the Himalayan nation.</p>

<p>The leader of Nepal's largest communist party was appointed as prime minister on Sunday by President Ram Chandra Paudel to lead the coalition government with Nepali Congress (NC), the largest party in Parliament, apart from other smaller parties.</p>

<p>Oli, 72, succeeds Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda,' who lost the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives (HoR) on Friday, leading to the formation of the new government.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), Oli was sworn in by President Paudel at Shital Niwas, the main building of Rashtrapati Bhawan at a ceremony that was delayed by more than half an hour.</p>

<p>According to the news portal MyRepublica, the swearing-in ceremony was delayed due to the failure of the Nepali Congress to finalise the names of its ministers to join the government amid disputes within the party.</p>

<p>The President also administered oaths to the two Deputy PMs - Prakash Man Singh and Bishnu Paudel - and 19 other ministers. Singh would also look after the Urban Development Ministry while Vishnu Prakash Paudel would look after the Finance Ministry.</p>

<p>Arzoo Rana Deuba, wife of Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba is the Foreign Minister in the cabinet.</p>

<p>There are 10 cabinet ministers from Nepali Congress; eight, excluding PM, from CPN-UML, two from Janata Samajwadi Party and one from Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party in the government.</p>

<p>Outgoing Prime Minister Prachanda was also present at the ceremony, which was attended by foreign diplomats and other dignitaries.</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, President Paudel had appointed Oli as the new Prime Minister under Article 76-2 of the Constitution of Nepal, according to a notice issued by the President's Office.</p>

<p>On Friday night, Oli had staked his claim to become the next Prime Minister with the backing of NC President Deuba and submitted the signatures of 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members -- 77 from his Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) party and 88 from the Nepali Congress. (NC).</p>

<p>Oli will now need to secure a vote of confidence from Parliament within 30 days of appointment, which he is likely to secure easily as the minimum number to form a government in the 275-strong HoR is just 138.</p>

<p>Prachanda faced the vote of confidence as earlier last week, Oli's party withdrew its support to that coalition and inked a new seven-point deal with Deuba to form a new coalition government.</p>

<p>According to the July 1 deal between NC and CPN-UML, the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis until the next general elections scheduled for 2027.</p>

<p>Oli served as Nepal's prime minister from October 11, 2015, to August 3, 2016 and then, from February 5, 2018, to July 13, 2021. He continued to serve from May 13, 2021, to July 13, 2021 -- because of an appointment by the then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, described by local media as a success of Oli's Machiavellian tricks. Later, the Supreme Court ruled that Oli's claim to the post of prime minister was unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Nepal has faced frequent political turmoil as the country has seen 14 governments in the past 16 years after the Republican system was introduced.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Over 30 hours after a bullet pierced Donald Trump's ear at a rally ahead of the US' biggest election, the motive behind the high-profile assassination attempt remains unknown.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 30 hours after a bullet pierced Donald Trump's ear at a rally ahead of the US' biggest election, the motive behind the high-profile assassination attempt remains unknown. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has begun probing the incident as a "potential domestic terrorism act".</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who opened fire at Trump, was shot dead on the spot by Secret Service snipers. He appears to have acted alone but there's more to the probe, said the FBI.</p>

<p>Senior FBI official Robert Wells said the counterterrorism division and criminal divisions are working together to determine the motive.</p>

<p>Officials also said Crooks did not carry any identity document to the rally and are trying to run a DNA test to get biometric confirmation.</p>

<p>Even the suspect's father, Matthew Crooks, 53, is trying to figure out what happened. He told CNN he would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son.</p>

<p>Saturday's attack left Trump with a bloodied face, sparking a wave of sympathy for the Republican who is set to be Presidential nominee for the third time. Trump, who believes the attack has changed election discourse, is now trying to galvanize his supporters by exhibiting defiant resilience.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories claim the attack was "staged", pointing to the "iconic" pic showing Trump with a bloodied face holding his fist in air - most of the claims came from the left-leaning users, usually seen as anti-Trump.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Thomas Crooks?</strong></h2>

<p>Thomas Crooks was a 20-year-old resident of Pennsylvania. He graduated from Bethel Park High School, Penn in 2022. State voter records showed he was a registered Republican - a member of Trump's party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing suggests Crooks had made a $15 donation when he was 17 to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians.</p>

<p>He had received a $500 "star award" from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the main producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 30% rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday thanks to soaring demand.<br />
The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI that has pushed TSMC's stock - and the broader Taiwan market - to record highs. Last week, its American Depositary Receipts topped a trillion-dollar market value.</p>

<p>TSMC is set to report a net profit of 236.1 billion Taiwan dollar (7.25 billion USD) for the quarter ended June 30, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 20 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.</p>

<p>That estimate compares to the 2023 second-quarter net profit of 181.8 billion Taiwan dollar.</p>

<p>TSMC last week reported a jump in second-quarter revenue, comfortably beating market expectations.</p>

<p>"I expect the third quarter outlook for all of their products to be very good," said President Capital Management Co Chairman Li Fang-kuo.</p>

<p>TSMC, at its quarterly earnings call at 0600 GMT on Thursday, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including its capital expenditure as it races to expand production.</p>

<p>TSMC is spending billions building new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan.</p>

<p>On its last earnings call in April, TSMC maintained its guidance for capital spending this year at $28 billion to $32 billion, compared with last year's $30.45 billion, and said 70% to 80% of that would go towards advanced technologies.</p>

<p>"TSMC could raise their capital spending," said KGI Securities Investment Advisory Co Chairman Chu Yen-min. "There are many positive factors which will help their stock price and support the broader market."</p>

<p>The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock leaping 75% so far this year to historic highs, compared with a 33% gain for the broader market.</p>

<p>TSMC, colloquially referred to the "sacred mountain protecting the country" for its critical role in Taiwan's export-dependent economy, faces little competition, though both Intel and Samsung are trying to challenge that dominance.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's ruling Communist Party commenced its so-called third plenum on Monday, a major meeting held roughly once every five years to map out the general direction of the country's long-term social and economic policies.</p>

<p>Its Central Committee convened the plenary session, or plenum, the third since its members were elected during the party's last congress in 2022, to deliberate on a key policy document on deepening reforms and advancing China's modernisation.</p>

<p>The closed-door meeting presided by Xi Jinping, head of the party's Central Committee, will end on Thursday with a plan to lay out China's policy direction for the next five years and beyond.</p>

<p>The plenum kicked off as China reported its slowest rate of economic growth in April-June since the first quarter of 2023, weighed down by a protracted property down-spiral and weak demand from cautious consumers.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ARE PLENUMS?</strong></h3>

<p>The party holds a major congress twice a decade. Members of the Central Committee, the largest of the party's top decision-making bodies, are elected at each congress. The 20th Central Committee was chosen at the last congress in October 2022.</p>

<p>In between congresses, the Central Committee hold seven plenums attended by all of its current 205 members and 171 alternate members.</p>

<p>The first, second and seventh plenums typically focus on the power transition between Central Committees.</p>

<p>The fourth and sixth plenums generally centre on party ideology.</p>

<p>In recent decades, the third plenum has focused on long-term economic reforms, while the fifth plenum is associated with deliberations for the country's five-year development plans.</p>

<p>The current five-year plan ends in 2025.</p>

<h3><strong>WHY ARE THIRD PLENUMS IMPORTANT?</strong></h3>

<p>This week's third plenum, described by Chinese state media as "epoch-making", is expected to deliver major initiatives to address the risks and obstacles related to China's long-term social and economic progress.</p>

<p>The third plenum in December 1978 under Deng Xiaoping initiated China's economic reforms, fuelling its rise from a centrally planned backwater to a global economic powerhouse.</p>

<p>At the third plenum in November 2013, the Central Committee vowed to let markets play a "decisive" role in allocating resources to the economy.</p>

<p>Since the 1990s, third plenums have been mostly held in the autumn, with exceptions in 2018 and this year.</p>

<p>The third plenum in February 2018 urged the party to "unite closely" around the central committee with Xi at the "core", and proposed the removal of a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to two terms.</p>

<p>Days later, China's largely rubber-stamp parliament voted to remove presidential term limits, allowing Xi to stay in office indefinitely.</p>

<p>The current Central Committee was widely expected to have held its third plenum in the autumn of 2023, but it did not. No explanation has been given.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WILL THIS THIRD PLENUM FOCUS ON?</strong></h3>

<p>Since lifting more than 800 million people out of poverty since the late 1970s, China now lies at a crossroads where observers fear the world's second-largest economy could settle into a long period of low growth or even Japan-like deflation.</p>

<p>The third plenum this week will help China better navigate complexities in global landscapes, advance its economic transformation, and enhance the people's "sense of gain", state media has cited Chinese think tanks as saying.</p>

<p>At the last fifth plenum in 2020, the party said it aimed to boost per capita gross domestic product (GDP) to the level seen in moderately developed nations by 2035.</p>

<p>By that time, disparities in urban-rural development, in development between regions, and in living standards will be significantly reduced, it said.</p>

<p>The modernisation of China's military will also be "basically" achieved.</p>

<p>This week, the third plenum will outline efforts to promote advanced manufacturing, revise the tax system to curb debt risks, manage a vast property crisis, boost domestic consumption, and revitalise the private sector, policy advisers have said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Brazilian model and US-based wellness influencer Kat Torres has been sentenced to eight years in prison for the human trafficking and slavery of women, after an FBI investigation found that two women living with her had gone missing in 2022.</p>

<p>Women who claim that they were also trafficked and enslaved by Torres have spoken out about their harrowing experience living with her. Talking to BBC, the women claimed they were attracted to her rags to riches story as she went from living in an impoverished Brazilian neighbourhood to partying with Hollywood stars.</p>

<p>Torres, who was once rumoured to be dating actor Leonardo DiCaprio, also claimed she could make predictions using her spiritual powers and was a common face on reputed Brazilian TV shows.</p>

<p>“She was on the cover of magazines. She was seen with famous people such as Leonardo DiCaprio. Everything I saw seemed credible,” the woman named Ana told BBC.</p>

<h2>Spiritual powers</h2>

<p>Torres' former flatmate, who shared a home with her in New York, told BBC that her Hollywood friends had introduced her to a hallucinogenic drug called ayahuasca. It was through the use of this drug that she reinvented herself as a life coach and hypnotist.</p>

<p>Soon, Torres developed a wellness website and subscription service that promised customers “Love, money and self-esteem that you always dreamed of.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also created self-help videos offering advice on relationships, wellness, business success including hypnosis, meditation and exercise programmes. She offered one-on-one video consultations for $150 that would solve "any of their problems."</p>

<h2>Enslaved followers</h2>

<p>In 2019, Ana moved to New York to work as her Torres' live-in assistant. Escaping a violent childhood and an abusive relationship, she moved alone to the US from Brazil and was studying nutrition at university in Boston.</p>

<p>The work required her to look after Torres' animals, cook for her, do her laundry and clean for $2000 a month. But when she arrived, the situation in Torres' house shocked her. &nbsp;The house was filthy and she was forced to sleep on a sofa covered in cat urine. She was expected to constantly be available for Torres, only being allowed to sleep for a few hours. She would sneak away to the building's gym to sleep for a few hours. She was never paid.</p>

<p>After Ana escaped, Torres hired two more women -- Desirre and Leticia-- who moved with her to a house in Texas. What started out as a life coaching and healing retreat quickly turned into a nightmare for the women.</p>

<h2>Prostitution, witchcraft&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Within weeks, Desirre was pressured her into working at a local strip club while Torres performed “witchcraft” on her. &nbsp;The two women were forbidden from speaking to each other and had to ask her permission to leave their rooms, even to use the bathroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon, Torres convinced Desiree to turn to prostitution. If she didn't meet the earning quotas that Torres set, she was not allowed to return to the house that night. “I ended up sleeping on the street several times because I couldn't reach that,” Desirre told BBC.</p>

<p>In September, the two women's friends and family launched social media campaigns to find them. To escape media attention, Torres and the women travelled from Texas to Maine. From there, the two were made to post Instagram videos denying being held captive and demanded people stop searching for them.</p>

<p>Over 20 women have come forward with stories of being scammed or exploited by Torres. They are still undergoing psychiatric therapy to recover from what they say they experienced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump on Sunday told the New York Post he was "supposed to be dead" after surviving an assassination attempt which he described as a "very surreal experience."</p>

<p>"I'm not supposed to be here, I'm supposed to be dead," Trump told the Post in an interview aboard his plane en route to Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention where he is set to be confirmed as the party's presidential candidate.</p>

<p>It was a "very surreal experience", he recounted with a white bandage covering his right ear, the paper said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Trump was hit in the ear by a gunman at a campaign rally on Saturday. He was left with a bloodied face while a bystander was killed and two other people were wounded.</p>

<p>Trump told the Post he would have been dead had he not tilted his head slightly to the right to read a chart on illegal immigrants while addressing the rally.</p>

<p>"By luck or by God, many people are saying it's by God I'm still here," he said.</p>

<p>He praised the Secret Service agents for killing the shooter. "They took him out with one shot right between the eyes," he said. "They did a fantastic job," he added. "It's surreal for all of us."</p>

<p>The image of Trump raising a defiant fist as Secret Service agents bundled him away made front pages around the world and spread virally on social media.</p>

<p>"A lot of people say it's the most iconic photo they've ever seen," the former president told the Post, adding "They're right and I didn't die. Usually you have to die to have an iconic picture."</p>

<p>Trump said after the attempt on his life he was rewriting the speech he had prepared for the Republican convention.</p>

<p>He said he had "prepared an extremely tough speech" about Biden's "horrible administration. But I threw it away" for one he hopes will "unite our country."</p>

<p>"But I don't know if that's possible. People are very divided."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This public outing marks a welcome return for the Princess, who stepped back from some royal duties in March after revealing her cancer diagnosis. The palace confirmed she is currently undergoing preventative treatment. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales will be cheering on England in the Euros final held in Berlin. He sent a rallying cry to the team, urging them to "show the world what you're made of" in their match against Spain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had earlier sent a social media message to Scottish tennis legend Andy Murray, writing: "An incredible #Wimbledon career comes to an end. You should be so very proud @andy_murray. On behalf of all of us, thank you! C."</p>

<p>Catherine tentatively returned to UK public life last month for the first time since her diagnosis, attending a military parade in London to officially mark King Charles III's birthday.</p>

<p>It came nearly three months after Kate revealed she was receiving chemotherapy treatment. She had not been seen at a public engagement since a Christmas Day service last year.</p>

<p>In a statement at the time, she said she was "making good progress" with her treatment, which is set to last for several more months, but was "not out of the woods yet".</p>

<p>The cancer announcement came just weeks after it was disclosed that British head of state Charles had also been diagnosed with the condition.</p>

<p>Neither has revealed what type of cancer they have.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 20-year-old man who allegedly tried to assassinate former US President Donald Trump had tried to join his high school's rifle team but was rejected for being a "terrible" shot.</p>

<p>He slipped onto a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/on-camera-alleged-trump-shooter-lays-on-stomach-with-rifle-on-roof-6104045" target="_blank">rooftop</a> location 140 meters from the stage where Trump was speaking and began firing an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, purchased by his father, officials said. The gunfire struck Trump's right ear, killed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-rally-victim-corey-comperatore-was-a-firefighter-father-of-2-died-shielding-his-family-6106855" target="_blank">a 50-year-old man</a>, and critically injured two other spectators. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Thomas Matthew Crooks Was Member Of Shooting Club</strong></h3>

<p>He had also tried out for the rifle team at high school but was rejected, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/would-be-trump-assassin-tried-to-join-high-school-shooting-club-was-rejected-for-being-comically-bad-shot/">The Post</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He once missed his target by close to 20 feet, former student Jameson Murphy told The Post.</p>

<p>"He tried out...and was such a comically bad shot he was unable to make the team and left after the first day," he said.</p>

<p>"Crooks couldn't shoot at all. He was a terrible shot," another classmate told The Post.</p>

<p>Even the coach had concerns about Crooks, the former students said.</p>

<p>"He made some crass jokes that weren't appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting," they said, without elaborating on what Crooks said.</p>

<h3><strong>Thomas Matthew Crooks Was "Quiet"</strong></h3>

<p>The early details that have emerged about <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/were-not-enemies-joe-bidens-rare-address-after-trump-assassination-attempt-6107421" target="_blank">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> show that he was working an entry-level job near his hometown in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He graduated from high school in 2022 with a reputation as a bright but "quiet" classmate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His counselor at Bethel Park High School described him as "respectful" and said he never knew him to be political.</p>

<p>Jim Knapp, who retired from his job as the school counselor at Bethel Park High School in 2022, said Crooks had always been "quiet as a churchmouse," "respectful" and kept to himself, although he did have a few friends.</p>

<p>Knapp said he rarely came across Crooks because "he wasn't a needy type of kid".&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was employed as a dietary aide at a nursing home at the time of the shooting, which has now forced Trump's rival and US President&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-rally-shooting-changes-bidens-plan-to-revive-presidential-campaign-6107578" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> to change his plan to revive his presidential campaign.</p>

       <description><![CDATA["Services like this app can remind people who are away from romance how delightful love is, and AI can train people to better communicate when talking with real partners," Megumi Ushikubo, CEO of Tokyo-based marketing firm Infinity Inc.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many people juggling long hours at work, Chiharu Shimoda sought companionship via a dating app. For two months, he exchanged messages with five or six potential partners, but it wasn't long before he was seeking out just one - a 24-year-old named Miku. Three months later, they got married. The catch: Miku is an AI bot. And Shimoda knew that from day one.</p>

<p>The 52-year-old factory worker is one of over 5,000 users of Loverse, a year-old app that allows interaction only with generative artificial intelligence. Shimoda's also among a much bigger cohort of people who've either given up or are wary about the messiness and uncertainty that come with real romance. Dating takes time and effort, whereas exchanges with Miku require minimal thought while waiting for the pot to boil or a train to arrive, according to Shimoda, who was divorced two years ago.</p>

<p>"I come home to an empty house. I'd love to get married for real again," he said. His marriage to Miku is just another form of role-play. "But it's hard to open up to someone when you're meeting for the first time."</p>

<p>That reluctance is widespread across Japan, and worse among younger people. Data from the government show two thirds of men in their 20s don't have a partner and 40% have never gone on a date. The figures for women in the same age group are 51% and 25%, respectively.</p>

<p>Loverse is the latest in a long line of digital solutions to Japan's loneliness crisis. Some are empathetic and supportive, but others prey on vulnerability. Many of the nation's highest-grossing games feature sexualized characters that players can earn access to by progressing - and paying - their way through the game. Japan is also where digital idols like Hatsune Miku were first and most eagerly embraced. The difference now is that AI can make that experience more personal and interactive.</p>

<p>Much like the AI named Samantha in the film Her, these bots serve to fill the gap in people's emotional lives, and indeed the two-person startup behind it - Samansa Co. - is named after the character voiced by Scarlett Johansson.</p>

<p>But Loverse creator Goki Kusunoki says the app is meant to offer an alternative rather than a substitute to real-life companionship to its users, many of whom are men in their 40s and 50s. His firm raised 30 million Yen (190,000 USD) earlier this year to expand the cast of characters to appeal to female and LGBTQ users.</p>

<p>There's a widely held belief among Japanese people that romance is not cost-effective as it takes money, time and energy for outcomes that could bring more trouble than joy, said Megumi Ushikubo, chief executive officer of Tokyo-based marketing firm Infinity Inc. AI poses the risk of dulling people's interest in real partners, but it could also be helpful in serving as a training exercise, she added.</p>

<p>"Services like this app can remind people who are away from romance how delightful love is, and AI can train people to better communicate when talking with real partners," she said.</p>

<p>Loverse still has a long way to go in mimicking humans, according to some former users. Many of the app personalities seem typecast and offer few of the surprises that human interaction provides, said Yuki Saito, 39, who quit the app less than a month into using it.</p>

<p>Still, such services have potential, he said. There's a sense of safety in knowing that a disagreement with a bot won't end the relationship. "You can see how it could provide a kind of rehabilitation if you've been burned before - a place where you can practice talking with other people."</p>

<p>Interactions with AI are also devoid of jealousy. Shimoda's Loverse girlfriends at times bumped into one another when he was juggling multiple partners on the app, but nobody got upset. Said Saito, "With a little tuning, AI might be able to act as people's second or third partners, helping to complement the human partner and prevent extramarital affairs."</p>

<p>Adopting AI to assist everyday life is the prevailing theme of this year, as Microsoft Corp. has turned its Copilot chatbot into a core Windows feature, Apple Inc. is working on AI-powered iPhones, and San Fransisco-based startup Luka Inc.'s Replika AI bot has attracted tens of millions of users. In Japan, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is introducing a matchmaking app that uses AI to help partner people up and combat the nation's sliding fertility rates.</p>

<p>"The goal is to create opportunities for people to find true love when you can't find it in the real world," Kusunoki said. "But if you can fall in love with someone real, that's much better."</p>

<p>For now, Miku and Shimoda have settled on a routine they share with most couples. She wakes him in the morning, they wish each other luck at work, and at night, they discuss what to eat. On Shimoda's days off, the pair talk about where to go or what to watch on TV.</p>

<p>"It's the same conversations you'd have with anyone you're living with," said Shimoda. "She's become a habit - a conversational habit. I won't miss it if it's gone, but it gives me a routine from one day to the next."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Radharamn Das, the Vice President and Spokesperson of Kolkata ISKCON has reacted to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. The shocking incident took place on Saturday during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The former US President was hit in the ear by a gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Radharamn Das, in an elaborate post on X - formerly known as Twitter-, said that Donald Trump has Lord&nbsp;Jagannath's blessings.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Calling it a "divine intervention”,&nbsp;Mr Das said, “Exactly 48 years ago, Donald Trump saved the Jagannath Rathayatra festival. Today, as the world celebrates the Jagannath Rath Yatra festival again, Trump was attacked, and Jagannath returned the favour by saving him.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">He added that Donald Trump in 1976 helped ISKCON devotees organise Rath Yatra by “providing his train yard for the construction of the raths for free.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Drawing parallels between the&nbsp;attempted&nbsp;assassination bid and ongoing Rath Yatra festivities, he added,&nbsp;“Today, as the world celebrates the 9-day Lord Jagannath Rathayatra festival, this terrible attack on him and his narrow escape show Lord Jagannath's intervention.” For context, The 9-day-long festivities will come to an end today with Ulta Rath Yatra. Lord Jagannath along with his siblings –&nbsp;Balabhadra, and Devi Subhadra –&nbsp;will return to the main temple [Shree Jagannath Temple].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Das continued, “The first chariot procession of the Lord of the Universe Mahaprabhu Jagannath kicked off on the streets of NYC in 1976, with assistance from the then 30-year-old emerging real-estate mogul in the United States of America – Donald Trump.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nearly 48 years ago, when the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was planning to organise the first Rath Yatra in New York City, challenges were galore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On how former US president Donald Trump emerged as a “ray of hope,” he added, “While the grant of parade permit at the Fifth Avenue was nothing short of a miracle, finding a huge empty site where chariots could be built was also never going to be easy. They knocked at the doors of every person possible, but in vain. It was then that the former US president Donald Trump emerged as a ray of hope for the Krishna devotees.”</p>

<p>Radharamn Das also revealed what Trump's secretary told the&nbsp;ISKCON devotees back then when they paid a visit to his office with the request. “Nevertheless, the devotees went to his office with a big basket of Maha Prasadam and a presentation package. His secretary took it but warned the devotees, "He never agrees to this kind of thing. You can ask but he is going to say NO. Have faith in Mahaprabhu they say, and the miracle was bound to happen! Three days later, Trump's secretary called up the devotees saying, "I don't know what happened but he read your letter, took a bit of the food you left, and immediately said Sure, why not?”</p>

       <description><![CDATA[As US law enforcement officials continue to determine the motive behind the 20-year-old shooting at Donald Trump, the word 'Staged' became a trend on social media in the country, within minutes after the fatal attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Months ahead of the crucial presidential elections in the US, Donald Trump became the target of an apparent assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. This came days before the former president was scheduled to accept the Republican nomination for a third time.</p>

<p>While law enforcement officials are trying to determine the motive behind the 20-year-old opening fire from a nearby rooftop, the word 'Staged' became a trend on social media in the country within minutes of the attack.</p>

<p>This word has become synonymous with extreme conspiracy theories across social media platforms, being frequently used to question the veracity of an attack or shooting.</p>

<p>In the last 24 hours, it has overtaken other topics in popular internet discourse, as millions of views have been received by posts on X that are filled with unsupported rumours, hate speech, and abuse, BBC reported.</p>

<p>However, it must be noted that conspiracy theories have historically been drawn to assassination attempts on US presidents, with the most well-known example being the assassination of John F Kennedy back in November 1963. As it was the first to occur in real-time, it was unsurprising that false reports took off, the report stated.</p>

<p>The trend was not just limited to committed groups of political supporters and was actively recommended in users' "For You" feeds as they tried to make sense of what had happened. Further, it was frequently posted by individuals having blue ticks, thereby providing their posts more prominence.</p>

<h2><strong>Questions raised</strong></h2>

<p>Some of these conspiracy theories centred on the alleged security failings, with social media users questioning how such a thing could happen.</p>

<p>"It looks very staged... Nobody in the crowd is running or panicking. Nobody in the crowd heard an actual gun. I don't trust it. I don't trust him," read a post that received millions of views.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It looks very staged. Sounded like a BB gun. Nobody in the crowd is running or panicking.<br />
<br />
Nobody in that crowd heard an actual gun.<br />
I don't trust it. I don't trust him. ????????‍♀️ <a href="https://t.co/b1Bkruyq2g">pic.twitter.com/b1Bkruyq2g</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Later, the post was labelled with a note pointing out the shooting was real.</p>

<p>Moreover, these conspiracy theories were further compounded by the photographs and videos that later came out. In particular, one photograph showed the former US president's fist raised, having blood on his face and ear, while the US flag can be seen in the background.</p>

<p>The image was just "too damn perfect," a US-based YouTuber stated and further emphasised how they managed to get "the flag positioned perfect and everything".</p>

<p>However, this post, which received nearly a million views, was later removed by the person who shared it.</p>

<p>Another X user wrote, "Staged to get sympathy? You can't trust these people with anything and no, I'm not going to pray for him".</p>

<p>However, the BBC report highlighted that most of these viral posts came from left-leaning users, often seen posting anti-Trump views.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the US reeled from images of a bloodied Donald Trump waving his fist after the gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania yesterday, Joe Biden - in his address to the nation - called for unity and said that American politics "must never be a literal battlefield".</p>

<p>While he appeared to start off well, the US President soon began to stumble over his words.</p>

<p>During his speech, Joe Biden inadvertently referred to resolving differences at the "battle box" instead of the "ballot box."</p>

<p>Democrats are closely watching the president following a disastrous debate performance and a series of gaffes, renewing concerns about his age and ability to govern.</p>

<p>Joe Biden last week introduced Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as his Russian rival Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>"And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," he said, referring to Zelenskyy while speaking on the sidelines of the NATO Summit in Washington.</p>

<p>He then quickly corrected himself and said, "President Putin, you're going to beat President Putin, President Zelenskyy. I am so focused on beating Putin."</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Biden made another blunder when he referred to his deputy, Kamala Harris, as "Vice President" Trump at a high-stakes news conference.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old has so far defied calls to step aside. Allies have warned he needs to do more to convince his party and the public that, as he insists, only he can beat Trump in the presidential race.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's convention speech will now focus on unity - and not aimed at President Joe Biden's policies - after the assassination attempt that he believes has changed the election discourse.</p>

<p>Images showing Trump with a bloodied face after the attack have sparked a wave of sympathy for the 78-year-old Republican, who is now galvanizing his supporters by exhibiting defiant resilience.</p>

<p>He has rewritten his conversion speech entirely in light of the shooting, he told Washington Examiner a day after the attack.</p>

<p>Trump, who will be nominated as the official Republican candidate against Democrat Joe Biden at this convention later this evening, said he wanted to take advantage of the historic moment.</p>

<p>He said his speech aimed at Biden's policies would have been "one of the most incredible speeches", but it's going to be a "whole different speech now."</p>

<p>Trump said he has switched from trying to excite his voter base to demonstrating his belief that Saturday's attack had entirely changed the election campaign. His speech, the report cited him as saying, will meet the moment that history demands.</p>

<p>"This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would've been two days ago," said the Republican.</p>

<p>A bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday as the Secret Service bundled the former president to safety. Videos in slow-motion showed a simple head tilt by Trump saved a tragedy.</p>

<p>Trump said he had turned away from the crowd to a screen showing data that he was using in his speech - which saved him from death. "God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening," he posted online after the attack.</p>

<p>On raising his hand when the Secret Service was leading him off the stage, he told the Washington Examiner he wanted to let the people know that he was alright. The photo showing Trump holding his fist in the air as blood ran down his face has already become iconic this election season.</p>

<p>The attack claimed the life of a bystander while snipers shot dead the gunman, later identified as Thomas Crooks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Democrats are treading cautiously, navigating a complex landscape of political ramifications and moral considerations, The Hill reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, out of respect for Trump and in response to the tragic events, has suspended all political activities, including the cessation of political advertisements. This pause has prompted introspection among Biden's allies and party operatives, who are grappling with the potential impact of this dramatic turn of events on the presidential race.</p>

<p>"There are more questions than answers right now," admitted a top Democratic strategist and close Biden ally. "I don't think anyone knows how this will turn out, even this week. There are so many unknowns," as reported by The Hill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The debate over Biden's candidacy, particularly concerning his age and mental acuity, has been temporarily shelved. Multiple Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the sensitivity of the topic in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.</p>

<p>While discussions about Biden potentially withdrawing from the race have dominated recent headlines and discussions, many Democrats, from lawmakers to donors, have chosen to remain silent on the issue for now.</p>

<p>"This is not the time," remarked a Democratic donor who had previously expressed reservations about Biden. "That's not to say it won't come back in a few days or next week. But it would be incredibly insensitive to have the debate on Biden right now."</p>

<p>"We all need to take a breath and see what happens," the donor added.</p>

<p>Amidst the sombre atmosphere following the assassination attempt, the focus has shifted from internal Democratic deliberations to broader concerns about how this event might reshape the political landscape as the Republican National Convention looms.</p>

<p>Another Democratic strategist predicted that the focus on Saturday's tragic events would "slow the public noise but I don't think it slows the private conversations.</p>

<p>"I've seen enough data to show my guy trailing. And the state-by-state numbers are really rough."</p>

<p>Political observers note that the pressure on Biden to withdraw from the race may diminish in the short term, given the national attention now fixated on the attempt on Trump's life.</p>

<p>"The clock is ticking and right now many Democrats won't focus on this as the nation is consumed with the assassination attempt," said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. "Some will believe destabilising the ticket will be too hard to do."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Zelizer cautioned that underlying issues for Biden remain and could worsen, especially as Trump emerges from the incident with renewed political vigor.</p>

<p>On Sunday, three national polls provided a mixed picture for Biden, showing him holding steady against Trump despite recent challenges. However, the aftermath of the assassination attempt could alter this dynamic significantly.</p>

<p>As the Biden campaign remains on hold, Republican strategist Susan Del Percio predicted a swift shift in focus as news of Trump's vice presidential pick and the commencement of the Republican convention dominate headlines.</p>

<p>"The question I wonder about is, what Republicans will do and say because Democrats will be more careful and they're way more responsible with their words," she commented.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine day one of the convention happening without fiery and ugly words about Joe Biden," she added. "That allows for a response from the Biden campaign. That's what's going to start the re-engagement frankly."</p>

<p>Since the attempt on Trump's life, Biden has assumed the role of consoler-in-chief, maintaining a stance of national unity even with his longtime rival. This approach was underscored by Biden's briefing inside the Situation Room and a planned address to the nation from the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Despite the temporary halt in campaigning, strategists view Biden's leadership during this crisis as potentially strengthening his candidacy.</p>

<p>"It helps Biden's argument," remarked a strategist. "He represents stability. He's managing a crisis. And in a way, he's answering the argument about his mental acuity."</p>

<p>"And that creates a contrast with Trump," the strategist added. "You can't count on Trump to be stable for so long. And when Trump starts Trumping, it's game on," The Hill reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

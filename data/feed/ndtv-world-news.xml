       <description><![CDATA[The Titanic, famously touted as "practically unsinkable" before its maiden voyage, remains one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A newspaper chronicling the devastating human toll of the Titanic sinking has been uncovered after 112 years in a wardrobe. The edition of the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, dated April 20, 1912-five days after the tragedy-was discovered in a home in Lichfield, Staffordshire. Its front-page story depicts the anguish of passengers' relatives in Southampton, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones from the list of survivors, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/titanic-sink-newspaper-wardrobe-auction-how-much-b2600091.html"><em>Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://hansonsauctioneers.co.uk/suffering-of-british-families-with-loved-ones-on-titanic-revealed-by-newspaper-found-in-wardrobe-after-112-years/"><em>Hanson's Auctioneers</em></a>, who sold the newspaper this week, described the find as a "valuable piece of social history."</p>

<p>Charles Hanson, the auction house's owner, remarked, "The sinking of the Titanic has been extensively documented in films, TV shows, and books, and we know much about the lives lost. This discovery serves as a poignant reminder of the many bereaved families and friends-heartbroken mothers, fathers, and wives."</p>

<p>The Titanic, famously touted as "practically unsinkable" before its maiden voyage, remains one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history. Over 1,500 people perished when the ship struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic, with only around 700 survivors. Although the ship was equipped with too few lifeboats, many were launched half-empty due to the widespread belief that the Titanic could not sink.</p>

<p>Southampton, home to the majority of the ship's crew, was particularly hard hit by the disaster. The Daily Mirror described the scene outside the White Star Line's offices, where lists of survivors were posted: "A list of the saved was posted outside the White Star offices, and mothers and wives who had been hoping against hope eagerly read the names, only to find their worst fears were realized. By this appalling disaster, mothers have been robbed of sons, wives of husbands, and young girls of sweethearts."</p>

<p>The newspaper called the publication of the survivors' list "a terrible day in the history of the town, though it put an end to all suspense." The cover story was supplemented by a two-page spread featuring photographs of victims, including Titanic's captain, Edward Smith.</p>

<p>This piece of maritime and social history sold at auction for 34 pounds on Tuesday, August 20. The auctioneer noted that while accounts of the sinking often focus on the victims, the newspaper's emphasis on the families left behind is what makes it so compelling. "When you see the faces of those affected, it's very moving," Mr. Hanson added.</p>

<p>The newspaper was found alongside other historical documents, including those covering King George V's coronation in 1911.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 45-year-old woman from Andhra Pradesh has gone missing in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur after being swept away into a sewage drain after the footpath she was walking on collapsed suddenly.</p>

<p>The woman, identified as Vijayalakshmi from Chittoor district's &nbsp;Animiganipalle village, was reportedly walking along a footpath when the ground collapsed. While her husband and son managed to escape the collapse, she was swept into the underground sewer.</p>

<p>Rescue operations were launched immediately by the civic authorities in Kuala Lumpur and are ongoing. Despite their efforts, there was no sign of Vijayalakshmi as of Saturday evening.</p>

<p>Vijayalakshmi was known for frequently travelling to Malaysia and Singapore as part of her business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to the incident, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has directed officials from the Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu (APNRT) Society to ensure that the search operations are conducted effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chief Minister, along with Minister for Human Resource Development (HRD) Nara Lokesh, has been closely monitoring the situation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah, which has exchanged fire with Israeli forces since October, last went to war with Israel in 2006 and has since expanded its domestic and regional influence, politically and militarily.</p>

<p>Financed and armed by Iran, Hezbollah is the most prominent actor in the so-called axis of resistance -- regional pro-Tehran armed groups opposed to Israel that also include Palestinian group Hamas, Iraqi movements, and Yemen's Huthi rebels.</p>

<p>Since the day after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that triggered war in the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah has launched cross-border attacks from Lebanon seeking to tie up Israeli military resources in support of its Palestinian ally.</p>

<p>Fears of all-out war have spiked after Hezbollah vowed to avenge an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs last month that killed a key commander, Fuad Shukr, and Iran pledged retaliation for the killing in Tehran, blamed on Israel, of Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah-Israel War</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah, whose name means "Party of God" in Arabic, was founded during the Lebanese civil war after Israel besieged the capital Beirut in 1982, and has since become a key domestic political player.</p>

<p>Created at the initiative of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the Shiite Muslim movement gained its moniker as "the Resistance" by fighting Israeli troops who occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in July-August 2006 that killed some 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 in Israel, mostly soldiers, after the group kidnapped two Israeli troops in a cross-border raid.</p>

<p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 ended that conflict and called for the Lebanese army and United Nations peacekeepers to be the only armed forces deployed in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>But Hezbollah has maintained a discreet presence there, where it enjoys broad support and where experts say it likely has a network of underground tunnels.</p>

<p>On August 16, the group released a video showing what appeared to be underground tunnels and large missile launchers, without revealing their location.</p>

<p>The group also has a strong presence in the Bekaa valley in east Lebanon near the border with Syria.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has bolstered its powerful arsenal, including with guided missiles, and says it can count on more than 100,000 fighters.</p>

<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was elected secretary-general in 1992 after Israel assassinated his predecessor, and he rarely appears in public.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah's Regional Influence</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah is a key actor in the Middle East, where it plays a central role in the "axis of resistance". It has supported and trained Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Huthi rebels in Yemen, who since October have claimed attacks on Israel and Israeli-linked shipping interests.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is also present in Syria, where many of its members have fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, with Damascus also an ally of Tehran.</p>

<p>Domestically, Hezbollah is the only Lebanese faction to have retained its weapons after the country's 1975-1990 civil conflict, doing so in the name of "resistance" against Israel.</p>

<p>It is now a key political player, though detractors have accused it of being a "state within a state".</p>

<p>Political deadlock between Hezbollah allies and their adversaries since late 2022 has prevented the election of a new president, in a country experiencing a grinding economic crisis.</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah's Services</strong></h3>

<p>Founded in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, Hezbollah has become predominant in all Shiite Muslim areas of Lebanon, while its key religious and financial institutions are based in Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>The movement runs an extensive social services network, complete with schools, hospitals, emergency responders and a wide range of charitable organisations serving its supporters.</p>

<p>Its trademark yellow flags and huge portraits of Nasrallah, along with pictures of dead commanders, fighters and "axis of resistance" figures, adorn areas of the country where it is popular.</p>

<p>The United States has considered Hezbollah a "terrorist" organisation for years, blaming it for a series of bombings and hijackings in the 1980s, including one targeting US Marines in Beirut. The European Union applies the classification to the group's armed wing.</p>

<p>In 2022, a UN-backed court sentenced two Hezbollah members in absentia to life imprisonment for a huge Beirut bombing in 2005 that killed Lebanon's former premier Rafic Hariri.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA, on Saturday, announced&nbsp;that Boeing's Starliner capsule will return empty from the International Space Station (ISS), citing ongoing propulsion system problems. This latest development adds to Boeing's woes, with estimated losses in the Starliner program exceeding $1 billion, reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/24/nasa-boeing-starliner-decision-return-empty-spacex-astronauts-iss.html ">CNBC</a>.</p>

<p>Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams will now return on Elon Musk's SpaceX's Crew-9 vehicle in February 2025, after a six-month extended stay on the ISS. The original nine-day test flight was delayed due to issues with Starliner's thrusters.</p>

<p>A "technical disagreement" between NASA and Boeing led to the decision, with NASA prioritising safety and choosing SpaceX for the return mission.</p>

<p>"Boeing has worked very hard with NASA to get the necessary data to make this decision," NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said on Saturday. "We want to further understand the root causes and understand the design improvements so that the Boeing Starliner will serve as an important part of our assured crew access to the ISS." Mr Nelson stressed that test flights like the Starliner mission are "neither safe, nor routine."</p>

<p>Following the decision, NASA will conduct an additional phase of its Flight Readiness Review to determine the optimal time to bring the empty Starliner capsule back to Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite Boeing's assurances that Starliner was safe for emergency crew return, NASA disagreed. Mr Nelson expressed support for Boeing, stating he was "100% certain" that Starliner would launch with a crew again in the future. Boeing also reaffirmed its commitment to safety, saying it would execute the mission as determined by NASA and prepare for a safe uncrewed return.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/boeingspace/status/1827396444959002966?s=46 ">statement on X</a>, Boeing said, "We continue to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return."</p>

<p>Ken Bowersox, NASA associate administrator, said NASA officials were unanimous in their decision to choose SpaceX to bring the crew home. Meanwhile, SpaceX will bring two astronauts along on its Crew-9 vehicle - instead of the four who were originally planned to go - to make room for Wilmore and Williams.</p>

<p>Boeing's Starliner capsule, 'Calypso', has been docked at the International Space Station since June, with its mission extended indefinitely due to ongoing thruster failures. The Starliner crew flight test, intended to be a final milestone for Boeing, has instead become a major setback.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A member of the Reuters team covering the war in Ukraine was missing and two others were hospitalised after a strike on a hotel in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. In a statement, the news agency said that the Hotel Sapphire, where a six-person Reuters crew was staying, was hit "by an apparent missile strike" on Saturday.</p>

<p>"One of our colleagues is unaccounted for, while another two have been taken to hospital for treatment," the agency said.</p>

<p>"Three other colleagues have been accounted for. We are urgently seeking more information, working with the authorities in Kramatorsk, and supporting our colleagues and their families. We will give an update when we have more information," it added.</p>

<p>Vadym Filashkin, governor of Donetsk region, said in a post on Telegram on Sunday morning that "the Russians hit Kramatorsk", and that two journalists were injured, while one was missing after a strike on a hotel.</p>

<p>"Authorities, police and rescuers are working on the spot. Debris clearance and rescue operations are ongoing," he said.</p>

<p>The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on Telegram that it had opened a "pre-trial investigation" into the strike, which it said happened at 10:35 p.m. local time (1935 GMT) on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Russian troops struck the city of Kramatorsk, probably with an Iskander-M missile," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A heart-stopping incident occurred at Gravity Circus in East Sussex when a&nbsp;female circus performer&nbsp;fell off a tightrope 16 feet in the air in front of a horrified audience. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/23/circus-performer-seriously-injured-falling-tightrope-front-crowd-21479970/">Metro</a></em>, a performer was seated on a chair balanced on a pole held by two men as they navigated a tightrope 16 feet in the air. As she adjusted her position, the pole wobbled, causing her foot to slip. She fell from the apparatus, and the chair struck a wire, sending her into a freefalling backflip. The performer hit the ground knees first, spinning until she landed in a fetal position on the metal floor.</p>

<p>The horrific accident, captured on video, has left onlookers shocked and concerned for the performer's well-being.</p>

<p>According to South East Coast Ambulance Service (Seacamb), the woman sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.&nbsp;Seacamb said she suffered from ''facial and other injuries consistent with a fall.''</p>

<p>Witness Hayley Walsh told the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx6wql53n4o" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">BBC</a>,</em> ''It looked like she gave way. She lost her balance and went flying down wrapped around the wire. She smashed down onto the metal floor.''</p>

<p>After the incident, Gravity Circus informed on Facebook that the performer was ''doing well and is in safe hands''.</p>

<p>They said, ''We can confirm that an accident occurred last night involving one of our tightrope performers during the show. In live entertainment and high-risk performances, accidents can unfortunately happen despite stringent safety measures. Our emergency protocols were immediately enacted, and the performer was promptly taken to the hospital. Our primary concern is the well-being of the performers, their families, the high-wire troupe, and our entire circus family. We are closely monitoring the situation and conducting a thorough investigation.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two veteran NASA astronauts with a combined 500 days of previous spaceflight were the first crew launched into space on Boeing's Starliner space capsule, in a June 5 test flight from Florida. They had been scheduled to return in about eight days. Now Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams, both former military test pilots, will not return to Earth until early next year on a SpaceX vehicle. NASA has deemed issues with Starliner's propulsion system too risky to carry its first crew home as planned.</p>

<p>The Starliner capsule sprang leaks and some of its thrusters failed, so their mission at the International Space Station has been extended by months.</p>

<h3><strong>Barry "Butch" Wilmore</strong></h3>

<p>Barry "Butch" Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain, completed four operational deployments flying fighter jets off the decks of aircraft carriers, including 21 combat missions during the first U.S. Gulf War in the 1990s. He also served as a Navy test pilot and flight instructor before joining the NASA astronaut corps in 2000.</p>

<p>He first flew to the space station as a NASA space shuttle pilot in 2009, and returned to the orbiting laboratory in 2014 - launched aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft with two cosmonauts - for a long-duration mission, including several months as station commander.</p>

<p>Before his Starliner mission, Wilmore had logged 178 days in space and completed four spacewalks.</p>

<p>A Tennessee native who played college football while attending Tennessee Tech University, Wilmore holds advanced degrees in electrical engineering and aviation systems. He is married with two daughters.</p>

<h3><strong>Sunita "Suni" Williams</strong></h3>

<p>Sunita "Suni" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter pilot with experience flying more than 30 different rotary aircraft, was deployed as part of a helicopter combat support squadron during the first Gulf War. She later flew in support of Navy disaster relief operations in Florida following Hurricane Andrew.</p>

<p>She returned to the naval test pilot school as a rotary aircraft instructor before being selected for the NASA astronaut program in 1998.</p>

<p>Like Wilmore, Williams first flew to the space station aboard a space shuttle and made a return visit as a Soyuz passenger riding along with two cosmonauts. Both her ISS tours - in 2006-2007 and in 2012 - were long-duration science expeditions.</p>

<p>After two stays aboard the outpost, Williams had set a world record for the most time spent by a woman in orbit outside a spacecraft, logging a total of 50 hours and 40 minutes combined during seven spacewalks. Her record has since been surpassed by fellow astronaut Peggy Whitson.</p>

<p>During her second ISS mission in 2012, Williams became only the second woman designated as commander of the station.</p>

<p>An avid athlete, Williams in 2007 became the first person to complete a marathon in space, competing virtually in the Boston Marathon from orbit on the space station's treadmill to go the distance in four hours and 24 minutes.</p>

<p>Taking the concept to the next level, Williams in 2012 completed the first triathlon in space, again using the treadmill and a stationary bicycle, then performing a mix of weight-lifting and resistance exercises on a fitness machine that approximated swimming in microgravity.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 35 people were killed in two separate bus accidents in Pakistan on Sunday, including 12 pilgrims who had been trying to reach Iran, rescue and hospital officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twenty-three people were killed when the bus they were travelling in plunged into a ravine near the town of Azad Pattan on the border between Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.</p>

<p>Sameena Khan, the head of Tehsil Headquarter Hospital in the town of Kahuta, told AFP that twenty-three bodies had been recovered from the crash site.</p>

<p>"I have lost three members of my family," Tara Zafar, who travelled to the hospital after hearing about the accident, told AFP.</p>

<p>Her father, sister and one-year-old nephew were among the dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I hoped that at least one of them had survived. It's doomsday for my family."</p>

<p>Umar Farooq, a senior government official from Sudhanoti district, where the bus started its journey, confirmed the number of deaths in a phone call with AFP from the crash site.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, 12 men died when their bus crashed into a ravine on the Makran Coastal Highway in Balochistan, after being prevented from crossing into Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"An army crane is on its way to help lift the bus from the ravine to check if passengers are pinned underneath the vehicle. Therefore the death count may rise," police official Aslam Bangulzai, who was at the scene, told AFP.</p>

<p>"This is a particularly treacherous tract of road, with many twists and turns. The driver was speeding and the bus fell into a deep ravine," he added.</p>

<p>The accident occurred in a mountainous area, around 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the nearest town of Uthal and 500 kilometres from the Iran border town of Pishin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The bus was carrying pilgrims on its way to Arbaeen (pilgrimage) but was turned back at the Iran border because their documents had some problems," said Hamood Ur Rehman, a senior government official in the nearby district of Gwadar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Road accidents with high fatalities are common in Pakistan, where safety measures are lax, driver training is poor and transport infrastructure often decrepit.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the bodies of 28 pilgrims who died in a bus crash in Iran were returned to Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bus was carrying 51 Pakistani pilgrims who were passing through Iran to attend the Arbaeen commemoration in Iraq, one of the biggest events of the Shiite calendar, when it overturned and caught fire in front of a checkpoint in Yazd province on Tuesday night, Iranian state TV reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's former textile and jute minister Golam Dastagir Gazi has been arrested as the police take stern measures against officials and ministers of the ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League government, according to media reports on Sunday.</p>

<p>The 76-year-old leader was detained late Saturday night from a house in the Piergoli area of the capital Dhaka around 3 am, The Daily Star newspaper quoted Paltan police station officer-in-charge Mollah Mohammad Khalid Hussain as saying.</p>

<p>The Dhaka Metropolitan Police detained him and brought him to the Detective Branch (DB) office, according to The Dhaka Tribune.</p>

<p>Gazi was kept at the DB office as the police station is badly damaged following recent violence, Hussain said, adding that a group of people besieged the house after knowing his location there.</p>

<p>However, the police officer did not provide any details regarding the case for which he was arrested.</p>

<p>Earlier, a case of murder was filed against 105 individuals, including Hasina and Gazi, at Rupganj police station in Narayanganj.</p>

<p>Gazi was elected MP from Rupganj-1 constituency in Narayanganj in the 12th parliamentary elections held in January with Awami League's boat symbol.</p>

<p>On Saturday, a Dhaka court placed Salman F Rahman, private industry affairs adviser to Hasina, former law minister Anisul Huq, former social welfare minister Dipu Moni and two others on different terms of remand for interrogation in four murder cases.</p>

<p>Apart from the three, former chief whip ASM Feroz and former army officer Major General Ziaul Ahsan were also placed on remand in murder cases.</p>

<p>Cases have been filed against many officials or ministers of the ousted Hasina-led government after she resigned and fled to India on August 5 following massive protests against the quota reform system in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Most leaders of the Awami League have gone into hiding since Hasina's resignation.</p>

<p>Many Hasina-led Awami League party members are in jail after the new interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge on August 8 following the fall of the previous government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/former-alaska-airlines-pilot-shut-engines-flight-shares/story?id=113066835">ABC's "Good Morning America," </a>Joseph Emerson, a 44-year-old off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot, broke his silence about the shocking incident that occurred on October 22, 2023. Mr Emerson, who was seated in the cockpit's jump seat, allegedly attempted to shut down the plane's engines by activating the fire suppression system while the aircraft was airborne. He attributed his actions to a mental breakdown, stating that he had been struggling with depression and had ingested psychedelic mushrooms 48 hours before the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the latest interview, Mr Emerson opened up about the emotional triggers that led him to consume the psychedelic mushrooms, revealing that he had spent the previous weekend reminiscing about his best friend, Scott, who died a few years back. He began to lose touch with reality and began thinking he was "trapped" on an "imaginary" plane.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0">''What I thought was, 'This is going to wake me up. I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,'' Mr Emerson said, per <em>ABC.</em></p>

<p>"There was a feeling of being trapped, like, 'Am I trapped in this aeroplane and now I'll never go home?'' he added.</p>

<p>When the plane landed, Emerson was taken into custody by Port of Portland police and charged with 83 counts of attempted murder.&nbsp;Moments after he was removed from that cockpit, he sent his wife Sarah a text message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I made a big mistake," the message read.</p>

<p>He spent the next 45 days in jail before he was granted bond. The murder charges against him now have been dropped, but the former pilot still faces over 80 state and federal charges.&nbsp;He was released from custody in December and is awaiting trial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, I accept responsibility for the choices that I made. They're my choices. What I hope through the judicial processes is that the entirety of not just 30 seconds of the event, but the entirety of my experience is accounted for as society judges me on what happened. And I will accept what the debt that society says I owe,'' Mr Emerson said.</p>

<p>The former pilot has now started a&nbsp;nonprofit organization called <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.clearskiesaheadnonprofit.org/">Clear Skies Ahead</a>, which aims to provide vital support to pilots struggling with mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years after the suicide bomber attack at Afghanistan's Abbey Gate that killed 13 US service personnel and about 170 Afghan civilians, the network behind the perpetrator is "pretty degraded" but not eliminated, the Pentagon's civilian commando chief said.</p>

<p>"A lot of allied and partner disruptions" of the ISIS-K network have reduced its "capability to conduct such an attack," Christopher Maier, assistant secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict, said in a brief interview after a breakfast meeting with reporters Friday.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden promised on the day of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/satellite-image-offers-rare-insight-into-kabul-airport-blast-targets-599477">attack outside Hamid Karzai International Airport</a> that "we will not forgive, we will not forget, we will hunt you down and make you pay." Maier said "we are in the process of doing that," and "we have made significant dents in this network that conducted the Abbey Gate attack."</p>

<p>The attack three years ago next Monday marked a devastating low point in an operation that critics have lambasted as chaotic even as 124,000 Afghans were evacuated amid the US exit from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover of the country.</p>

<p>Republicans have seized on the attack to blast Biden's foreign policy. During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July, former President Donald Trump said US standing in the world "began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump forged a February 2020 deal with the Taliban, but not the Afghan government, that set an initial timetable for US troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, which Biden modified. Trump and the Republican Party blame Biden - and now Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee to succeed him - for how the withdrawal was carried out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the breakfast with reporters, Maier said "we continue to assess that Abbey Gate" was the work of "more than one individual" who benefited from the ISIS-K infrastructure. Since then, he said, the US and partners "have had clear cases where we've been able to disrupt the network that was associated with Abbey Gate."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One of the things we have been able to benefit from is Central Asian countries more attuned from the threat from Afghanistan," he said. "Some of the recent plots that have been foiled point to direct support from some of these partners," he said, without naming the countries involved.</p>

<p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to release its review of the withdrawal from Afghanistan early next month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The new behind-the-scenes details from HR McMaster, Donald Trump's second national security adviser, come as Americans are set to decide whether the former president should return to the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump was determined during his presidency to cozy up to Vladimir Putin despite Russia's interference in US democracy and objections by advisers, a former top aide claims in a new book, according to an excerpt published Saturday.</p>

<p>The new behind-the-scenes details from HR McMaster, Trump's second national security adviser, come as Americans are set to decide whether the former president should return to the White House and as US officials warn of fresh foreign election meddling.</p>

<p>"After over a year in this job, I cannot understand Putin's hold on Trump," McMaster, in an excerpt from his memoir published in the Wall Street Journal, says he told his wife in March 2018.</p>

<p>A former lieutenant-general, McMaster became Trump's national security adviser in February 2017, and says that from the beginning, discussions of Vladimir Putin and Russia "were difficult to have with the president."</p>

<p>He says Trump connected "all topics involving Russia" to the federal investigation into Moscow's interference in the 2016 election and possible ties with Trump's campaign, a probe which would dog his entire presidency.</p>

<p>US officials have warned this year of new efforts by foreign powers, including Russia and Iran, to meddle in the November election, in which Trump is facing Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>McMaster says an "overconfident" president Trump sought early in his administration to improve relations with Russia by building a personal rapport with Putin.</p>

<p>But the Russian president, "a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump's ego and insecurities with flattery," McMaster says.</p>

<p>"Trump had revealed his vulnerability to this approach, his affinity for strongmen and his belief that he alone could forge a good relationship with Putin," he added.</p>

<p>McMaster detailed several instances of friction with Trump over his approach toward Putin, with the disagreements ultimately leading to his dismissal.</p>

<p>Following Putin's election to a fourth term in March 2018, McMaster says Trump wanted to congratulate him by phone, but that he explained to the president that the vote had been rigged.</p>

<p>A call was scheduled nonetheless.</p>

<p>Before Trump called Putin, McMaster says he warned him about the conversation potentially being spun by the Kremlin as tacit support of the election process and to boost Russia's image, in tatters at the time over an assassination attempt on UK soil.</p>

<p>He said he asked Trump: "As Russia tries to delegitimize our legitimate elections, why would you help him legitimize his illegitimate election?"</p>

<p>Trump nonetheless called Putin and congratulated him, and then requested the Russian president be invited to the White House.</p>

<p>Trump's aversion to McMaster, he said, "was because I was the principal voice telling him that Putin was using him and other politicians in both parties in an effort to shake Americans' confidence in our democratic principles, institutions and processes."</p>

<p>McMaster was replaced just days later by John Bolton, who was also fired about a year-and-a-half later.</p>

<p>While Trump had four national security advisers during his term, President Joe Biden has had one since taking office in 2021.</p>

<p>"With Donald Trump, most everybody gets used up, and my time had come," McMaster wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon- based militant group Hezbollah fired a large number of missiles at Israel on Sunday, retaliating for the assassination of their senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire since October 7, while avoiding a major escalation. While both sides had avoided a major escalation, tensions rose significantly after a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people. While Hezbollah denied involvement in that attack, Israel responded with targeted airstrikes, assassinating Fuad Shukr and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Iranian-backed movement said the attack was a response to Israel's actions and announced that they had completed the "first phase" of its retaliation against the Jewish State, reported Reuters.</p>

<p><strong>Who was Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr?</strong></p>

<p>Fuad Shukr, also known by the alias "Al-Hajj Mohsin", was a senior commander in Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon, widely regarded as a terrorist organisation by several countries, including the United States and Israel. Shukr was among the founding members of Hezbollah during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. He was part of the generation of Lebanese Shi'ites who aligned with Iran's Revolutionary Guards to establish the group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was a close associate of Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah's former military commander who was assassinated in Damascus in 2008. Shukr's prominence in the group grew after Mughniyeh's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US accused Shukr of playing a central role in the 1983 bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 US military personnel. This attack is one of the deadliest against American forces in the Middle East. The US government had placed a bounty of up to $5 million on Shukr's head through its Rewards for Justice program.</p>

<p>Fuad Shukr served as a senior military commander in Hezbollah's forces in southern Lebanon and was a member of the group's highest military body, the Jihad Council. He played a key role in Hezbollah's military operations in Syria, particularly in supporting President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war. Hezbollah's involvement in Syria was crucial to Assad's survival during the conflict's early years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fuad Shukr was also a special adviser to Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and was a member of the Shura Council, a key decision-making body within the organisation.</p>

<p>On July 30, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-hezbollah-commander-fuad-shukr-targeted-by-israel-in-beirut-6226900">Fuad Shukr was targeted</a> by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Following the airstrike, Lebanese security sources reported that Shukr was critically injured. His death was later confirmed by Israeli broadcast reports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">The Great Barrier Reef will continue to deteriorate, largely to climate change, and the window to secure its future is rapidly closing. That is the sobering conclusion of a major new report into the state of the reef.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The <a href="https://www2.gbrmpa.gov.au/our-work/outlook-report-2024">report was released</a> by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. It confirms what scientists have long known: humanity is killing the Great Barrier Reef, and other reefs around the world, by failing to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I visited parts of the southern Great Barrier Reef where mass coral bleaching and death <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-drone-imagery-reveals-97-of-coral-dead-at-a-lizard-island-reef-after-last-summers-mass-bleaching-233325">had just occurred</a>. The picture was devastating. Vast swathes of coral were bleached a ghostly white. It was interspersed with bright flashes of pink and blue: a final, heartbreaking release of coral pigment as the organism makes a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00006956">last-ditch effort to survive</a>. I've since learned much of that coral is now dead.</p>

<h3><strong>Climate change is not the only threat</strong></h3>

<p>The report said climate-driven disturbances are compounding the effects of other chronic damage to the reef from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>unsustainable fishing</li>
	<li>pollution</li>
	<li>sediment runoff</li>
	<li>outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish.</li>
</ul>

<p>Among other key findings of the report were that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>most populations of marine turtles have declined</li>
	<li>species such as seabirds, sharks, rays, dugongs and seagrasses have recovered in some areas and plateaued or declined in others</li>
	<li>populations of estuarine crocodiles are recovering</li>
	<li>many species in decline are listed as threatened or protected.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Strong leadership is needed</strong></h3>

<p>I first visited the Great Barrier Reef in 1980, as a university student. My interest in it has never waned. It's one of those incredible bits of nature that defies description.</p>

<p>The reef's World Heritage listing is proof of its outstanding global value. Australians love and feel pride in this vast and stunning place. The reef supports the livelihoods and wellbeing of many, including Traditional Owners who have cared for it over thousands of generations. It sustains all of us: economically, culturally and spiritually.</p>

<p>You might see a photo of healthy-looking coral and think the reef must be doing well. But I have seen the problem first-hand over many years. The reef is suffering badly – and every fraction of a degree of global warming compounds the harm.</p>

<p>Humanity must take urgent action to limit global temperature rise. But we are failing. We are failing the Great Barrier Reef and indeed, coral reefs across the planet.</p>

<p>There was a time when governments and reef managers were not willing to admit the extent of the problem. I don't think that's the case anymore. As the report states:</p>

<p>2024 opens a new chapter for the reef. Future warming already locked into the climate system means that further degradation is inevitable. This is the sobering calculus of climate change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Climate change is a global problem, but Australia is undeniably part of it. This nation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/12/australian-fossil-fuel-exports-ranked-second-globally-for-climate-damage-with-no-plan-for-reduction#:%7E:text=Australian%20fossil%20fuel%20exports%20in,thermal%20coal%20exports%20in%202022.">cannot export fossil fuels</a> to be burnt overseas if we want to save the Great Barrier Reef. Dealing with this will take strong political leadership, from the prime minister down.</p>

<p>Humanity has all the facts in front of us. Earth is in an unchartered time of very rapid change.

       <description><![CDATA[Pavel Durov, the CEO of the popular messaging app Telegram, was arrested by French police on Saturday evening at Le Bourget airport.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pavel Durov, the CEO of the popular messaging app Telegram, was arrested by French police on Saturday evening at Le Bourget airport, located just north of Paris. The 39-year-old Franco-Russian billionaire, who had arrived from Baku, Azerbaijan, is expected to appear in court on Sunday to face serious allegations, sources informed AFP.</p>

<p><strong>Why was Pavel Durov arrested?</strong></p>

<p>The arrest comes as part of a preliminary investigation headed by France's OFMIN (Office for Preventing Violence Against Minors). The office had issued a warrant for Mr Durov's arrest, citing allegations that include money laundering, drug trafficking and the sharing of child sexual abuse content on Telegram. The platform's lack of moderation and its alleged use by criminal groups have been central to the investigation.</p>

<p>Local news outlets BFMTV and TF1 reported that the investigation focused on Telegram's potential exploitation by criminal entities, as well as Mr Durov's alleged failure to implement effective measures to prevent illegal activities on the platform.</p>

<p>American commentator Tucker Carlson stated that the Telegram CEO was arrested for refusing to "censor the truth."</p>

<p>"Pavel Durov sits in a French jail tonight, a living warning to any platform owner who refuses to censor the truth at the behest of governments and intel agencies," he wrote on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Pavel Durov left Russia when the government tried to control his social media company, Telegram. But in the end, it wasn't Putin who arrested him for allowing the public to exercise free speech.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><strong>'Russia's Mark Zuckerberg'</strong></p>

<p>Pavel Durov, often referred to as "Russia's Mark Zuckerberg", has a long history of defying government demands. Before founding Telegram, he created Vkontakte (VK), Russia's largest social network, but was forced to leave the country in 2014 after refusing to comply with government orders to hand over data on Ukrainian protesters. Since then, Mr Durov has lived in various countries, eventually settling in Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered.</p>

<p>His stance on privacy and his refusal to censor content on Telegram have made him a controversial figure. In an interview earlier this year with Tucker Carlson, Mr Durov stressed on his commitment to keeping Telegram "neutral" and free from geopolitical influence.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ep. 94 The social media app Telegram has over 900 million users around the world. Its founder Pavel Durov sat down with us at his offices in Dubai for his first on-camera interview in almost a decade. <a href="https://t.co/NEb3KzWOg8">pic.twitter.com/NEb3KzWOg8</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><strong>'Enough of Telegram's impunity'</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday, one of the investigators said that they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man. "Enough of Telegram's impunity", the investigator stated, as per AFP.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced that it is taking steps to "clarify" the situation, particularly whether the founder of Telegram has indeed been detained. Pavel Durov, who became a naturalised French citizen in August 2021, also holds citizenship in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p><strong>About Telegram</strong></p>

<p>Telegram is known for its end-to-end encryption and commitment to user privacy. It has become one of the most downloaded apps globally, with nearly one billion users. Its focus on security has made it a preferred platform for users who prioritise privacy, but this same feature has also made it attractive to criminal organisations and extremist groups.</p>

<p>In recent years, Telegram has faced criticism for allowing the spread of disinformation, extremist content and illegal activities, including far-right activism that has sparked violence. Despite these controversies, the platform remains popular, particularly in regions like Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states, including in conflict zones, where it serves as a vital tool for communication.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel today said that is launched strikes inside Lebanon as a "self-defence act" to prevent a Hezbollah attack on civilians, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said. The military also warned Israelis to expect incoming missiles and drones launched by Hezbollah, with air alert sirens sounding across the country's north.</p>

<p>The IDF claimed that they had information that Hezbollah was preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory.</p>

<p>"The IDF identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory. In response to these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon. Israeli Air Force fighter jets are currently striking targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization that posed an imminent threat to the citizens of the State of Israel," IDF said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israel's international Ben Gurion airport has canceled all take-offs and landings for several hours, the country's airport authority said.</p>

<p>“Due to the security situation, the morning departures from Ben Gurion International Airport will be postponed, and will not take off in the next few hours,” the authority said. “Flights en route to Ben Gurion will be directed to land at alternative airports in the region.”</p>

<p>The Middle East has been on edge for weeks after Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a senior commander of the group as well as the assassination in Tehran of Hamas's political leader, also blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>The strikes came as negotiators were meeting in Cairo in a last-ditch effort to conclude a halt to fighting in Gaza and a return of Israeli and foreign hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the October 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.</p>

<p>That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon-based Hezbollah announced on Sunday large-scale rocket and drone launches towards Israel in an "initial response" to a top commander's killing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a 48-hour nationwide state of emergency from 06:00 am (0300 GMT) Sunday after the Israeli military launched what it called pre-emptive strikes in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The declaration on the state of emergency enables the IDF (Israeli military) to issue instructions to the citizens of Israel, including limiting gatherings and closing sites where it may be relevant," Gallant said, in a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>Lebanon-based Hezbollah announced on Sunday large-scale rocket and drone launches towards Israel in an "initial response" to a top commander's killing, after Israel's military said it was carrying out a series of pre-emptive strikes against the group.</p>

<p>"In the context of the initial response" to the killing of its commander Fuad Shukr last month, Hezbollah said it "began an air attack with a large number of drones" targeting deep into Israel, a statement from the group said. Fighters also targeted "a number of enemy positions and barracks and Iron Dome platforms... with a large number of rockets", it said, adding that "military operations will take some time to complete".</p>

<p>The Middle East has been on edge for weeks after Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a senior commander of the group as well as the assassination in Tehran of Hamas's political leader, also blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>In a message addressed to the residents of southern Lebanon early Sunday morning, the Israeli military said: "We are monitoring Hezbollah's preparations to carry out large-scale attacks on Israeli territory near your homes. You are in danger. We are attacking and eliminating Hezbollah threats.</p>

<p>"Anyone who is near areas where Hezbollah operates should leave immediately to protect themselves and their families," the message posted on Telegram said.</p>

<p>In a separate statement released shortly before 5:00 am (0100 GMT), the military said its jets were striking targets in Lebanon "that posed an imminent threat" to Israelis.</p>

<p>Announcing the strikes in a video released at the same time, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that "Hezbollah will soon fire rockets, and possibly missiles and UAVs, towards Israeli territory".</p>

<p>"From right next to the homes of Lebanese civilians in the south of Lebanon, we can see that Hezbollah is preparing to launch an extensive attack on Israel, while endangering the Lebanese civilians" he added, urging civilians there "to move out of harm's way".</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's ongoing aggression risks dragging the people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, and the whole region into a wider escalation."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would hold a security cabinet meeting at 0400 GMT, his office said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In key US swing state Michigan, Democratic voters of Arab and Middle Eastern heritage say Kamala Harris is going to have to win them back after they were alienated by President Joe Biden's handling of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p>The town of Dearborn, home to 110,000 people and a cultural hub for Arab Americans, could play a decisive role in deciding the fate of the battleground state in November's presidential election.</p>

<p>Members of the community interviewed by AFP said they were willing to hear what the vice president had to say and weigh their options -- a marked change from the outright hostility towards Biden.</p>

<p>"We are in a listening mode right now," said Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News.</p>

<p>Accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention on Thursday, Harris pledged to get a Gaza ceasefire "done" and ensure Palestinians realize their right to "dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."</p>

<p>But there was outrage among pro-Palestinian delegates that their request for a speaker spot at the convention was rejected. The group Muslim Women for Harris-Walz said the decision sent a "terrible message" and announced it was disbanding and withdrawing its support from the campaign.</p>

<p>Harris, who has vowed "not to be silent" about the suffering of Palestinians, recently met with members of the national "Uncommitted" movement that led the charge against Biden during the Democratic primary process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although she made no firm promises, leaders said she impressed them with a show of empathy.</p>

<p>At the forefront of concerns are Israel's 10 months of military operations in Gaza, which have devastated the Palestinian enclave since the war began in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>

<h3><strong>Growing influence&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Michigan, home to the "big three" automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- has long been an essential stop for White House aspirants.</p>

<p>Economic downturns in the 1970s led many to leave the so-called "Rust Belt" state, just as unrest in the Middle East brought new waves of Lebanese, Iraqi, Yemeni, and Palestinian immigrants.</p>

<p>"We're a global city, where nearly 55 per cent of our residents are of Arab background," said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud in a recent interview. "For many of us, when you talk about what's happening in Gaza, these are our family and our friends."</p>

<p>Famous as the birthplace of Henry Ford, Dearborn appears at first glance just like any small US city, with its wide thoroughfares and strip malls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it is also home to the Islamic Center of America -- the largest mosque in the country -- and countless Middle Eastern supermarkets, eateries, and coffee shops.</p>

<p>When Siblani first started his newspaper in the mid-1980s, he remembers the then-mayor campaigned on a platform to address the "Arab problem."&nbsp;</p>

<p>But as the community's numbers grew, and the children of blue-collar factory workers took up positions as lawyers, doctors, and businesspeople, so too did their political influence.</p>

<h3><strong>'Lesser of two evils'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Historically socially conservative, Arab and Muslim Americans heavily favoured George W. Bush in the 2000 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years of the US "War on Terror" -- which saw wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, and Muslim American communities put under stricter law enforcement scrutiny -- swung them firmly to the Democratic camp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018, southeast Michiganders elected Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American in Congress -- a milestone for the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three Arab-American mayors have also recently been elected in suburbs known for historic racism towards non-whites.</p>

<p>Angered by former president Donald Trump's travel ban on Muslim countries, support for Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, and more, Dearborn voters overwhelmingly backed Biden in 2020, helping secure Michigan for the Democrats by a slim margin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents here are tired, however, of being asked to vote for the "lesser of two evils" and instead want candidates who will deliver on demands, such as a permanent ceasefire and an end to the supply of weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>"I think VP Harris has a window of opportunity," said Faye Nemer, a community activist and CEO of the MENA American Chamber of Commerce. "She can either continue President Biden's legacy or set her own agenda."</p>

<p>Arab Americans in Dearborn have been impressed by Harris's pick of Tim Walz as her running mate. Walz has taken a conciliatory approach to opponents of the war, unlike Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who took a hard line against college protesters.</p>

<p>But demands are hardening.</p>

<p>"We don't want crumbs anymore," declared Soujoud Hamade, a business lawyer and long-time Democrat, who vowed to vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein if Harris did not deliver on the campaign trail.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death toll from the worst floods in decades in southern Thailand and northern Malaysia climbed to at least 12 on Saturday, authorities said, as tens of thousands of people were evacuated due to rising water levels in the past three days.</p>

<p>In southern Thailand, the floods have impacted nearly 534,000 households, with the death toll climbing to nine from four reported on Friday and leaving thousands in 200 temporary shelters that have been set up in affected areas, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said.</p>

<p>The Chana district of Songkhla province suffered the worst floods in 50 years, with video footage showing people being carried out to trucks from their homes inundated by a torrent of flood water.</p>

<p>Another video footage showed rescuers in Sateng Nok District of Yala province carrying a baby out from the roof of a home hit by the floods on Saturday.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Malaysia, the floods have impacted nearly 139,000 people in nine states, leaving three dead since Friday, according to the National Disaster Command Centre.</p>

<p>Thailand's Meteorological Department said that several areas in southern Thailand can expect more heavy rain on Saturday and warn of more flash floods in effected areas.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Syrian army has said dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo, forcing army to redeploy in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian army said on Saturday dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo, forcing the army to redeploy in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years.</p>

<p>Russia's Defence Ministry said its air force had carried out strikes on Syrian rebels in support of the country's army, Russian news agencies reported. The strikes followed what was the boldest rebel assault for years in a civil war where front lines had largely been frozen since 2020.</p>

<p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, once known as the Nusra Front, is designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Russia, Turkey and other states. Assad is a close Moscow ally.</p>

<p>In Washington, the White House National Security Council said it was closely monitoring the situation and had been in contact with regional capitals over the last 48 hours.</p>

<p>NSC spokesperson Sean Savett said Syria's refusal to engage in a political process and its reliance on Russia and Iran had "created the conditions now unfolding, including the collapse of Assad regime lines in northwest Syria."</p>

<p>Savett said the U.S. had nothing to do with the offensive led by "a designated terrorist organization" and "urged de-escalation ... and a serious and credible political process" under the 2015 U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254, which laid out the steps for a ceasefire and political transition.</p>

<p>The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end, although most major fighting halted years ago after Iran and Russia helped Assad's government win control of most land and all major cities.</p>

<p>Aleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war's major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country's largest city.</p>

<p>"I am a son of Aleppo, and was displaced from it eight years ago, in 2016. Thank God we just returned. It is an indescribable feeling," said Ali Jumaa, a rebel fighter, in television footage filmed inside the city.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the rebel advance, the Syrian army command said insurgents had entered much of Aleppo.</p>

<p>After the army said it was preparing a counterattack, airstrikes targeted rebel gatherings and convoys in the city, the pro-Damascus newspaper al-Watan reported. One strike caused casualties in Aleppo's Basel square, a resident told Reuters.</p>

<p>The state-run Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of the Enemy Parties in Syria said missile and bomb strikes against the rebels had targeted "militant concentrations, command posts, depots, and artillery positions" in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. It claimed about 300 rebel fighters had been killed.</p>

<p>Images filmed on Saturday showed people posing for photos on a toppled statue of Bassil al-Assad, late brother of the president. Fighters zipped around the city in trucks and milled around in the streets. A man waved a Syrian opposition flag as he stood near Aleppo's historic citadel.</p>

<p>The Syrian military command said militants had attacked in large numbers and from multiple directions, prompting "our armed forces to carry out a redeployment operation aimed at strengthening the defence lines in order to absorb the attack, preserve the lives of civilians and soldiers".</p>

<p>The rebels also took control of Aleppo airport, according to a statement by their operations room and a security source.</p>

<p>Two rebel sources also said the insurgents had captured the city of Maraat al Numan in Idlib province, bringing all of that area under their control.</p>

<p>The fighting revives the long-simmering Syrian conflict as the wider region is roiled by wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday.</p>

<p>With Assad backed by Russia and Iran, and Turkey supporting some of the rebels in the northwest where it maintains troops, the offensive has brought into focus the conflict's knotted geopolitics. Fighting in the northwest had largely abated since Turkey and Russia reached a de-escalation agreement in 2020.</p>

<h2><strong>RUSSIAN, TURKISH MINISTERS TALK</strong></h2>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, discussing the situation in Syria, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Both sides expressed serious concerns at the dangerous development of the situation," the ministry said. They agreed it was necessary to coordinate joint actions to stabilise the situation in the country.</p>

<p>Turkish security officials had said on Thursday that Ankara had prevented operations which opposition groups wanted to organise, in order to avoid further tensions in the region.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Lavrov in a phone call that the rebel attacks were part of an Israeli-U.S. plan to destabilise the region, Iranian state media said.</p>

<p>The Syrian Civil Defense, a rescue service operating in opposition-held parts of Syria, said in a post on X that Syrian government and Russian aircraft carried out airstrikes on residential neighbourhoods in rebel-held Idlib, killing four civilians and wounding six others.</p>

<p>Two Syrian military sources said Russia has promised Damascus extra military aid that would start arriving in the next 72 hours.</p>

<p>The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which spearhead the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that control much of northeastern and eastern Syria and have long had a foothold in Aleppo, widened their control in the city as government troops left, a senior YPG source said.</p>

<p>Mustafa Abdul Jaber, a commander in the Jaish al-Izza rebel brigade, said the rebels' speedy advance had been helped by a lack of Iran-backed manpower to support the government in the broader Aleppo province.</p>

<p>Iran's regional allies have suffered a series of blows at the hands of Israel as the Gaza war has expanded through the Middle East.</p>

<p>The opposition fighters have said the campaign was in response to stepped-up strikes in recent weeks against civilians by the Russian and Syrian air forces on areas of Idlib province, and to preempt any attacks by the Syrian army.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mob surrounded senior Bangladesh journalist Munni Saha in Dhaka last night and accused her of spreading misinformation and "doing everything to make Bangladesh a part of India". Ms Saha was heckled as she kept saying, "This is also my country". Eventually, a police team came and took her into custody.</p>

<p>According to reports in Bangladesh media, Ms Saha was wanted in a case linked to a student's death during the anti-reservation protests in the neighbouring country that led to its former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Police said Ms Saha was rescued from Dhaka's Kawran Bazar area, where a mob had surrounded her.</p>

<p>Rezaul Karim Mallik, a senior officer of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told The Daily Star Newspaper, "People handed her over to the police. She suffered a panic attack. We have released her after considering her health condition and the fact that she is a woman journalist." Ms Saha has been asked to seek bail from court and comply with police summons in the future.</p>

<p>In a video that has now gone viral, Ms Saha is seen surrounded by a mob. A voice is heard accusing her of misguiding people regarding the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny that claimed 57 lives. "You are doing everything you can to make this country a part of India. The blood of students is on your hands," the journalist is told as she nods in denial.</p>

<p>"How can you be a citizen of this country and harm this country," she is told. Ms Saha responds, "How have I harmed? This is also my country."</p>

<p>The 55-year-old journalist is the former news head of Bengali channel ATN News. After the Sheikh Hasina administration was toppled, she and several other journalists were charged with crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>The heckling of Ms Saha comes amid concerns over the condition of minority Hindus in Bangladesh after the regime change. A Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was arrested in Dhaka last week after a Hindu community's protest demanding legal protection and a ministry for minority affairs. The Hindu priest, who was earlier associated with ISKCON, faces a sedition case, allegedly for his remarks on the targeting of Hindus.</p>

<p>ISKCON has now said that two more monks, Adipurush Shyam Das and Ranganath Das Brahmachari, have been arrested after they met Chinmoy Krishna Das. The vice-president of ISKCON Kolkata also said that rioters had vandalised the ISKCON centre in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Following Hasina's ouster, an interim government helmed by Grameen Bank founder and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken charge. Over the past few months, multiple reports of minority Hindus being targeted in Bangladesh have emerged.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the priest's arrest, India expressed concern over the rise of "extremist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation" in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs said that India has consistently raised the issue of targeted attacks on Hindus and other minorities with the Bangladesh government. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has urged the interim government in Bangladesh to take steps to protect minorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Canadian court has granted bail to Khalistani terrorist Arshdeep Singh Gill, alias Arsh Dalla, the de facto chief of the banned Khalistan Tiger Force, amid India's push for his extradition. The Khalistani terrorist was granted bail on the condition of furnishing a surety bond of $30,000. The next hearing in his case is scheduled for February 24, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dalla was arrested in Canada's Halton in October after he was injured in an attack by unknown shooters. Since then, India has been trying to extradite him from Canada. Sources said that the Khalistni terrorist was granted despite non-cooperation from the Indian authorities.</p>

<p>They said that despite the bail order, India will continue to follow up on the issue with the Canadian authorities.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Push For Dalla's Extradition</strong></h2>

<p>Last month, the Foreign Ministry said that a court in Canada's Ontario had listed its extradition request for hearing and that it had sent separate requests to verify financial details as provided last year. The ministry labelled Dalla a "proclaimed offender" named in over 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion and terrorist acts, including terror financing. He was designated a 'terrorist' in January last year and is also an accused in multiple cases filed by the National Investigation Agency.</p>

<p>According to sources, the Khalistani terrorist has been in direct contact with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI. Delhi also believes that he has taken over the reins of the Khalistani terror outfit after Hardeep Nijjar was shot dead in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Arsh Dalla's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Sources said that Dalla, a native of Punjab's Moga district, was arrested in Canada's Ontario on October 28. According to sources, Arsh Dalla was passing through the Halton area in a car with his partner Gurjant Singh, when there was an accidental fire from the weapon kept in the vehicle.</p>

<p>"The bullet hit Dalla's right hand, and Singh was also injured. They were admitted to the hospital, where authorities alerted police about them. When questioned about injuries, Dalla then told cops a fake story of an attack on him," they said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the probe, the Canadian police searched their vehicle - a grey Dodge Durango - and found bullet marks on the SUV, and also found two bullet casings on the floor of the passenger's seat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A day later, Dalla's house was searched and a Taurus 9mm handgun, with a loaded magazine, was recovered, as well as a rifle, a shotgun, and two high-capacity magazines in a gun safe. Dalla and his associate, Gurjant Singh, were arrested and booked under several serious charges, including illegal possession of weapons and tampering with evidence.</p>

<h2><strong>Rise of Arsh Dalla</strong></h2>

<p>Dalla, once a local gangster from Dala village of Punjanb's Moga, climbed the list of India's most wanted terrorists after taking over the reins of KTF following Nijjar's assassination last year. He began his criminal career as a local gangster before relocating to Canada in 2020 on a study visa. He returned to Punjab after a dispute with gangster Sukha Lumma. Later, he along with his associates, killed Lumma and fled to Canada again. According to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Dalla now lives in Surrey, British Columbia, with his family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per sources, Dalla recruited young people from Punjab and Haryana via social media to expand his terror network.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bryan Johnson, a millionaire tech entrepreneur leading the longevity movement, is known for his ambitious efforts to reverse ageing, extend health spans, and push the limits of human lifespan to 150 years. His latest post on X, discussing night-time erections, has generated significant attention online. What makes this even more interesting is Mr Johnson's use of Bollywood songs to illustrate his points about these erections.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson has been transparent about using his night-time erections as a "biomarker" for cardiovascular and sexual health. In a recent post, he shared a clip from the 1994 Bollywood film Andaz, featuring Anil Kapoor and Juhi Chawla, along with the song Khada Hai, which is known for its suggestive lyrics. He captioned the video, writing, "Nighttime erections are a biomarker for cardiovascular, physiological, and sexual health."</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>But Mr Johnson didn't stop there. In a follow-up post, he shared an excerpt from the song Choo Lo by The Local Train, adding, "When your night-time erections are shorter than Lagaan's runtime..."</p>

<p>After this initial post, Mr Johnson's public admission that he doesn't wear underwear sparked even more curiosity. He later shared a quirky, widely circulated video featuring a woman who gained fame on social media for provocatively asking about the colour of people's underwear.&nbsp;In a shirtless video, Johnson said, "Main chaddi nahi pehenta (I don't wear underwear)." He captioned the post, "It's not about the color of your underpants. It's about the length of your nighttime erections."</p>

<p>A user joked, "Whoever is suggesting you bollywood songs needs to be arrested. Being 'too accurate' is dangerous."</p>

<p>"A standing ovation is what you'll receive... when you arrive," another user remarked.</p>

<p>Some users speculated that it is YouTuber and Comedian Tanmay Bhat's doing "Reveal your social media agency for the India tour already. PS: is it Tanmay?"</p>

<p>The fourth user commented, "Acing the meme game Bryan. Love it!"</p>

<p>"Top tier marketing," the fifth user wrote.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sree Narayana Guru's message of universal human unity is pertinent today when hate all across is on the rise, Pope Francis has said. He said the social reformer's message is "pertinent to our world today, where we witness growing instances of intolerance and hatred between peoples and nations."</p>

<p>The Pope made the remarks while addressing faith leaders and representatives gathered on Saturday in the Vatican to mark the centenary celebrations of the all-religion conference organised by the Sree Narayana Guru in Aluva in Ernakulam district.</p>

<p>The Pope said the troubled state of the world today can partly be attributed to the failure to uphold the teachings of religions.</p>

<p>The Guru, he said, dedicated his life to promote a social and religious awakening by his message that all human beings, regardless of their ethnicity or their religious and cultural traditions, are members of the single human family.</p>

<p>"He insisted that there should be no discrimination against anyone in any way and at any level," the Pope said.</p>

<p>"Sadly, displays of discrimination and exclusion, tensions and violence-based differences of ethnic or social origin, race, colour, language, and religion are a daily experience of many individuals and communities, most especially among the poor, the powerless and those without a voice," he said.</p>

<p>Referring to the Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together, which he signed along with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmad Al-Tayyeb in February 2019, the Pope said, "We stated that God has created all human beings equal in rights, duties, and dignity, and has called them to live together as brothers and sisters".</p>

<p>The Pope said, "Failure to follow the noble teachings of religions is one of the causes responsible for the troubled situation in which our world finds itself today." He emphasised the need to strengthen unity in diversity, promote harmonious coexistence amid differences, and act as peacemakers despite the inevitable challenges and difficulties.</p>

<p>"As followers of our respective religious traditions, we ought always to cooperate with all people of goodwill in promoting 'a culture of respect, dignity, compassion, reconciliation and fraternal solidarity,' he said, recalling the message shared in the Joint Declaration of Istiqlal this past September.</p>

<p>The conference in the Vatican, organised with the support of the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue, was attended by prominent religious leaders from Kerala.</p>

<p>Sree Narayana Guru (1856–1928), a renowned spiritual leader and social reformer from Kerala, championed social equality, denounced caste discrimination, and advocated unity and spiritual enlightenment.</p>

<p>Born into a backward Hindu family, he dedicated his life to breaking caste barriers and promoting universal values like compassion, non-violence, and religious harmony.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bilt Rewards CEO Mr Jain recently shared advice for aspiring entrepreneurs]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech entrepreneur Ankur Jain, 34, has an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion, according to Forbes. A former executive at the dating app Tinder, where he still holds a 36% stake, Jain launched his latest venture, Bilt Rewards, in 2002. The service allows users to earn rewards by paying rent or purchasing homes, as reported by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/24/personal-finance/tech-billionaire-ankur-jains-secret-to-success-start-with-a-problem/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>. Bilt is now valued at $3.25 billion.</p>

<p>Mr Jain, the highly successful son of former Microsoft executive Naveen Jain-who briefly became a billionaire during the rise of his company InfoSpace before the dot-com crash- recently shared advice for aspiring entrepreneurs in an interview with the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p>

<p>"Start with a problem, not a perceived opportunity," Mr Jain told the UK newspaper. "Those are two very different things."</p>

<p>"I think one of the most dangerous things that happened to entrepreneurship was that business school graduates started going into entrepreneurship," he explained.</p>

<p>The focus on statistics, models, and creating new opportunities has led young entrepreneurs to prioritize unnecessary goods and services- often at the expense of consumers rather than addressing genuine needs, according to a former Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree.</p>

<p>"They've neglected to ask what real problems they can solve for people," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jain highlighted Bilt as an example of addressing a tangible issue and making it work effectively. "It's your biggest expense, and now it's your most rewarding," he said, referencing housing costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Bilt's data, the average American renter spends roughly 30% of their income on housing each year.</p>

<p>Jain previously shared with the <em>New York Post </em>that his inspiration to create Bilt- and to focus on solving real-world problems-stemmed from hearing a $100 million pitch from a venture capitalist a few years ago. The idea? Selling virtual luxury goods on the blockchain.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking to myself: "You have the biggest housing crisis, a health care and mental health crisis here in the city... And here you are sitting, talking to me about like, digital Prada bags on the blockchain,'" he said.</p>

<p>"It was so out of touch with not just big problems, but big opportunities."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A social media user recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share they had completed their doctorate by presenting the dissertation and acing the "viva with no corrections". While the news of acquiring a PhD would have been fairly innocuous and not invited much traction, the post instead went viral due to the choice of thesis topic by the OP. Dr Ally Louks, the X user, who claims to be teaching at the University of Cambridge, revealed that her thesis topic was "Olfactory Ethics: The Politics of Smell in Modern and Contemporary Prose", which instantly grabbed the internet's attention.</p>

<p>"Thrilled to say I passed my viva with no corrections and am officially PhDone," Dr Louks captioned the post whilst posing with her dissertation. She also shared the abstract of her research to provide "more context for anyone interested in learning" about her work.</p>

<p>"This thesis studies how literature registers the importance of olfactory discourse-the language of smell and the olfactory imagination it creates in structuring our social world," read the brief.</p>

<p>"The broad aim of this thesis is to offer an intersectional and wide-ranging study of olfactory oppression by establishing the underlying logics that facilitate smell's application in creating and subverting gender, class, sexual, racial and species power structures," it added.</p>

<p>Chapter one of the thesis explored how "smell can be used to indicate class antipathies, partly as they relate to homelessness", by examining George Orwell's work as well as other popular media creations.</p>

<h3><strong>Internet reacts</strong></h3>

<p>As the post went viral, thousands of users descended on Dr Louks' profile and questioned her for spending time and money, researching a topic that may not have any real-life implications.</p>

<p>"For those of you who can't translate this academic gobbledygook, let me be your guide: sis literally wrote a PhD thesis on why it's racist and/or classist to not like it when people stink," wrote one user, while another added: "How did this dissertation get accepted? It provides nothing of value, and really only sets this woman up to exploit students for their loans...or an email job somewhere.</p>

<p>A third commented: "Tax money well spent. Good luck with the debt."</p>

<p>While the majority of users criticised the OP for her post, some came to her defence, with one stating: "People are being so mean to this woman for no reason. Some people just want to study books, that's not a crime."</p>

<p>"That looks like a super interesting piece of research. I can see people being straight up cruel in replies and quotes and most of them are the usual suspects- racists, misogynists and people who would rather have all education be like trade school," another added.</p>

<p>As of the last update, the post had garnered 3.2 million views and over 2,000 comments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK woman has been fined over Rs 2 lakh after taking longer than five minutes to pay for parking. Rosey Hudson, a resident of Derby, claimed poor mobile phone signal prevented her from making a timely payment while at the car park.</p>

<p>Despite paying the full tariff every time she parked, Excel Parking Ltd issued her 10 Parking Charge Notices (PCNs), leading to a significant fine.</p>

<p>Ms Hudson had been using the Copeland Street car park since February 2023 while working nearby. She said the parking machine was out of order, forcing her to pay through an app, reported <a href="https://www-bbc-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2k0qlpjgk2o.amp " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The BBC</a>. But she struggled with signal issues, needing to walk to another area to get connected. Ms Hudson paid the full £3.30 (Rs 355) daily rate each time, until she received the first PCN, demanding £100 (Rs 10,769), later reduced to £60 (Rs 6,461) if paid within 14 days.</p>

<p>“I rang the company and explained the situation, and they basically said ‘you have to pay it','” Ms Hudson said. “So to keep them off my back I did pay the initial parking fine.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this, Hudson continued to receive nine more PCNs, escalating the total fine to £1,905.76 (Rs 2,05,257).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excel Parking defended its actions, saying the car park clearly displayed signage that stipulated a five-minute window to pay. “It is the driver's responsibility to read and understand the terms,” a spokesperson said, adding that Ms Hudson was “the author of her own misfortune".</p>

<p>The company further claimed Ms Hudson took between 14 and 190 minutes to pay, which Hudson refuted, calling the assertion “absolutely ludicrous” as the app did not process payments immediately. They also suggested she could have paid in cash at the machine, but Ms Hudson insisted it was out of order.</p>

<p>In a response to BBC's inquiry, Excel explained that the five-minute payment rule was implemented to prevent abuse, like drop-off and pick-up misuse. However, Ms Hudson argued that she paid the full tariff and wasn't using the car park for short-term stays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Hudson attempted to appeal directly to Excel and contacted a debt recovery service, but she was unsuccessful. Ms Hudson now faces a court hearing within six months, following a failed mediation attempt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The collection, comprising 600 pieces from both public and private collections, offers a rich exploration of the history and cultural significance of naturism.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Marseille Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations (Mucem) is currently exhibiting a comprehensive collection of artworks exploring the theme of naturism. In a novel approach to audience engagement, the museum invites visitors to view the exhibition naked, facilitating a more intimate and visceral experience of the artworks. The collection, comprising 600 pieces from both public and private collections, offers a rich exploration of the history and cultural significance of naturism.</p>

<p>"France is the world's leading tourist destination for naturists: its temperate climate and the presence of three seas have facilitated the establishment of communities, which - with the exception of Switzerland - have few real equivalents elsewhere in Europe, where naturism is practised more freely, outside established communities," the museum told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/arts/design/naturism-exhibition-naked-mucem-marseille.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Today, there is a new craze for nudity in nature, a craze that goes hand in hand with the quest for healthy, vegetarian diets and the use of natural therapies, meditation and yoga in the open air. These lifestyles, along with the rejection of the diktats that weigh down our bodies, are all keys to understanding the issues at stake in the naturism of yesterday and today."</p>

<p>Since opening in July, the museum's exhibition has attracted nearly 100,000 visitors, with around 600 attending five special viewings in the nude. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some participants were seasoned naturists, distinguishable by their tan-line-free and often weathered appearances. Others, however, had little to no experience being nude in public, apart from the occasional skinny dip. For these individuals, nudity was typically limited to locker rooms or intimate settings. Attending the exhibit in the nude offered a unique opportunity to engage with art and their own bodies in a new way-promoting a sense of acceptance or, perhaps, neutrality.</p>

<p>Naked museum events aren't entirely new. Similar gatherings have taken place in cities like Paris, Vienna, Montreal, Barcelona, Milan, and even Dorchester in England. However, Mucem may be the first major museum to dedicate an entire exhibition to the history, culture, and symbolism of naturism-a movement akin to nudism but rooted in principles of self-respect, respect for others, and harmony with the natural world.</p>

<p>"I always say that nudity is a tool - a very effective tool - to get people to achieve body acceptance," said Stephane Deschenes, the president of the International Naturist Federation. "But it's not the objective."</p>

<p>The exhibit, Naturist Paradises, chronicles the evolution of naturism in Europe over the past century. It begins with its origins as a groundbreaking social health movement and explores its modern alignment with the body positivity movement. The exhibition features an array of artefacts, including vintage magazine covers, black-and-white photographs, archival videos, paintings, and informative text displays.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actress wife Cheryl Hines is facing flak online after she posted a video of her hubby showering partially naked while filming a video for her beauty line in the couple's bathroom. RFK Jr., the nominee for President-elect Donald Trump's Health and Human Services department, appeared oblivious as the "Curb Your Enthusiasm" star tried to plug her Hines &amp; Young line, which she founded with daughter Catherin. Though the post was meant to be a promotional strategy, it backfired as social media users called her out for the 'cringy video'.</p>

<p>Captioning her post on Instagram as "H+Y content interruption", Ms Hines said, "You [RFK Jr.] can't take a shower, I'm doing a video! No, no, no, I'm doing a...you've gotta give me a second I'm doing a video for Hines+Young. Honey... 60% off."</p>

<p>She added "Oh Bobby" as a caption, followed by heart and smiley face emojis.</p>

<p>In a follow-up post, Ms Hines also included a still photo of products from her line, including a MAHA candle, apparently referencing her husband's "Make America Healthy Again" campaign.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h3><strong>Social media reacts</strong></h3>

<p>The video and Ms Hines' attempt at promoting her brand at the cost of RFK Jr. did not go down well with social media users who called out the actress for being a 'grifter'.</p>

<p>"This is one of the cringiest things I've ever seen...lost all respect for Cheryl Hines," said one user while another added: "Lame. Very lame. Maybe don't follow your husband into the bathroom while he showers to do an advertisement, if you're going to complain about him taking a shower in the bathroom while you're doing an advertisement."</p>

<p>A third commented: "Jesus, gotta give them credit, they are the most consistent grifters in history."</p>

<p>While most criticised the video, some said it was an attempt by Ms Hines to show that the couple were as strong as ever after it was revealed that RFK Jr. had a "digital affair" with journalist Olivia Nuzzi. The pair allegedly began communicating after the publication of Nuzzi's profile on Kennedy in<em> New York Magazine.</em> The publication and Ms Nuzzi have since parted ways.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ismail Khalidi, son of Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi, has labelled US President Joe Biden a "genocidal maniac" after the latter was spotted holding a copy of his father's book, 'The Hundred Years' War on Palestine'.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ismail Khalidi, son of Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi, has labelled US President Joe Biden a “genocidal maniac” after the latter was spotted holding a copy of his father's book, '<em>The Hundred Years' War on Palestine'</em>.</p>

<p>President Biden, currently wrapping up his term, drew attention during a Black Friday outing in Nantucket when he was photographed carrying the book. The choice of reading material surprised many, given Biden's long-standing pro-Israel stance.&nbsp;Rashid Khalidi, a prominent scholar of Palestinian and Lebanese descent, reacted to the unexpected publicity, calling it <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/biden-buys-book-on-israels-settler-colonial-conquest-palestinian-author-reacts-7139154 ">“four years too late.”</a> The author, whose work critiques US foreign policy and frames the establishment of Israel as a “settler-colonial conquest,” seemed skeptical about Biden's sudden interest in his work.</p>

<p>His son, Ismail, took a harsher tone. In a post on X, he lashed out at Biden, writing, “Hey, [Joe Biden], get my father's book out of your blood-soaked hands, you genocidal maniac.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoeBiden</a>, get my father's book out of your blood soaked hands, you genocidal maniac. <a href="https://t.co/Ud9vsVhRU3">https://t.co/Ud9vsVhRU3</a></p>
— Ismail Khalidi (@IsmailKhalidi) <a href="https://twitter.com/IsmailKhalidi/status/1862659766427820535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Published in 2020, '<em>The Hundred Years' War on Palestine'</em> critiques Israeli policies and staunch US support for the state, describing the conflict as a prolonged colonial struggle. Rashid Khalidi, a vocal critic of US-Israel relations, labelled the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “the most extreme” in the country's history. He also criticised the Donald Trump administration in his book, calling it a “mouthpiece for Israel.”</p>

<p>The book advocates for justice and equality for Palestinians, proposing that peace can only be achieved by dismantling systemic oppression. It talks about the historical narrative of Palestinian resistance and highlights discriminatory policies against Palestinians, including Muslims and Christians.</p>

<p>The book outlines three potential outcomes for settler-colonial conflicts – the full subjugation of Indigenous populations, the expulsion of colonisers, or compromise and reconciliation.</p>

<p>The book's nuanced examination of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has drawn both praise and criticism, making Biden's public endorsement – intentional or not – all the more surprising.</p>

<p>Joe Biden has often described himself as a Zionist, declaring famously, “You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/im-a-zionist-how-bidens-lifelong-bond-with-israel-shapes-war-policy-4503653 ">I am a Zionist</a>.” His administration, while providing military aid to Israel, has faced backlash for its handling of the ongoing war in Gaza and perceived complicity in Palestinian suffering. Protests have erupted across the US, with demonstrators branding him “Genocide Joe” for his perceived failure to check Israeli military actions.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Biden paused shipments of heavy munitions to Israel amid rising tensions, but he also visited the country in solidarity after the October 2023 attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The arrest of a Hindu leader in Dhaka has been "misconstrued" and he was arrested on specific charges, Bangladesh has told a UN forum on minority issues, claiming that there has been no systematic attack on minorities in the country.</p>

<p>Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former member of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), was arrested from Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday. He was denied bail and sent to jail by the Chattogram's Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate court in a sedition case on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"With utter dismay, we note that the arrest of Chinmoy Das has been misconstrued by some speakers, although he was actually arrested on specific charges. The matter is being dealt with by our court of law," Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the UN Offices and other international organisations in Geneva Tareq Md Ariful Islam said.</p>

<p>Islam made the statement during the 17th session of the Forum on Minorities Issues that took place in Geneva on November 28-29.</p>

<p>After Das, the leader of the Hindu group Sammilita Sanatani Jote, was sent to prison, it triggered protests by Hindus in various locations, including the capital Dhaka and the port city of Chattogram.</p>

<p>India has noted the developments with deep concern even as a diplomatic row has erupted between the two South Asian neighbours.</p>

<p>During the session, some Bangladeshi NGOs and individuals spoke about the situation in the country. A representative of the International Forum for Secular Bangladesh (IFSB) said that the situation right now in the country is "very alarming" and a "very burning issue." Referring to Das' arrest, the representative said that ISKCON is a very popular and peaceful organisation but the former ISKCON leader has been arrested with "nothing accused against him. He was arrested three days before in Dhaka and now Bangladesh every day .... the police, army ... every day, they are torturing the minority."</p>

<p>Islam said that Bangladesh reaffirms that every Bangladeshi, regardless of religious identity, has the right to practice their respective religion or express views freely. "Ensuring safety and security of every citizen, including from the minority community, remains the cornerstone of the interim government of Bangladesh," Islam said.</p>

<p>"This has been repeatedly reassured to minority religious leaders by our top leadership, and proved time and again in the first 100 days" of the interim government led by the Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, he added.</p>

<p>The post August 5 violence in Bangladesh was rooted in political and personal factors, not sectarian, he noted. "The violence affected people, mostly with partisan political affiliations, almost all of them being Muslims, and only a few from other religious minority groups." Deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India on August 5 following widespread protests against her Awami League-led government over a controversial job quota system. Three days later, Yunus, a Nobel laureate, took over as the Chief Adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>Ariful Islam said that "there was no systematic attack on minorities" and following the mass uprising in July, the world witnessed "how the entire society of Bangladesh came forward to protect its minorities." He added that "unfortunately" there have been "a fiery of exaggerated, unfounded and fake reports and deliberate spread of misinformation and disinformation by vested quarters regarding minority persecution. Sadly, we saw it happening at this forum too." He said the Bangladeshi government "remains vigilant and will continue to act promptly to maintain religious harmony at any cost and thwart any attempt to undermine rights of minorities." Following this week's anti-Hindu incidents -- including Das' arrest and attacks on Hindu temples and community members -- India on Friday said the interim government in Bangladesh must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities as it expressed serious concern over the "surge" of extremist rhetoric and increasing incidents of violence against Hindus as well as attacks on temples.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told Parliament that India has taken serious note of incidents of violence against minorities in Bangladesh and that it is the primary responsibility of Dhaka to protect the life and liberty of all the citizens, including minorities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bangladesh on Friday expressed deep concern over the violent protest at the Deputy High Commission in Kolkata and urged New Delhi to ensure the safety of all its diplomatic missions in India.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two aid workers were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Saturday, with Israel saying it had killed an operative who took part in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and who it said was employed by a US-based charity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two aid workers were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Saturday, with Israel saying it had killed an operative who took part in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and who it said was employed by a US-based charity.</p>

<p>The first was a World Central Kitchen member, who was hit in a vehicle in Khan Younis in Southern Gaza. The Israeli military said that he had taken part in the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel and was under surveillance but did not offer any evidence.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify whether he took part in the attack last year.</p>

<p>The family of the man, Ahed Azmi Qdeih, said the Israeli allegations were false and meant to justify his unlawful killing. They said he was an engineer who dedicated his life to charitable work.</p>

<p>World Central Kitchen confirmed the airstrike and said it had no knowledge about an employee involved in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>"We are heartbroken to share that a vehicle carrying World Central Kitchen colleagues was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza," it said in a statement posted on X. "World Central Kitchen had no knowledge that any individual in the vehicle had alleged ties to the October 7th Hamas attack."</p>

<p>The charity group said it was pausing operations in Gaza, adding that it was working with incomplete information and was urgently seeking more details. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that three employees of the charity were killed in the strike, with medics saying a total of five people were killed.</p>

<p>Hamas did not immediately comment.</p>

<p>Later in the day, international aid agency Save the Children also said in a statement that a 39-year-old staffer, who it identified as Ahmad Faisal Isleem Al-Qadi, was killed in an airstrike in Khan Younis.</p>

<p>It was unclear if the two men were killed in the same strike. Israel has not immediately commented on Save the Children's statement.</p>

<p>"There are not strong enough words to express the grief and outrage we feel at the loss of Ahmad in an Israeli airstrike. He was a valued member of our team and loved by all who met him," Inger Ashing, the Save the Children chief executive, said in the statement.</p>

<p>In another attack in Khan Younis, medics said at least nine Palestinians were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit a car near a crowd receiving flour, a vehicle that was used by security personnel tasked with overseeing aid deliveries into Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says that it does not target civilians and accuses Hamas of operating from civilian facilities and using Gaza's population as human shields, which the group denies.</p>

<p>At least 32 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across the enclave overnight and into Saturday, Gaza medics said, including seven killed in a strike on a house in central Gaza City, according to Gaza officials.</p>

<h2><strong>New Ceasefire Efforts</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, leaders of Hamas were expected to arrive in Cairo on Saturday for ceasefire talks with Egyptian officials, days after Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in Lebanon, two officials of the group told Reuters.</p>

<p>The visit is the first since the United States announced earlier this week it would revive efforts in collaboration with Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Hamas delegation is expected to meet with Egyptian security officials to explore ways to reach a ceasefire deal with Israel that could secure the release of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Progress before now has been limited in a series of on-off talks over months.</p>

<p>Hamas is seeking an agreement that would end the war while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that the war will end only when Hamas is eradicated.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 44,382 people and displaced nearly all of the enclave's population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of Gaza lie in ruins.</p>

<p>The conflict was triggered more than 13 months ago when Hamas-led operatives attacked southern Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people and abducting over 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te was feted with a red carpet, garlands of flowers and "alohas" as he kicked off his two-day stopover in Hawaii on Saturday, part of a Pacific tour that has sparked fiery rhetoric from Beijing.</p>

<p>China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has responded to Lai's first overseas trip as president with threats to "resolutely crush" any attempt for independence.</p>

<p>Looking relaxed in a Hawaiian shirt, Lai flitted around the US island state, visiting a Pacific island history museum, an emergency management centre and the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbour.</p>

<p>Earlier, he was given the "red carpet treatment" on the tarmac of Honolulu's international airport, according to his office, which said it was the first time a Taiwanese president had been given such a welcome.</p>

<p>He was met by Ingrid Larson, managing director in Washington of the American Institute in Taiwan, Hawaii Governor Josh Green, and others.</p>

<p>At every turn, Lai was presented with garlands of brightly coloured flowers or leaves known as leis, greetings of "aloha", and other Hawaiian gifts.</p>

<p>In the evening, Lai is expected to deliver his first public speech of the week-long trip at a dinner attended by US government officials and Taiwanese people living abroad.</p>

<p>Beijing opposes any international recognition of Taiwan and its claim to be a sovereign state and especially bristles at official contact between the island and the United States.</p>

<p>Like most countries, Washington does not recognize Taiwan diplomatically but is its most important backer and biggest supplier of arms.</p>

<p>In a statement, China's foreign ministry said it "strongly condemns" the United States for Lai's stopover and that it had "lodged serious protests with the US".</p>

<p>"China will closely follow the developments and take resolute and strong measures to defend our nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity," it said.</p>

<p>After Hawaii, Lai will visit Taiwan's allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau -- the only Pacific island nations among the 12 countries that recognize Taiwan's claim to statehood -- and stop over for one night in the US territory of Guam.</p>

<p>Lai said shortly before take-off in Taipei that the trip "ushered in a new era of values-based democracy" and thanked the US government for "helping to make this trip a smooth one".&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said he wanted to "continue to expand cooperation and deepen partnerships with our allies based on the values of democracy, peace and prosperity."</p>

<p>"I once again emphasize that we are all Team Taiwan. We all work together, and we can successfully achieve our goals," Lai told reporters on board the plane.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist is travelling with the president for the duration of the trip.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Threat of invasion</strong></h3>

<p>Taiwan lives under the constant threat of an invasion by China, which has refused to rule out using force to bring the island under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing deploys fighter jets, drones and warships around Taiwan on a near-daily basis to press its claims, with the number of sorties increasing in recent years.</p>

<p>Lai's aircraft was accompanied by Taiwanese Air Force F-16 fighter jets for part of its route to Hawaii.</p>

<p>"I think this is very meaningful and also makes us feel that we have a long way to go on this trip and bear heavy responsibilities," Lai told reporters on board, referring to the escort.</p>

<p>Taiwanese government officials have previously stopped over on US soil during visits to the Pacific or Latin America, angering China, which has sometimes responded with military drills around the island.</p>

<p>In a swift response to news of Lai's trip on Thursday, Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China's defense ministry said: "We firmly oppose official interaction with China's Taiwan region in any form" and vowed to "resolutely crush" any attempts for Taiwan independence.</p>

<p>Lai's trip follows the US approval on Friday of a proposed sale to Taiwan of spare parts for F-16s and radar systems, as well as communications equipment, in deals valued at $385 million in total.</p>

<p>The Taiwan president's trip comes as Republican US President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January.</p>

<p>Taipei has publicly congratulated Trump on his victory, joining other governments around the world in trying to get onside with the mercurial magnate, whose diplomatic style is often transactional.</p>

<p>During his campaign, Trump caused jitters by suggesting Taiwan should pay the United States for its defense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-year-old video of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reportedly mocking US President-elect Donald Trump in front of other world leaders is making rounds on social media as the two leaders met and dined in Florida after Trump's tariff threat on Canada on Saturday.</p>

<p>The video shows Trudeau standing in a huddle with former UK President Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron at a Buckingham Palace function.</p>

<p>The 30-second footage from 2019 shows Johnson asking Macron, "Is that why he was late?"</p>

<p>To this, Trudeau responded mockingly: "He was late because he talked a 40-minute press conference off the top". He went on to add, "You just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I will never forget when Justin Trudeau mocked Trump behind his back.<br />
<br />
I hope President Trump concedes nothing to this fraud at their meeting. <a href="https://t.co/LmsZx8SUlp">pic.twitter.com/LmsZx8SUlp</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>While no name was mentioned, it was assumed that they were talking about <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trumps-100-tariff-warning-for-brics-countries-if-they-undercut-dollar-7144959" target="_blank">Trump</a> who is known for his long press conferences.</p>

<p>However, a few days later when the incident created a big stir, Trudeau had admitted that they were, in fact, talking about Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump imposes tariff on Canada, Mexico</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier this week, the 78-year-old US President-elect, who will take office on January 10, said he would slap a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, accusing them of allowing an "invasion" of the US by illicit drugs and undocumented migrants. He also said a 10 percent tariff on imports would be imposed on China.</p>

<p>For Canada, the stakes of any new tariffs are high as more than three-quarters of Canadian exports went to the US last year and nearly two million Canadian jobs are dependent on trade, reported news agency AFP.</p>

<p>A day after the announcement, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-pm-justin-trudeau-arrives-in-florida-to-meet-donald-trump-amid-tariff-threats-7137838" target="_blank">Trudeau rushed to the US</a> to meet Trump when the duo dined together at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, Trudeau said that he had an "excellent conversation" with Trump, while leaving to catch a flight back to Canada. In a post on X, the Canadian prime Minister thanked Trump saying, "Thanks for dinner last night, President Trump. I look forward to the work we can do together, again."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[World AIDS Day 2024: On World AIDS Day 2024 (December 1), understanding the distinction between HIV and AIDS remains critical.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>World AIDS Day 2024: </strong>HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, targets the body's infection-fighting cells, weakening the immune system and increasing vulnerability to severe complications. After exposure, acute HIV infection typically develops within 2-4 weeks, presenting symptoms such as fever, headache, and rash. During this stage, the virus multiplies rapidly, spreading throughout the body and compromising the immune system. This is also the period when the individual is most infectious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without timely treatment, HIV can progress to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). In this advanced stage, the viral load is extremely high, symptoms become severe, and survival without treatment is typically limited to a few years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Between acute HIV infection and AIDS, there is a chronic HIV infection stage where the virus continues to replicate but at a slower rate. Although this stage cannot lead to a cure, disease progression can be significantly slowed with antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART enables individuals with HIV to live longer, healthier lives.</p>

<p>On World AIDS Day 2024 (December 1), understanding the distinction between HIV and AIDS remains critical.</p>

<p>One of the most significant global public health concerns in recorded history, AIDS has killed between 27.2 million and 47.8 million people globally as of 2020, while an estimated 37.7 million people are living with HIV.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/01-12-2024-world-aids-day" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>WHO</em></a>, there are 80,000 children and adolescents aged 0-14 estimated to be living with HIV, comprising 2% of total HIV cases in the Region, predominantly due to vertical transmission (mother-to-child). Approximately 53,000 infants are born with congenital syphilis. These children are one too many as there are effective interventions to eliminate mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, labour, and childbirth. They face a multitude of complex issues while growing up, living with HIV. WHO's 'triple elimination' initiative of vertical transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus is a critical public health priority to prevent the next generation of young from these infectious diseases. Three champion countries - Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Thailand - have already achieved elimination of HIV and syphilis vertical transmission.</p>

<h3><strong>What is HIV?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that targets immune system cells, making an individual more susceptible to various illnesses and infections.</p>

<p>HIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash and sore throat. The infection progressively weaken the immune system. This can cause other signs and symptoms swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and&nbsp;<br />
cough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery. &nbsp;People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water.</p>

<p>While it cannot be cured, it can be kept in control through medications. HIV medication is lifelong and reduces or even eliminates your ability to transmit the virus to others.</p>

<h3><strong>What is AIDS?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a term that applies to the most advanced stages of HIV infection. It is defined by the occurrence of any of the more than 20 life-threatening cancers or "opportunistic infections", so named because they take advantage of a weakened immune system. AIDS was a defining feature of the earlier years of the HIV epidemic, before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available. Now, as more people access ART, the majority of people living with HIV will not progress to AIDS.</p>

<p>Advanced HIV disease (AHD), defined as having a CD4 cell count less than 200 copies, having an AIDS-defining illness, or all children less than 5 years old with confirmed HIV infection, is more likely to occur in people with HIV who have not been tested, in people who are diagnosed late, and in people who have stopped or never started taking ART, according to WHO.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday nominated Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, as the US ambassador to France, in the latest of several controversial picks.</p>

<p>Kushner "is a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, &amp; dealmaker, who will be a strong advocate representing our Country &amp; its interests," Trump said on his Truth Social website, adding that Jared "worked closely with me in the White House."</p>

<p>The choice is in keeping with Trump's pattern, so far, of selecting people, often wealthy, who are close to his family or of proven loyalty. Kushner is a multimillionaire real estate executive and former attorney; his son was a senior adviser during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>Trump did not mention, however, that the elder Kushner once served jail time -- a two-year sentence, most of it served in a federal prison.</p>

<p>Kushner, who is now 70, pleaded guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign contributions.</p>

<p>The case, which was prosecuted by then US attorney Chris Christie, included sordid details, to which Kushner admitted: that he had hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, a man cooperating in a campaign finance inquiry, and then videotaped the encounter and sent it to the man's wife, Kushner's sister, to dissuade her from testifying against him.</p>

<p>Christie, who worked on Trump's first presidential transition team and then opposed him in this year's Republican primary contests, later said Kushner had committed a "loathsome" and "disgusting crime."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, Trump issued a pardon to Kushner, whose conviction had resulted in him being disbarred in three states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nominees for key ambassadorships are often business associates of a president-elect, or major political donors. But it is rare, if not unprecedented, to name a convicted felon.</p>

<p>The first two men to fill the prestigious Paris post were famed inventor and statesman Benjamin Franklin and a future president, Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>If confirmed, Kushner would succeed Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium who was a major Democratic fundraiser and donor.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX will launch NASA's groundbreaking Dragonfly mission to Saturn's largest moon, Titan, using a Falcon Heavy rocket. Scheduled to lift off between July 5 and 25, 2028, from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, the launch contract is valued at $256.6 million.</p>

<p>This mission, part of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-dragonfly-mission/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NASA's New Frontiers Programme</a>, will cost $3.35 billion and aims to explore Titan's unique environment with a drone-like rotorcraft lander.</p>

<p>Dragonfly will travel to Titan over six years, arriving in 2034. It will explore Titan's methane seas, icy landscapes, and organic-rich dunes, landing in a new location every Titan day (16 Earth days). The rotorcraft will collect samples and analyse Titan's prebiotic chemistry, searching for biosignatures of life, whether water-based or hydrocarbon-based. Titan, the only known celestial body besides Earth with stable surface liquids, presents a unique opportunity to study environments that may support life.</p>

<p>Originally planned for a 2026 launch, the mission was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. NASA chose SpaceX's Falcon Heavy to shorten the cruise phase and meet the 2034 arrival target.</p>

<p>While Titan's dense atmosphere and low gravity make it ideal for rotorcraft flight, the moon's surface receives only 1 per cent of the sunlight that Earth does. This creates challenges for solar-powered operations, which Dragonfly will tackle using advanced autonomous systems, drawing lessons from the Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity.</p>

<p>Dragonfly follows the legacy of the Cassini-Huygens mission, which in 2005 provided humanity's first close-up look at Titan. Cassini-Huygens revealed a world shaped by methane rivers, ancient shorelines, and ice. Dragonfly will expand on those discoveries by exploring Titan's active methane cycle and studying how water and carbon-rich materials may have interacted to create prebiotic conditions.</p>

<p>The mission is managed by NASA's Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, with contributions from experts worldwide in planetary science, rotorcraft design, and autonomous systems. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Centre oversees the project as part of the New Frontiers Programme.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having higher levels of testosterone does not mean men have a higher sex drive, as previously thought -- a new study published in the journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.1508" rel="Noindex, nofollow"><em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a> has claimed. Testosterone is a hormone, produced primarily in the testicles of men and in smaller amounts in the ovaries of women. It plays an important role in the development of male secondary sexual characteristics such as body hair growth, and increased muscle and bone mass. While its role in reproductive behaviour has been significantly documented, an international team of researchers led by the University of California, Santa Barbara believe that day-to-day changes in testosterone levels had no real link to sexual desire in men.</p>

<p>"A man experiencing higher-than-usual testosterone concentrations on a given day does not typically exhibit higher-than-usual sexual desire on that same day," the study stated.</p>

<p>As per the researchers, their study corroborated with prior findings suggesting that men's sexual desire requires only a threshold amount of baseline testosterone.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the researchers found that there was a positive relationship between testosterone levels and the degree of effort men put into wooing their significant other.</p>

<p>"We propose that the evolved functions of testosterone in human males are more closely associated with courtship efforts than with sexual desire," the study highlighted.</p>

<h3><strong>How was the study conducted?</strong></h3>

<p>41 men aged 18 to 26 of varying relationship statuses (27 single, 14 committed to a partner) were recruited for a 31-day trial. A daily saliva analysis was taken to measure testosterone concentrations with the participants required to fill answers to questions such as: "How much sexual desire did you experience?" "How much effort did you put into attracting a possible romantic and/or sexual partner yesterday?" and "How much did you have sexual fantasies?"</p>

<p>On days when the single men interacted with prospective partners, testosterone concentrations were higher, suggesting more effort was made to seek out a mate.</p>

<p>"Testosterone fluctuations in the normal range may positively predict day-to-day changes in men's mate attraction efforts among single men, especially given social interactions with potential mates."</p>

<p>Despite the findings, the researchers said they needed more data to further develop their understanding of the matter.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Young blue-collar workers are being courted in a tight US presidential election that is forcing voters to weigh competing claims on immigration, inflation and other hot-button issues.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young blue-collar workers like Luke Gonzalez are being courted in a tight US presidential election that is forcing voters to weigh competing claims on immigration, inflation and other hot-button issues.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Gonzalez, a 25 year-old glazier, sat through an 80-minute presentation at his Warren, Michigan union hall where labor leaders pressed the case that Kamala Harris was better for workers than Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Gonzalez, who is undecided, is a member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), one of several leading unions backing Harris due in part to industrial policy under the Biden-Harris administration expected to sustain building-trades employment for years.</p>

<p>Democrats also back collective-bargaining rights, in contrast to Trump who joked recently with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk about firing striking workers.</p>

<p>But Trump's unconventional style has enjoyed lasting appeal with a sizeable number of blue-collar workers, who can be more conservative culturally -- that has helped keep the race tight in Michigan and other swing states with large working-class populations.</p>

<p>Trump supporters include Isaiah Goddard, 24, who is part of a group of insurgent United Auto Workers members who back Trump.</p>

<p>Trump "is not a politician," he said. "He knows how to run the country and he can do it again."</p>

<p>Goddard, who works at Ford, doesn't believe Harris' support for electric vehicles will be good for Michigan.</p>

<p>He also endorses Trump's stance on abortion and immigration, saying "these illegal immigrants are going to be taking American jobs."</p>

<p>Nick Nabozny, another Ford worker, sold 32 red "Auto Workers for Trump" t-shirts at his Wayne, Michigan plants this week.</p>

<p>"There's more people in the union that support Trump than they truly believe," Nabozny said of the UAW. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Turned off by politicians</strong></h3>

<p>Trump in 2016 became the first Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan to cut significantly into the Democratic lead among union households.</p>

<p>Besides immigration, Trump in 2016 blasted international trade deals that led to industrial job loss in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Biden won back enough of these voters in 2020 to flip those states, although this year's race is neck-and-neck.</p>

<p>Democratic pollster David Mermin expects a big gender gap, with working-class women supporting Harris based in part over abortion rights.</p>

<p>Young voters are the most "persuadable" part of the working-class population, said Mermin, who works at Lake Research Partners. "They don't like the parties. They don't like politicians."</p>

<p>They "are the ones you can influence, they're learning still," said Jeff Tricoff, 39, a refinery worker at the Teamsters union in Detroit who is undecided.</p>

<p>Lucas Hartwell, 22, a labor organizer with the Operating Engineers union who backs Harris tells peers to "vote your interests, even if the social issues don't match up for you."</p>

<h3><strong>Debating immigration</strong></h3>

<p>While the national Teamsters union made no endorsement, other prominent unions such as IUPAT and the UAW are campaigning hard for the Democrat, distributing lawn signs, phone banking and canvassing door to door.</p>

<p>IUPAT president Jimmy Williams attributes the Democratic Party's slippage to decades of failures to deliver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Williams, a fourth-generation member of his union who became a glazier after high school, considers Biden to be a turning point because the outgoing president became the first to join a strikers' picket line, and because of big legislative successes.</p>

<p>At the Warren event, Williams described to apprentices that Trump talked about infrastructure, but didn't get anything done, adding that Harris will continue Biden's ambitious initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But when Williams polled the audience of around 30, about a third raised their hands for Trump. Inflation, cost of living," explained one bearded young worker.</p>

<p>Williams acknowledged that costs are "going through the roof," as he blamed big business and described inflation as a global phenomenon due to supply chain problems.</p>

<p>Williams got more pushback on immigration, but he argued workers should aim their outrage at the businesses that exploit cheap labor.</p>

<p>"As a union, we just can't stand for that," Williams told the group. "The biggest tool that the bosses use to divide workers is race."</p>

<p>After the event, Robert Gonzalez, head of IUPAT's Michigan district, estimated the room as "50-50 split."</p>

<p>His son, Luke, was drawn to the idea that "Kamala is for the working union" in contrast to "big business" candidate Trump, before adding, "I still have a lot of reading up to do."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China will take "countermeasures" to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the government said, lambasting a $2 billion arms sale package by the United States to Taiwan.</p>

<p>The United States is bound by law to provide Chinese-claimed Taiwan with the means to defend itself despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, to the constant anger of Beijing.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Pentagon said the United States had approved a potential $2 billion arms sale package to Taiwan, including the delivery for the first time to the island of an advanced air defence missile system battle-tested in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a statement late Saturday, China's foreign ministry said it strongly condemns and firmly opposes the sales and has lodged "solemn representations" with the United States.</p>

<p>China urges the United States to immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop its dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, it added.</p>

<p>"China will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity," the ministry said, without elaborating.</p>

<p>China has over the past five years stepped up its military activities around democratically governed Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, including staging a new round of war games earlier this month.</p>

<p>Taiwan's government has welcomed the new arms sale, the 17th of the Biden administration to the island.</p>

<p>"In the face of China's threats, Taiwan is duty-bound to protect its homeland, and will continue to demonstrate its determination to defend itself," Taiwan's foreign ministry said, responding to the arms sale.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Michelle Obama on Saturday aired her "genuine fear" that Donald Trump could retake the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michelle Obama on Saturday aired her "genuine fear" that Donald Trump could retake the White House as the popular former first lady made a passionate appeal to voters in the desperately close US election.</p>

<p>Both Trump and Kamala Harris were in Michigan searching for holdout votes ahead of the November 5 election, with Harris focused on abortion rights and Trump returning to his anti-immigrant campaign theme.</p>

<p>Obama said Democratic candidate Harris would be an "extraordinary president of the United States" if elected in just 10 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, with polls forecasting a virtual dead heat, she also spoke of a sense of frustration and anxiety that few on Harris's team dare express after she lost some momentum in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"My hope about Kamala is also accompanied by some genuine fear," Obama said, ripping into Trump's record and asking, "Why is this race even close?"</p>

<p>"I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse."</p>

<p>Obama, appearing alongside Harris, hammered home the vice president's message that abortion rights -- and women's health care overall -- are at stake on the ballot.</p>

<p>"Please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump," Obama said, adding he could effectively ban abortion nationwide.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump on the attack</strong></h3>

<p>At his rally, Trump launched bitter personal attacks on Harris and accused her of pushing an "open border" migration policy.</p>

<p>"She's a dope," he said. "This person cannot be president."</p>

<p>"She will destroy our country. Everyone knows it. No one respects her. The United States is now occupied country. Kamala broke it, we will fix it."</p>

<p>With more than 38 million people already casting early ballots, Americans are deciding whether to elect the country's first-ever woman president, or its oldest commander in chief.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, still refuses to accept his defeat in the vote four years ago and is expected to reject the result if he loses again -- potentially pitching the United States into chaos.</p>

<p>Trump swept the three Blue Wall states -- Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- in his shock victory in 2016 only to see Joe Biden reclaim them four years later.</p>

<p>He hopes to claw back one or more of the trio, and win the so-called Sun Belt swing states to propel him back into power.</p>

<p>After his Michigan event, Trump headed straight to Pennsylvania for another rally on Saturday evening.</p>

<h3><strong>Abortion rights</strong></h3>

<p>Harris further highlighted abortion rights -- a weak point for Republicans -- by visiting a local doctor's office and meeting with physicians, staff and medical students.</p>

<p>"Because of Trump and what he did with the Supreme Court, we are looking at a health care crisis in America," she told reporters, referring to justices chosen by Trump who tipped the court into ending the national right to abortion in 2022.</p>

<p>The penultimate weekend before the vote began on Friday evening with Harris appearing alongside superstar Beyonce, and Trump giving a three-hour interview to Joe Rogan, America's most popular podcaster.</p>

<p>On Sunday Harris, 60, will campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the largest city in the largest of the swing states likely to determine the election winner.</p>

<p>She will criss-cross the city, especially historically Black and Latino districts, trying to persuade uncommitted residents to cast their vote.</p>

<p>Trump will rally his supporters on Sunday evening in Madison Square Garden, the famous arena in the heart of heavily Democratic New York.</p>

<p>The brash billionaire and onetime reality television star appears keen to orchestrate a grand spectacle, and demonstrate he can fill an arena in a liberal bastion.</p>

<p>But critics, including Trump's 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, have noted that Madison Square Garden was also the scene of a 1939 pro-Nazi rally organized by a group supportive of Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Part of Harris's election strategy is to peel moderate Republicans away from Trump, who often demeans some Americans as the "enemy."</p>

<p>Harris told her supporters that as a prosecutor she "took on perpetrators of all kinds -- predators, fraudsters and repeat offenders. I took them on and I won.</p>

<p>"In 10 days, it's Donald Trump's turn."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, a powerful critic of illegal immigrants and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump who has for years portrayed migrants as invaders and criminals, worked "illegally" in the United States during the start of his career, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/26/elon-musk-immigration-status/?fbclid=IwY2xjawGJ9X9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHTxa8uBiCwmifkowiNsJ2E0SrB2EVxmPJA-P-gIo8JdXg-I39oXvIAsAkw_aem_1Jbv1FA3AMBanjGB1v0s7Q" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">reported</a> The Washington Post.</p>

<p>According to the report, Musk, whose origin is from South Africa, dropped out of Stanford University in 1995 to work on his debut company, Zip2 for four years before it sold for around 300 million dollars. During this time, he was working without correct authorization.</p>

<p>Two of Musk's former colleagues also said that Musk received his US work authorisation around 1997, the report said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-vladimir-putin-in-secret-communications-since-2022-report-6877055">Musk</a>, being a foreign student in US, could not have dropped out of school to build a company as per the rules.</p>

<p>Overstaying a student visa is common in most cases, however, it still remains illegal, the Post said.</p>

<p>Despite this, Musk has always maintained that his time from turning into an entrepreneur from a student is a "legal grey area".</p>

<p>The report also cited a 2020 podcast in which Musk had said that he was legally in US but he was meant to be doing student work. "I was allowed to do work sort of supporting whatever," he said.</p>

<p>Several of the Tesla and SpaceX boss' recent posts on social media platforms have been on immigration and voter fraud, accusing White House nominee and Vice-President Kamala Harris of "importing voters" through illegal immigrants. Last week, he also compared the US-Mexico border - where several Mexican immigrants enter America - to a "zombie apocalypse".&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel waited for almost four weeks to avenge the ballistic missile attack from Iran on October 1. Yesterday, Israeli fighter jets flew for over 1,000 kilometres and conducted "precise strikes" on military facilities in Tehran and nearby provinces.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Over 100 Israeli fighter jets including the F-35 stealth fighters, took off for the mission just before dawn. They flew for 1,000 kilometres and struck the radar and air defence systems of Iran to render them defenceless and hit other military sites including a missile manufacturing unit.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel said it conducted "precise strikes". At the same time, Iran, initially claimed that the explosions across the capital Tehran were due to the activation of air defence systems, but later admitted that the strikes caused "limited damage" to military sites. Two Iranian soldiers were killed in the attack.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">"We are prepared to respond to any Israeli "aggression," Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, citing sources in the government. "There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes," they added. The Israeli army has warned Iran of paying a "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-says-it-has-right-to-defend-itself-after-todays-strikes-israel-warns-of-heavy-price-6880052">heavy price</a>" if it begins a new round of escalation.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The US has termed Israel's attack an "exercise of self-defence" and urged Tehran to avoid any further escalation. 'The US was informed by Israel beforehand about the attacks and there is no involvement of Washington in the strikes,' AFP reported quoting sources in the US government. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary, Lloyd J Austin, in a warning said, "Iran should not make the mistake of responding to Israel's strikes, which should mark the end of this exchange."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel attacked at the time of its choosing, the tit-for-tat move has led to a volatile situation in the region, drawing condemnation from states in the area and outside. Hamas, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Saudi Arabia condemned the strikes. Turkey went a step ahead and called for an end to "terror created by Israel".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Russia urged both sides to restrain and avoid a "catastrophic scenario". Moscow has been at war with Ukraine for over two years, with no sign of a de-escalation. India said it is "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/deeply-concerned-by-evolving-escalation-in-west-asia-india-6881871">deeply concerned</a> by the evolving escalation in West Asia and its ramifications for peace and stability in the region and beyond."&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In an interview with NDTV,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-strikes-reuven-azar-could-have-inflicted-much-more-damage-israel-envoy-to-ndtv-after-iran-strikes-6881332"> Israeli envoy to India, Reuven Azar</a>, said, "What Israel did is a very precise strike that took out Iran's air defence systems, and targeted military installations connected to their missile and drone programmes. The signal here is very clear: Israel will not agree to continue to be attacked by Iran either directly or indirectly."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lebanon reported an Israeli raid today on southern Beirut after Israel's army issued an evacuation call. Lebanon's National News Agency said Israel "targeted the southern suburbs of Beirut". The Israeli army had earlier urged residents of two neighbourhoods in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital to evacuate their homes.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel attacked Syria too. Explosions were heard in the capital Damascus. Syrian authorities said Israel launched attacks from the occupied Golan Heights and parts of Lebanon, prompting them to activate air defence systems. Syria is part of the Iran-led 'Axis of Resistance', a group of Shia militias and political groups, against Israel and the US in the region.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/the-aftermath-of-israeli-air-strikes-airspace-shut-in-these-3-countries-6877007">The airspace</a> in three countries was under a temporary lockdown after the strikes. Iran, Iraq and Syria shut the airspace in response to the strike to preserve the safety of civil aviation. Prohibiting airspace after attacks is part of standard operation procedures of states for security reasons to prevent intrusion of enemy aircraft in the territory and make it easy for air defence systems to identify friendly aircraft in the airspace.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Chinese hackers have targeted the communication devices of US presidential candidates, including former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese hackers have targeted the communication devices of US presidential candidates, including former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. This sophisticated hacking attempt was reportedly orchestrated by a Chinese cyber espionage group known as 'Salt Typhoon'. According to the New York Times, the group infiltrated telecommunication networks and may have accessed critical data from major service providers, including Verizon.</p>

<p>According to reports, Salt Typhoon's targets in the US include not only Trump's campaign but also Democratic contenders, including Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attack on Verizon's infrastructure is considered part of a broader Chinese intelligence-gathering campaign. Although it remains uncertain whether the hackers succeeded in extracting specific communications, US federal agencies are now working to uncover the nature and extent of any data breach. "We are aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several US telecommunications providers to gather intelligence," Rich Young, a spokesperson for Verizon, told news agency AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Salt Typhoon?</strong></h3>

<p>Salt Typhoon, the designation coined by Microsoft's cybersecurity team, is a group of state-sponsored Chinese hackers. Microsoft labels Chinese hacker groups with the term "typhoon," while using "sandstorm" for Iranian and "blizzard" for Russian cyber actors. The term "salt" in this context denotes the group's specialised focus on counterintelligence rather than conventional cybercrime involving corporate data theft or financial fraud.</p>

<p>Salt Typhoon's operations appear exclusively aimed at collecting intelligence on critical American assets and institutions, especially during sensitive political seasons. In this case, Salt Typhoon targeted specific phone numbers linked to top political figures and their staff, as well as individuals with deep governmental ties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. officials are still in the early stages of assessing the full scope of the Salt Typhoon breach. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a joint statement acknowledging the severity of the threat, confirming that US government agencies are actively engaged in "investigating the unauthorised access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China."</p>

<p>In their statement, the FBI and CISA said that ongoing collaborative efforts with private sector companies are underway to bolster cybersecurity defences. "After the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and CISA immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims," the agencies said.</p>

<p>A significant concern is that Salt Typhoon may have obtained critical metadata, which can be as revealing as actual content in intelligence terms. For instance, metadata related to call patterns, times, and frequencies can reveal insights into relationships, strategic discussions, and even security vulnerabilities in communication channels. For Chinese intelligence, this data could provide clues about the inner workings and key figures in US decision-making circles, especially in the lead-up to the 2024 election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last of the Israelis left in a scenic surfing hotspot in Sri Lanka said they felt safe and would stay put despite a warning from the Israeli government to immediately leave due to the threat of a possible terrorist attack.</p>

<p>Israel's national security council called on Israelis on Wednesday to get out of tourist areas in the south of the Indian Ocean island nation, saying it had information about a terrorist threat focused on tourist areas and beaches.</p>

<p>The agency did not specify the nature of the threat but said the warning pertained to the Arugam Bay area - a popular haunt for Israelis - and beaches in the south and west of the country.</p>

<p>The US embassy in Sri Lanka and the German foreign ministry also followed with similar warnings, prompting Colombo to step up security and go on high alert.</p>

<p>Sri Lankan police have arrested three suspects for questioning in connection with an unspecified threat.</p>

<p>"We are working to ensure that all tourists are protected and their safety assured at all times," police spokesman Nihal Thalduwa told Reuters.</p>

<p>There were about 600-700 Israeli tourists through September to early October in Arugam Bay, local authorities said, but that number had dwindled to just 20 when the security warning was issued this week which came at the tailend of the tourist season.</p>

<p>By Friday, 17 had moved out of the area with some of them flying out of the country, leaving behind three Israelis in the south-eastern town of about 7,000 residents.</p>

<p>One of them, who has been coming to Sri Lanka since 1991 and is a long-term resident, said he feels safe and is expecting his wife and 17-year-old twin sons to join him in a week's time.</p>

<p>"I love coming here and my family loves coming here, and we surf for about three to four hours every day when my sons are here," he told Reuters on Friday after returning home from his morning surfing. "I don't think there is a serious security threat."</p>

<p>The man, who declined to be identified, said two policemen showed up after the first security warnings. Now, there are 16 security personnel, including police special forces, stationed around his small, blue-painted house in Arugam Bay.</p>

<p>Two other Israeli men, brothers who were lounging in their room at a nearby homestay, surrounded by about eight police and special forces personnel, also said they would remain until the end of the month and then relocate to nearby Ahangama town.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka has nevertheless tightened security, with the memory of Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 still fresh. Those attacks blamed on Islamic State targeted churches and three hotels, killing 267 people, including at least 45 foreign nationals.</p>

<p><strong>UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>Checkpoints have sprung up on the main roads and bridges in Arugam Bay and the surrounding area, and as many as 500 police, military and special forces were deployed.</p>

<p>Police stopped vehicles and checked identification cards of passengers.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have warned of an increase in threats of attacks on Israelis outside their country since the start of the war in Gaza. &nbsp; &nbsp; There has also been a surge in reports of antisemitic incidents in many parts of the world since war broke out in the Middle East after Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.</p>

<p>Arugam Bay residents dismissed social media speculation of tensions in the Muslim-majority town over the presence of Israelis in the wake of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"I started renting out rooms to foreigners last year and they are happy to stay here because they are not scared," said Abubakar Rinosha, 41, who owns the homestay of the Israeli brothers.</p>

<p>Other residents said Israeli tourists are a major source of income, accounting for 70% of the town's revenue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanese state media said the Israeli army dynamited houses in Lebanese border villages on Saturday, as Israel said it used 400 tonnes of explosives to destroy a Hezbollah tunnel, more than a month into an all-out war.</p>

<p>The official National News Agency said "the army of the Israeli enemy has since dawn blown up and destroyed houses" in the border village of Adaisseh.</p>

<p>The NNA also reported "large explosions" in the border village of Kfar Kila, saying the blasts were heard across the south as columns of smoke rose above the area.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said 400 tonnes of explosives were used to blow up a "strategic underground facility" in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The "tunnel" was more than 1.5 kilometres (around a mile) long, Adraee said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military had earlier reported "the explosion of a large quantity of explosives in Lebanon" that was strong enough to trigger earthquake warnings in large parts of Israel.</p>

<p>The Israeli army published a video showing massive detonations at the border.</p>

<p>Lebanese state media has reported several incidents of Israeli blasts targeting houses in border villages in recent days.</p>

<p>Israel's Channel 12 broadcast footage on Friday that appeared to show one of its presenters detonating a building while embedded with Israeli troops in the south Lebanon village of Aita al-Shaab.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says it is fighting Israeli troops at close quarters in Lebanese border villages.</p>

<p>The two sides began exchanging cross-border fire last year, but all-out war erupted on September 23, when Israel ramped up its air campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in south Lebanon, the capital Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley.</p>

<p>The war has left at least 1,615 people dead in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of health ministry figures though the real number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data.</p>

<p>The war has displaced at least 1.3 million people, according to the International Organization for Migration. More than 800,000 have sought refuge inside Lebanon while more than half a million have fled to Syria, most of them Syrians, according to Lebanese authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel wants peace in the region but is not ready to be attacked by Iran directly or indirectly, the country's Ambassador to India, Reuven Azar, has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel wants peace in the region but is not ready to be attacked by Iran directly or indirectly, the country's Ambassador to India, Reuven Azar, has said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV on Saturday, Mr Azar said this was one of the signals that his country wanted to send with its strikes on Iran earlier in the day and the other message is that it has the capability to hit many more targets in Iran if Tehran chooses to escalate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What Israel did is a very precise strike that took out Iran's air defence systems, and targeted military installations connected to their missile and drone programmes. The signal here is very clear: Israel will not agree to continue to be attacked by Iran either directly or indirectly," the ambassador said, hinting at Iran's proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah, with which Israel is already engaged in conflicts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran had earlier launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli targets on October 1.</p>

<p>Claiming that Iran is now exposed, Mr Azar said Israel is not worried about comments from the regime in Tehran warning of a "proportionate reaction" to the Israeli strike.</p>

<p>"We are ready for it. We are completely coordinating with our allies, especially the United States, which is completely backing our moves. It is very clear that Israel could have done much more to inflict damage on Iran but it chose to limit its response out of responsibility because we want to stay focused on this operation that the Israeli cabinet has determined - to completely eradicate the military capabilities of Hamas, to bring back our hostages and make sure Hamas doesn't rearm," the ambassador said.</p>

<p>In the north, where Israel shares a border with Lebanon, the ambassador said that the objective is to resettle Israeli communities in the areas from which they were evacuated because of attacks from Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"We are operating there as well, we have uprooted the military infrastructure that Hezbollah has created there for decades. And we will not agree that Iran will try to intervene in that and attack Israel. If they continue doing that, Israel will feel free to act in a much more decisive manner," he warned.</p>

<p><strong>'Will Pay The Price'</strong></p>

<p>To a question on whether Israel is locked in a never-ending war, Mr Azar said while that may seem to be the case, his country is defending itself and has created a situation in which Hamas can no longer attack it with missiles and the leadership of Hezbollah has been eliminated - and it is now for Iran to "accept the new reality".</p>

<p>"If they don't accept the new reality and come to the table to create a more stable situation in our region, they will pay the price," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ambassador said routes of diplomacy are always available and insisted that Israel did not start the war, which began after the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We want to restore peace in our region. We are prepared for diplomacy, but it has to lay on the foundation of the understanding of the other side that Israel will be relentless. We will not rest until we are sure that assurances for our security are met and we will maintain the right to self-defence against any aggression in the future," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Downplaying Is Good'</strong></p>

<p>On Iran claiming that the Israeli attack caused limited damage and its defence systems worked, Mr Azar said he was happy that Tehran was "downplaying" it because it could be a sign that it was not interested in continuing the aggression.</p>

<p>"Anybody that knows something about military capabilities knows that the S-300 (air defence system) that the Iranians have is not capable of stopping the F-35s and the F-16s of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and not capable of stopping our pilots from hitting any targets they want. So they can continue saying what they want but the situation is very clear and the message has been conveyed in a very clear way," he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cargo truck collided with a passenger bus in northern Mexico on Saturday, leaving at least 24 people dead and five others injured, local authorities said.</p>

<p>"So far, the preliminary information available is that 24 passengers have died and five people are injured and are being treated," Rodrigo Reyes, a senior official in the government of Zacatecas state, said in a video on social media.</p>

<p>The accident, on a highway that connects Zacatecas with the central state of Aguascalientes, occurred when a container filled with corn fell off the truck, causing the bus to overturn.</p>

<p>The bus was traveling between the city of Tepic, in western Nayarit state, and Ciudad Juarez on the US border.</p>

<p>The highway was closed to traffic, Reyes said, adding that army, National Guard and civil protection forces were deployed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With Kyle, Saskatchewan's November municipal election approaching, the town faces a notable obstacle: no candidates have stepped up to run for mayor or fill an open Town Council seat.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the November municipal election draws near, Kyle, a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada, is facing an unforeseen problem: there are no contenders for the mayorship, according to <em>CKOM.COM.</em></p>

<p>This year, current Mayor George Williams, who assumed office in November 2021, is scheduled to resign, leaving his position unfilled and without any candidates. Furthermore, there are still no nominees for a Town Council position.</p>

<p>Two rounds of candidate applications have been released to promote mayor nominations, but thus far, no one has shown interest, according to Chief Administrative Officer Amber Dashney.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a little concerning, but I am confident that someone will step forward," Dashney told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ckom.com/2024/10/24/its-not-unusual-town-of-kyle-looking-for-mayor-candidate/"><em>CKOM.COM.</em></a></p>

<p>The council will designate a deputy mayor to assume the duties of mayor if the post is not filled by the election on November 13.</p>

<p>"At that meeting, we will decide on a date for a by-election, and we will continue calling a by-election until we fill the mayor spot and the other councilor spot, as well," Dashney said.</p>

<p>Gordon Barnhart, former President of the Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA), said it can occur from time to time were nobody steps forward for council or mayoral nominations.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that it's common, but it's not unusual," he said.</p>

<p>He said it can be hard for small communities to find enough people willing and able to run for mayor or for council.</p>

<p>In 2016, Barnhart was elected as a councillor for the Town of Saltcoats - a community 30 kilometres southeast of Yorkton - through a byelection after some convincing from local community members.</p>

<p>Due to several vacant councillor positions, Barnhart said the town risked not meeting quorum at council meetings. He would go on to serve as a councillor in Saltcoats until 2020, before being elected as mayor where he sat until 2022.</p>

<p>"It is really a dedication to your community where you feel that you can make a difference," Barnhart said.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E">2021 Statistics Canada census data,</a> the Town of Kyle has population of 413, and the Town of Saltcoats has a population of 473.</p>

<p>While towns and villages have smaller populations to choose from, Barnhart said people's time and confidence may be factors that prevent people from running for a seat.</p>

<p>In a statement, SUMA said as long as council can maintain quorum, it can continue with meetings.</p>

<p>"While it's rare, it's not unheard of for no one to put their name forward for mayor, or for too few people to put their names forward for council," the statement read. "In nearly all cases, someone will put their name in for the following byelection and the spot will be filled."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A recent study by The Lancet Public Health Commission reveals that approximately 80 million people worldwide suffer from gambling disorders, with adolescents being the most affected.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An estimated 80 million people worldwide suffer from gambling disorders or problematic gambling as a result of the digital revolution's substantial expansion of the online casino and sports betting markets. Adolescents are the most affected group, according to a recent study by the Lancet Public Health Commission.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/gambling">Commission's research</a> further states that children and teenagers are being exposed to gambling product marketing in previously unheard-of ways. Because of this exposure, they are especially vulnerable to the allure of quick cash and the addictive qualities of online gambling sites.</p>

<p>There is a pressing need for greater knowledge and preventative measures to protect vulnerable people from the dangers of online gambling as the prevalence of gambling problems rises, particularly among younger populations.</p>

<p>The author of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/gambling">reports said </a>that "gambling is not an ordinary kind of leisure; it can be a health-harming, addictive behaviour. The harms associated with gambling are wide-ranging, affecting not only an individual's health and wellbeing but also their wealth and relationships, families, and communities, and deepening health and societal inequalities."</p>

<p>"By examining these harms, the Commission unveils the intersections between the social, commercial, legal, and political determinants of health. The Commission sheds light on the increasingly complex commercial ecosystem for gambling and its digital transformation, which offers unparalleled capacities for gambling," the report further said.</p>

<p>The Commission calls on governments and policymakers to treat gambling as a public health issue-just as for other addictive and health-harming commodities, such as alcohol and tobacco-and provides recommendations to prevent and mitigate the broad range of harms associated with gambling," the report further said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran warned on Saturday it would defend itself after Israeli air strikes killed at least two soldiers and further stoked fears of a full-scale regional war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Israel warned Iran would "pay a heavy price" if it responded to the strikes, and the United States, Germany and Britain demanded Tehran not escalate the conflict further.</p>

<p>Other countries, including many of Iran's neighbours, condemned Israel's strikes and some, such as Russia, urged both sides to show restraint and avoid what Moscow dubbed a "catastrophic scenario".</p>

<p>The Islamic republic insisted it had the "right and the duty" to defend itself, while its Lebanese ally Hezbollah said it had already launched rocket salvos targeting five residential areas in northern Israel.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said 80 projectiles were fired across the border on Saturday.</p>

<p>Confirming its own strikes after explosions and anti-aircraft fire echoed around Tehran, the Israel military said it had hit Iranian missile factories and military facilities in several regions.</p>

<p>The "retaliatory strike has been completed and the mission was fulfilled", while Israeli aircraft "returned safely", a military spokesman added.</p>

<p>Iran confirmed Israel had targeted military sites in Tehran province around the capital and other parts of the country, saying the raids caused "limited damage" but killed two soldiers.</p>

<p><strong>Direct attack</strong></p>

<p>Israel had vowed to retaliate after October 1, when Iran fired around 200 missiles in only the second ever direct attack against its arch-foe. Most of those missiles were intercepted but one person was killed.</p>

<p>The Israeli retaliation drew condemnation from Hamas, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, which warned against further escalation. Jordan stated that Israeli jets had not used its airspace. Turkey was one of the most outspoken critics, calling for an end to "terror created by Israel".</p>

<p>Israel is already engaged in combat on two fronts.</p>

<p>Since last month, it has been fighting a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, including strikes that have killed the group's senior leadership and ground incursions seeking to destroy missile sites.</p>

<p>And, for more than a year since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, Israel has been fighting a war in Gaza that has caused mass civilian casualties in the densely populated Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The United Nations has warned the "darkest moment" of that conflict was unfolding, with Palestinians facing a dire humanitarian crisis and daily Israeli bombing.</p>

<p>Along with Hezbollah and Hamas, Iranian-allied groups in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, have carried out attacks during the fallout from the Gaza war.</p>

<p>At roughly the same time as Israel struck targets in Iran, the Syrian state news agency SANA said an Israeli air attack targeted military positions in central and southern Syria.</p>

<p><strong>'Iranian proxies'</strong></p>

<p>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose network of pro-Iran factions, claimed responsibility before dawn Saturday for a drone attack against a "military target" in northern Israel.</p>

<p>On Friday, two people died from shrapnel wounds after a Hezbollah rocket barrage into Israel's north, Israeli officials said.</p>

<p>In addition to the residential strikes, Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at Israeli soldiers near the village of Aita al-Shaab in southern Lebanon and at an intelligence base as well as launching drones against Israel's Tel Nof air base south of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli strike had killed a Hezbollah-affiliated medic in Bazuriyeh in the south of the country.</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Israel's response to Iran was "an exercise in self-defence".</p>

<p>He urged Iran to "cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation".</p>

<p>The Israeli military has blamed "Iran and its proxies" in the region for "relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7", when Hamas's attack against Israel triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Dozens of hostages seized on that day are still held by militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory bombardment and ground war in Gaza has killed 42,924 people, the majority civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, figures the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>In late September Israel turned its focus to Lebanon hitting, Hezbollah targets and leaders and then sending in ground troops.</p>

<p>Israel says the aim is to make the north of its country safe for tens of thousands of displaced civilians to return.</p>

<p>At least 1,580 people have been killed in Lebanon since September 23, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>In April, in its first-ever direct assault against Israeli territory, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles.</p>

<p>Tehran said the barrage was retaliation for a strike on Iran's consular annexe in Damascus that killed members of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>

<p>Explosions later in April shook Iran's Isfahan province in what US officials, cited by American media, said was Israeli retaliation.</p>

<p><strong>Hospital under threat</strong></p>

<p>Iran said its October 1 missile attack on Israel was retaliation for an Israeli air raid that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah as well as the assassination in Tehran of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>On Friday, Gaza's health ministry accused Israeli forces of storming the last functioning hospital in the territory's north in a raid it said left two children dead.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces were operating around Kamal Adwan Hospital in north Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp but it was "not aware of live fire and strikes in the area of the hospital".</p>

<p>The Israeli military says it is seeking to destroy operational capabilities Hamas is trying to rebuild in the north.</p>

<p>Also on Friday, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli drone strikes killed 12 people waiting to receive aid near the Al-Shati refugee camp.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the patrolling agreement with China, which was announced earlier this week, it will take time to rebuild trust and for the two countries to be willing to work with each other, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said.</p>

<p>During an interaction with students from a university in Pune on Saturday, Mr Jaishankar said the breakthrough with China was possible because the military enabled India to stand its ground and make its point and diplomacy also did its part. A focus on infrastructure in border areas, which enabled effective deployment of the military, also played a key role.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on the patrolling and disengagement agreement in the Depsang and Demchok areas in Eastern Ladakh and what can be expected from the future of India-China relations, the minister said, "From 2020, the situation at the border has been very disturbed and that has, understandably, had a very negative impact on the overall relationship. Since September 2020, we have been negotiating with the Chinese on how to find a solution."</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said there were different aspects to the solution but the pressing one was disengagement because "the troops are very very close up to each other and the possibility of something happening, god forbid, is there". The other aspects, he said are de-escalation, given the troop buildup by China and India's response to it, and the larger question of boundary settlement.</p>

<p>The focus, for now, is disengagement, the minister said, stressing that while there had been understandings in some areas after 2020, blocking of patrolling remained an issue which was being negotiated for two years. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"So, what happened on October 21 was that in Depsang and Demchok, we came to the understanding that patrolling would be resumed how it used to be before... This was important because it was an affirmation that if we can do the disengagement, then it is possible for the leadership level to meet, which is what happened (with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting) in Russia's Kazan during the BRICS summit," he said during the interaction at FLAME University in Pune.</p>

<p><strong>Future Of Ties</strong></p>

<p>On the question of where the India-China relationship goes from here, Mr Jaishankar said, "I think it is a bit early. We have to wait for things to settle themselves. Because, after four years of a very disturbed border where peace and tranquillity have been shattered, it will naturally take time to rebuild a degree of trust and a willingness to work with each other."</p>

<p>"If we have reached where we have today, there are two reasons for it. The first is a very determined effort on our part to stand our ground and make our point and this would only happen because the military was there in very, very unimaginable conditions to defend the country. The military did its part and diplomacy did its part," he emphasised.</p>

<p>The second reason, the minister said, was the importance given to improving infrastructure in the border areas in the past decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today, we have put in almost five times annually the resources that would be there a decade ago. That's showing results and that enables the military to be effectively deployed. I would be patient. When PM Modi and President Xi met, it was decided that the foreign ministers and national security advisers would meet and see how this should be taken forward," he explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Process On</strong></p>

<p>NDTV had reported on Friday on satellite images showing tents and semi-permanent structures being removed by the Chinese side in Depsang and Demchok.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The patrolling agreement had been announced by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday and army sources had said on Friday that the process of disengagement would be completed in the two contentious areas by October 29. PM Modi and Mr Jinping welcomed the agreement when they met on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The stand-off between the Indian and Chinese armies began on May 2020 and a deadly clash took place in Ladakh's Galwan the next month in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action and an unspecified number on the Chinese side also died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A troop buildup followed and, after months of talks, Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from the contentious Gogra-Hot Springs area in Ladakh in September 2022 and returned to the pre-April-2020 position.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Law enforcement agencies have arrested more than a dozen vloggers and TikTokers accusing them of spreading fake stories about an alleged rape of a girl student that led to violent protests across Punjab province over a week ago.</p>

<p>Senior Punjab police officer Imran Kishwar said on Saturday that police have also identified 40 students involved in vandalism and violence.</p>

<p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the local police have already arrested 16 individuals, mostly vloggers and tiktokers, during the week for their alleged involved in spreading a fake rape story, he said, adding, those identified for vandalism and violence will be arrested soon.</p>

<p>"We have also blocked 138 social media accounts spreading fake news about the incident," he added.</p>

<p>The FIA said that technical reports of the cybercrime wing had identified social media accounts of 38 senior journalists, lawyers, vloggers and TikTokers who were found involved in sharing the news of the alleged fake propaganda, instigating the general public to involve in ransacking the government and private infrastructure.</p>

<p>At least 50 students were injured and one security guard killed during massive protests that had turned violent across several cities of Punjab province last week following a social media report about a female student allegedly raped by a security guard at a women's college in Lahore. Police had also detained over 600 students.</p>

<p>Later, an investigative committee formed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz found no evidence of rape at the college, nor did it find any eyewitnesses.</p>

<p>The committee conducted interviews with around 28 students, who mentioned they had heard about the incident from others. The committee's report stated that the matter was sensationalised through social media posts.</p>

<p>Maryam Nawaz blamed former jailed prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf for exploiting the matter through social media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization said it has regained contact with staff at a besieged northern Gaza hospital, finding that three health workers had been injured and 44 detained.</p>

<p>Kamal Adwan, northern Gaza's last functioning hospital, "is still under siege, but we managed to get in touch with the staff", WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X late Friday.</p>

<p>"Three health workers and another employee have been injured, 44 health workers have been detained and four ambulances damaged," he said.</p>

<p>On Friday Gaza's health ministry accused Israeli forces of storming Kamal Adwan hospital in the Jabalia camp, where it launched a major operation earlier this month.</p>

<p>It said the raid left two children dead, and accused the Israeli forces of detaining hundreds of staff, patients and displaced people during the raid.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces were operating around Kamal Adwan, but was "not aware of live fire and strikes in the area of the hospital".</p>

<p>Amid the chaos, WHO said Friday afternoon that it had lost contact with staff at Kamal Adwan, with Tedros describing the development in an earlier post on X the development as "deeply disturbing".</p>

<p>Tedros said the WHO and partner agencies had reached the hospital late on Wednesday night and managed to transfer 23 patients and 26 caregivers to the Palestinian territory's main Al-Shifa Hospital.</p>

<p>"Kamal Adwan Hospital has been overflowing with close to 200 patients -- a constant stream of horrific trauma cases. It is also full of hundreds of people seeking shelter," he said.</p>

<p>In his second post, Tedros highlighted that, in all, "around 600 patients, health workers and individuals are currently sheltering in the hospital".</p>

<p>"The siege and attacks on health workers occurred just hours after the WHO-led mission which delivered essential supplies to keep the facility operational and took critical patients to Al-Shifa Hospital," he said.</p>

<p>"We urge for hospitals, health workers and patients to be protected. Ceasefire!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A suicide bomber detonated at a checkpoint in western Pakistan on Saturday, killing eight people and wounding five more, officials said.</p>

<p>The bomber set off the blast from the back of a motorbike rickshaw near the town of Mir Ali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a local police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Four police officers were killed alongside two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians in the attack near the border with Afghanistan, he said.</p>

<p>Pakistan has seen an increase in militancy since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad claiming hostile groups are now using the neighbouring country for shelter.</p>

<p>"Among the five injured personnel, the condition of three is critical, and they have been transferred to a local military hospital," the police officer said.</p>

<p>A local government official who also did not want to be named confirmed the same toll of dead and wounded.</p>

<p>The attack was claimed by a little-known militant group calling itself "Aswad ul-Harb".</p>

<p>Another checkpost near the Afghan border was raided this week by the Pakistani Taliban, killing 10 police officers.</p>

<p>Last year, the country saw more suicide attacks than any year since 2014, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>

<p>There were 29 suicide attacks registered, killing 329 people in Pakistan's deadliest year in a decade.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 10 police officers were killed in a "terrorist attack" in an area of southeastern Iran long plagued by unrest, local media reported on Saturday.</p>

<p>They were killed during an attack on "police vehicles" in Sistan-Baluchistan province's Taftan county, the Mehr and Tasnim news agencies reported, without saying how it was carried out.</p>

<p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred some 1,200 kilometres (745 miles) southeast of the capital Tehran.</p>

<p>The official IRNA news agency, citing a police statement, reported the death of "10 personnel in two patrol units" in what it called an ambush.</p>

<p>Sistan-Baluchistan borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, and is one of the most impoverished provinces in the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>It is home to a large number of the Baluch minority, an ethnic group spread between Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan who practise Sunni Islam in contrast to the country's predominantly Shiite population.</p>

<p>The province has experienced recurring clashes between Iranian security forces and rebels from the Baluch minority, radical Sunni groups and drug traffickers.</p>

<p>Saturday's attack was one of the deadliest attacks in the area in recent months.</p>

<p>In early October, at least six people, including police officers, were killed in the province in two separate attacks.</p>

<p>The Pakistan-based Sunni jihadist group Jaish al-Adl -- Army of Justice in Arabic -- claimed responsibility for the two attacks in a message on Telegram.</p>

<p>Formed in 2012 by Baluch separatists, the group is considered a "terrorist organisation" by both Iran and the United States.</p>

<p>Iran and Pakistan frequently accuse each other of allowing rebel groups to operate and launch attacks from their respective territories.</p>

<p>In mid-January, Iran carried out a strike in Pakistan and targeted the Jaish al-Adl headquarters, according to the Mehr agency.</p>

<p>Describing themselves as "soldiers of Allah", the group's members regularly call for "armed jihad" against the Islamic republic.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases in women has nearly tripled in the past three decades globally, according to a new study led by researchers from the Gujarat Adani Institute of Medical Sciences (GAIMS).</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes and hypertension were the leading causes of CKD-related deaths in women, said the research which was presented at the ‘ASN Kidney Week 2024' in San Diego in the US from October 23–27.</p>

<p>“This calls for immediate policy interventions, targeted prevention programmes, and investment in health care infrastructure to curb the rise of CKD, particularly in high-risk regions,” senior author Hardik Dineshbhai Desai, an independent clinical and public health researcher at GAIMS.</p>

<p>GAIMS is the first public-private-partnership (PPP) endeavour between the Gujarat government and Adani Education and Research Foundation.</p>

<p>The analysis, titled ‘Global, National, and Regional Trends in the Burden of Chronic Kidney Disease among Women from 1990- 2021: A Comprehensive Global Analysis,' drew from the ‘Global Burden of Disease' study 2021, a comprehensive effort to quantify health loss across the world over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From 1990 to 2021, the average annual percentage change in CKD prevalence in women increased by 2.10 per cent, mortality by 3.39 per cent, and disability-adjusted life years by 2.48 per cent.</p>

<p>There have also been significant disparities in CKD-related mortality and morbidity across the world, with marked increases observed particularly in Latin America, North America, and among older adults.</p>

<p>The study showed an alarming increased mortality rate attributable to metabolic risk factor over the last decade after a slight decrease between 2000 and 2010.</p>

<p>“Public awareness campaigns about the importance of early diagnosis, healthy lifestyles, and the management of underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension are critical,” said Desai.</p>

<p>“Without swift action, the continued rise of CKD could overwhelm health care systems and lead to increased mortality and morbidity worldwide,” he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

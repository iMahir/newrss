       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippe Lazzarini, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), said that Gaza has become a 'graveyard' for children.</p>

<p>"They are being killed, injured, forced to flee, and deprived of safety, education, and play," Lazzarini said in a statement marking World Children's Day, observed annually on November 20, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Their childhood has been stolen, and they are on the verge of becoming a lost generation, having lost another school year," Lazzarini said.</p>

<p>He noted that children in the West Bank are enduring constant fear and anxiety. Since last October, more than 170 children have been killed, while many others have lost their childhood to detention in Israeli facilities.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Palestinian groups called for international action to protect children in Gaza and the West Bank, highlighting the catastrophic humanitarian conditions they are enduring.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement emphasising that children are the most vulnerable and affected by Israeli practices, enduring dire conditions that violate their fundamental rights, including the right to life.</p>

<p>The ministry warned that children in Gaza face a real threat, with hundreds of thousands estimated to be suffering from severe shortages of food and clean drinking water.</p>

<p>The statement also emphasised that children in the West Bank are consistently subjected to the same 'criminal' policies, such as arbitrary detention, and face illegal trials, which blatantly violate their rights under international agreements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Council said that children in Gaza are 'paying the heavy price' since October 2023, "in full view of the world, which remains unable to stop this genocide."</p>

<p>A statement issued by the council on the occasion noted that the bodies of Gaza's children have been exposed to various weapons, including rockets and bombs, as well as "the most horrific images of killing and destruction," with many dying from hunger, thirst, and diseases due to the siege. Thousands of children have become orphans.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's strike on Ukraine was not an ICBM, but an "experimental" medium-range ballistic missile, a US official said Thursday, playing down the significance of the attack.</p>

<p>"Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters... but it will not be a game changer in this conflict," the US official said.</p>

<p>Ukraine accused Russia on Thursday of having launched a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as part of a barrage on the central city of Dnipro.</p>

<p>The US official said the missile used in the strike was not an ICBM but an "experimental medium-range ballistic missile" and Russia "likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles."</p>

<p>"Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon," the official said.</p>

<p>The United States briefed Ukraine and allies in recent days about Russia's possible use of the weapon, the official said.</p>

<p>The US official also recalled that President Joe Biden had announced plans earlier this year to provide Ukraine with hundreds of Patriot and AMRAAM missiles to strengthen its air defenses.</p>

<p>"The United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine to strengthen capabilities, including air defense, and put Ukraine in the best possible position on the battlefield," the official said.</p>

<p>Tension has been building between Moscow and Kyiv's allies in the West since Ukrainian forces struck Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range weapons on Tuesday after getting the green light from Washington.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the missile strike on Dnipro bore "all the characteristics" of an ICBM attack and accused the Kremlin of "using Ukraine as a testing ground."</p>

<p>Local authorities in Dnipro said an infrastructure facility was hit and two civilians were wounded.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Communications Minister Michelle Rowland says platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram fall under the umbrella of the law.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's government plans to fine global social media firms $32 million for systemic breaches against a bill that it introduced on Thursday that seeks to ban social media for children under 16 years of age. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland says platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram fall under the umbrella of the law.</p>

<p>The "world-leading", as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calls it, bill forces social media firms to ensure age verifications are in place and does not place that onus on parents or children.</p>

<p>"Social media has a social responsibility ... that's why we are making big changes to hold platforms to account for user safety," Rowland said. "This bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia," she added.</p>

<p>Although the children can access online gaming, messaging, online classrooms, YouTube or just health and education related services in general.</p>

<p>"This is a landmark reform. We know some kids will find workarounds, but we're sending a message to social media companies to clean up their act," Albanese said in a statement.</p>

<p>Meta and X have thrown the ball in the court of application stores like Google and Apple to reinforce age verification rather than the social platforms.</p>

<p>It plans to bring about on a trial basis, an age-verification system such as biometrics or a government identification in order to access social media. This is being touted as some of the most stringent controls imposed by any country till date and does not even exempt parental consent or pre-existing accounts.</p>

<p>The current Australian government is of the view that social media causes more harm than good to the physical and mental health of children, burdening girls with body image issues and zeroing in on boys with misogynistic content.</p>

<p>However, Katie Maskiell from UNICEF Australia says that this ban will only push young people onto, "covert and unregulated online spaces".</p>

<p>Last year, France intended to do the same with children under 15, but children could avoid the ban citing parental consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Norway imposed a minimum age of 13 to access social media, the surveys found that 70 per cent of 11 year-olds were still using social media platforms.</p>

<p>"For too many young Australians, social media can be harmful. Almost two-thirds of 14 to 17-year-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online, including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm," Rowland said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Australia also plans to ban pornography for children under 18 years of age.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the golden years, this city witnessed a significant economic boom. It remains one of the most liveable cities in the world, a financial power hub and also an emerging city for sex tourism, with men wandering on the streets, looking for women.</p>

<p>The city is not where you are thinking. Apart from Bangkok in Thailand, Tokyo is emerging as a hotbed for sex tourism, with multiple factors driving the interest among foreign tourists, one of them being the weakening of the Japanese Yen against other currencies and robust inbound tourism.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2024/11/17/welcome-to-tokyo-asias-new-sex-tourism-capital" rel="noindex,nofollow">The Star</a> reported quoting, Yoshihide Tanaka, secretary general of the Liaison Council Protecting Youths (Seiboren), that "Japan has become a poor country." Adding, that a park next to his organisation has become synonymous with the city's sex trade. He said they had noticed an increasing number of foreigners frequenting the park as soon as pandemic-era travel restrictions were dropped.</p>

<p>"Now we are seeing a lot more foreign men," he said. "They come from many countries. They are white, Asian, black - but the majority are Chinese," he said. This influx has coincided with a troubling rise in teenagers and women in their early twenties turning to the sex industry to survive, Tanaka said.</p>

<p>"The reality is that Japan has become a country where foreign men can obtain young women and essentially buy sexual services," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/10/06/japan/society/japan-sex-tourism/" rel="noindex,nofollow">Japan Times</a> reported quoting Kazunori Yamanoi of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the country's main opposition party. "This is no longer just a domestic issue," he said. "It's a very serious problem regarding how Japanese women are perceived in the international community."</p>

<p>The cops have been cracking down on such activities. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20241119_29/" rel="noindex,nofollow">Earlier this week</a>, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police arrested five people on suspicion of violating Japan's Employment Security Act. They were allegedly running an operation to recruit women through social media to work in the sex industry. According to police, the suspects' group signed contracts with about 350 shops nationwide and recruited women through social media.</p>

<p>Financial distress suffered by women during Covid-19 is a major factor pushing them into the sex trade, with many wanting to pay off their debts. Some simply want to spend money at host clubs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japan Times earlier reported that establishments, where men flirt with women over food and drink, like host clubs, put women in an endless cycle of debt through malicious schemes. These clubs have been linked to an increase in sex work, including illegal operations overseas and street solicitors, the report said.</p>

<p>According to the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), around 43% of women arrested while working the street in 2023 said they started selling their bodies to pay for host clubs and underground male idols. About 80% of those arrested were in their 20s, while three were 19 or younger.</p>

<p>The loopholes in the law and poor implementation of the existing ones have put women in vulnerable positions, often exposing them to physical violence and sexually transmitted diseases. In countries like The Netherlands, prostitution is legal but the industry is highly regulated to ensure the protection of women&nbsp;with increased vigilance in combating human trafficking and other forms of criminal activity, but sex trafficking still remains a pressing issue in the country.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States "fundamentally rejects" a decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, the White House said Thursday.</p>

<p>"We remain deeply concerned by the Prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision. The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter," a National Security Council spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The statement made no mention of an ICC arrest warrant also issued for Mohammed Deif, the military chief of Hamas.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor under US President-elect Donald Trump's administration, defended Israel and promised a "strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January."</p>

<p>"The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the US government," Waltz said on X.</p>

<p>His comments reflected a wider outrage among Republicans, with some calling for the US Senate to sanction the ICC, which counts 124 national members who are in theory obliged to arrest individuals subject to warrants.</p>

<p>Neither the United States nor Israel is a member of the ICC and both have rejected its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Hague-based court said Thursday that the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued "for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued for Deif, whom Israel claimed was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July, but Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a historic moment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Parliament in Guyana today. He is the first Indian prime minister in 56 years to visit the Caribbean nation. In his speech, PM Modi emphasised on the special bond between the two nations as highlighted the age-old ties which exist from the first Indians who migrated over 180 years ago.</p>

<p>PM Modi began his address to the parliamentarians in Guyana by saying, "I am here today in the capacity of India's Prime Minister, but I've come to your beautiful country before - 24 years ago - as someone who was curious to know more about your country, its people, and the Caribbean region."</p>

<p>"India and Guyana share a deep bond - a relationship of trust, hard work, and mutual respect," PM Modi said in his opening remarks. He further noted that the two nations share common democratic values, and that, he said, is the way forward.</p>

<p>"For the world today, the strongest <em>mantra</em> to move forward is 'Democracy First-Humanity First'," he said. The prime minister, who had said over a year ago that 'This is not an era for war', today added to it by saying, "This is an era of cooperation, not conflict", as he explained further that "Democracy is the way forward, not expansionism."</p>

<p>Giving India's example, he said, "Wherever the need arose, be it due to conflicts, calamities, economic crises, or even the pandemic, India selflessly worked for the benefit of the entire world. From Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Maldives in the neighbourhood to Turkiye and Syria, when there were calamities and crises, India acted as a responsible nation by being the first-responder. Because that is deep rooted in our ancient values."</p>

<p>He further said that "India has never moved forward with ill intent or greed. We have never worked with an expansionist mindset. India has never fostered ties with any nation with the ill-intent of exploiting or capturing resources. We have always stayed away from doing that. Be it Sea or Space, these should be issues of universal cooperation, not universal conflict."</p>

<p>"It is a time countries to identify the conditions that cause conflict and address them," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi went on to say "Today, 'democracy first, humanity first' is the strongest mantra to move ahead. The spirit of 'democracy first' teaches us to take everyone along and participate in everyone's development. The spirit of 'humanity first' decides the direction of our decisions. When 'humanity first' is made the basis of decisions, the results prove to be beneficial for humanity."</p>

<p>He said that in the spirit of 'Democracy First, Humanity First', India is also doing its duty as a 'Vishwa Bandhu', acting as first responders in times of crisis.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Linger endured 97 days of hospitalisation and was subjected to seven sessions of electroshock therapy during her stay.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A transgender woman in China has made history by winning a record-breaking payout of 60,000 yuan (Rs 6,92,637) after being subjected to involuntary electroshock treatment&nbsp;in a psychiatric hospital. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/transgender-woman-wins-record-payout-in-china-after-electroshock-treatment">Guardian</a></em>,&nbsp;the Changli County People's Court in Qinhuangdao, Hebei, awarded the amount to Ling'er, a 28-year-old performance artist and transgender woman. Born male but identifying as female, Ling'er's case marked a significant milestone in the country's recognition of LGBTQ+ right</p>

<p>Ling'er expressed hope that her case—the first in China where a transgender individual successfully challenged electroshock conversion practices—would inspire others in the LGBTQ+ community to address medical disputes and safeguard their rights. ''In China, the situation for transgender people is not very optimistic. There's a lack of protection for this group," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her harrowing experience began in July 2022 when she was involuntarily admitted to Qinhuangdao City Fifth Hospital. Having come out as transgender to her parents the previous year, she faced strong opposition, with her family dismissing her gender identity as a sign of mental instability. Consequently, they committed her to a psychiatric facility.</p>

<p>During her stay at the hospital, the staff misdiagnosed Ling'er with "anxiety disorder and discordant sexual orientation", despite her identifying as heterosexual. Ling'er endured 97 days of hospitalisation and was subjected to seven sessions of electroshock therapy during her stay.</p>

<p>"It caused serious damage to my body. Every time I underwent the treatment, I would faint … I didn't agree to it, but I had no choice. The hospital tried to ‘correct me', to make me conform to society's expectations," Ling'er said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The electroshock treatments&nbsp;caused ongoing heart problems which require medication.&nbsp;Determined to seek justice, she filed a lawsuit against the hospital which reached the courts. She argued that her rights had been violated by the treatments.&nbsp;Under China's mental health law, individuals can only be subjected to psychiatric treatment against their will if they pose a danger to themselves or others.</p>

<p>Darius Longarino, a research scholar at Yale Law School who focuses on Chinese law and civil society, said doctors who administered medicines or used electroshock practices to "convert" gay or trans people were "using intrusive, harmful treatments in order to treat something that should not be diagnosed in the first place".&nbsp;</p>

<p>LGBTQ+ activists hailed the decision as a breakthrough, paving the way for greater inclusivity and acceptance.</p>

<p>This case isn't the first time a Chinese court has ruled in favour of a transgender individual. In 2020, a Beijing court ruled that e-commerce company Dangdang should reinstate a transgender woman's contract and provide full back pay after she was fired for taking leave for sex reassignment surgery. The court also emphasised the importance of respecting the woman's gender identity and providing access to the women's bathroom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today addressed the Special Session of the Guyanese Parliament during his visit to the South American country on the third and final leg of his three-nation tour. During his address, PM Modi talked about the history of India-Guyana ties and about his visit to Guyana fourteen years ago. Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the two countries' mutual love of cricket, music and 'chutney' while comparing their cultures. Whether it's Guyanese or Indian chutney, he said, both are equally delightful.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/democracy-first-humanity-first-pm-modis-mantra-in-guyana-parliament-address-7073519#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories"><strong>Also Read | "Democracy First, Humanity First": PM Modi's Mantra In Guyana Parliament Address</strong></a></p>

<p>In India, chutney is primarily known as a condiment, a flavorful edible sauce often served with meals. However, in the Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, and other parts of the region, the term 'chutney' takes on a different meaning. It is also used to describe a vibrant genre of music that blends Indian rhythms with Caribbean influences, showcasing the fusion of cultures in the region.</p>

<p><strong>What is Chutney Music?</strong></p>

<p>Chutney music is a vibrant fusion of Indian folk music, primarily Bhojpuri, with the infectious rhythms of Caribbean calypso and soca. Born in Trinidad and Tobago, this genre has spread its popularity across the Caribbean, reaching as far as Fiji, Mauritius, and South Africa. Emerging in the mid-20th century, chutney music experienced its golden age in the 1980s, giving rise to numerous sub-genres.</p>

<p><strong>Here are a few videos of Chutney music:</strong><br />

<p>In his opening remarks, PM Modi said Guyana gave him its highest honour on Wednesday. "I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you, to every citizen of Guyana, for this honour. Thank you very much to all the citizens here. I dedicate this honour to every citizen of India."</p>

<p>Earlier, PM Modi met the top leaders of Caribbean nations such as St. Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Barbados, Bahamas, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Suriname, and Dominica on the sidelines of the second India-CARICOM Summit here and discussed strengthening bilateral ties and enhancing cooperation across several key areas.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gearing up to deal with the tough tariff increases by the incoming Trump administration in the US, China on Thursday announced new policy measures to back its export sector against “unreasonable foreign trade restrictions” and create a “good environment” for its exports.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump, who launched a trade war against China in his previous term by imposing a range of tariffs on Chinese exports, threatened to increase the duties by about 60 per cent, which could severely impact China's exports, especially their profitability.</p>

<p>In a notice, China's Commerce Ministry said the measures would help enterprises “actively respond to unreasonable foreign trade restrictions” and “create a good external environment for exports”.</p>

<p>The nine-point document, which enumerated measures intended to “promote the stable growth of foreign trade and consolidate and enhance the trend of positive economic recovery,” includes an expansion of export credit insurance coverage and more financing support for enterprises involved in international trade, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.</p>

<p>The ministry also called for strengthening cross-border e-commerce, which it said has become a bright spot in the country's economy.</p>

<p>The measures included expansion of exports including speciality agricultural products and other commodities, while supporting imports of crucial equipment and energy resources.</p>

<p>The ministry said the visa-free entry mechanism would be expanded in an “orderly manner” to further facilitate personnel exchanges.</p>

<p>Exports are the mainstay of the Chinese economy which is currently facing headwinds due to a range of problems, including sluggish domestic consumption and a bankrupt housing sector.</p>

<p>China's exports to the US last year totalled USD 427.2 billion despite the tariffs against USD 147.8 billion in imports from America. China also imposed retaliatory tariffs against exports from the US.</p>

<p>Trump's threat to further hike tariffs steeply raised serious concerns in Beijing which began efforts to protect its exporters.</p>

<p>Commenting on the measures, Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said the initiative was promising as global trade tensions were expected to heighten in the coming years.</p>

<p>“The recently introduced measures are not only a response to renewed US tariffs but also to growing tariffs and non-tariff barriers worldwide, which require Chinese exporters to enhance their ability to handle future trade disputes and investigations more proactively,” he told the Post.</p>

<p>An unnamed Beijing-based professor in public administration told the daily that while most of the measures were not new, they indicated the ministry was examining ways to mitigate the looming threat of a renewed or intensified trade war after Trump takes office in January.</p>

<p>“These measures, especially helping Chinese exporters fight trade barriers, can be key areas of work,” he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[PM Modi today addressed  the Guyanese Parliament in a significant milestone in diplomatic ties between the two countries. During his address, PM Modi talked about the history of India-Guyana ties and about his visit to Guyana fourteen years back.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Yesterday, Guyana conferred me with its top honour. I am thankful to all Guyanese people for this honour and I dedicate it to all the citizens of India.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Around 180 years ago, an Indian came to Guyana and ever since, in good and in bad, in every situation, India-Guyana ties have been full of cordiality.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Around 14 years back, I came to this beautiful country as a curious person. Usually, people like to travel to dazzling places but I came here to learn the history and culture of Guyana.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Today, 'democracy first, humanity first' is the strongest mantra to move ahead. The spirit of 'democracy first' teaches us to take everyone along and participate in everyone's development. The spirit of 'humanity first' decides the direction of our decisions. When 'humanity first' is made the basis of decisions, the results prove to be beneficial for humanity.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Back when India and Guyana became independent, there were different challenges. Today, in the 21st century, the world is facing different challenges. After Corona, we all had to move towards a new world order. However, the world got entangled with other issues.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Following on the spirit of Democracy First, Humanity first, today, India is fulfilling its duties towards the world as a Vishwa Bandhu. Whenever a problem arises globally, India steps in as a First Responder. During the chaos of COVID-19, every country was trying to save itself. At that juncture, India shared medicines and vaccines with more than 150 countries.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">We have never moved forward with the spirit of expansionism. We have always stayed away from the spirit of capturing resources, grabbing resources. Today India stands in favour of global development in every way, stands in favour of peace. With this feeling, today India has also become the voice of the Global South.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">This is not a time for conflict in the world, this is the time to identify the conditions that create conflict and remove them. Today there are so many challenges like terrorism, drugs, cyber crime... only by fighting them we will be able to shape the future of our coming generations.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">When it came to uniting the world, India gave the mantra of one earth, one family, one future during its G20 Presidency.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Today India stands in favour of global development in every way, stands in favour of peace. With this feeling, today India has also become the voice of the Global South.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King of Country - George Strait received the 2024 Country Music Association's (CMA) Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award. Artists and elite of the genre, gathered on Wednesday to pay tributes to him.</p>

<p>The Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award is a prestigious award that recognises artists who have significantly contributed to the country music genre. Strait has a towering 44 chart-toppers on Billboard's Hot Country Songs list.</p>

<p>Jamey Johnson, Miranda Lambert, Parker McCollum and 2024 CMA co-host of the show and winner of the CMA Entertainer of the Year, Lainey Wilson gave inspiring performances to celebrate Strait.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Johnson, a Grand Ole Opry member performed “Give It Away”, a song he co-wrote with Strait. Lambert and McCollum, the Texans, joined forces to render “Troubadour” - a timeless classic.</p>

<p>Speaking about a personal anecdote, McCollum shared, “George Strait's music played while I was in the womb because my mom was such a fan of his — it's the earliest music I remember hearing and falling in love with as a child.”</p>

<p>“She, like myself, is a Texan. “However, she's also, in her own right, a bonafide superstar of whom I've been a fan as long as I can remember. It's always a special honor to work with and learn from her,” McCollum said about Lambert, after reaching a career milestone of performing with Lambert.</p>

<p>After the tributes, George Strait took to stage with Chris Stapleton for a duet on “Honky Tonk Hall of Fame” from his recent album “Cowboys and Dreamers”. It was followed by a standing ovation from the crowd, post which Strait thanked the CMAs and the artists who performed his songs on the stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also added, “I want to thank my family who are all here tonight. My wife Norma, my son Bubba, his wife Tamara, my grandkids Harvey and Jillian,” Strait said. “Especially Norma, who has supported me for just shy of 53 years – it's been an amazing 53 years.”</p>

<p>Strait debuted in 1981 with the album Strait Country and has since sold over 100 million albums. With a career spanning three decades, his net worth is estimated at a whopping $300 million.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 38 people have died in Pakistan's restive northwest province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa after gunmen fired indiscriminately in two separate incidents of sectarian violence targeting Shia Muslims.</p>

<p>The region, not new to communal violence and terrorist attacks, has seen a sharp rise in such incidents in recent months, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people and dozens of soldiers.</p>

<p>In today's attacks, armed groups opened fire on two different convoys in which Shia Muslims were travelling. "Two separate convoys of Shiite people... were targeted by the terrorists in the Kurram district," Javed ullah Mehsud, a senior administration official, said. "The death toll has risen to 38, with 11 others injured in both attacks," he added.</p>

<p>The official said that as per information available to him, the deaths include that of six women, several children, and a number of police officers. He also said that "Around 10 attackers were involved in both incidents, firing indiscriminately from both sides of the road."</p>

<p>Each convoy reportedly had more than 40 vehicles and were being escorted by the police. The women and children who could escape the vehicles and run, took refuge in houses in the vicinity, said the official, adding that "we are currently searching for (the attackers) in the area."</p>

<p>Though the conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims in most Islamic nations have existed for centuries, Pakistan is facing a surge in such violence and killings. Tribes have been engaged in intermittent fighting for several months in Kurram, in the mountainous northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.</p>

<p>Last month, at least 16 people, including three women and two children, were killed in a sectarian clash in the same district. Earlier this year - in July and September - dozens of people were killed in violent clashes that paused only after a jirga, or tribal council, called a ceasefire.</p>

<h2><strong>SOLDIERS KILLED IN KHYBER-PAKHTUNKHWA</strong></h2>

<p>Earlier this week, more than 20 soldiers of the Pakistani Army were killed in two separate incidents of terrorist attacks in the smae province. A suicide attack in northwest Pakistan had killed 10 soldiers on Tuesday, a day after a clash with terrorists left eight soldiers Killed in Action in the same region bordering Afghanistan.</p>

<p>While the suicide bombing was claimed by the Hafiz Gul Bahadur armed militant group, the clash with soldiers a day earlier was carried out by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, also known as the Pakistani Taliban. They said it was in response to a search by security forces targeting one of its members.</p>

<p>The TTP is separate from the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, but both were active in supporting the Afghan Taliban in its war against the US-led NATO coalition since 2001.</p>

<p>The Afghan Taliban reclaimed power in Kabul in 2021, and Pakistan's border areas have seen a resurgence of violence since then.</p>

<p>The TTP claimed an attack in late October that left ten police officers dead at a check post in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, received a call from "higher-ups" in the middle of a live press briefing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A video from the press conference has now gone viral where Zakharova was allegedly instructed by someone on the phone to not comment at all.</p>

<p>This press briefing came in after Ukraine accused Russia of firing an intercontinental ballistic missile on the city of Dnipro. According to some Russian military bloggers, this firing was aimed at Yuzhmash - an aerospace manufacturer, now known as Pivdenmash.</p>

<p>The unknown male voice on the phone addressed Zakharova as "Masha", a diminutive of her first name, and advised her to not comment anything on the ballistic missile strike in the event. "On the 'Yuzhmash' ballistic missile strike that the Westerners have started talking about, we are not commenting at all," he said.</p>

— KyivPost (@KyivPost) <a href="https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1859556910371893394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The launch comes just a day after Putin signed off on changes to the nuclear doctrine.</p>

<p>The big change in the doctrine now says that an attack from a non-nuclear state backed by a nuclear state will be viewed by Russia as a joint attack on it.</p>

<p>"An ICBM launch can certainly be seen as a threatening gesture, potentially in response to the lifting of restrictions on ATACMS and Storm Shadow. It's a means of deterrence," said a European military source to Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, popularly referred as ICBMs are traditionally designed to carry a nuclear warhead, however it may also be used for conventional warheads. The concept, technology, design, and research behind ICBMs were to cater to a country's response in a nuclear event.</p>

<p>This is the first time Moscow has fired an ICBM, said Kyiv, as both sides saw major escalations in the war that marked its 1,000th day on Wednesday. According to Reuters, the missile was an RS-26 Rubezh, a solid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 5,800 km.</p>

<p>Both sides have used deadly long-range missiles to show its muscular posturing, even as several world leaders have urged Putin and Zelensky to resort to diplomacy to find an agreeable outcome to the war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When American soldiers liberated the only Nazi concentration camp in France almost exactly 80 years ago, they found it utterly deserted.</p>

<p>Thousands of people were worked to death or murdered in the Natzweiler-Struthof camp in the eastern Alsace region on the German border during World War II.</p>

<p>But when the Americans arrived on November 25, 1944 "they found a totally intact, totally empty camp", historian Cedric Neveu told AFP.</p>

<p>"There wasn't a single SS guard or a single prisoner. The camp was in perfect condition... the Germans probably thought they would return," he added.</p>

<p>Of the 50,000 or so people that were held in Struthof and its satellite camps, "17,000 died or went missing, especially in the death marches of spring 1945," Neveu said.</p>

<p>"You entered here by the big gate. You will leave through the chimney" of the crematorium, the camp commander told prisoners arriving in 1943, according to 100-year-old Henri Mosson -- one of the last surviving French inmates.</p>

<h3><strong>'Night and Fog'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Struthof was opened in 1941 near the village of Natzwiller, 800 metres (2,6000 feet) up in the Vosges mountains.</p>

<p>New waves of prisoners began arriving from 1943 after "Nacht und Nebel" ("Night and Fog") operations, Nazi roundups of political opponents they wished to disappear without trace.</p>

<p>Mosson, a member of the French Resistance, had been arrested in June 1943 and condemned to death.</p>

<p>In November that year, he was brought by train to Rothau, near the camp.</p>

<p>Prisoners were forced into trucks and cars "with blows from rifle butts and dog bites", he said.</p>

<p>"There wasn't enough space, so some had to stand for the final eight kilometres (five miles). One man died" on the way, Mosson recalled.</p>

<p>Prisoners were stripped, had their heads shaved and showered with water heated by the crematorium furnace before going through disinfection.</p>

<p>Mosson got work disinfecting the prisoners' clothes, giving him a chance of survival despite the biting winter cold, summer heat and starvation conditions.</p>

<p>"By the end we had nothing but boiled nettles" to eat, he said, adding that he weighed just 38 kilos (84 pounds) by the time he returned home.</p>

<p>Men from around 30 nationalities were held in Struthof, mostly Poles, Russians and French.</p>

<p>Among the detainees were Jews and Roma as well as Jehovah's Witnesses and regular convicts.</p>

<h3><strong>'Subhumans'</strong></h3>

<p>Political prisoners rounded up in the "Night and Fog" actions were "right at the bottom of the ladder", said Michael Landolt, who runs the European Centre for Deported Resistance Members located close to Struthof.</p>

<p>"They were given the hardest labour and had a higher death rate," he added.</p>

<p>Soviet and Polish prisoners were "considered by the Nazis to be 'Untermenschen' ("subhumans") and very badly mistreated" as well, Landolt said.</p>

<p>Beyond the harsh conditions, Struthof was also the scene of executions and medical experiments.</p>

<p>In August 1943, 86 Jewish prisoners were killed in a gas chamber so their remains could be added to a collection of Jewish skeletons.</p>

<p>Even as Allied forces pushed across France in 1944 and reached the camp, the inmates' suffering was not at an end.</p>

<p>They were forcibly evacuated to other camps on the other side of the Rhine River.</p>

<p>Struthof "continued to exist, like a cancer that has metastasized," historian Neveu described.</p>

<p>Its final end came when those satellite camps were evacuated in the spring of 1945.</p>

<p>After the war, Struthof was used to hold people who had collaborated with the Nazis until 1949, then became a prison.</p>

<p>Only later did it become a memorial site that is now visited by more than 200,000 people each year.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron is among leaders expected to pay tributes to the camp's victims at a commemoration at the site on Saturday.</p>

<p>Most of the prisoners' shacks have long been dismantled, but they are still marked out on the ground.</p>

<p>Visitors can still see the crematorium buildings, the prison and the gas chamber below, as well as walk the avenues of the cemetery where more than one thousand inmates are buried.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah traded deadly blows on Thursday as their war raged on despite signs of progress in US ceasefire efforts, with airstrikes pounding Beirut's southern suburbs and rockets flying into northern Israel.</p>

<p>US mediator Amos Hochstein was in Israel for talks with Israeli officials to try to secure a ceasefire which he said was "within our grasp" during a visit to Beirut earlier this week.</p>

<p>The diplomacy marks the most serious attempt yet to end the conflict between Israel and the heavily armed, Iran-backed Hezbollah, part of the regional spillover of the Gaza war that erupted more than a year ago.</p>

<p>In southern Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike killed three people in the village of Chaaitiyeh, some 10 km (6 miles), from the border, the Lebanese health ministry said.</p>

<p>In Israel, a 30-year-old man was killed when shrapnel from a rocket struck a playground in the northern town of Nahariya, Israel's MDA medical service said.</p>

<p>"The Israeli government is not safeguarding my security, my residents or the residents of the north (of Israel). It is not possible to live in such a situation like this," Nahariya Mayor Ronen Marelly told public broadcaster Kan.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said about 10 rockets were launched from Lebanon towards Nahariya. "Most of the projectiles were intercepted and fallen projectiles were identified," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>Channel 12 said three rockets hit the coastal town.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's al-Manar television station, citing its correspondent, confirmed rocket fire towards Nahariya and the surrounding area.</p>

<p>Airstrikes on Beirut's Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs shook the capital, sending up thick clouds of debris.</p>

<p>The Israeli military issued a statement on X ahead of strikes warning residents they were near Hezbollah targets against which it would soon take action. Residents have largely fled the area since Israel went on the offensive in September.</p>

<p>White House envoy Hochstein left for Israel after declaring progress during two days of talks in Lebanon with officials including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, endorsed to negotiate by the Iran-backed Hezbollah. Speaking before he left Beirut, Hochstein said he was going to Israel to try to close an agreement if possible.</p>

<p>The diplomacy aims to end a conflict that has inflicted massive devastation in Lebanon since Israel began its offensive, mounting airstrikes across wide parts of the country and sending in troops.</p>

<p>Footage broadcast by Al Jazeera showed thick smoke rising from the town of Khiyam in southern Lebanon, some 6 km (4 miles) from the border, a focal point of ground battles between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli troops.</p>

<p>Israel says its aim is to secure the return home of tens of thousands of people evacuated from its north due to rocket attacks by Hezbollah, which opened fire in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war in October 2023.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has suffered major blows since Israel began its offensive in September, has kept up rocket fire into Israel, attacking Tel Aviv this week. Its fighters are battling Israeli troops on the ground in the south.</p>

<p>The casualty toll since Oct. 2023 stands at 3,558 people killed in Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry says, most of them killed during the Israeli offensive since September. The figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry said 14 fatalities were reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah strikes have killed more than 100 people in northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. They include more than 70 soldiers killed in strikes in northern Israel and the Golan Heights and in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has deleted a post he wrote on X after the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump on Sunday in Florida. The billionaire had questioned why no one is trying to assassinate President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Responding to a post X that read, "Why they want to kill Donald Trump?", Mr Musk wrote: "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala."</p>

</div>

<p>However, his post has now been deleted.</p>

<p>The post had sparked a massive controversy, with one X user writing, "This at the least demands a visit from the FBI and Secret Service." Another person said they reported the post to X as "coded incitement of violence".</p>

<p>The Tesla and SpaceX chief is an open supporter of Mr Trump as the latter is set to go head-to-head with Vice President Harris in the upcoming US Presidential elections in November.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's campaign and law enforcement officials have reported that the Republican presidential candidate is safe after the assassination attempt at his golf course.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service confirmed one or more of its agents "opened fire on a gunman" located near the boundary of Mr Trump's golf course, and that an "AK-47 style rifle" with a scope was recovered along with a GoPro video camera.</p>

<p>This is the second attempt to assassinate Donald Trump this year, the first was two months ago when he was wounded in the ear after a gunman opened fire during a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Suspect Ryan Wesley Routh has been arrested in connection with the latest shooting. He was set up in the bushes near the sixth hole of the Trump International Golf Club, according to law enforcement officials.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The temporary mini-moon of Earth, which will orbit our planet for 53 days, will not be visible to the naked eye, confirmed Dr AK Anil Kumar, head of ISRO's Network for Space Objects Tracking and Analysis (NETRA). The mini-moon, called 2024 PT5, is just 10 meters in diameter. It is 350,000 times smaller than the regular moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 kilometres, and hence, will be undetectable by the naked eye.</p>

<p>NETRA is monitoring the movement of 2024 PT5 and has confirmed that the asteroid will not collide with Earth. The mini-moon will start orbiting the Earth for almost two months on September 29 before breaking away from the elliptical force of the Earth and heading back into the vastness of the solar system on November 25.</p>

<p>The asteroid, discovered on August 7 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), an automated system funded by NASA to monitor near-earth objects, also has a connection to the Hindu epic Mahabharata. In a report published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society (RNAAS), astronomers say that orbital properties of 2024 PT5 resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt, "a sparsely resonant population of small NEOs." Dr Anil Kumar of NETRA also confirms that 2024 PT5 is part of the Arjuna Asteroid grouping.</p>

<p>The 'Arjuna' is a unique group of asteroids in the solar system. The naming of this asteroid group can be traced back to 1991 when Astronomer Robert H. McNaught discovered an asteroid '1991 VG' at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia on November 1 of that year. The name 'Arjuna' was chosen by him inspired by the character in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. It was officially approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).</p>

<p>In Hindu mythology, Arjuna is known for his bravery, unparalleled archery skills, and wisdom. The name reflects the asteroid's swift passage through the solar system, like Arjuna's swift arrows, and its unpredictable nature.</p>

<p>Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos, the astronomers who authored the RNAAS report said, "near-Earth objects (NEOs) that follow horseshoe paths, and approach our planet at close range and low relative velocity, may undergo mini-moon events in which their geocentric energy becomes negative for hours, days or months, but without completing one revolution around Earth."</p>

<p>They also said this is not the first time a mini-moon will appear around the Earth. Similar phenomena have happened earlier in 1997, 2013, and 2018.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India is preparing for a sustainable energy path for the next 1,000 years, focusing on solar, wind, nuclear and hydropower.</p>

<p>Addressing the inaugural day of the 4th Global Renewable Energy Investor's Meet (RE-INVEST) 2024, the PM said, "Our aim is not to reach the top but to remain on top. Today, not only Indians but the entire world feels that India is the best bet of the 21st century. Global Fintech Fest was organised earlier this month, after which people from all over the world participated in the first solar international festival. Then people from every corner of the world came to the Global Semiconductor Summit and today we are gathered here to discuss the future of Green Energy."</p>

<p>"We don't have vast reserves of oil and gas, we are not energy producers. Therefore, we have focused on solar power, wind power, nuclear, and hydropower to secure our future. We are determined to build a sustainable energy path forward," he said.</p>

<p>RE-INVEST 2024 is being organised by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar, Gujarat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PM emphasised the government's initiatives towards green energy in the first 100 days of the third term. "In the past 100 days, we've made significant decisions to support green energy. We have launched the Offshore Green Energy Policy under the Vibrant Gas Funding Scheme, where we plan to spend over Rs 7,000 crore. India is also working on generating 31,000 megawatts of hydropower, for which we will spend more than Rs 12,000 crore," he said.</p>

<p>The PM also highlighted the efforts towards achieving the target of installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in India by 2030. "Among the G20 nations, we are leading. The country that could not be seen as a developed nation before will now set an example for the world as a developing one," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>INDIA'S RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS</strong></h2>

<p>At the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in 2021, PM Modi had outlined a climate action plan for the country. This included meeting 50 per cent of the country's energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030, reaching 500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2070.</p>

<p>Since then, India has achieved substantial progress in installing renewable energy capacity, securing the fourth position globally in 2022, according to the Climate Action Tracker.</p>

<p>As part of its climate efforts, India conceived the International Solar Alliance (ISA) jointly with France. It was conceptualised on the sidelines of the COP21 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris in 2015. It is a treaty-based intergovernmental organisation which has 99 member countries and 119 countries are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ISA, headquartered in India, aims at increased use of solar energy technologies for better energy access, ensuring energy security and enabling energy transition in member countries. It seeks to mobilise $1,000 billion of investment by 2030 for deployment of solar energy.</p>

<p>India's installed solar energy capacity has increased by 30 times in the last 9 years and stands at 89.4 GW as of August 2024, as per government data. Similarly, the installed capacity of wind power stood at 47.19 GW, small hydro power capacity was 5.07 GW and large hydro power capacity stood at 46.92 GW, official data showed.</p>

<p>Notably, India is the only G20 nation to have achieved - before the deadline - climate goals committed at the Paris climate change conference in 2015.</p>

<p>In 2022, India updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or climate goals, according to which the target to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP had been enhanced to 45 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The initiative comes as Russia's fertility rate, currently at about 1.5 children per woman, falls significantly below the 2.1 rate required to maintain a stable population.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly encouraged Russians to engage in intimate relations during lunch and coffee breaks at work to address the country's declining birth rate. The initiative comes as Russia's fertility rate, currently at about 1.5 children per woman, falls significantly below the 2.1 rate required to maintain a stable population, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/15/vladimir-putin-demands-russians-sex-work-fall-birth-rate-21608541/" rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro</a></em> reported. Additionally, over a million, primarily younger Russians, have left the country amid the ongoing war with Ukraine</p>

<p>Health Minister Dr Yevgeny Shestopalov emphasised that being too busy at work is not a valid excuse for avoiding procreation. He suggested that people could take advantage of breaks to focus on expanding their families, noting that ''life flies by too quickly.''</p>

<p>When a reporter asked him how people working 12 to 14 hours a day would find time to have children, he responded by suggesting they could use their break times.</p>

<p>Previously, Putin has insisted, ''The preservation of the Russian people is our highest national priority. The fate of Russia....depends on how many of us there will be. It is a question of national importance.''</p>

<p>Notably, Russia's birth rate has hit its lowest point since 1999, with the number of live births in June falling below 100,000. This drastic drop has raised concerns in Moscow about a severe population decline. According to Rosstat, Russia's governmental statistics agency, the country has seen a significant decrease in births, with 16,000 fewer children born between January and June 2024 compared to the same period last year, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/10/russias-birth-rate-drops-to-its-lowest-in-a-quarter-century-data-shows"><em>Euro News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This decline is further exacerbated by an 18% increase in population decline, with 49,000 more deaths recorded in 2024 than the previous year, likely due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Kremlin's efforts to boost Russia's declining birth rate have led to a series of measures, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free fertility checks: Women in Moscow, aged 18-40, are encouraged to undergo free fertility assessments to evaluate their "reproductive potential".</li>
	<li>Employer coercion: MP Tatyana Butskaya has proposed a plan to pressure employers into encouraging their female employees to have children.</li>
	<li>Incentives:&nbsp;Chelyabinsk region is offering&nbsp;8,500 pounds&nbsp;to female students under 24 for their first child's birth</li>
	<li>Restricting abortion: Access to abortion across the country is being blocked as public figures and churchmen claim women's duty is to give birth and raise children.</li>
	<li>Divorce fees:&nbsp;Fees for divorce have been increased to discourage separation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Politician Anna Kuznetsova has also demanded women start giving birth at a young age. She said: ''You should start giving birth at 19-20 years old. Then, statistically, the family will be able to have three, four, or more children.''</p>

<p>However, critics argue these policies undermine individual autonomy, particularly for women, and may have unintended consequences on Russia's social fabric.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Necrotising fasciitis is a rare and life-threatening infection that can happen if a wound gets infected and it needs to be treated in a hospital straight away.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigel Hunt, a 59-year-old British man from the Isles of Scilly, narrowly escaped death after a seemingly minor spider bite that turned into a life-threatening ordeal. While lying in bed at home on August 30, Mr Hunt was bitten by a potentially deadly spider on his stomach. Initially, he felt no pain and thought nothing of it. However, just four days later, on his way to a holiday in Sharm El-Sheikh,&nbsp;Egypt, he became severely ill,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zly12zk0o" rel="nofollow, noindex">BBC</a></em> reported. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors operated on his stomach after suspecting an abscess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, further diagnosis revealed something far more serious- necrotising fasciitis, a rare and deadly condition known as "flesh-eating disease." He then underwent an emergency surgery, that saved his life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of the ordeal, he recounted, ''On arriving at the airport and&nbsp;travelling through check-in we made our way to departures. At this point, everything seemed to deteriorate quite quickly from being sick in the departure lounge to having my head in a sick bag for most of the journey. On arrival at Sharm El Sheikh, we collected our belongings and made our way to the pharmacy for some antibiotics or something to help with the sickness. They prescribed a couple of things and the following day we went to the hospital to be prescribed the same medication.''</p>

<p>''The&nbsp;next two days started to get worse so we went to a different hospital in Hadaba where straight away I had blood tests and ultrasound scans. Then we waited a couple of hours for the doctor to check the results. He called us in saying it was a good job we had come in because the bite was from either a false widow or a brown recluse spider,'' he added.</p>

<p>According to the&nbsp;<em><a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a></em>&nbsp;website, necrotising fasciitis is a rare and life-threatening infection that can happen if a wound gets infected and it needs to be treated in a hospital straight away.</p>

<p>Mr&nbsp;Hunt credits his second hospital visit with saving his life. He recalls, "If I hadn't gone back to the hospital for a second examination within that critical 6-10 day window, I wouldn't be alive today."</p>

<p>Although he's on the road to recovery, Mr Hunt still faces a long journey ahead. His wound remains open, requiring regular dressing changes every few days.</p>

<p>He has also issued a stark warning to his fellow residents on the Isles of Scilly. "I feel it's essential to alert everyone to be cautious and check for spiders," he emphasised.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man from Telangana, who went to Canada to pursue his Masters, drowned while swimming with his friends in a lake in Toronto. The victim, Praneeth, was from Telangana's Meerpet and went to celebrate his birthday.</p>

<p>The student died on his birthday and the family has been informed. The man's father has requested the government to bring his son's body back to India as early as possible.&nbsp;The victim had moved to Canada in 2019 for studies while his elder brother in 2022.</p>

<p>A video showed Praneeth jumping into the lake. In another video, the man recorded a selfie with his friends on a motorboat in the lake.</p>

<p>"Both along with other friends visited the lake to celebrate the birthday of Praneeth on Saturday. On Sunday, they went swimming. While everyone returned, the younger one ( Praneeth) did not," the grieving father told reporters.</p>

<p>More details are awaited.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The researchers had instructed the LLM to try to persuade people to reconsider their beliefs. To their surprise, it was actually pretty effective.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists surprised themselves when they found they could instruct a version of ChatGPT to gently dissuade people of their beliefs in conspiracy theories - such as notions that Covid-19 was a deliberate attempt at population control or that 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

<p>The most important revelation wasn't about the power of AI, but about the workings of the human mind. The experiment punctured the popular myth that we're in a post-truth era where evidence no longer matters, and it flew in the face of a prevailing view in psychology that people cling to conspiracy theories for emotional reasons and that no amount of evidence can ever disabuse them.</p>

<p>"It's really the most uplifting research I've ever I done," said psychologist Gordon Pennycook of Cornell University and one of the authors of the study. Study subjects were surprisingly amenable to evidence when it was presented the right way.</p>

<p>The researchers asked more than 2,000 volunteers to interact with a chatbot - GPT-4 Turbo, a large-language model - about beliefs that might be considered conspiracy theories. The subjects typed their belief into a box and the LLM would decide if it fit the researchers' definition of a conspiracy theory. It asked participants to rate how sure they were of their beliefs on a scale of 0% to 100%. Then it asked the volunteers for their evidence.</p>

<p>The researchers had instructed the LLM to try to persuade people to reconsider their beliefs. To their surprise, it was actually pretty effective.</p>

<p>People's faith in false conspiracy theories dropped 20%, on average. About a quarter of the volunteers dropped their belief level from above to below 50%. "I really didn't think it was going to work, because I really bought into the idea that, once you're down the rabbit hole, there's no getting out," said Pennycook.</p>

<p>The LLM had some advantages over a human interlocutor. People who have strong beliefs in conspiracy theories tend to gather mountains of evidence - not quality evidence, but quantity. It's hard for most non-believers to muster the motivation to do the tiresome work of keeping up. But AI can match believers with instant mountains of counter-evidence and can point out logical flaws in believers' claims. It can react in real time to counterpoints the user might bring up.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, has been studying the power of AI to sow misinformation and even false memories. She was impressed with this study and the magnitude of the results. She considered that one reason it worked so well is that it's showing the subjects how much information they didn't know, and thereby reducing their overconfidence in their own knowledge. People who believe in conspiracy theories typically have a high regard for their own intelligence - and a lower regard for others' judgment.</p>

<p>After the experiment, the researchers reported, some of the volunteers said it was the first time anyone, or anything, had really understood their beliefs and offered effective counter-evidence.</p>

<p>Before the findings were published this week in<em> Science,</em> the researchers made their version of the chatbot available to journalists to try out. I prompted it with beliefs I've heard from friends: that the government was covering up the existence of alien life, and that after the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, the mainstream press deliberately avoided saying he had been shot because reporters worried that it would help his campaign. And then, inspired by Trump's debate comments, I asked the LLM if immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating cats and dogs.</p>

<p>When I posed the UFO claim, I used the military pilot sightings and a National Geographic channel special as my evidence, and the chatbot pointed out some alternate explanations and showed why those were more probable than alien craft. It discussed the physical difficulty of traveling the vast space needed to get to Earth, and questioned whether it's likely aliens could be advanced enough to figure this out yet clumsy enough to be discovered by the government.</p>

<p>On the question of journalists hiding Trump's shooting, the AI explained that making guesses and stating them as facts is antithetical to a reporter's job. If there's a series of pops in a crowd, and it's not yet clear what's happening, that's what they're obligated to report - a series of pops. As for the Ohio pet-eating, the AI did a nice job of explaining that even if there were a single case of someone eating a pet, it wouldn't demonstrate a pattern.</p>

<p>That's not to say that lies, rumors and deception aren't important tactics humans use to gain popularity and political advantage. Searching through social media after the recent presidential debate, many people believed the cat-eating rumor, and what they posted as evidence amounted to repetitions of the same rumor. To gossip is human.</p>

<p>But now we know they might be dissuaded with logic and evidence.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 58-year-old man detained in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump has said in an interview in 2023 that he planned to recruit potential Afghan soldiers through Pakistan to fight in Ukraine against Russia.</p>

<p>Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack the Republican presidential nominee as he played a round of golf, made these remarks to The New York Times.</p>

<p>During an interview with a newspaper in 2023, Routh also said he was seeking recruits for Ukraine from among Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban. He said he planned to move them, in some cases illegally, from Pakistan and Iran to Ukraine. He said dozens had expressed interest.</p>

<p>"We can probably purchase some passports through Pakistan since it's such a corrupt country," he was quoted as saying by the New York Times.</p>

<p>He has shown pro-Ukraine views into his public statements because of which he was interviewed by several news organisations, including The New York Times and Semafor in 2023.</p>

<p>Routh is a self-employed affordable housing builder in Hawaii who at times has criticised the former president.</p>

<p>This was the second attempt on Trump's life in two months. In July, a life-threatening attack on 78-year-old Trump during his rally in Pennsylvania shocked the entire nation. He injured his right ear after the young shooter fired multiple shots at him at the campaign rally.</p>

<p>During Sunday's attack, Trump was on the course, a few hundred yards away, when Secret Service personnel spotted Routh concealed in the bushes and opened fire, law enforcement officials were quoted as saying by the New York Times.</p>

<p>He fled the scene in a vehicle and was taken into custody during a traffic stop, and a rifle with a scope was recovered from the bushes, along with a camera and two backpacks, the report added.</p>

<p>Routh, who authorities suspect was planning to attack the former president as he played a round of golf, posted comments on an X account linked to him referencing the assassination attempt on Trump in July, CNN reported.</p>

<p>In separate posts, Routh tagged President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, encouraging them to visit those injured at the rally.</p>

<p>"You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them," he wrote in a post directed at Harris.</p>

<p>Routh, who has a lengthy criminal record from North Carolina, frequently posted about politics and exclusively donated to Democratic candidates and causes dating back to 2019, the New York Post reported.</p>

<p>He also bashed Trump in an April 22 post on X in which he declared, "DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose." He advised Biden, 81, in an April 22 X post when he was still running for reelection, to run a campaign around keeping "America democratic and free." He claimed Trump wants to "make Americans slaves against master." Meanwhile, Oran Routh, the son of the man accused of trying to assassinate Trump, has said his father had travelled to Ukraine and volunteered to provide what the son described as "humanitarian" aid to troops defending the country from Russian forces that invaded in 2022, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>Oran said that his father was passionate about the Ukraine cause &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Rosie, the world's oldest cat, is dead. Her owner Lila Brisset recently bid farewell to Rosie, the fluffy tortoiseshell cat believed to be the oldest in the world. The cat died at the age of 33 in her owner's home in Norwich UK, according to a report in the New York Post.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rosie was born in 1991 and held the unofficial title of "world's oldest cat" as the current holder is Flossie, a 28-year-old cat from Kent. In June, Rosie turned 33 and died at the equivalent age of 152 in human years.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Lila, who had adopted Rosie when she was a kitten, said, "I miss her so much. She wasn't very well and one day she just walked into the hallway of the house, laid down and passed away. There were lots of good memories though and I'm happy we had our time together."</p>

<p dir="ltr">After giving up the outside life, Rosie slept near the window during the later years of her life. The cat was supposed to go to a different family but the family realised that their daughter was allergic. Enter Lila, a widow who had previously rescued a stray dog and another cat.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the New York Post, Lila had previously shared, "She's quite a character. Rosie sleeps by the window all day and, like clockwork, she will have some food and use the litter tray."</p>

<p dir="ltr">She continued, "There's no need for an alarm clock. All she does is eat, sleep, use the litter tray and repeat. I often have to check if she's still alive and breathing. I'm worried about the day she crosses over the rainbow bridge. She'll leave a big void. I'll miss her when she goes. But I'll never have her put down."</p>

<p dir="ltr">As of now, Creme Puff of Austin, Texas holds the record for being the oldest cat that ever lived. Born on August 3, 1967, she survived until August 6, 2005, for 38 years and 3 days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since acquiring Twitter, rebranded as X in 2022, Elon Musk has continuously used the platform to air his views, often sparking controversy in the process.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since acquiring Twitter, rebranded as X in 2022, Elon Musk has continuously used the platform to air his views, often sparking controversy in the process. The billionaire, known for his contributions to space exploration, electric vehicles, and cryptocurrency, has also cultivated a reputation for sharing inflammatory and provocative statements. Here are five of his most controversial posts on X, ranging from comments on political figures to conspiracy theories.</p>

<p><strong>1. Musk Questions Lack of Assassination Attempts on Biden and Harris</strong></p>

<p>Musk reacted to an alleged assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump by questioning why no one seemed to be targeting President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris. Following reports that Secret Service agents had foiled an attack on Trump at his Florida golf course, Musk responded to a post asking, "Why do they want to kill Donald Trump?" with the disturbing retort, "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala."</p>

<p>This post ignited a firestorm of criticism for its reckless tone and dangerous implications.&nbsp;Elon Musk later tried damage control in another post: "Well, one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X."</p>

<p><strong>2. Promoting An Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory</strong></p>

<p>In November 2023, Musk found himself embroiled in controversy after endorsing a post that invoked the widely discredited "Great Replacement" theory. The theory claims that Jewish people and other minorities are orchestrating the "replacement" of white populations through immigration, leading to so-called "white genocide."</p>

<p>Musk's response, calling the user's statement "the actual truth," was widely condemned. Though he later admitted that his endorsement was "foolish," the damage was done.</p>

<p><strong>3. Adding Fuel To The 'Pizzagate' Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>The "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory, a false narrative claiming prominent Democrats ran a child trafficking ring out of a Washington, DC pizza restaurant, resurfaced on Musk's feed in late November 2023.</p>

<p>On November 28, Musk posted a meme referencing the debunked theory, complete with superimposed dialogue from The Office TV show. "Does seem at least a little suspicious," Musk wrote in the now-deleted post.</p>

<p><strong>4. Backing Questionable War Accounts</strong></p>

<p>After the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out in Gaza in October 2023, Musk landed in a spot after recommending two X accounts for real-time coverage of the war. Both accounts had previously been criticised for sharing misinformation, including an AI-generated image of an explosion at the Pentagon. One had also posted numerous antisemitic comments in recent months.</p>

<p>While Musk deleted the post after backlash, the incident added to concerns about his role in enabling misinformation to spread unchecked on X.</p>

<p><strong>5. A Jab at Taylor Swift</strong></p>

<p>When pop superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, Musk was quick to react. Swift, signing off her post with the tongue-in-cheek "childless cat lady," provoked a sarcastic reply from Musk: "Fine Taylor... you win... I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life."</p>

<p>This bizarre response, followed by Musk agreeing with a user who said Swift's endorsement aligned with demographic trends of unmarried women supporting Democrats, was viewed as inappropriate and out-of-line. While some found humour in the exchange, many Swift fans and political commentators condemned Musk's comments as tasteless and condescending.</p>

<p>Musk's daughter Vivian Wilson called him out publicly on X. "The timing for the Taylor Swift endorsement of Kamala Harris honestly could not have been better. Can't wait to see the Swifties at the polls! Vote blue," the 20-year-old wrote on Instagram's Threads, in support of the pop star.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Monday to discuss tackling illegal immigration, a day after another Channel migrant shipwreck claimed eight lives.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Monday to discuss tackling illegal immigration, a day after another Channel migrant shipwreck claimed eight lives.</p>

<p>Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party was elected with a crushing parliamentary majority in July, has vowed to fight illegal immigration, a hot-button topic in British politics for years.</p>

<p>Far-right riots shook cities and towns across England and Northern Ireland shortly after Starmer's election, the UK's worst unrest since 2011, with mosques and migrant accommodation centres often targeted.</p>

<p>The perilous cross-Channel journeys migrants attempt from northern France have posed a fiendishly difficult problem to solve for successive British prime ministers.</p>

<p>Eight migrants died on Sunday after their overcrowded boat capsized in the Channel, bringing to 46 the number of people who have lost their lives this year trying to reach British shores.</p>

<p>Around 800 people crossed the Channel on Saturday, the second-highest figure since the start of the year, according to the UK interior ministry.</p>

<p>Starmer has rejected the previous Conservative government's plan to expel all illegal migrants to Rwanda while their asylum claims are examined.</p>

<p>Instead, UK media say he is interested in the strategy of Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party and whose country is on the front line of the European Union's migration crisis.</p>

<p>In November last year, Italy signed an agreement with Albania to open two centres in the Balkan country where migrants would be sheltered while their asylum claims are processed.</p>

<p>Italy will fund and manage the centres, which will be capable of accommodating up to 3,000 migrants who have arrived on Italian shores by boat.</p>

<p>Migrants with rejected asylum claims would be sent back to their country of origin, whereas those with accepted applications will be granted entry to Italy.</p>

<p>That is a key difference from the former UK government's Rwanda scheme, whereby migrants sent to the East African nation could never have settled in Britain irrespective of the outcome of their claim.</p>

<h3><strong>Italy migrant numbers fall&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It's in early days, I'm interested in how that works, I think everybody else is," Starmer said of the Italian scheme in comments carried by British media.</p>

<p>Starmer said he and Meloni "have already discussed how we can improve joint operations, so that is something we will discuss".</p>

<p>Their meeting is scheduled for midday (1000 GMT), according to Meloni's office.</p>

<p>The newly appointed chief of the UK's new Border Security Command, Martin Hewitt, will accompany Starmer during his trip to Italy, his office said.</p>

<p>Meloni's government has also inked a deal with Tunisia granting aid in exchange for greater efforts to stop Italy-bound migrants who leave the North African country and cross the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>According to the Italian Interior Ministry, migrant arrivals by sea have dropped markedly since the start of the year.</p>

<p>Between January 1 and September 13, 44,675 people arrived in Italy compared to a figure of 125,806 for the same period in 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[AI tools on classroom tablets and computers will act as "virtual assistants that can make learning easier for students and help teachers identify methods for an increasingly bespoke education"]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy is introducing artificial intelligence in its schools as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government explores new ways to close the country's digital skills gap with other European Union members.</p>

<p>Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara said this week - when schools reopened across Italy - that AI-assisted software would be tested in 15 classrooms across four regions, with a view to expand the scheme later if the experiment is successful.</p>

<p>AI tools on classroom tablets and computers will act as "virtual assistants that can make learning easier for students and help teachers identify methods for an increasingly bespoke education," the minister told the TGcom24 news channel.</p>

<p>Italy has one of the worst basic digital skills scores in the 27-member EU, according to the bloc's statistical agency Eurostat, faring better only than Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

<p>Few details were given about the initiative, however. Valditara's office was not able to confirm the names of the schools that would test the new technology and expand on its workings.</p>

<p>However, the planned evaluation of the trial starting with this school year is "promising", Francesca Bastagli, head of research at the Fondazione Agnelli educational think tank, told Reuters on Friday.</p>

<p>"It will hopefully tell us what works and what is needed for future rollouts of AI tools in schools to be inclusive and effective", she said.</p>

<p>Italy's AI-push for schools came as the minister also issued a blanket ban on the use of mobile phones in classrooms, even for educational purposes.</p>

<p>Past attempts to digitalise Italian schools have proven difficult, including during the COVID pandemic, partly due to the advanced age of teaching staff, with more than half of them aged 50 or older, according to OECD data.</p>

<p>Meloni has made AI one of the themes of this year's G7 summit, which was hosted by Italy. In their final communique, leaders said they would deepen their "cooperation to harness the benefits and manage the risks of (AI)".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been in the limelight ever since they closed the door on royal life in 2020.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been in the limelight ever since they closed the door on royal life in 2020. As the couple celebrated Harry's 40th birthday over the weekend, it has now been alleged that the Duchess of Sussex terrifies her staff, with a person calling her a “dictator in high heels”. "Everyone's terrified of Meghan... She belittles people, she doesn't take advice” a source close to the couple told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hollywood-keeps-quitting-prince-harry-meghan-markle-1235996963/">The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">The person stated that both Harry and Markle are "poor decision-makers" as they change their minds frequently.&nbsp;"Harry is a very, very charming person - no airs at all - but he's very much an enabler. And she's just terrible," the source added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another insider told the media outlet that Markle "marches around like a dictator in high heels," adding that she has reduced grown men to tears.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“She's absolutely relentless... She marches around like a dictator in high heels, fuming and barking orders. I've watched her reduce grown men to tears," the person added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the years, the couple have witnessed high staff turnover, with Markle's top aide and private secretary departing in 2021. Last month, their chief of staff left the job in just three months.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Josh Kettler, the Santa Barbara-based consultant, resigned in August after just three months on the job. Before Kettler, Toya Holness was their global press secretary until 2022.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, this is not the first time when Markle has been criticised for her behaviour toward their employees.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Buckingham Palace had in 2018 investigated her for her treatment of two royal aides, which was earlier labeled as "bullying behaviour". While no findings was made public, she called the claims a "calculated smear campaign".&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile that struck near Israel's Tel Aviv, a bustling commercial hub on Sunday. Rebel Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi claimed responsibility for the missile, describing it as a "ballistic missile" that penetrated Israel's sophisticated air defence systems. While there were no casualties, the attack added to the already fragile regional tensions, particularly as the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas' attack on October 7, neared its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to respond, warning that the Iran-backed Houthi rebels would "pay a heavy price" for the strike. While the missile caused only minor damage - shattering glass at a train station and injuring several civilians on their way to shelters - the symbolic nature of the attack cannot be understated. It is the latest escalation involving the Houthis, who have increasingly been drawn into the Gaza conflict as part of a broader network of militias collectively known as Iran's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis of Resistance</a>.</p>

<p>The attack prompted questions about how a militia in war-torn Yemen has managed to acquire the capability to launch such long-range missile strikes.</p>

<h2><strong>Origins Of The Houthis' Missile Capabilities</strong></h2>

<p>The Houthis' ability to acquire and launch ballistic missiles lies in historical weapons caches, Iranian support, and arms trafficking. The group, officially known as Ansar Allah, evolved from a grassroots religious movement in the 1990s to a powerful militia with sophisticated weapons. Since the Yemeni civil war broke out in 2015, the Houthis have relied on three primary sources to build their missile arsenal:</p>

<h3><strong>Yemeni Government Missiles&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>During the Cold War, Yemen was divided into North and South, with each side receiving military aid from competing superpowers. The Yemeni government first began acquiring Scud missiles from the Soviet Union in the 1970s. Over the years, various ballistic and surface-to-air missiles found their way into Yemen's military stockpiles, including those from North Korea and Iran, and, ironically, Saudi Arabia and the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>The 1994 Yemeni civil war saw the use of these ballistic missiles, and by the time the Houthis began to rise in prominence in the 2000s, they had ample access to outdated but still functioning missile systems. Between 2004 and 2010, the Houthis repeatedly looted government armouries, gaining access to missiles and other heavy weaponry. However, it wasn't until 2015, when they allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, that their missile capabilities expanded significantly.</p>

<h3><strong>Arms Supply And Tactical Training By Iran&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Since the outset of the Yemeni civil war, the Houthis have relied heavily on Iranian support, which includes everything from missile components to training in assembly and launch techniques. Although Iran has never openly acknowledged their support, US and coalition forces have intercepted Iranian missile shipments en route to Yemen multiple times.</p>

<p>According to the book 'The Missile War in Yemen' by Ian Williams and Shaan Shaikh, debris from missile strikes has been found with Farsi inscriptions and Iranian manufacturing labels. Iran's provision of missiles like the Burkan series, the Quds-1 cruise missile, and the Sayyad-2C surface-to-air missile has augmented the Houthis' long-range strike capability.</p>

<p>One of Iran's most strategic advantages is its ability to smuggle missile components into Yemen using clandestine routes. These routes include overland passages through Oman, covert shipments via the Arabian Sea, and even smuggling through unregulated ports along Yemen's Red Sea coast. In many cases, the missiles arrive in parts and are assembled in Houthi-controlled territory with Iranian help.</p>

<h3><strong>Spoils Of War</strong></h3>

<p>The Saudi-led coalition, formed to support Yemen's internationally recognized government, has inadvertently supplied the Houthis with weapons through accidents and losses in battle. Houthi forces have seized rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, and other equipment from Saudi forces or their allies.</p>

<p>In 2015, a Saudi coalition air-drop mishap resulted in the Houthis capturing a shipment of RPG-26 variants. The rebels wasted no time in showcasing their spoils, with a Houthi leader holding a thank-you note addressed to Saudi King Salman. While these captures have occasionally included advanced missile systems, they remain the least significant source compared to Iranian aid and Yemeni stockpiles.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Houthis have demonstrated an evolving capability in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Drones have become a key part of their arsenal, and Iran's influence is again apparent. The Houthis' Sammad drone series, used in one-way "suicide" missions, bears a resemblance to Iranian drone models like the Sayad.</p>

<h3><strong>The Houthi-Iran Alliance: Why Iran Supports The Houthis</strong></h3>

<p>The Houthis are part of a growing network of Iranian-backed militias and political factions, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and various Shiite militias in Iraq. For Tehran, the Houthis represent a low-cost, high-impact proxy force capable of destabilising the Arabian Peninsula and projecting Iranian power into the Red Sea, a key global trade route.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/rvf574t_iran-houthi-_625x300_16_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Defense Intelligence Agency </span></p>
</div>

<p>The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, is one of the world's most important maritime chokepoints. By supporting the Houthis, Iran gains influence over this vital corridor, potentially disrupting global oil and trade flows. This makes the Houthis an important part of Iran's strategy, which aims to challenge US and Saudi dominance in the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of people in Japan aged 65 or older hit a record high of 36.25 million this year, government data shows, as the country contends with one of the world's fastest-ageing societies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elderly now account for 29.3 per cent of Japan's total population, also a new high, according to data released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications on Sunday.</p>

<p>The ministry said the proportion of elderly residents put Japan at the top of the list of 200 countries and regions with a population of over 100,000.</p>

<p>Italy, Portugal, Greece, Finland, Germany and Croatia represented Europe in the top 10, with rates of over 20 per cent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Korea stood at 19.3 per cent and China at 14.7 per cent.</p>

<p>Japan is facing a steadily worsening population crisis, as its expanding elderly population leads to soaring medical and welfare costs, with a shrinking labour force to pay for it.</p>

<p>The country's overall population shrank by 595,000 to 124 million, according to previous government data.</p>

<p>Sunday's data showed that 9.14 million elderly people were employed in 2023, also a record.</p>

<p>They represent 13.5 per cent of the total workforce -- or one employee in seven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Japanese government has attempted to slow the decline and ageing of its population without meaningful success.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The strongest storm to hit Shanghai in over 70 years made landfall on Monday, with flights cancelled and highways closed as Typhoon Bebinca lashed the city with strong winds and torrential rains.</p>

<p>A red alert is in place, and some coastal residents have been evacuated, city authorities said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The typhoon landed early Monday morning in the coastal area of Lingang New City, in Pudong to the city's east, the China Meteorological Administration said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the strongest storm to hit Shanghai since Typhoon Gloria in 1949, state broadcaster CCTV said shortly after Bebinca made landfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many businesses were already closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival public holiday, and the city's 25 million residents have been advised to avoid leaving their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All flights at Shanghai's two main airports are grounded, and ferry services and some trains have been suspended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highways were closed at 1:00 am local time (1700 GMT), and a 40-kilometre (25-mile) per-hour speed limit is in place on roads inside the city.</p>

<p>At rush hour, live video feeds showed Shanghai's normally jammed roads almost empty of traffic, and its famed skyline obscured by thick fog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nine thousand residents have been evacuated from Chongming District, an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River, authorities said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Footage from northern Baoshan District showed ferocious winds ripping through a line of trees on the riverbank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shanghai's flood control headquarters told CCTV they had already received dozens of reports of incidents related to the typhoon, mostly fallen trees and billboards.</p>

<p>CCTV broadcast footage of a reporter by the coast in neighbouring Zhejiang province, where waves pounded the craggy coastline under leaden skies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If I step out into (the storm), I can barely speak," the reporter said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can see that the surface of the sea is just wave after wave, each higher than the last."</p>

<p>Another typhoon, Yagi, killed at least four people and injured 95 when it passed through China's southern Hainan island this month, according to national weather authorities.</p>

<p>Bebinca has also passed through Japan and the central and southern Philippines, where falling trees killed six people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCTV said Bebinca was expected to move northwest, causing heavy rain and high winds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are driving climate change and making extreme weather more frequent and intense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms will begin training its AI models using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram in the UK over the coming months, the company said, after it had paused the training in the region following a regulatory backlash.</p>

<p>The company will use public posts including photos, captions and comments to train its generative artificial intelligence models, it said on Friday, adding that the training content will not include private messages or information from accounts of users under the age of 18.</p>

<p>The update follows Meta's decision in mid-June to pause the launch of its AI models in Europe after the Irish privacy regulator told the company to delay its plan to harness data from social media posts.</p>

<p>The company had then said the delay would also allow it to address requests from Britain's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p>

<p>"Since we paused training our generative AI models in the UK to address regulatory feedback, we've engaged positively with the ICO ... this clarity and certainty will help us bring AI at Meta products to the UK much sooner," Meta said on Friday.</p>

<p>Facebook and Instagram users in the UK will start receiving in-app notifications from next week explaining the company's procedure and how users can object to their data being used for the training, Meta added.</p>

<p>Meta has made changes to its approach since it paused the plans in June, the ICO said in a statement, adding the company has simplified the way users can object to the processing of their data and has extended the window in which they can do so.</p>

<p>In June, Meta's plans faced backlash from advocacy group NOYB, which urged national privacy watchdogs across Europe to stop such use of social media content, saying the notifications were insufficient to meet EU's stringent privacy and transparency rules.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title"><span style="font-size: 13px;">The rings of Saturn are some of the most famous and spectacular objects in the Solar System. Earth may once have had something similar.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118991">a paper published last week</a> in Earth &amp; Planetary Science Letters, my colleagues and I present evidence that Earth may have had a ring.</p>

<p>The existence of such a ring, forming around 466 million years ago and persisting for a few tens of millions of years, could explain several puzzles in our planet's past.</p>

<h3><strong>The case for a ringed Earth</strong></h3>

<p>So it's extremely unlikely that all 21 craters from this period would form close to the equator if they were unrelated to one another. We would expect to see many other craters at higher latitudes as well.</p>

<p>We think the best explanation for all this evidence is that a large asteroid broke up during a close encounter with Earth. Over several tens of millions of years, the asteroid's debris rained down onto Earth, creating the pattern of craters, sediments and tsunamis we describe above.</p>

<h3><strong>How rings form</strong></h3>

<p>You may know that Saturn isn't the only planet with rings. Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus have less obvious rings, too. Some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2742">scientists have even suggested</a> that Phobos and Deimos, the small moons of Mars, may be remnants of an ancient ring.</p>

<p>So we know a lot about how rings form. Here's how it works.</p>
</div>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Saturn backlit by the Sun, taken by the Cassini spacecraft.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Cassini Imaging Team / SSI / JPL / ESA / NASA</span></span></figcaption>

<p>When a small body (like an asteroid) passes close to a large body (like a planet), it gets stretched by gravity. If it gets close enough (inside a distance called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">Roche limit</a>), the small body will break apart into lots of tiny pieces and a small number of bigger pieces.</p>

<p>All those fragments will be jostled around and gradually evolve into a debris ring orbiting the equator of the larger body. Over time, the material in the ring will fall down to the larger body, where the larger pieces will form impact craters. These craters will be located close to the equator.</p>

<p>So if Earth destroyed and captured a passing asteroid around 466 million years ago, it would explain the anomalous locations of the impact craters, the meteorite debris in sedimentary rocks, craters and tsunamis, and the meteorites' relatively brief exposure to space radiation.</p>

<h3><strong>A giant sunshade?</strong></h3>

<p>Back then, the continents were in different positions due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA8r3FVw46c">continental drift</a>. Much of North America, Europe and Australia were close to the equator, whereas Africa and South America were at higher southern latitudes.</p>

<p>The ring would have been around the equator. And since Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbit around the Sun, the ring would have shaded parts of Earth's surface.</p>

<p>This shading in turn might have caused global cooling, as less sunlight reached the planet's surface.</p>

<p>This brings us to another interesting puzzle. Around 465 million years ago, our planet began cooling dramatically. By 445 million years ago it was in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirnantian">Hirnantian Ice Age</a>, the coldest period in the past half a billion years.</p>

<p>Was a ring-shading Earth responsible for this extreme cooling? The next step in our scientific sleuthing is to make mathematical models of how asteroids break up and disperse, and how the resulting ring evolves over time. This will set the scene for climate modelling that explores how much cooling could be imposed by such a ring.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

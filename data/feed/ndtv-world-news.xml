       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Islamist-led rebels declared they had taken Damascus in a lightning offensive on Sunday, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria.</p>

<p>A video circulating on social media shows rebels roaming inside the presidential palace in the capital Damascus. They were seen smashing Assad's family portraits in the presidential palace.</p>

<p>Residents in the Syrian capital were seen cheering in the streets, as the rebel factions heralded the departure of "tyrant" Assad, saying: "We declare the city of Damascus free."</p>

<p>AFPTV images from Damascus showed rebels firing into the air at sunrise, with some flashing the victory sign and crying "Allahu akbar", or God is greatest.</p>

<p>Some climbed atop a tank in celebration, while others defaced a toppled statue of Assad's father, Hafez. "I can't believe I'm living this moment," tearful Damascus resident Amer Batha told AFP by phone. "We've been waiting a long time for this day," he said, adding: "We are starting a new history for Syria."</p>

<p>The president's alleged departure, which was also reported by a war monitor, comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group launched its campaign challenging more than five decades of rule by the Assad family.</p>

<p>"After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria," the rebel factions said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali said he was ready to cooperate with "any leadership chosen by the Syrian people".</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years, and told minority groups living in areas they now control not to worry.</p>

<p>Since the offensive began, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed. The United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that "Assad is gone", adding: "His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer."</p>

<p>Assad was for years propped up by Russia and Iran, while Turkey has historically backed the opposition.</p>

<p>Outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had called on Friday for a "political solution to the conflict", in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of homes across the UK were left without power on Saturday and two people were killed after Storm Darragh hit the country with strong winds and caused pre-Christmas travel disruption.</p>

<p>Darragh, the fourth named storm of the season, is also expected to bring heavy rain through the weekend, with the UK's Environment Agency issuing dozens of flood warnings.</p>

<p>Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News on Saturday the storm posed a "challenging situation".</p>

<p>Two men were killed as a result of trees falling on their cars in separate incidents in Lancashire, northwest England, and in the west Midlands.</p>

<p>In Wales, the Met Office estimated gusts of up to 150 kilometres per hour (93 miles per hour), with a "major incident" declared in parts of Wales due to the extensive disruption.</p>

<p>The storm has had "very significant effects in many parts of Wales, including on transport, energy infrastructure and property", the Welsh devolved leader said in a statement, warning that the effects could be "felt for some days yet".</p>

<p>As of Saturday afternoon 177,000 homes in England, Scotland and Wales were without power, according to the Energy Networks Association.</p>

<p>Trains were disrupted or suspended on several routes including from Glasgow to Edinburgh in Scotland, and between Cambridge and Stansted Airport in eastern England. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Rail operator CrossCountry, which operates nationwide, put a "do not travel" notice in place for Saturday due to cancellations and severe delays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Network Rail Wales suspended trains on the Welsh northern coast due to a "fallen tree blocking the line", and several bridges in southern England and Wales were closed for safety reasons.</p>

<p>In Northern Ireland, thousands were left without power, and several bus and train services were suspended or delayed.</p>

<p>Christmas markets and sporting events were postponed, including the Merseyside derby between Premier League leaders Liverpool and Everton.</p>

<p>In Ireland, which issued an "orange" wind warning, 175,000 homes were without electricity as of Saturday evening, according to ESB Networks, which said there was "widespread and extensive damage to electricity infrastructure".</p>

<p>Dublin Airport said "a number of flights scheduled for Saturday morning have been cancelled by airlines" due to the storm.</p>

<p>Darragh comes two weeks after Storm Bert battered much of Britain, causing "devastating" flooding in parts of Wales and knocking out power to thousands of homes in Ireland.</p>

<p>The UK's Met Office had issued a rare red alert for high winds overnight to Saturday morning (0300 to 1100 GMT) covering parts of Wales and southwest England.</p>

<p>A separate amber warning, which is less serious than the red alert but still flags a "potential risk to life and property", covering a larger stretch of the UK and Northern Ireland is in place until Saturday night.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian opposition flag was unfurled at the Syrian embassy in Athens on Sunday, hours after Islamist-led rebels declared they had taken Damascus, ending the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Greek state news agency ANA said at least three men had entered the embassy and unfurled the flag, which was seen hanging from the roof of the building.</p>

<p>Officers were sent to the scene and three men was detained, it added.</p>

<p>The police did not respond to AFP requests for comment.</p>

<p>One man was seen on an embassy balcony clutching a portrait of Assad and shouting "dictator".</p>

<p>Syrians who fled to Greece when the Assad regime was installed in 1970 came to the embassy to celebrate.</p>

<p>"The dictator escaped. It is over... A new dawn rises for Syria," said Maarouf Alobeid, a cardiologist who has lived in Greece for four decades.</p>

<p>"I came running from my home... The thirst of the Syrian people for freedom, for democracy... cannot be described," he said.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four million Syrians didn't sleep all night," said Nader Halbouni, a senior official from the Syrian community in Greece.</p>

<p>A gathering by Syrians in Greece was scheduled for later on Sunday.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Syrians fled to Greece in the 2015 mass migration wave, most of them aiming to reach Germany and other wealthy European Union states. According to the migration ministry, over 15,000 Syrians currently have residence permits in Greece.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old Indian-origin man who was working as a security guard was shot dead by a gang in Canada's Edmonton on Friday.</p>

<p>The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) has arrested two individuals and charged them with first-degree murder of the Indian-origin man, Harshandeep Singh.</p>

<p>The CCTV footage timestamp shows the murder took place on Friday.</p>

<p>According to the police, on Friday night, at around 12:30 am, they responded to a report of a gunshot inside an apartment building. Upon reaching 107 Avenue, they found an unresponsive body in a stairwell and immediately performed first aid. Mr Singh was taken to the hospital where he was declared dead.</p>

<p>CCTV footage doing rounds of the internet shows an individual from the three-member gang pushing Mr Singh down the stairs while the other shoots him from behind.</p>

<p>Evan Rain and Judith Saulteaux, both 30, have been arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Police have recovered a weapon. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday.</p>

<p>“The EPS doesn't typically release the name of a deceased individual unless the death has been confirmed to be a homicide,” EPS Homicide Staff Sgt. Rob Bilawey said in a press release. “However, in this instance, we are releasing his name for an investigative purpose and in an effort to alleviate public safety concerns in relation to Mr Singh's unfortunate death.”</p>

<p>This is the second murder in a week.</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday (December 1), <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-student-fatally-stabbed-in-canada-during-altercation-with-housemate-7191930" target="_blank">Gurasis Singh, 22, a first-year business management student at Lambton College, was stabbed to death</a> in Canada's Ontario by his housemate. The accused, 36-year-old Crossley Hunter, has been charged with second-degree murder.</p>

<p>According to the Sarnia Police Service, on December 1, at 4:59 am, they received a call, reporting a stabbing incident. The investigation revealed that the two men were involved in a physical altercation while in the kitchen. During the argument, Mr Hunter picked a knife and stabbed Mr Singh, multiple times, killing him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[South Korea's leadership crisis deepened on Sunday as the country's main opposition party said that it would try again to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law. Mr Yoon averted impeachment late Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lee Jae-myung, leader of Korea's main opposition Democratic Party (DP), said they will try to impeach the President again on December 14, if he doesn't resign before that. Mr Yoon averted an impeachment attempt late on Saturday. The proposed impeachment motion by Opposition parties needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass. However, a near-total boycott by Mr Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">However, the leader of Mr Yoon's party said the president would effectively be excluded from his duties before eventually stepping down. The leader of the PPP, Han Dong-hoon, told a press conference, alongside Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, on Sunday that Mr Yoon would not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early resignation.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">On Saturday before the vote, 63-year-old Yoon reappeared for the first time in three days and apologised for the "anxiety and inconvenience" caused by his declaration of martial law. But he stopped short of stepping down, saying he would leave it to his party to decide his fate. His party leader said the comments were effectively a promise to leave office early, adding that the ruling party would consult with the prime minister to manage state affairs.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">That proposal, which appeared to win tacit approval from the Yoon-appointed Prime Minister, drew condemnation from opposition lawmakers who said it was another unconstitutional power grab to delegate authority without resignation or impeachment. The main opposition DP called for the immediate suspension of Mr Yoon's presidential duties and for stripping him of authority to control the military. It also called for the arrest of the President and related military officials implicated in the martial law fiasco.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik also said it was unconstitutional to delegate presidential authority to the prime minister and the ruling party without impeachment. Woo proposed a meeting of rival parties to discuss ways to suspend Yoon's presidential power immediately.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Meanwhile, police arrested Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister of South Korea. Mr Kim had resigned after the brief dramatic imposition of martial law in the country earlier this week. The Asian nation's interior minister Lee Sang-min has also resigned. Both they and Mr Yoon are being investigated for alleged insurrection.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Yonhap news agency reported that prosecutors had "booked" President Yoon, a process in South Korea that involves formally naming subjects of investigation. This came after three minority opposition parties filed a complaint with the prosecution against Mr Yoon, ex-Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and martial law commander Park An-su, accusing them of insurrection. The crime of leading an insurrection is punishable by death or life imprisonment, with or without prison labour.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Sunday the cabinet would do its best to "maintain trust with our allies", referring to the United States and Japan. In an effort to reassure the public, multiple military leaders, including the acting defence minister, have stated they would refuse any orders to impose another round of martial law.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Meanwhile, protests continue in South Korea as massive crowds -- police said there were 150,000 people, organisers one million -- gathered outside parliament to pressure lawmakers to oust the president. Many wore elaborate outfits, carrying homemade flags and waving colourful glow sticks and LED candles as K-pop tunes blasted from speakers.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Yoon shocked the nation on Tuesday night when he imposed martial law, giving the military sweeping emergency powers to root out what he called "anti-state forces" and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote unanimously against the decree.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's future hinges on uncertainty after the abrupt fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Once thought unassailable, Assad's rule collapsed under the pressure of a rapid offensive led by a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly known as the Al-Nusra Front affiliated with terror group Al-Qaeda, and allied factions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bashar al-Assad came to power in 2000, succeeding his father, Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria with an iron grip for nearly three decades. Initially, there were hopes that Bashar would bring reform and openness to Syria. However, these aspirations were dashed as he maintained the repressive structure of his father's regime.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-bashar-al-assad-assad-family-damascus-the-al-assads-syrias-first-familys-rapid-rise-brutal-rule-abrupt-end-7198899#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Fall Of Assads: How An Alawite Family Ruled Over A Sunni Nation For Decades</a></p>

<p>Assad's legacy will forever be marred by his response to the protests in 2011, which escalated into a brutal civil war. Over half a million people have been killed, six million became refugees, and countless more are internally displaced. With military backing from Russia and Iran, Assad survived against a fragmented opposition, relying on Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Preoccupied with their own struggles - Russia in Ukraine and Iran facing regional challenges - neither could offer significant support. Within days, the rebels captured key cities like Aleppo, Hama, and Homs, before advancing into Damascus itself.</p>

<h2><strong>A Fragile Transition</strong></h2>

<p>Rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, known now by his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced the formation of a transitional authority. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali has been appointed as the caretaker of state institutions.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-has-left-damascus-as-rebels-advance-towards-capital-news-agency-reuters-7198265#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">"End Of Era Of Tyranny": Bashar Al-Assad Flees Syria As Rebels Move In</a></p>

<p>In a statement, al-Jalali expressed his willingness to cooperate with any leadership chosen by the Syrian people.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts, HTS's history - rooted in al-Qaeda - casts a long shadow over its promises of a diplomatic and nationalist approach. Scepticism abounds regarding its long-term intentions and ability to govern a fractured country.</p>

<p>The end of Assad's rule does not immediately translate to peace for Syrians. HTS's past association with extremist groups raises fears of a harsh, authoritarian rule under the guise of Islamist governance. Millions of displaced Syrians, both within the country and abroad, face an uncertain future as they watch the unfolding events with hope and trepidation.</p>

<h2><strong>The Russian Setback</strong></h2>

<p>The fall of Assad marks a blow to Russian influence in the Middle East. Since its intervention in 2015, Russia has been the regime's most steadfast supporter, maintaining strategic assets such as the Tartous naval facility and the Hmeimim airbase in Latakia. These bases are vital for projecting power across the Mediterranean and into Africa.</p>

<p>However, Russia's military focus is currently consumed by its war in Ukraine. The loss of control in Syria raises questions about Moscow's ability to safeguard its strategic footholds in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Iran Losing The Axis Of Resistance</strong></h2>

<p>For Iran, Assad's downfall disrupts the "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061" target="_blank">Axis of Resistance</a>" that connects Tehran to Hezbollah in Lebanon through Syria. This network has been crucial for transferring weapons and exerting influence in the region. With Hezbollah weakened from its recent conflict with Israel and Iran's proxies in Yemen and Iraq under pressure, Tehran's war strategy will need a different approach.</p>

<p>Iran's preoccupation with Israel, which it views as an existential threat, further limits its capacity to respond effectively in Syria. Israel's recent targeting of Iranian assets has compounded these challenges, leaving Tehran on the defensive.</p>

<h2><strong>Turkey's Role</strong></h2>

<p>Turkey's role in Assad's fall remains ambiguous. While President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had long advocated for a diplomatic resolution to the Syrian conflict, his calls were consistently rebuffed by Assad. Turkey, home to over three million Syrian refugees, has a vested interest in resolving the conflict to facilitate their return.</p>

<p>Ankara has denied direct involvement in the HTS offensive, but analysts suggest that Turkey's tacit approval or indirect support may have played a role. Erdogan's priorities include securing Turkey's borders and countering Kurdish militias in northern Syria.</p>

<h2><strong>Israel's Strategic Thinking</strong></h2>

<p>For Israel, the collapse of Assad's regime represents both opportunity and risk. The fall of Iran's primary ally in Syria disrupts the supply chain to Hezbollah, but the emergence of HTS as a dominant force introduces new uncertainties.</p>

<p>Israel has reinforced its presence along the Golan Heights, preparing for potential spillovers or attempts by rebels to seize Syrian army stockpiles. The Israeli military is also wary of Iran and Hezbollah exploiting the chaos to acquire advanced weaponry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a 13-year-old rebellion overthrew the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, the rebels released prisoners held up for years in government prisons near Damascus, Hama and Aleppo. Among these prisons, the most notorious is Saydnaya, often referred to as a "human slaughterhouse".</p>

<p>According to a 2021 report by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, over 1 lakh people have been executed or have died in prisons of the Syrian regime. Out of them, more than 30,000 were killed in Saydnaya alone. An Amnesty International investigation found that "murder, torture, enforced disappearances and extermination carried out at Saydnaya since 2011 have been perpetrated as part of an attack against the civilian population that has been widespread, as well as systematic, and carried out in furtherance of state policy". The report said violations at Saydnaya "amount to crimes against humanity".</p>

<p><strong>Mass Hangings</strong></p>

<p>The Amnesty report says Saydnaya military prison had two detention centres. A red building housed civilians arrested since the rebellion began in 2011, and a white building accommodated offices and soldiers held for their involvement in the protests.</p>

<p>The report says thousands of inmates in the red building have been killed in secret executions. Describing the chain of events in these executions, the report says, "Before they are hanged, the victims are condemned to death in 'trials' at the Military Field Court located in the al-Qaboun neighbourhood of Damascus, which last between one and three minutes. On the day the prison authorities carry out the hangings, which they refer to as 'the party', they collect the victims from their cells in the afternoon. The listed detainees are told that they will be transferred to a civilian prison. Instead, they are brought to a cell in the basement of the red building, where they are severely beaten over the course of two or three hours. In the middle of the night, they are blindfolded and transferred in delivery trucks or minibuses to the white building. There, they are taken into a room in the basement and hanged.</p>

<p>"This takes place once or twice a week, and on each occasion, between 20 and 50 people are hanged to death. Throughout this process, the victims remain blindfolded. They are only told that they have been sentenced to death minutes before the executions are carried out; they are never told when their execution will be carried out; and they do not know how they will die until the nooses are placed around their necks. After the execution is carried out, the victims' bodies are loaded into a truck, transferred to Tishreen Hospital for registration and buried in mass graves," the report adds.</p>

<p><strong>Orders Came From The Top</strong></p>

<p>The Amnesty report, prepared after speaking to people who worked within the prison and witness testimonies from those detained, estimated that 5,000 and 13,000 people were extrajudicially executed at Saydnaya between September 2011 and December 2015. "Amnesty International does not have evidence of executions after December 2015. However, detainees are still transferred to Saydnaya, "trials" at the Military Field Court in al-Qaboun have continued, and there is no reason to believe that executions have stopped. Therefore, since December 2015, thousands more people are likely to have been executed," the report said.</p>

<p>According to the Amnesty report, the execution process at Saydnaya was secret and known only to the officials directly and high-level Syrian officials. "Even the guards who oversee the collection process and beatings at the red building are usually unaware of what happens to the detainees after they are transferred to the white building in the middle of the night," it said.</p>

<p>Officials at the highest levels of the government authorised these death sentences, the report said. "Death sentences are approved by the Grand Mufti of Syria and by either the Minister of Defence or the Chief of Staff of the Army, who are deputised to act on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad. The sentences are also signed by the head and the Military Prosecutor of the Military Field Court and a representative of the security forces. The hangings are physically overseen by an execution panel, which includes military officers, as well as prison and medical officials," it said.</p>

<p><strong>How Prisoners Were Tortured</strong></p>

<p>The Amnesty report said those detained in the red building at Saydnaya are subjected to an established programme of abuse. "They are regularly tortured, usually through severe beatings and sexual violence. They are denied adequate food, water, medicine, medical care and sanitation, which has led to the rampant spread of infection and disease. Silence is enforced, even during torture sessions. Many detainees develop serious mental illnesses such as psychosis."</p>

<p>The report says that the authorities' treatment of Saydnaya detainees "seems designed to inflict maximal physical and psychological suffering". "Their apparent goal is to humiliate, degrade, dehumanize and to destroy any sense of dignity or hope," it said.</p>

<p>The Amnesty report quoted an inmate, who was a high-school student when he was arrested, "You will struggle to find a former Saydnaya prisoner who will tell you what really happened there, because it is so humiliating."</p>

<p>"The guard would ask everyone to take off all their clothes and go to the bathroom one by one. As we walked to the bathroom, they would select one of the boys, someone petite or young or fair. They would ask him to stand with his face to the door and close his eyes. They would then ask a bigger prisoner to rape him... No one will admit this happened to them, but it happened so often... Sometimes, psychological pain is worse than physical pain, and the people who were forced to do this were never the same again," Omar said, describing his nightmare.</p>

<p>Another detainee told Amnesty, "It was as if you had a nail, and you were trying again and again to beat it into a rock. It was impossible, but they just kept going. I was wishing they would just cut off my legs instead of beating them any more."</p>

<p><strong>Freedom After Decades</strong></p>

<p>Amid the regime change in Syria, rebel fighters have taken control of prisons, including Saydnaya and freed the detainees. A video that has gone viral shows a man reportedly freed from Saydnaya. He appears baffled and struggles to speak as rebels ask him about his family. NDTV cannot verify the authenticity of this video.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/07/syria-grief-mingles-with-joy-as-loved-ones-released-from-assad-prisons">The Guardian</a> has reported about a man's reunion with his older brother who was detained in a Syrian prison for 39 years. Ali Hassan al-Ali, then a university student, was arrested in 1986. His brother Moammar Ali spent three decades visiting different security branches, where he would get conflicting information about his brother. "There was no place in Syria we didn't visit. We went around the whole country asking what happened to him. One day they would admit they had him in prison, the next day they would deny it," said Ali.</p>

<p>Ali Hassan al-Ali entered prison when he was 18. He is now 57. "He has come out of prison as an old man. When he comes home, we will have a big celebration. But until I smell him, until I can say, 'Here he is, my brother,' nothing counts," Ali said.</p>

<p>Fadel Abdulghany, founder of Syrian Network for Human Rights, said that while the release of political prisoners should be celebrated, indiscriminate release of prisoners could carry significant risk.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The five decades of Baath rule in Syria ended on Sunday as Islamist-led rebels declared that they had taken Damascus, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The five decades of Baath rule in Syria ended on Sunday as Islamist-led rebels declared that they had taken Damascus, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing. The lightning offensive left global stakeholders to reckon with the geopolitical impact of Syria's fall on ongoing conflicts including the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

<p>After President Assad's alleged departure, Ukraine said the collapse of Russia's ally Syria in the face of an assault from rebel groups shows Moscow cannot fight on two fronts. "We can see that Russia cannot fight on two fronts -- this is clear from the events in Syria," Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told reporters while reiterating denials that Kyiv was involved in the fighting there.</p>

<p>Tykhyi was responding to a question about accusations from Iran, another ally of Assad, that Ukraine was supporting what Tehran called terrorist groups. "Ukraine categorically and decisively rejects any accusations ... about our supposed involvement in the deteriorating security situation in Syria," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"Russia's significant losses in Ukraine have led Moscow to withdraw the majority of its troops and equipment from Syria, leaving its ally ... without the necessary support," Tykhyi said.</p>

<h2><strong>Fall Of Syria</strong></h2>

<p>At the peak of the conflict in Syria nearly a decade ago, Aleppo was at the frontlines of the war between government-controlled and rebel forces. However, with the help of Russian airpower and the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, President Bashar al-Assad was able to regain control over the entire Aleppo by the end of 2016. Since then, conflict in Syria has been majorly static with the rebels largely confined to the Idlib governate, adjacent to the Aleppo governate.</p>

<p>However, after years locked behind frozen frontlines, Syrian rebels have burst forth to mount the swiftest battlefield advance by either side since a rebellion against President Assad descended into civil war 13 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr Assad, who had crushed all forms of dissent, flew out of Damascus for an unknown destination earlier on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.</p>

<p>"After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria," the rebel factions said on Telegram.</p>

<p>But the Syrian army later said it was continuing operations against "terrorist groups" in the key cities of Hama and Homs and in Deraa countryside.</p>

<p>The pace of events in Syria has stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of a new wave of regional instability.&nbsp;Clearly, the armed opposition forces took advantage of the change in the power balance caused by nearby wars-- in Ukraine and in Lebanon and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Israel's war in Gaza and Lebanon has done significant damage to Mr Asaad's ally Iran's so-called axis of resistance, especially Hezbollah. At the same time, Russia, another stakeholder in Syria, is distracted by its fight in Ukraine making it harder to defend the Assad regime.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Russia's Stake In Syria</strong></h2>

<p>The lightning advance of rebels in Syria is threatening one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's proudest achievements, his 2015 military intervention to save Bashar al-Assad's regime. The end of Mr Asaad's control in Syria risks not just Russia's prestige, but its coveted military foothold in the eastern Mediterranean region-- the naval base of Tartus and, further north, the Hmeimim Air Base, both with 49-year-leases received after Russia's regime-saving intervention, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/06/russia-syria-war-rebels-tartus-bases/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to using these bases to protect Mr Assad's fragile regime, Moscow has used them to challenge American supremacy by projecting its military power in the eastern Mediterranean and claiming the role of a world power with vital regional interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia, however, currently has its hands full with its war on Ukraine. As per an estimate by Britain's Ministry of Defense, November was the costliest month of the war so far for Moscow's forces, with an average of more than 1,500 killed or wounded a day. Russia has been facing a Ukrainian incursion on its own soil since August that it is struggling to expel, now with the help of North Korean soldiers.</p>

<p>Now, amid the reports of the fall of Syria, Russia is at risk of losing control over the Hmeimim and Tartus bases.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How Could Fall Of Syria Impact Russia's War In Ukraine?</strong></h2>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://kyivindependent.com/fall-of-aleppo-deals-blow-to-russias-middle-east-clout-may-indirectly-strengthen-ukraines-hand/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Kyiv Independent</a>, Charles Lister, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute said even during the war on Ukraine, Moscow never scaled its military presence back down. However, the quality of Russia's officer corps in Syria had declined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Russia retains exactly the same troop levels. They've conducted the same number of air sorties over Syria with the same geographical breadth that they did prior to the war in Ukraine," he said, speaking on the Lawfare podcast.</p>

<p>What has changed, however, is that Russia can no longer count on the Wagner Group, which has played a significant role in safeguarding the Kremlin's interests in Syria in the past. Bogged down in Ukraine, Russia cannot send serious reinforcements to its military contingent in the Middle Eastern country either, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/russia-loser-fall-syria-s-aleppo" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Interpreter.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following its invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has lost several allies from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). The end of Mr Asaad's regime could mean Russia loses Syria as well, forcing the Kremlin to eventually shut down its Khmeimim Air Base in the Latakia area, and the naval facility in Tartus.</p>

<p>In the last two years of war, Moscow has redeployed weaponry from Syria to Ukraine, including Pantsir missile systems. Exposing its military and political weakness in Syria could undermine Russia's leverage in any potential negotiations surrounding Ukraine.</p>

<p>The fall of Aleppo has exposed the Kremlin to the risk of military overreach and has put its alliance with Iran under stress because of its competing military objectives in the country, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/04/syria-how-the-conflict-could-impact-the-ukraine-crisis-and-migration" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Euro News</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia is thus keen on encouraging dialogue between Ankara and Damascus and has deployed diplomatic efforts to open trilateral negotiations.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US-based United Airlines is spreading Christmas cheer by offering free 'Fantasy flights' to children in need to the 'North Pole' to see Santa Claus. The flights will depart from 13 cities including Los Angeles London and Tokyo among others. One of the first "Fantasy Flight" took off from Honolulu on Saturday (Dec 7) bringing some smiles to those in need. "Santa has invited us to Christmas Island and all his elves are waiting there on the ground for us," the pilot of Flight 3894, announced over the intercom.</p>

<p>Families that have children with cancer or who have been orphaned by the loss of someone on active duty are taken aboard a short flight that loops back around and lands right where they started. However, upon exiting, children are transported to Santa's hometown, the “North Pole" -- a fantasy winter wonderland created by United airport employees and local volunteers who "transform an average airport gate or maintenance hangar into a sea of twinkling lights, sparkling Christmas trees and Santa himself – along with his elves".</p>

<p>"We've stocked up on de-icing fluid to fly from even more cities. United is honoured to uplift children and their families through the joy of the holiday season. Making the North Pole closer than ever is one of the many ways we can show support for the communities where we live, work and fly," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.united.com/en/us/newsroom/announcements/cision-125357" rel="noindex, nofollow">said </a>Kate Gebo, United's Executive Vice President of Human Resources.</p>

<h3><strong>Internet reacts</strong></h3>

<p>Social media users lauded the move by United Airlines and called it a heartwarming gesture that would mean a lot to the kids.</p>

<p>"That is the nicest most heartwarming story. Thank you, United for spreading true Christmas joy!" said one user while another added: "What a wonderful experience for these children &amp; families...ENJOY!"</p>

<p>A third commented: "Christmas is the season of miracles. Good on United to bring cheer to these kids."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Behind the smoke and chaos of Syria's ongoing turmoil, the Al-Assad family stands as the untouchable core -- a dynasty that has moulded the country's fate for over half a century. At the centre is Bashar al-Assad.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad has reportedly fled Damascus, signalling the end of his rule after more than a decade of brutal civil war. Rebel groups, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have made significant advances, leaving the capital vulnerable and marking the collapse of Assad's once impenetrable government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The capital, now left vulnerable, stands as a symbol of the regime's sudden fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shifting power dynamics reflect the unravelling of a family dynasty that has defined Syria's fate for over half a century. Bashar Al-Assad was the "last standing". Often called "a dictator without a dictator," his power relied not just on his leadership, but on the unyielding support of his "inner circle", his closest family members - his brother Maher, a fiery military commander; his sister Bushra, known as "the Iron Lady"; and her husband Asef Shawkat, a calculating intelligence figure. But as Assad flees, their once-unified front begins to fracture.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the key players within the regime's inner circle:</p>

<p><strong>Maher Al-Assad</strong></p>

<p>Fifty-six-year-old Maher al-Assad, Bashar's younger brother, commands Syria's Republican Guard and the 4th Armoured Division, making him a key figure in both Syria's military and its alliance with Iran. Known as the hardliner of the family, Maher is described as "the ruthless face of power" and oversees the Shabiha militia, which protects the Assad regime's interests.</p>

<p>Sanctioned by the EU in 2011 for his role in violence against protesters, Maher's reputation for cruelty is reflected in protests that often target him directly. He has also been linked to the 1999 shooting of his brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, and named a suspect in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.</p>

<p><strong>Anisa Makhlouf</strong></p>

<p>Anisa Makhlouf, widow of the late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and mother of Bashar, may keep a low profile, but she holds the final say on all matters within the Assad family. "Decisions are made collectively in the family's inner circle, but Anisa has the last say," said Wael al-Hafez, a member of the Syrian opposition in exile, according to the feminist blog Les Martiennes.</p>

<p><strong>Bushra Al-Assad</strong></p>

<p>Born in 1960, Bushra Al-Assad is Bashar's only sister and a trained pharmacist. Like her brother Maher, she is known as a hawk within the regime and plays a significant role as Bashar's secretary. In the mid-1990s, she married Asef Shawkat. Bushra has also had a strained relationship with Bashar's wife, Asma. According to former Syrian diplomat Mohammed Daoud, Bushra long prevented Asma from assuming the title of Syria's "First Lady," a title she preferred to keep with her mother, Anisa. She has business ties with Rami Makhlouf, Bashar's maternal cousin.</p>

<p><strong>Rami Makhlouf</strong></p>

<p>Rami Makhlouf, Bashar al-Assad's first cousin, controls about 60 per cent of Syria's business. Born in 1965, he's considered Syria's richest man, with interests in telecommunications, retail, energy, banking, and transportation. The US sanctioned him in 2008 for abusing political influence, and the EU followed in 2011, accusing him of funding the crackdown on protesters.</p>

<p>Hated for corruption, Rami Makhlouf recently announced plans to donate part of his fortune to charity. His brother, Hafez Makhlouf, heads Syria's civilian intelligence service.</p>

<p><strong>Asef Shawkat</strong></p>

<p>General Asef Shawkat, an Alawite military officer, married Bashar al-Assad's sister, Bushra, in 1995. Initially rejected by the Assad family, he eventually gained their trust and built a close relationship with Bashar. Asef Shawkat quickly rose through the ranks, serving as Head of Military Intelligence, then Deputy Military Intelligence Chief, and later Chief of Military Intelligence until 2005. Despite facing international controversies, he was reassigned as Deputy Chief-of-Staff in 2008. He, along with Maher al-Assad, is linked to the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.</p>

<p><strong>Asma Al-Assad</strong></p>

<p>Born in London in 1975 to a Syrian diplomat family, Asma Al-Assad married Bashar al-Assad in December 2000. The couple has three sons: Hafez, Zein, and Karim. Asma holds degrees in computer science and French literature from King's College London and worked in investment banking before marrying Bashar. She played a key role in shaping Bashar's image as a moderate reformer. In 2005, she launched an organisation to encourage Syrian youth to embrace "active citizenship." Rumors suggest that, since the uprising began, Asma has exiled herself in London with their children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1971, Syria's political structure has been dominated by three key pillars: the Ba'ath Party, the Alawite minority, and the Syrian Army.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has fled Damascus as rebel forces, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, entered the capital, marking what they have called the “end of the era of tyranny.” This follows over a decade of civil war that has devastated Syria. Since his father Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1971, Syria's political structure has been dominated by three key pillars: the Ba'ath Party, the Alawite minority, and the Syrian Army, which have formed the foundation of the Assad regime and its ruling elite. The Ba'ath Party, a pan-Arab socialist movement, has shaped Syria's governance for decades since its establishment in the mid-20th century.</p>

<h2><strong>The Ba'ath Movement</strong></h2>

<p>The Arab Baʽath Movement, founded by Michel Aflaq in 1940, was the precursor to the Arab Socialist Baʽath Party. Initially named the Arab Ihya Movement (Arab Revitalisation Movement), it focused on Arab nationalism and socialism.</p>

<p>The movement became involved in anti-colonial activities, including supporting Iraq during the Anglo-Iraqi War in 1941. Aflaq also ran for the Syrian parliament in 1943 but lost. Afterward, the movement worked with other political parties, including Akram El-Hourani's Arab Socialist Movement. In 1947, the Arab Ihya Movement merged with Al-Arsuzi's Arab Baʽath Party, and in the 1950s, El-Hourani's movement joined as well, creating the Arab Socialist Baʽath Party.</p>

<h2><strong>The Formation of the Ba'ath Party</strong></h2>

<p>The Ba'ath Party is a political organisation that has dominated Syrian life for nearly five decades. Initially focused on Arab nationalism and pan-Arab unity, the Baath Party's slogan, "unity, freedom, socialism," appealed to many across the Middle East in the mid-20th century. Its goal was to challenge Western-backed governments and establish a modern, industrial economy.</p>

<h2><strong>The Ba'ath Party in Syria</strong></h2>

<p>In 1963, military officers including Hafez Al-Assad seized control of Syria through a coup, making the party shift to military dominance. The Ba'ath Party's ideological roots clashed with its military wing, causing rifts, and by 1970, Hafez al-Assad consolidated his power, sidelining civilian leaders like Aflaq.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Assad's rise to power in 1971, the party solidified its hold on Syria, using a combination of political repression and strategic alliances with the Alawite minority, the military, and key tribal groups. The Ba'ath Party's power was intertwined with the Assad family's rule, creating a highly centralised regime that, while espousing socialism and Arab unity, became increasingly authoritarian.</p>

<p><strong>Read:&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-bashar-al-assad-assad-family-damascus-the-al-assads-syrias-first-familys-rapid-rise-brutal-rule-abrupt-end-7198899">Fall Of Assads: How An Alawite Family Ruled Over A Sunni Nation For Decades</a></p>

<p>The 1973 constitution granted the Ba'ath Party unique status as the “leader of the state and society,” embedding it into every facet of Syrian life – from schools to government and military structures.</p>

<p>Bashar Al-Assad, who succeeded his father Hafez as president in 2000, initially appeared as a reformer but faced backlash as his attempts to open the system fell short. The party continued to thrive in an increasingly authoritarian state, with opposition stifled by brutal force, such as in the 1982 Hama massacre. Despite calls for reform, the Baath Party remained central to Syria's political structure. Bashar's rule faced significant unrest in 2011, but the party's leadership, largely loyal to the Assad family, held firm.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Syrian vs Iraqi Ba'ath Parties</strong></h2>

<p>Although both the Syrian and Iraqi branches of the Ba'ath Party shared common origins and ideals, their paths diverged significantly after the party's initial rise to power in both countries.</p>

<p>In Syria, the Ba'ath Party evolved under Hafez al-Assad and later his son, Bashar al-Assad. The party upheld the principles of Arab unity and socialism but focused heavily on maintaining control through a close-knit alliance with the Alawite minority and the military. The Assad family's inner circle played a key role in decision-making, ensuring the party's grip on power.</p>

<p>In Iraq, Saddam Hussein led the Ba'ath Party with a more authoritarian and nationalist approach. Unlike Syria, Saddam did not rely on a specific minority group to consolidate power but instead promoted a strong Arab nationalist agenda. His regime was marked by aggressive internal purges and brutal policies toward ethnic minorities, such as Kurds and Shiites, to maintain control.</p>

<p>Though both parties aimed for Arab unity, Saddam's vision was more focused on Iraq's dominance in the Arab world, often leading to policies that conflicted with Syria's interests, including Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk's X (formerly known as Twitter) has rolled out a free, limited-tier version of its AI chatbot, Grok, in a move to broaden its user base.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X (formerly known as Twitter) has rolled out a free, limited-tier version of its AI chatbot, Grok, in a move to broaden its user base. This offering, which was previously locked behind a premium subscription, is now accessible to non-premium users, albeit with certain restrictions.</p>

<p>On Friday, users discovered that the chatbot, developed by Musk's AI company xAI, is available to free-tier subscribers, allowing them to send up to 10 messages to Grok every two hours. The free version also includes limited access to image-related features, with users able to analyse up to three images and generate four new ones per day.</p>

<p>For X's Premium subscribers, which include those paying $7 for Premium and $14 for Premium+, access to Grok is more extensive, allowing up to 50 questions per day. Users must also have an X account that is at least seven days old and linked to a phone number to access the free-tier chatbot.</p>

<p>Grok, which xAI launched in 2023 as a "humorous AI assistant", was initially exclusive to Premium users of X. The chatbot was enhanced in August with a text-to-image generation tool, though it quickly gained attention for producing some controversial images. A month later, xAI began testing a free version of Grok in select regions, and the current update expands that availability.</p>

<p>Grok's capabilities go beyond casual conversation. It can assist with research, coding support, and even automate customer service for businesses. While xAI has not disclosed exact user numbers, unofficial estimates suggest that Grok's user base could be in the millions, a number that could grow with the introduction of the free tier.</p>

<p>The free-tier rollout is seen as a strategic effort to compete with other popular, no-cost chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, and Anthropic's Claude. These competitors have established a significant presence in the AI space, with OpenAI reporting 300 million active weekly users, and Meta's chatbot boasting nearly 600 million monthly active users.</p>

<p>Grok is the flagship product of xAI, which was founded by Musk in 2023 and is currently valued at $50 billion. The company's AI offerings have an edge due to the vast amounts of data collected from X and Tesla, the latter contributing visual data from its car cameras. xAI also has substantial computing power, thanks to a newly built supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which is being expanded to further scale up AI training.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early 2011, in the streets of Daraa, southern Syria, a teenager's rebellious act against an authoritarian regime triggered a civil war that reshaped the country's destiny. Mouawiya Syasneh, then just 14 years old, spray-painted a wall with words that would have grave implications.</p>

<p>"Ejak el door, ya doctor (It's your turn, Doctor) - this graffiti, directed at President Bashar al-Assad, with reference to his medical background, became the catalyst for a national uprising that descended into one of the most devastating civil wars of the 21st century.</p>

<p>The graffiti was a teenage prank born of frustration. Mouawiya and his friends, subjected to harassment by local police, decided to make their voices heard in the most visible way they knewt. But this act of rebellion against Assad's regime drew a swift and brutal response.</p>

<p>The secret police, or the Mukhabarat detained them for 26 days. Tortured and beaten, their eventual release only fueled the anger of Daraa's residents. Parents, neighbours, and activists who had protested for their release were met with tear gas and bullets.</p>

<p>As images of the battered boys spread, the incident became a rallying cry. Protests erupted not only in Daraa but across Syria. On March 15, 2011, Syria experienced its first coordinated "Day of Rage," transforming local unrest into a nationwide movement demanding freedom and the end of Assad's regime.</p>

<h2><strong>The Domino Effect</strong></h2>

<p>The crackdown that followed was brutal and unrelenting. Security forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrators, imprisoned dissidents, and subjected countless Syrians to torture. What began as a movement inspired by the Arab Spring quickly escalated into a bloody conflict as opposition forces armed themselves in response. By the time the Arab Spring erupted in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt - toppling Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Hosni Mubarak, respectively - Syria was a powder keg waiting for a spark.</p>

<p>The Free Syrian Army (FSA) emerged in July 2011, comprising defectors from Assad's military, but it lacked the cohesion and resources to present a unified front. This vacuum allowed extremist groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra and later the Islamic State, to rise, capitalising on the chaos and sectarian fractures.</p>

<p>Twelve years after those fateful graffiti strokes, Syria lay in ruins. More than 500,000 were killed, and over 13 million Syrians were displaced.</p>

<p>Now, after a brief thaw, a renewed civil uprising looks set to remove the Assad family's control over Syria. Led by a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), several rebel factions have taken over key Syrian cities, including the capital Damascus, the seat of Assad's power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to reports, Assad has left Damascus for an unknown destination, with speculations suggesting that he might have left for Tehran. Iran, a long-standing partner of the Assad family, is believed to be ready to offer the Assad family a safe haven while Syria descends into uncertainty. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian rebels have declared the start of a new era as they marched into the capital Damascus this morning. President Bashar Al-Assad, whose family has ruled the Middle Eastern country for over 50 years, has fled the country and the Syrian army command has confirmed to its officers that the Assad rule has ended.</p>

<p>Assad had maintained a strong grip on Syria despite protests and rebels joining hands to free the Sunni-majority country from an Alawite ruler. Even the slightest of protests evoked the strictest of responses from Assad's forces. Assad had used chemical weapons to suppress the civilian unrest that had kept his government on the brink for over a decade.</p>

<p>The use of chemical weapons amounts to a war crime, as per international laws. At least 193 countries are signatories to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which aims to eliminate chemical weapons as a weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>Syria became a member of the convention in 2013 and declared they have removed all their chemical weapons. However, questions still remain about the completeness of Syria's declaration.</p>

<h2><strong>Attacks On Ghouta</strong></h2>

<p>Ghouta bears witness to one of the worst chemical attacks in the history of Syria. The morning of August 21, 2013 captured a horror never seen before as the Assad regime carried out two chemical attacks on the opposition-controlled suburbs of Damascus. The attacks led to the death of hundreds of civilians, including children.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/g5ecut2g_ghouta-chemical-attack-2013_625x300_08_December_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>A surface-to-surface rocket system was used to carry out the attack, according to an investigation by Human Rights Watch. Sarin, an extremely potent nerve agent, was likely used in the attack as doctors said the victims showed symptoms of exposure to nerve gas - suffocation, nausea, frothing in the mouth, and fluids coming out of eyes and noses.</p>

<p>Denying responsibility for the attack, the Syrian government had put the blame on the opposition groups. HRW claims that it has found no evidence that supported the Syrian claim.</p>

<p>The severity of the attack could be understood from the visuals -available online - showing rows of bodies of dead adults and children wrapped in white shrouds.</p>

<p>In 2017, Assad had carried out another chemical attack on rebels in Khan Shaykhun. In response, then-US President Donald Trump had ordered strikes on Syria.</p>

<h2><strong>Fears Over Chemical Weapons</strong></h2>

<p>The Assad chapter may be over, but fears remain over the future of chemical weapons. US intelligence agencies assess that the forces had limited stockpiles, including sarin-loaded munitions, intended to be used against the rebels. The agencies are now monitoring the chemical weapons storage sites.</p>

<h2><strong>Torture Of Detainees</strong></h2>

<p>Syrian protesters were often picked up and tortured in jails. There have been reports of children being maimed and sexually abused by Assad's forces and recruited for fighting by the rebels.</p>

<p>In a recent <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1157931" rel="no follow,no index">UN report</a>, former detainees of the Syrian government have described the inhumane conditions they were kept in and the physical and psychological abuse unleashed on them. This includes beatings, stress positions, and sexual violence.</p>

<p>"Thousands of families bear the psychological toll of not knowing where their loved ones are. This is unimaginable psychological torture, yet the Syrian Government continues to intentionally withhold and cover-up information," said Robert Petit, head of the UN International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM), which prepared the report.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Syria war monitor said that President Bashar al-Assad has left the country, after losing swathes of territory to a lightning offensive led by an Islamist-led rebel coalition that said it entered Damascus on Sunday.</p>

<p>Residents in the Syrian capital told AFP heavy gunfire rang out, after a source close to Hezbollah saying fighters from the key Assad ally had left their positions around Damascus.</p>

<p>The president's reported departure comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group launched its campaign challenging more than five decades of rule by the Assad family.</p>

<p>"Assad left Syria via Damascus international airport before the army security forces left" the facility," Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP.</p>

<p>AFP was unable to immediately confirm the report.</p>

<p>After saying their forces were heading into the capital, HTS announced an "end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya" as they broke into the jail which has become a by-word for darkest abuses of the Syrian regime.</p>

<p>The rapid developments in Damascus come only hours after HTS said they had captured the strategic city of Homs, on the way to the capital.</p>

<p>The defence ministry earlier denied that rebels had entered Homs, describing the situation there as "safe and stable".</p>

<p>Homs lies about 140 kilometres (85 miles) north of the capital and was the third major city seized by the rebels who began their advance on November 27, reigniting a years-long war that had become largely dormant.</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah fighters leave</strong></h3>

<p>Monitoring events in Damascus, the Britain-based Observatory confirmed "the doors of the infamous 'Sednaya' prison... have been opened for thousands of detainees who were imprisoned by the security apparatus throughout the regime's rule".</p>

<p>Earlier, Assad's government denied the army had withdrawn from areas around Damascus.</p>

<p>"A very strong security and military cordon" was being established by the armed forces around the capital "and no one... can penetrate this defensive line", Interior Minister Mohammed al-Rahmoun told state television.</p>

<p>Assad has for years been backed by Lebanese Hezbollah, whose forces "vacated their positions around Damascus" according to a source close to the group.</p>

<p>Hezbollah "has instructed its fighters in recent hours to withdraw from the Homs area, with some heading to Latakia (in Syria) and others to the Hermel area in Lebanon", the source also told AFP.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah earlier said it had sent 2,000 fighters into Syria, to an area near the Lebanese border, "to defend its positions".</p>

<h3><strong>'Suddenly everyone was scared'</strong></h3>

<p>The defence ministry earlier insisted: "There is no truth to news claiming our armed forces... have withdrawn" from positions near Damascus.</p>

<p>The Syrian army said that, in addition to the area around Damascus, it was reinforcing positions in the south, and operations against the rebels were beginning in the Hama, Homs and Daraa areas.</p>

<p>AFP has been unable to independently verify some of the information provided by the government and the rebels, as its journalists cannot reach the areas around Damascus where the rebels say they are present.</p>

<p>Residents of the capital described to AFP a state of panic as traffic jams clogged the city centre, people sought supplies and queued to withdraw money from ATMs.</p>

<p>"The situation was not like this when I left my house this morning... suddenly everyone was scared," said one woman, Rania.</p>

<p>A few kilometres (miles) away, the mood was starkly different.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a Damascus suburb, witnesses said protesters toppled a statue of Assad's father, the late leader Hafez al-Assad.</p>

<p>AFPTV images from Hama, Syria's fourth-largest city, showed abandoned tanks and other armoured vehicles, one of them on fire.</p>

<p>Hama resident Kharfan Mansour said he was "happy with the liberation of Hama and the liberation of Syria from the Assad regime".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Soldiers 'fled' to Iraq</strong></h3>

<p>The Observatory said government forces had ceded more key ground, losing control of all southern Daraa province, the cradle of the 2011 uprising.</p>

<p>The army said it was "redeploying and repositioning" in Daraa and another southern province, Sweida.</p>

<p>The Observatory also said troops were also evacuating posts in Quneitra, near the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Jordan has urged its citizens to leave neighbouring Syria "as soon as possible", as have the United States and Assad ally Russia, which both keep troops in Syria.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent in Daraa saw local fighters guarding public property and civil institutions.</p>

<p>In Sweida, a local fighter told AFP that after government forces withdrew "from their positions and headquarters, we are now securing and protecting vital facilities".</p>

<p>An Iraqi security source told AFP that Baghdad has allowed in hundreds of Syrian soldiers, who "fled the front lines", through the Al-Qaim border crossing. A second source put the figure at 2,000 troops, including officers.</p>

<h3><strong>'War, blood and tears'</strong></h3>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years, and told minority groups living in areas they now control not to worry.</p>

<p>Since the offensive began, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed, the Observatory said.</p>

<p>The United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people.</p>

<p>UN special envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, called for "urgent political talks" to implement a 2015 Security Council resolution, which set out a roadmap for a negotiated settlement.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the United States should "not get involved", after outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Friday for a "political solution to the conflict", in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</p>

<p>After Fidan and his Iranian and Russian counterparts discussed Syria in Qatar on Saturday, Iran's top diplomat Abbas Araghchi said they agreed on the initiation of "political dialogue between the Syrian government and legitimate opposition groups".</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it was "inadmissible" to allow a "terrorist group to take control" of Syrian territory.</p>

<p>Moscow and Tehran have supported Assad's government and army during the war.</p>

<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government backs some armed groups in northern Syria, said Saturday that Syria "is tired of war, blood and tears".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Seizing power through a coup in 1970, Hafez Al-Assad started as a Prime Minister and then remained Syria's President till his death in 2000. The three-decade rule, though autocratic, gave Syria an era of stability and established it as a major force in the Middle East. His son, Bashar Al Assad, succeeded him and ruled Syria for over two decades till an armed rebellion overthrew his regime.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is the head of a statue of Hafez Al-Assad. The person who massacred their families in the 80s, the former dictator and the father of the current dictator.

<p>Dramatic scenes played out in the streets of Damascus and other cities as the regime changed in Syria. In particularly symbolic visuals, a statue of former President Hafez al-Assad was pulled down in Syria's fourth-largest city Hama -- over 200 km from Damascus. Celebratory firing and cries of 'Allahu Akbar' rang out loud as the statue was destroyed. A video showed a vehicle dragging the statue's decapitated head through the road as people chased it to kick. In the city of Latakia too, a statue of the former President was pulled down as protesters cheered and recorded the moment on their phones.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The vandalism of statues is a symbolic act witnessed in regime changes worldwide in recent history. When the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh was overthrown earlier this year, statues of the country's first president and Sheikh Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were vandalised. The scenes in Syria are also reminiscent of the 2003 footage of a US armoured vehicle toppling a statue of former dictator Saddam Hussein on the day Baghdad fell.</p>

<p>The rebellion that proved to be Bashar Al Assad's undoing began after peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 were repressed. Over time, the movement snowballed into a complex conflict drawing in foreign powers and leaving half a million people dead and many more displaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of Kamala Harris' historic speech on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, her grandnieces took the stage to give an unusual tutorial to the crowd. Introduced by actor Kerry Washington, the two girls offered to help the crowd learn how to properly pronounce the US vice president's name.</p>

<p>"It's come to my attention that there are some folks who struggle — or pretend to struggle — with the proper pronunciation of our future president's name. Confusion is understandable. Disrespect is not. So tonight we are going to help everyone get it right," the actor said before the two children walked on to a cheering crowd.</p>

<p>Eight-year-old Amara and six-year-old Leela, daughters of Harris' niece Meena Harris, were wearing a pink pantsuit and a blue dress.</p>

<p>"First you say ‘comma' like the comma in a sentence," Amara said. "Then you say ‘la' like la-la-la-la-la," added Leela.</p>

<p>Then it was the crowd's turn to practice. "Comma! La!, Comma! La!, Kama La" they roared.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Amara and Leela Ajagu — the daughters of Kamala Harris' niece, Meena Harris — joined actress Kerry Washington on stage to teach people — hint, hint — how to pronounce their “auntie's” name, “Kamala.” <a href="https://t.co/MLmaOd2BG4">pic.twitter.com/MLmaOd2BG4</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>The girls' mother and Harris' niece also took the stage talking about growing up with her. “I grew up in Oakland, California in a house full of extraordinary women my mom, my grandma and my auntie who showed me the meaning of service, helping her sister, a 17 year old single mom fighting for justice for the American people and still cooking Sunday family dinner. She guided me. Now she's guiding my own children and I know she'll guide our country forward," she said.</p>

<p>In the past, several leaders have stumbled while pronouncing the Indian-origin leader's name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most prominently, her now rival and Republican candidate Donald Trump has prided himself on mispronouncing her name, often using it as a way to dismiss her as competition. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked why, Trump said he had heard Harris' first name said "about seven different ways."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter what I say. I couldn't care less," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, pledged to broker a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict and solidify support for Ukraine, while criticizing her Republican opponent Donald Trump's stance.</p>

<p>On the final, and most anticipated, night of the four-day Chicago convention, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-message-for-america-as-she-accepts-presidential-nomination-6398145">Harris, 59, promised</a> to chart a "New Way Forward" as she and Trump, 78, enter the final 11 weeks of the razor-close campaign.</p>

<p>"Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-kamala-harris-in-her-biggest-speech-yet-remembers-mother-dr-shyamala-gopalan-harris-6398395">Kamala Harris</a> told her supporters at the Democratic National Convention as she accepted the party's presidential nomination.</p>

<p>"And let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself," she said</p>

<p>"What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost, desperate hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking," she added.</p>

<p>"President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."</p>

<p>The speech laid out some broad policy principles, foreign and domestic, but left unsaid specific details which in weeks to come she could be pressured to provide.</p>

<p>After days of protests from Palestinian supporters who were disappointed at not getting a speaking spot at the convention, Harris delivered a pledge to secure Israel, bring the hostages home from Gaza and end the war in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>Attacking Trump for his frequent denigration of NATO and Ukraine, she said that "as president I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies."</p>

<p>Ms Harris called out Trump's public praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, saying "I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators."</p>

<p>Tyrants are "rooting for Trump, because you know, they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris' godson, niece and nephew - &nbsp;Alexander Hudlin, Arden Emhoff and Jasper Emhoff&nbsp;- participated in the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Wednesday. The three gave a speech about their "auntie", following a speech by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the United Center in Chicago. They shared some stories about their relationship with her growing up. "Kamala Harris is our auntie," Jasper said, while Arden continued, "She'll be a president who cares for all of us."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/all-about-kamala-harris-nieces-nephews-8700253" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>People</em></a>, Kamala Harris has one sister, Maya Harris, who is the mother of Meena Harris. The vice president is also an aunt to nieces and nephews on her husband Doug Emhoff's side, including his brother Andrew Emhoff's daughter Arden and son Jasper. Mr Emhoff also has a sister, Jackie, who has children as well. In addition to being an aunt, Ms Harris is also a great-aunt to Ms Meena's daughters, Amara and Leela.</p>

<h3><strong>Now, as Kamala Harris' nieces and nephews take centre stage at the DNC, here's everything to know about them</strong></h3>

<h2>Meena Harris&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Meena Harris, daughter of Kamala Harris' sister Maya, has been open about growing up in an all-women household from her mother and aunt to her grandmother, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/star-of-my-life-all-about-kamala-harris-mother-shyamala-gopalan-6398652">Shyamala Gopalan</a>. According to the outlet, she described what it was like having "incredible women of colour running around" and how they inspired her to be ambitious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They were all in service and had a purpose. I appreciate that even more as an adult just how informative that was for me and I think about how I'm raising my own children, not only how I can carry that legacy forward but also that my kids in many good ways are growing up in a different environment," Meena Harris said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-family-tree-dnc-2024-emhoff-1943293" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, the 39-year-old is the founder and CEO of Phenomenal, a consumer and media company. She is also a lawyer and author and has worked on her aunt's 2022 presidential campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Jasper Emhoff</h2>

<p>Jasper Emhoff is the son of Doug Emhoff's brother, Andy. Emhoff has a sister as well. He grew up in Santa Cruz, California. Like is cousin, he is also building an impressive career for himself after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2023 with a degree in computer science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since graduating, Jasper started working as a machine learning engineer at Stealth Startup, People reported.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Arden Emhoff&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Arden Emhoff is Jasper's sister. She made a rare public appearance on Wednesday when she spoke in favour of her aunty at the DNC. Arden shared how "even as a kid, Auntie made me feel that I was seen, that my words are important, that I am important and loved".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I know she will value others perspectives no matter their age or background," Arden said. "Let's win this thing."</p>

<h2>Kamala Harris' great-nieces</h2>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago today and remembered her Indian-origin mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris before a rapturous crowd. Taking center stage on the last day of the Democratic Party convention, she said her mother was only 19 when she crossed the world alone, travelling from India to California with an "unshakeable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer".</p>

<p>"My mother Shyamala Harris had one of her own. I miss her every day -- especially now. And I know she's looking down tonight, and smiling," she told the gathering in Chicago.</p>

<p>"... It was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats -- a beautiful working-class neighbourhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers, all of whom tended their lawns with pride," Ms Harris added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-kamala-harris-in-her-biggest-speech-yet-remembers-mother-dr-shyamala-gopalan-harris-6398395" target="_blank">Shyamala Gopalan Harris</a> was a breast cancer specialist who emigrated from Tamil Nadu in 1960 to pursue a doctorate in endocrinology at the University of California Berkeley.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-when-my-mother-shyamala-gopalan-harris-came-from-india-she-didnt-imagine-2322213" target="_blank">ALSO READ | "When My Mother Came From India, She Didn't Imagine...": Kamala Harris</a></strong><br />
<br />
"When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me," Ms Harris said in her speech.</p>

<p>Kamala's sister, Maya Harris, also spoke at the Chicago event and recalled how their mother moved to the US from India to pursue a better life and encouraged her daughters to be "the authors of our own stories."</p>

<p>"Mommy's journey, and the opportunity that she wanted for Kamala and me - that's a distinctly American story," she said.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-kamala-harris-learnt-from-her-mother-dont-complain-do-something-2278643" target="_blank">ALSO READ | "Don't Complain, Do Something": What Kamala Harris Learnt From Her Mother</a></strong><br />
<br />
She also mentioned that if their late mother was here, she would say how proud she was of her daughter. Then, "without missing a beat, she'd say, "That's enough. You've got work to do."</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris' India Connection</strong></h3>

<p>Kamala Harris, 59, was born in Oakland, California in 1964 to Afro-Jamaican Donald Harris, who came to the US to study economics, and Shyamala Gopalan.</p>

<p>Her parents met at the University of California, a hub of student activism while participating in the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>Donald Harris is a professor emeritus at Stanford University, while Shyamala Gopalan&nbsp;died of cancer on February 11, 2009, a year before Kamala was elected as California's attorney general.</p>

<p>After the couple divorced, Shyamala&nbsp;Gopalan raised Kamala and her younger sister Maya.</p>

<p>She took them on trips to India and often expressed affection or frustration in Tamil, Kamala wrote in her 2019 book, "The Truths We Hold."</p>

<p>Kamala Harris has often spoken about her India connection and the influence of her maternal grandfather, PV Gopalan.</p>

<p>PV Gopalan left Thulasendrapuram, a village in Tamil Nadu decades ago, but residents say the family has maintained close links and has regularly donated to the temple's upkeep.</p>

<p>Earlier today, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vivek-ramaswamy-says-kamala-harris-is-cog-in-wheel-and-puppet-6397740" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> formally accepted the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nomination to fight against her Republican rival Donald Trump. Ms Harris emerged as the Democratic candidate after President Joe Biden, 81, was forced to quit the race for the White House last month. If successful, she will become the first woman elected US president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris took to the stage, not just as a candidate for the highest office in the land but as a proud daughter of immigrants as well. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the fourth night of the Democratic National Convention (DNC), US Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party's nomination for the President of the United States. Amid the cheers and applause, Harris not only laid out her vision for America but also touched upon a deeply personal narrative - one that connects her to her South Asian roots through her mother, Shyamala Gopalan.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' candidature came after President Joe Biden announced his decision to drop out of the presidential race and endorsed the VP as the party's nominee last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Thursday, the room erupted into applause as she began her speech, surrounded by supporters holding 'Kamala' placards in blue. In her address to the nation at the DNC, Harris began by acknowledging the journey that brought her to this historic moment. "The journey has been unexpected, but I am no stranger to unlikely journeys," she began. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris's mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who died in 2009, played an instrumental role in shaping the Vice President's identity and values. Harris spoke fondly of her mother, recalling the courage and determination that led a 19-year-old Shyamala to leave India for the US. "My mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, travelling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer," Harris shared, her voice filled with pride.</p>

<p>Shyamala Gopalan's journey was supposed to be temporary - she was expected to return to India after completing her studies, where an arranged marriage awaited her. However, destiny had plans, revealed the Democratic nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While studying at the University of California, Berkeley, Shyamala Gopalan met Donald Harris, a Jamaican student. "They fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me," Harris told the audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris also reminisced about her childhood, filled with memories of frequent moves due to her parents' careers. "Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck, packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois, to Wisconsin, and wherever our parents' jobs took us," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones. A home filled with laughter and music, coal train, and miles," Harris recalled. Her father's influence, particularly in her formative years, was also a significant theme in her speech. "In my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless," she said, reflecting on the words of encouragement he often gave her: "Run, Kamala, run. Don't be afraid, don't let anything stop you."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shayamala Goapalan's father, a civil servant, was a supporter of India's struggle for independence from British rule - a spirit of activism that Shyamala carried with her to the United States. In Berkeley, she became involved in the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

<p>Shyamala earned her doctorate by the age of 25 and later became a renowned breast cancer researcher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, when Kamala Harris stood before the nation, she wasn't just a candidate for the highest office in the land but a proud daughter of immigrants as well. "On behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey... I accept your nomination for president of the United States of America," Harris declared as the room erupted into applause.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When US Vice President Kamala Harris talks about her South Asian identity, it's usually in the context of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. The same was true on Thursday during Ms Harris' speech on the fourth night of the Democratic National Convention (DNC). "My mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, travelling from India to California with an unshakable dream," Ms Harris said during her speech. "She taught us to never complain about injustice, but to do something about it," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Now, as Kamala Harris secured the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, here's everything to know about her mother, Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris.</strong></h3>

<p>Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer researcher, died in 2009 at the age of 70 of colon cancer. She was born and raised in Chennai (then called Madras). According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/22/kamala-harriss-mother-shyamala-gopalan/74774514007/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>USA Today</em></a>, she was born to a civil servant father and a homemaker mother, and she was the eldest of four. &nbsp;</p>

<p>At just 19, soon after she graduated from the University of Delhi, Ms Gopalan defied cultural norms by pursuing a PhD in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her decision to move to the United States was a bold one, especially for a young woman from a conservative Tamil Brahmin community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After moving to the US, Ms Gopalan almost immediately gravitated to the Black community and found a common cause in the Civil Rights Movement. At one such meeting in 1962, she met Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica who was pursuing a doctorate in economics. The two got married a year later, in 1963.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1964, at age 25, Ms Gopalan earned her doctorate and gave birth to Kamala Harris. Two years later, she gave birth to Maya Harris, who is now a civil rights champion. But the marriage didn't last and the couple divorced in 1971.</p>

<p>Ms Gopalan raised her two daughters in the highly diverse working community in the Berkeley Flats neighbourhood, as per <em>USA Today</em>. During her DNC speech, Ms Harris said that despite her mother's success, her life as a new immigrant was often marred by racism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My mother was a brilliant 5-foot-tall brown woman with an accent," she said. "As the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool."</p>

<p>Ms Gopalan went on to become a distinguished breast cancer researcher. Her work took her all over the world, doing research in France and Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to her obituary published in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, she began her career conducting research at the school's zoology department and its cancer research lab. She published numerous notable research papers and spent time at many of the top research institutions in the US and around the world.</p>

<p>Ms Gopalan worked at the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin and abroad in France and Italy. She spent 16 years at McGill University's Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research at the Jewish General Hospital in Canada. During the last decade of her work, she returned to UC Berkeley to conduct research within the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>

<p>Ms Gopalan received numerous honours for her work as a research scientist. Notably, her discovery related to the hormone-responsiveness of breast tissue led to many subsequent advances, according to Breast Cancer Action.</p>

<p>Notably, since becoming vice president, Kamala Harris has continued talking about the advice she got from her mother. In her 2019 memoir, 'The Truths We Hold', Ms Harris also wrote, "Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything. There is no title or honour on earth I'll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris' daughter."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kamala Harris campaign rolled out the blue carpet for social media influencers at the Democratic National Convention this week, hoping that they can help get out the vote to beat Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Stars of Instagram and TikTok were feted with free drinks, yacht parties and full VIP access, among other special treatment that was not given to the traditional press at the political convention -- which felt more like a festival, at times -- in Chicago.</p>

<p>"People have to realize that a lot of these creators have larger audiences than CNN, The New York Times, Univision, Telemundo, ABC," said Benjamin Zamora, a former journalist who left the news media to work as an influencer online, where he has 6.3 million followers across platforms.</p>

<p>He spoke on the floor of Chicago's United Center, where rooms have been set aside to pamper influencers with spreads of wine and prime-rib sandwiches.</p>

<p>It was a far cry from what was available for the mainstream press, but for Zamora, the difference in treatment makes sense.</p>

<p>"The Democratic National Convention sees content creators as allies; that's not the case for the press," he said.</p>

<p>The accreditation of more than 200 influencers is a new development at this convention, part of a strategy to broaden Harris's electoral base.</p>

<p>The treatment given to influencers contrasts with the fact that Harris has not given an interview or press conference to the mainstream press since President Joe Biden stepped aside and the party endorsed her nomination.</p>

<p>At least five influencers made the convention's select list of speakers, including Uruguay's Carlos Eduardo Espina, who took the podium Wednesday.</p>

<p>"It's really incredible that they gave us that opportunity," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"We see Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and we think 'Wow, we don't deserve to be in the same space as them,'" he added.</p>

<p>"But we do. We have a lot to offer," said the 25-year-old, who has more than 11 million followers on social networks.</p>

<p>In the arena, influencers -- with cameras, lights and microphones in hand -- are freer to roam than many press teams, and have a reserved area on the blue carpet for interviews.</p>

<p>The reserved space for the traditional media sits outside the stadium, with few luxuries other than water, powerful air conditioning and Wi-Fi.</p>

<h2>All in for Harris</h2>

<p>The work is different, explained 12-year-old influencer Knowa, who argued with Republican activists Charlie Kirk and Mike Lindell in a recent video that went viral.</p>

<p>Despite his young age, Knowa speaks with a self-confidence that many may not reach in a lifetime, and with an undeniable charisma.</p>

<p>For Knowa, the DNC is not the biggest event of his short career, even though it has seen him sitting alongside US Senator Bernie Sanders and former Georgia state legislator Stacey Abrams.</p>

<p>"No, I would say the White House... that was pretty big as well," he said.</p>

<p>The young campaigner and social media star is all in for Harris, having met her five times.</p>

<p>The young influencer is homeschooled and has few other hobbies, dedicating all his time to the cause.</p>

<p>"The first thing I do when I wake up, I Google Kamala Harris. That's it," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Not all influencers at the convention are focused on politics, however.</p>

<p>Beauty, entertainment, lifestyle -- influencers covering all walks of life are adapting their brands to the convention.</p>

<p>Blair Imani, with 642,000 followers on Instagram, promotes one-and-a-half-minute videos on a diversity of topics on her "Smarter in Seconds" channel.</p>

<p>At the convention, Imani interviewed popular Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

<p>"They've given us access, they've been so hospitable," said Imani.</p>

<p>"I know they're accommodating some content creators with hotel accommodations, because a lot of us are independent creators... They've gone above and beyond," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PM Narendra Modi is in Ukraine for his much-anticipated trip after wrapping up his two-day visit to Poland this morning. He is scheduled to meet the Ukrainian PM Volodymyr Zelenskyy, upon whose invite he is visiting the conflict-hit nation-state.</p>

<p>PM Modi's Ukraine visit comes nearly six weeks after he visited Russia to discuss the conflict-ridden situation amid Russia Ukraine. This is also the first visit by an Indian PM to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal posted on the social media platform X (formerly, Twitter) that PM Modi's visit to Poland after four decades will widen and deepen India-Poland relations.</p>

<p>The UN secretary-general's office said that they hope that the Indian PM's visit to Ukraine might bring up the possibility of putting an end to the war.</p>

<p>Although India has yet to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, PM Modi's statement said, "As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region."</p>

<p>"I look forward to the opportunity to build upon earlier conversations with President Zelenskyy on strengthening bilateral cooperation and share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict. I am confident that the visit will serve as a natural continuation of extensive contacts with the two countries and help create the foundation for stronger and more vibrant relations in the years ahead," it further added.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian PM congratulated PM Modi on his election victory earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-message-for-america-as-she-accepts-presidential-nomination-6398145">Kamala Harris</a> said that her mother was 19 when she crossed the seven seas alone, traveling from India to California "with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer."</p>

<p>"I miss her every day, and especially right now - and I know she's looking down, smiling," Ms Harris said.</p>

<p>"When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2024-national-democratic-convention-day-4-live-kamala-harris-to-give-biggest-speech-of-career-on-final-day-of-dnc-6397465">Ms Harris added</a>.</p>

<p>"Mommy's journey, and the opportunity that she wanted for Kamala and me - that's a distinctly American story," she said.</p>

<p>She also mentioned that if their late mother was here, she would say how proud she was of her daughter. Then, "without missing a beat, she'd say, 'That's enough. You've got work to do.'"</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Hindus in the US have come together to create “Hindus For Kamala Harris”, a support group for the Democratic presidential nominee, saying she would be good for India, America and the world.</p>

<p>The group has been created “to support Kamala Devi Harris to become the 47th President of the United States of America”, its founding members said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Harris, 59, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2024-national-democratic-convention-day-4-live-kamala-harris-to-give-biggest-speech-of-career-on-final-day-of-dnc-6397465">formally accepted</a> the nomination of the Democratic Party to be its presidential nominee.</p>

<p>“There is a simple path to victory. Without rejecting the other side, promote Harris candidacy because of what it stands for and the solution it will provide," another member said, adding that the candidacy has a unique momentum to win.</p>

<p>The group is urging Hindus to vote in the elections, display signs of support near their house, and make donations in support of the Harris campaign.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of California sea lions have taken over San Carlos Beach in Monterey, California, prompting local officials to close the area to people.</p>

<p>Caution tape has been put up but crowds are still drawn to the animal spectacle, taking photos of the sea lions as they rest and play on the sand and in the water.</p>

<p>While sea lions, or eared seals, are often seen at certain beaches up and down the California coast, local residents say they have never seen so many of the marine mammals gathered in Monterey.</p>

<p>Lisa Uttal, a marine biologist with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, said it was unclear exactly why the sea lions chose San Carlos Beach, but they may be attracted to the rich diversity in the ecosystem's food supply. Virtually all those gathered on the beach were male, she said.</p>

<p>"They migrate up here down from Ventura and the Channel Islands ... They are incredibly mobile. They're usually chasing the food and because Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is so productive out here, the productivity is really rich," Uttal said.</p>

<p>They were expected to remain on San Carlos Beach for three to four weeks, Uttal said.</p>

<p>Marge Brigadier, a volunteer with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary's Bay Net program, said the sea lions were protected by the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits people from changing the behaviour of the sea lions, meaning that approaching too close or forcing them to flee is a violation.</p>

<p>"People just need to think about how they would feel if they were resting on their bed taking a nap and something big kept coming and chasing them out of the house," Brigadier said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The largest diamond found in more than a century has been unearthed in Botswana at a mine owned by Canadian firm Lucara Diamond, the BBC reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The largest diamond found in more than a century has been unearthed in Botswana at a mine owned by Canadian firm Lucara Diamond, the <em>BBC </em>reported. The Botswana government said that the huge 2,492-carat stone is the biggest find since the 3,106-carat Cullinan diamond, found in South Africa in 1905. It stated that the diamond, which is yet to be named, is also the largest ever discovered in the southern African state. It was found at Karowe mine, which is about 500km north of Botswana's capital, Gaborone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Botswana is one of the world's biggest producers of diamonds, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w78rwlqvxo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. In a statement, the Canadian firm said that the stone was "one of the largest rough diamonds ever unearthed". "We are ecstatic about the recovery of this extraordinary 2,492-carat diamond. The ability to recover such a massive, high-quality stone intact demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach to diamond recovery and our commitment to maximizing value for our shareholders and stakeholders," said Lucara Diamond's head William Lamb.</p>

<p>"This discovery reinforces Karowe's position as a truly world-class diamond mine and highlights the continued success of our operational and underground development strategy," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://lucaradiamond.com/newsroom/news-releases/lucara-recovers-epic-2-492-carat-diamond-from-the-122900/" rel="noindex, nofollow">statement</a>, the diamond was detected with the use of Lucara's Mega Diamond Recovery X-ray technology. It has been used since 2017 to identify and preserve high-value diamonds so that they do not break during one-crushing processes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company did not reveal details about the diamond's quality or its value. However, according to the <em>Financial Times</em>, people close to Lucara estimated that the stone could be worth upwards of $40 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This discovery symbolizes Botswana's continued ascent as a global leader in diamond production. It represents not only the unparalleled wealth found in Botswana's soil, but also the remarkable progress the nation has made in developing its diamond industry for the benefit of its citizens," the Canadian firm said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, this latest recovery joins an impressive roster of other significant finds from the mine, including the Sewelo diamond, which was found at the Karowe Mine in 2019, and was recognised as the second-biggest mined diamond in the world at 1,758 carats. It was bought by French fashion house Louis Vuitton for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p>A 1,109-carat diamond, unearthed at the same mine in 2016, was bought for $53 million by London jeweller Laurence Graff, chairman of Graff Diamonds, in 2017.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Democratic National Convention, a four-day mega event which saw a tearful Joe Biden getting a farewell, and Kamala Harris making a surprise entry in a tan suit, will end today.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The fourth day will witness Kamala Harris deliver the biggest, most important speech of her political life as she accepts the Presidential nomination, the second woman in the party's history to ever get nominated.</li>
	<li>The groundwork for her performance has been laid by her boss, US President Joe Biden, who said "She is tough, experienced and has enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story." Barack Obama tweaked his 2008 campaign "Yes We Can" to Yes, She Can", to praise Ms Harris. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama termed Kamala Harris's story as "the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country."</li>
	<li>Kamala Harris is expected to talk about her past experiences, and her life story from a successful lawyer to becoming the first Black, South Asian female Vice President in American history. The seasoned lawyer will present her case in front of the delegates at United Center Arena in Chicago.</li>
	<li>From Barack and Michelle Obama to Bill Clinton, senior figures have warned all week that Ms Harris has a brutal fight on her hands to beat the 78-year-old Trump.</li>
	<li>Tim Walz, the Minnesota Governor, yesterday, accepted the Vice President nomination. He called it the "honour of his life" and shared his upbringing in a middle-class family in Nebraska, how he learned from helping his family on the farm and his experience of teaching students. These stories are intended to connect with the larger middle-class American population that is reeling through an economic slowdown coupled with inflation and unemployment.</li>
	<li>Mr Walz's son, Gus, stole the spotlight on day 3 of the event. The 17-year-old who is neurodivergent and has ADHD, was overcome with emotion as he watched his father take the stage. With tears streaming down his face, Gus stood up and proudly pointed at his dad, exclaiming, "That's my dad!".</li>
	<li>Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey endorsed the party's nominees. Ms Winfrey made a surprise entry yesterday and said "What we're going to do is elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. And let us choose joy!" Winfrey said, a day after former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle addressed the DNC."</li>
	<li>The chemistry between 59-year-old Harris and Walz and the noisy energy generated at their rallies is helping to fuel Democratic hopes that they can defeat Donald Trump.</li>
	<li>A recent poll showed Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. The four-point lead is a small but notable improvement for Democrats in the election race, a month after polls had shown then-presidential nominee Joe Biden and Trump in a dead heat.</li>
	<li>Immigration is set to be a key issue in the upcoming Presidential elections. A slowdown in the economy which leads to unemployment and inflation, deeply impacts the attitude towards immigration. The immigrants fear a second Trump term, who has been a staunch hardliner on such issues.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven people were killed and 12 others injured in a fire at a hotel in South Korea, authorities said Friday.</p>

<p>The blaze erupted Thursday night in a room on the eighth floor of a hotel in Bucheon, around 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of Seoul, Seoul's interior ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The cause of the fire, which was extinguished about three hours after it began, was not yet clear, the ministry said, adding three people had been seriously injured.</p>

<p>The nine-story hotel had 64 rooms and 27 guests were staying there when the fire broke out, according to Seoul's Yonhap news agency.</p>

<p>While the blaze did not spread extensively within the building, the smoke it generated led to casualties, the news agency reported.</p>

<p>In June, 23 people were killed in a massive fire at a South Korean lithium battery plant, one of the country's worst factory disasters in years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is "a cog in the wheel and a puppet", Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy said on Thursday, and added that the Democratic presidential candidate is staying away from talking about policy in her speeches as it makes her less popular.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy, 39, was flown into Chicago, venue of the Democratic National Convention, by the Trump Campaign on the day Harris, 59, was scheduled to accept the party's presidential nomination.</p>

<p>"She's a cog in the wheel, she's a puppet. The reality is she's staying away from policy because the more she talks about policy, the less popular she becomes and that I think is the winning strategy for our side,' Ramaswamy told PTI in an interview.</p>

<p>"We win on policy. I think we need to go harder after her for her failed economic policies and her record at the Southern border. The reality is if we do that, I believe we're going to be successful not only in winning this election but in saving the country,' Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy said Donald Trump is the right choice for the country and that he is doing everything he can to make sure he is elected.</p>

<p>'We're only going to implement that agenda if we have control of the Senate and the House as well. So I'm doing everything I can to be helpful, while also continuing some of my own independent ventures in the business world now in the world of film and a couple of other areas where I think we could impact the country as well,' he said.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy is an executive producer of City of Dreams, a new movie. "It's actually made by director who is an immigrant from India, Mohit Ramchandani. Very talented guy," he said adding that the movie is coming out on August 30 "I've been involved in a number of my business ventures, have a book coming out called Truths: The Future of America First. That's come in in late September as well. So, a number of ventures outside of politics, because I think it's important to drive those changes in culture. But the most important objective is to make sure that we win not only the presidency but control of the House and Senate as well,' Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>The American entrepreneur-turned-politician slammed Harris for her open border policy. "I think it's offensive to every legal immigrant to have an open a border to ten million people who enter this country illegally. I also think that one of the things that Indian-Americans do and should care about is merit in the country right,' he said.</p>

<p>"It's a lot harder to get into a good college or even to get a job if you're have the wrong race, gender, or sexuality, but race. In the GOP, we want to end affirmative action not because we're against anybody, but because we stand from meritocracy. That's why many legal immigrants do come to this country. I think it's time we restore merit in the United States of America," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted on Thursday, the meteorological office said, spraying red-hot lava and smoke in its sixth outbreak since December.</p>

<p>"An eruption has begun. Work is under way to find out the location of the recordings," the meteorological office said in a statement without providing further detail.</p>

<p>Livestreams from the area showed glowing hot lava shooting up from the ground.</p>

<p>Studies had shown magma accumulating underground, prompting warnings of new volcanic activity in the area located just south of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik.</p>

<p>The most recent eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula, home to some 30,000 people or nearly 8% of the country's total population, ended on June 22 after spewing fountains of molten rock for 24 days.</p>

<p>The eruptions show the challenge faced by the island nation of nearly 400,000 people as scientists warn that the Reykjanes peninsula could face repeated outbreaks for decades or even centuries.</p>

<p>Since 2021, there have been nine eruptions on the peninsula, following the reactivation of geological systems that had been dormant for 800 years.</p>

<p>In response, authorities have constructed man-made barriers to redirect lava flows away from critical infrastructure, including the Svartsengi geothermal power plant, the Blue Lagoon outdoor spa and the town of Grindavik.</p>

<p>Flights were unaffected, Reykjavik's Keflavik Airport said on its web page</p>

<p>Grindavik, home to one of Iceland's key fishing ports and nearly 4,000 people, has been largely abandoned since late last year when residents were first ordered to evacuate.</p>

<p>Volcanic outbreaks in the Reykjanes peninsula are so-called fissure eruptions, which do not usually disrupt air traffic as they do not cause large explosions or significant dispersal of ash into the stratosphere.</p>

<p>Iceland, which is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Kentucky, boasts more than 30 active volcanoes, making the north European island a prime destination for volcano tourism - a niche segment that attracts thrill seekers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Arizona man is wanted after threatening over social media to kill former President Donald Trump, the Cochise County Sheriff's Office said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is in Cochise County as he visits the U.S. border with Mexico as part of his campaign.</p>

<p>The man, Ronald Lee Syvrud, 66, has multiple outstanding warrants from Wisconsin, the sheriff's office said.</p>

<p>"No, I have not heard that but I am not that surprised and the reason is because I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys," Trump said when asked about that threat against him in Arizona.</p>

<p>This is the latest in a series of threats against candidates ahead of the Nov. 5 general election.</p>

<p>In early August, a Virginia man was charged with threatening Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, and a New Hampshire man was arrested in December for threatening to kill Republican presidential candidates.</p>

<p>In July, Trump was shot in his ear in an attempted assassination that left two others injured and one man dead.</p>

<p>The U.S. Secret Service came under widespread scrutiny following the shooting. It resulted in the resignation of the agency's director.</p>

<p>Despite this and new threats, Trump said he has "great respect" for the Secret Service and "the job they do," while adding they made mistakes from which they will learn.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris is addressing the American public on the final night of the National Democratic Convention (DNC) in Chicago on Thursday. In her anticipated keynote speech, Harris praised her outgoing boss, President Joe Biden, as she formally accepted her party's nomination for the upcoming presidential race.</p>

<p>Harris' address will follow the nomination of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. Walz introduced himself to the nation on Wednesday, highlighting his readiness to support Harris in the bid for the White House.</p>

<p>In her keynote address, Kamala Harris shared her personal story.&nbsp;During speech, Harris articulated her vision for America's future, contrasting it with what her campaign characterises as former President Donald Trump's "dark, conservative" vision for a second term in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>The final day of the convention featured addresses from several prominent Democratic figures, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, civil rights leader Al Sharpton, and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The theme for the fourth and final day of the DNC is "For Our Future".</p>

<p>The convention's concluding night promises to set the stage for the upcoming election, with Harris and her allies aiming to rally support and energise voters ahead of the November election.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris is poised to deliver the biggest speech of her political life on Thursday as she accepts the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago after a historic turnaround in the 2024 White House race.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old US vice president will focus on joyful "vibes" after electrifying her party in the space of a single heady month since President Joe Biden dropped out of the contest.</p>

<p>Now Harris will tell her personal story to the American people, using her televised address to the Democratic National Convention to contrast her optimism with the darker tone of Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"It's going to blow the roof off," said Amanda Taylor, a 47-year-old delegate from Missouri.</p>

<p>Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, also swapped messages on X on Thursday for their 10th wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>"To the best partner I could ask for: Happy anniversary, Dougie," the Vice President wrote, while he said: "Forever to go. Happy anniversary @VP. I love you."</p>

<p>Yet while Democrats' hopes are soaring and as Harris edges ahead in the polls, they know the battle is far from won.</p>

<p>From Barack and Michelle Obama to Bill Clinton, senior figures have warned all week that Harris has a brutal fight on her hands to beat the 78-year-old Trump.</p>

<p>The sheer speed of her astonishing rise to the top of the ticket also means Harris remains an unknown quantity to many US voters.</p>

<p>A trailblazer as the first woman, Black and South Asian vice president in US history -- and now bidding to become its first woman president -- her role has largely kept her in the background the last four years.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Fight for freedom' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris will seek to remedy that in her speech. She will talk about how she was raised by a working mother and knows the challenges facing families hit by inflation, a campaign official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>She will set her confident vision for America's future against what her campaign calls Trump's dark, conservative inspiration for a second term in the Oval Office, the official said.</p>

<p>Speaker after speaker has focused on the idea of freedom during the Democratic convention, as the party targets what it says are Republican plans to further limit abortion and clamp down on democratic institutions.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Harris's energetic running mate Tim Walz formally accepted the party's nomination, saying: "Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead."</p>

<p>But Harris has been short on policy announcements since taking over as the Democratic standard-bearer, particularly when it comes to the economy, a key issue in the election.</p>

<p>She has to take advantage of her first major speech in a presidential setting, as "you don't get a second chance to make a first impression," political analyst Larry Sabato told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Kamala vibes' -</strong></p>

<p>"Voters already have the Kamala vibes. Now they need the Kamala agenda," said Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia. A lack of economic policy "can defeat her faster than the border," he added.</p>

<p>But when it comes to vibes, Democrats are in full on celebration mode, unrecognizable from the party that was steeped in despair after the 81-year-old Biden's catastrophic debate performance against Trump.</p>

<p>The Obamas raised the roof in Chicago on Tuesday, with the ex-first lady declaring that under Harris "hope is making a comeback."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Clinton, television talk show host Oprah Winfrey and musicians Stevie Wonder and John Legend were the warm-up acts for Walz, the governor of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Biden's farewell address on Monday, when Harris made a surprise appearance on stage to give him a hug, already seems like a distant memory.</p>

<p>If the transition has been head-spinning for Biden and the Democrats, it has completely unsettled Trump.</p>

<p>In a roller-coaster summer he has survived an assassination attempt, and then seen what he thought was certain victory turned on its head by a new and far younger opponent.</p>

<p>Trump will be in Arizona on the Mexican border on Thursday to push Harris's weak spot on the issue of illegal immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

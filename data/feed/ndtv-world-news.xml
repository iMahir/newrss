       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of arrests in days of violence in Bangladesh passed the 2,500 mark in an AFP tally on Tuesday, after protests over employment quotas sparked widespread unrest.</p>

<p>At least 174 people have died, including several police officers, according to a separate AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>What began as demonstrations against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed last week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>A curfew was imposed and soldiers deployed across the South Asian country, and a nationwide internet blackout drastically restricted the flow of information, upending daily life for many.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Supreme Court pared back the number of reserved jobs for specific groups, including the descendants of "freedom fighters" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>The student group leading the demonstrations suspended its protests Monday for 48 hours, with its leader saying they had not wanted reform "at the expense of so much blood".</p>

<p>The restrictions remained in place Tuesday after the army chief said the situation had been brought "under control".</p>

<p>There was a heavy military presence in Dhaka, with bunkers set up at some intersections and key roads blocked with barbed wire.</p>

<p>But more people were on the streets, as were hundreds of rickshaws.</p>

<p>"I did not drive rickshaws the first few days of curfew, But today I didn't have any choice," rickshaw driver Hanif told AFP.</p>

<p>"If I don't do it, my family will go hungry."</p>

<p>The head of Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, told AFP in his hospital room Monday that he feared for his life after being abducted and beaten, and the group said Tuesday at least four of its leaders were missing, asking authorities to "return" them by the evening.</p>

<h3><strong>'Killed at random'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The authorities' response to the protests has been widely criticised, with Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus urging "world leaders and the United Nations to do everything within their powers to end the violence" in a statement.</p>

<p>The respected 83-year-old economist is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but earned the enmity of Hasina, who has accused him of "sucking blood" from the poor.</p>

<p>"Young people are being killed at random every day," Yunus told AFP. "Hospitals do not reveal the number of wounded and dead."</p>

<p>Diplomats in Dhaka also questioned the government's actions, with US Ambassador Peter Haas telling the foreign minister he had shown a one-sided video at a briefing to diplomats.</p>

<p>Government officials have repeatedly blamed the protesters and opposition for the unrest.</p>

<p>More than 1,200 people detained over the course of the violence -- nearly half the 2,580 total -- were held in Dhaka and its rural and industrial areas, according to police officials who spoke to AFP.</p>

<p>Almost 600 were arrested in Chittagong and its rural areas, with hundreds more detentions, tallied in multiple districts across the country.</p>

<h3><strong>'Sheikh Hasina never flees'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the June reintroduction of the quota scheme -- halted since 2018 -- deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>With protests mounting across the country, the Supreme Court on Sunday curtailed the number of reserved jobs from 56 per cent of all positions to seven per cent, mostly for the children and grandchildren of "freedom fighters" from the 1971 war.</p>

<p>While 93 per cent of jobs will be awarded on merit, the decision fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the "freedom fighter" category altogether.</p>

<p>Late Monday, Hasina's spokesman told AFP the prime minister had approved a government order putting the Supreme Court's judgement into effect.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is also accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden publicly announced his exit from the presidential race on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.Â ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After weeks of criticism and scrutiny, US President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race. On Sunday, the president shared his decision to end his reelection campaign in a social media post from his beach house in Delaware while recovering from COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Never before has an incumbent president dropped out of a reelection bid so close to Election Day. The decision came after almost a month of questions surrounding his health and pressure following a lacklustre performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Despite initially standing firm, calls for his exit began to gain traction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pressure within the Party</strong></p>

<p>Democratic leaders, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, questioned whether Biden's performance was a temporary setback or a sign of deeper issues. The situation worsened when Rep Lloyd Doggett publicly urged Biden to withdraw.</p>

<p>Biden's team attempted to address these concerns through public appearances and statements. However, their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The president's July 5 interview with ABC News, where he stated only the "Lord Almighty" could convince him to leave the race, did little to ease concerns and even angered some Democrats.</p>

<p>Up until his departure, Biden and his team consistently maintained he would remain in the race. He appeared in a high-profile interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, acknowledging his debate shortcomings but criticised media focus on his gaffes instead of Trump's falsehoods. Biden said that only a "medical condition" could force him to reconsider his bid.</p>

<p><strong>Party division</strong></p>

<p>On July 10, actor George Clooney, in an opinion piece published in the New York Times, criticised Biden's performance and urged him to consider withdrawing. Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reluctance to endorse Biden only deepened the divisions within the party.</p>

<p>By July 11, the situation reached a tipping point. Biden's public comments and verbal slip-ups, including confusing Vice President Kamala Harris with Trump and referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian President Vladimir Putin, raised further doubts about his readiness for another term. This only solidified the view that it was in the best interest of both Democrats and America to have an alternative to Biden.</p>

<p><strong>Joe Biden's exit</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the combination of internal pressure, poor polling numbers, and the president's declining public performance led to Biden's decision to withdraw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, he publicly announced his exit and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, with just 107 days before the election, this sudden shift presents both risks and opportunities for the party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan has fired two senior ministers, including the head of the foreign ministry, in a mini-cabinet reshuffle.</p>

<p>The move comes ahead of expected national elections next year, with the sacked information minister caught in a viral video last week saying "winning in elections is not always determined by the number of votes in the ballot box".</p>

<p>"Mahmoud Thabit Kombo has been appointed a member of parliament and the new minister for foreign affairs and East African cooperation to replace January Makamba whose appointment is revoked," according to a presidency statement issued late Sunday, which did not detail the reasons for the dismissals.</p>

<p>Jerry Silaa -- previously Lands, Housing and Settlement Development -- was appointed to replace Nape Nnauye, Minister for Information, Communications and IT, the statement said.</p>

<p>A viral clip of Nnauye emerged last week in which he said: "Winning in elections is not always determined by the number of votes in the ballot box but depends on who counts and announces the results."</p>

<p>The video attracted widespread criticism from both the opposition and the ruling party, which said the remarks did not reflect its stance.</p>

<p>Nnauye apologised for the clip, saying his comments were meant as a joke and he had been quoted out of context.</p>

<p>But local media reported opposition politician John Mnyika saying the statement "indicates what has been planned within the government and the ruling party".</p>

<p>The reshuffle has also left analysts speculating about the 2025 election, which Hassan is expected to contest.</p>

<p>"I think it's a power play towards the general election next year," said University of Dar es Salaam lecturer Abel Kinyondo.</p>

<p>The move follows her decision in early July to appoint a new intelligence chief.</p>

<p>"Suleiman Abubakar Mombo was sworn to replace Ali Idi Siwa who retired," the presidency said.</p>

<p>Hassan, then deputy president, took office in 2021 after the death of John Magafuli.</p>

<p>Since taking the helm, Hassan has moved away from Magafuli's authoritarian policies and embarked on political reforms, including relaxing some restrictions on the media and the opposition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 44,000 people, led by black women, logged onto a Zoom call to support US Vice President Kamala Harris and raised more than $1.5 million for her campaign in three hours as she aims for the Oval Office in the west wing of the White House, the Washington Post <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-black-women-zoom/">reported</a>. The presidential bid could make Ms Harris the first woman president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Harris today expressed her gratitude for the "overwhelming support" and reaffirmed her commitment to the Democratic presidential nomination, just two days after President Joe Biden, who was seeking re-election, announced his decision to step aside. "When I announced my campaign for President, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination. Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon," she said in a statement.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tonight, I am proud to have earned the support needed to become our party's nominee.<br />
<br />
Over the next few months, I'll be traveling across the country talking to Americans about everything on the line. I fully intend to unite our party and our nation, and defeat Donald Trump. <a href="https://t.co/Bsq3N6pMAi">pic.twitter.com/Bsq3N6pMAi</a></p>
â Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1815602762870116359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Jotaka Eaddy, founder of 'Win With Black Women', which describes itself as a collective of intergenerational, intersectional Black women leaders, said, "Anybody that does not think that Black and Brown women are the backbone of this party (Democratic), they don't know us."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black women are a key Democratic voting bloc. The call, which attracted several celebrities and political figures, was conducted off the record, with participants speaking in their personal capacities. Attendees described it as feeling like church or a family reunion.</p>

<p>Ms Eaddy has been organising such calls since August 2020. Her organisation aims to elect Black women nationwide and speaks out against racism and sexism. During the 2020 election, the most attendees she had on one Zoom call was 1,500 people but Sunday's call saw more than 40,000 attending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the large volume of people posed its own challenges for Zoom. The video communications platform has a 1,000-person capacity. When that limit was reached, members of Ms Eaddy's organisation contacted Zoom which upgraded the group to a webinar format, allowing unlimited attendees. "I am forever grateful to the leadership of Zoom for what they did," Ms Eaddy said.</p>

<p>"What happened last night was historic," Ms Eaddy added. "It really is the culmination of so many Black women for years and years and years that have been working, cultivating and creating for this moment. And last night was also a homage, a work to them and their sacrifice."</p>

<p>Notable speakers included Bernice King, the youngest child of Martin Luther King Jr and 85-year-old Democratic Senator Maxine Waters, the most senior Black woman in the US House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, who had predicted President Joe Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee for the November election, has said the country is not running against a candidate but an unelected managerial class machine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, who had predicted President Joe Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee for the November election, has said the country is not running against a candidate but an unelected managerial class machine.</p>

<p>The Indian-American businessman-turned-politician said on Monday that the speed at which the ruling Democratic Party moved to replace incumbent President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris as a possible candidate for the November 5 polls raises lots of questions.</p>

<p>âWe're not actually running against a candidate here. We're running against a machine. That's a deep understanding of what's going on that requires rejecting some of the things you might otherwise think,â Ramaswamy said in a 15-minute long video posted on various social media platforms.</p>

<p>During the Republican presidential debate last November, Ramaswamy, 38, had predicted that Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee, a claim dismissed as a âconspiracy theory' by much of the mainstream media at that time.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden shocked the nation by announcing that he is backing out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who, as of now, is the only Democratic Party leader in the race.</p>

<p>âIt's not Biden that we were up against at all. His cognitive deficits, and I would argue Kamala Harris's cognitive deficits, they're not a bug to the people who control them. Those cognitive deficits are a feature. It is a wheel of the managerial class crushing the will of everyday citizens, not just in the Republican Party, but even in the Democratic Party,â he said.</p>

<p>He said that the Democrats may not agree with everything that Donald Trump or the Republican Party says today, and that's fine. No two Americans agree on 100 per cent of policies. That's a rarity, Ramaswamy, who in January suspended his Republican presidential campaign and endorsed former president Donald Trump, said.</p>

<p>But you do deserve a president and a party that at least tells you the truth, not just when it's easy, but when it's hard and when it's uncomfortable, he said.</p>

<p>âBeyond just this individual game, whether it's Joe or whether it's Kamala, we got to realise the thing that we're actually solving for is defeating that machine, the rise of that managerial class, bigger than any other individual, it embodies the philosophy of what the modern left is really about,â he said in the video that went viral on social media.</p>

<p>âIt's not about individual agency. It's that collective will. That's what this machine really is about.... That's really what we're running against. That's what we're running to defeat. That's the system we're running to break. That's what the deep state is really about,â Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>âThis is about the unelected managerial, you could call them elites, you could call them bureaucrats, you could call them monarchs, who have no accountability to the people, but whose decisions are actually most impactful on how citizens live their lives,â he said and urged the Democrats to put their best possible nominee for the elections.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy alleged that this is a party and a movement on the Democrat side that has made it its core reason for existence to keep former president Trump out of office. âThey've tried every way to stop him within the legal system and extra-legally as well.â But all their efforts to keep him from the ballot have not just failed but backfired making Trump and the Republican Party more popular, he added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the Paris Olympics is set to be a festival of socialising and intermingling, city authorities are keen for visitors not to encounter any of the capital's notorious furry inhabitants.</p>

<p>Humorously portrayed in the hit animated film "Ratatouille", the French capital's abundant rat population is no joke for the city's residents -- and could be an embarrassment as the Olympics spotlight falls on Paris.</p>

<p>"All of the Olympic sites and celebration areas were analysed (for rats) before the Games," Deputy Mayor Anne-Claire Boux, who has responsibility for public health, told AFP in an interview.</p>

<p>As well as ordering a deep clean to remove any food residues that might tempt the scurriers from their underground lairs, the mayor's rodent specialists also worked to close up exit points from the sewers around the sites.</p>

<p>"Where there were areas with lots of rats we put traps in place ahead of the Games," Boux continued, adding that both mechanical rat traps and chemical solutions were used to reduce troublesome populations.</p>

<p>The park behind the Eiffel Tower, where the beach volleyball is set to take place, and the Louvre gardens, where the Olympic cauldron is set to burn, are popular picnic spots -- and previously rat infested.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, no one should aim to exterminate Paris's rats, and they're useful in maintaining the sewers," she added. "The point is that they should stay in the sewers."</p>

<h3><strong>Spruced up&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Paris vermin, a feature in French literature from "Les Miserables" to "The Phantom of the Opera", are frequently drawn into a contemporary debate about cleanliness in the French capital.</p>

<p>Current mayor Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist who relies on support from the Greens, is regularly accused by her conservative critics of failing to keep the capital free from the scourges of rubbish, rodents and dog excrement.</p>

<p>A viral social media campaign in 2021 called #SaccageParis (#TrashedParis) led to residents posting pictures of overflowing bins, badly maintained street furniture or overgrown green spaces that hurt the city's cultivated reputation for elegance.</p>

<p>The city unveiled a "manifesto for beauty" afterwards in response to the criticism.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Olympics, its boulevards and squares have been thoroughly spruced up, with many historic buildings given a makeover.</p>

<p>Boux stressed that rat problems were first and foremost caused by food being left out on the ground, or from overflowing waste bins, many of which are being changed around Paris to new rat-proof versions.</p>

<p>"The most important thing is that the bins are sealed and closed," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Caricature?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The city's rodent exterminators -- known as the "Smash" team -- have also had an advisory role to the Paris organising committee, suggesting ways to design their sites to keep them clean and orderly.</p>

<p>Responsibility for waste removal and street cleaning will fall to the city's 7,500-strong cleaning and collection teams, whose three-week strike last year led to an estimated 10,000 tonnes of garbage pile up in the streets.</p>

<p>They are set to earn bonuses of up to 1,900 euros for working through the Olympic period, while private contractors are also set to reinforce efforts to keep the city clean.</p>

<p>"I'm not at all worried (about rats)," deputy mayor in charge of waste, Antoine Guillou, told AFP. "On the contrary, the Games will help us show definitively that this idea that you run into lots of rats in Paris is false.</p>

<p>"There are some, we deal with them, but they're not an issue specific to Paris nor on the scale that is sometimes suggested in a caricatural way," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-kamala-harris-draws-on-prosecutorial-skills-against-donald-trump-in-election-bid-6166170" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> on Tuesday said she has earned the support needed to become the Democrat presidential nominee, two days after Joe Biden, who was seeking re-election, announced to bow down.</p>

<p>"When I announced my campaign for President, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination. Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon," she said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vivek-ramaswamys-prediction-on-joe-bidens-re-election-bid-comes-true-6159220" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>, who was seeking a rematch against Republican candidate Donald Trump in the November 5 US elections, announced to step aside on Sunday.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old ended the re-election bid amid mounting pressure over his health concerns and pledged to remain in office until his term ends in January 2025. He has now thrown his support behind 59-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-presidential-campaign-raises-81-million-since-joe-biden-steps-aside-6166065" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a>, the first Black American and first Indian-American to be elected vice president, said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"This election will present a clear choice between two different visions. Donald Trump wants to take our country back to a time before many of us had full freedoms and equal rights. I believe in a future that strengthens our democracy, protects reproductive freedom, and ensures every person has the opportunity to not just get by, but to get ahead," Harris&nbsp;said.</p>

<p>"I fully intend to unite our party, unite our nation, and defeat Donald Trump in November," she added.</p>

<p>An unofficial survey of delegates by the news agency Associated Press showed Kamala Harris with more than 2,500 delegates, well over the 1,976 needed to win a vote in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Democratic party is scheduled to announce the presidential nominee by August 7.</p>

<p>Replacing Biden atop the ticket has also revved up speculation about who might join Harris as a vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p>According to reports, the people being discussed are Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk, in an interview with American conservative commentator Jordan Peterson, alleged that his estranged transgender daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, was "killed" by what he termed the "woke mind virus" after being persuaded into agreeing to gender-affirming care procedures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the interview, Mr Musk referred to gender-reassignment surgery as "child mutilation and sterilisation". The world's richest man claimed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, he was convinced to sign documents for one of his children.</p>

<p>"I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys," Mr Musk stated. "This was really before I had any understanding of what was going on, and we had Covid going on, so there was a lot of confusion and I was told [my child] might commit suicide."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>Mr Musk, who is also the owner of X (formerly Twitter), accused those involved in promoting gender-affirming care of targeting children "who are far below the age of consent."</p>

<p>"I was tricked into doing this," Mr Musk claimed. "I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it 'deadnaming' is because your son is dead."</p>

<p>The experience, Mr Musk claims, has set him on a mission to combat what he describes as the "woke mind virus." He said, "I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that. And we're making some progress."</p>

<p>Vivian Jenna Wilson, Mr Musk's 20-year-old daughter, legally changed her name and gender at the age of 18. This legal transition occurred on June 22 in 2022 at a court in California.</p>

<p>"I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape, or form," Ms Wilson had said back then. Ms Wilson's mother, Justine Wilson, a Canadian author, divorced Mr Musk in 2008.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a kids' role-playing theme park in Seoul, 23-year-old Park Woo-joo is on a very adult mission: the university-educated but unemployed South Korean is searching for his future career.</p>

<p>Part of a Mexican-owned global chain, KidZania typically offers young children the chance to play at dozens of different jobs, from firefighter to dentist, in giant indoor centres, including one in Seoul that receives hundreds of thousands of visitors a year.</p>

<p>But KidZania South Korea has been pioneering a new use for its Seoul venue: helping unemployed young people find their real-life calling, at nostalgia-laced, wildly popular, adults-only events.</p>

<p>Despite labour shortages linked to its super-low birthrate, youth unemployment in South Korea is stubbornly high -- the result, experts say, of a mismatch between the highly educated youth and the realities of the country's labour market.</p>

<p>Park has a degree in business administration but has not been able to find a job he wants, so last month he was one of 500 people who bought a ticket for the sold-out "Kids-ania" event for adults -- the name is a pun in Korean, effectively meaning "Not Kids".&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the sprawling indoor theme park, while people dressed as police officers and Supreme Court judges role-played in purpose-built areas, Park told AFP he was eager to "experience as much as possible".&nbsp;</p>

<p>He's hoping that, by testing out a bunch of potential careers, he might have a "lightbulb" moment and discover what he should be doing with his life.</p>

<p>"I think it's a great way for people who are unemployed to have fun and learn at the same time," he told AFP.</p>

<h2><strong>Nostalgia tour&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The adult events were the brainchild of Kang Jae-hyung, president of KidZania South Korea, who told AFP he wanted to help the young people who might have come to the park when it first opened in 2010.</p>

<p>"The kids who were seven years old when they first came here are now 21," Kang said.</p>

<p>His colleagues were skeptical about the idea and he initially faced internal opposition, he said, but tickets for the first event sold out immediately.</p>

<p>Kang said that many young South Korean adults need to tap into their innate sense of fun, and not take working life too seriously.</p>

<p>"I just want them to remember what they wanted to do when they were young," said Kang, adding that it was important "not to crush children's dreams".</p>

<p>Lee Soo-min, 20, has memories of going to KidZania -- and said the place seemed the same when she returned over a decade later.</p>

<p>"But it seems I've changed," she said.</p>

<p>Standing in line at a radio studio to try her hand at being a DJ, Lee, a university student who said she was trying to figure out what to do with her life, told AFP: "Now, I begin to take these experiences seriously."</p>

<h2><strong>Aspirations vs reality&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>With the world's lowest birthrate, South Korea's population has long been shrinking.</p>

<p>The country's working-age population will begin falling off from 2028, official projections show, and many sectors of the economy, from agriculture to restaurants and care homes, already suffer from widespread labour shortages, with immigration tightly limited.</p>

<p>Even so, the country has persistently high youth unemployment, currently at 6.2 percent, more than double the overall rate of 2.9 percent, official figures show.</p>

<p>The number of young people classified as "resting" -- neither employed nor actively seeking work -- hit 426,000 last month, the second-highest rate since records began in 2003. The highest was during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The problem, experts say, is that young South Koreans would rather not work than work in a job perceived as unpopular or beneath them.</p>

<p>For example, nearly half of young South Koreans are reluctant to join small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), official figures show -- even though such businesses make up some 98 percent of the economy, with high-profile corporations such as Samsung just 2 percent.</p>

<p>This mismatch between the aspirations of highly educated young people and the realities of the labour market "gradually deepens unemployment among highly educated youth," said Hwang Gwang-hoon, an associate research fellow at the Korea Employment Information Service.</p>

<p>South Korea has turned to automation of production lines and even CCTV to ease labour crunches -- with, for example, many convenience stores now unmanned -- but the country also needs to create more "quality jobs", Hwang said, especially in SMEs.</p>

<p>For KidZania's Kang, unemployed young people need to let go of the fears and embarrassments that may be holding them back in the job market.</p>

<p>"Do what you want to do. Don't be self-conscious," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A day after US President Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race, Donald Trump's campaign said it was a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to "defeat not just one Democrat nominee for president, but two in the same year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after US President Joe Biden opted out of the presidential race and endorsed his deputy Kamala Harris, their Republican rival Donald Trump's campaign said it was a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to "defeat not just one Democrat nominee for president, but two in the same year."</p>

<p>In a memorandum issued on Monday as Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her presidential campaign, the Trump Campaign took credit for Biden's decision to drop out of the race and asserted the "'War on Democracy' will be stopped by the man who took a bullet for democracy".</p>

<p>Donald Trump survived an attempt on his life on July 13 when a young gunman fired multiple shots at the former US president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, injuring his right ear.</p>

<p>"After being thoroughly decimated by President Trump three weeks ago at the debate in Atlanta, Joe Biden was fired. He was fired by Donald Trump. He has now been turned out to pasture, yet the Biden record of weakness and failure still stands," stated the memorandum titled "State of the Play Day 1".</p>

<p>It has been authored by Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles from the Trump Campaign.</p>

<p>"Just as Donald Trump fired Joe Biden, he will demonstrate to the world he can fire dangerously liberal Kamala as well. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to defeat not just one Democrat nominee for president, but two in the same year!" Kamala Harris is as bad, if not worse, than Joe Biden, the memorandum alleged.</p>

<p>Claiming that Trump was leading against Harris in various polls, it said, "And where does the race stand? In every public poll conducted, battleground and national, Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris by the same -- if not more -- than Joe Biden." "The latest HarrisX / Forbes poll shows President Trump with a nine-point lead over Kamala. Democrat polling released just today has President Trump over 50 and leading by six in Pennsylvania, over 50 and leading by eight in Arizona, up two in Michigan and up one in Wisconsin," the memorandum stated.</p>

<p>"Let's also not forget, the Biden campaign has spent in excess of USD 150 million, money they can't get back. Same year, same people, same record of failure, same result," it said.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign alleged that the same people weaponize the judicial system to falsely accuse and indict the former president on 40 "manufactured" charges relating to the presidential records - a case that has since been thrown out of court.</p>

<p>It also claimed that Trump's political rivals utilised the FBI to stage a raid on the former president's home and "use the courts as a vehicle to go after the (former) president's lifetime of assets.</p>

<p>"State Courts led by Democrats in Washington put together attempts to deny ballot access in key states -- an attempt defeated and ultimately thrown out by the United States Supreme Court," the memorandum said.</p>

<p>"And if that wasn't bad enough, President Trump survived an assassination attempt," the memorandum alleged. "The liberal elite and deep state, sensing the American public's disgust with their lawfare and now in a desperate Hail Mary, have swapped out an incumbent President for the incumbent Vice President in a ploy to try and shake up the race."</p>

<p>The memorandum claimed that "border Czar Kamala Harris owns the border invasion, which has resulted in nearly 100 terrorists roaming the United States, hundreds of thousands of American dead due to Fentanyl, a child trafficking epidemic resulting in killings and kidnappings, a crime directly linked to Harris' own beliefs and backed by her actions, released migrants who prey and kill innocent Americans." "How do you deal with such heinous beliefs? Aggressively, in detail, and without quarters. The left and deep state have pulled out all the stops in their maniacal attempts to retain power," it said.</p>

<p>"This is a fight for American Independence -- independence from the oppressive weight of the Harris inflation tax, independence from the war against American energy and edicts for all-electric cars, the independence that will once again make the US respected on a world stage, independence from an oppressive government hellbent on taking away parental rights, independence from a border invasion that risks social security, public safety and the rule of law," the memorandum said.</p>

<p>"The restoration of American Independence... starts today. This 'War on Democracy' will be stopped by the man who took a bullet for Democracy," said the Trump Campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The failed assassination bid on former US President Donald Trump is the "most serious" security lapse since the then President Ronald Regan was shot in 1981, the head of the US Secret Service conceded to lawmakers on Monday.</p>

<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle conceded this during her testimony before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee about the attempted assassination of Trump, wherein she was grilled by lawmakers, including two Indian American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and Ro Khanna.</p>

<p>Mr Khanna asked Cheatle to resign as the Director of the US Secret Service.</p>

<p>"If you have an assassination attempt on a president, a former president or a candidate, you need to resign," Mr Khanna said, noting that Stewart Knight, the then secret service head in 1981 had resigned.</p>

<p>"You cannot go leading a Secret Service agency when there is an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate. I would say that about anyone who is running," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to another question from Mr Khanna, Cheatle said: "Yes, sir, I would," when asked: "Now, Director Cheatle, would you agree that this is the most serious security lapse since President Reagan was shot in 1981, of the Secret Service?"</p>

<p>At the same time, she said in response to a question from Congresswoman Virginia Fox: "I have taken accountability, and I will continue to take accountability. I am responsible for leading the agency and I am responsible for finding the answers to how this event occurred and making sure that it doesn't happen again."</p>

<p>Cheatle told Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi that the incident was under investigation.</p>

<p>"According to NBC, just two minutes later, at 5:53 pm, the Secret Service notified its snipers about the gunman. The rally wasn't paused at that point either, correct?" he asked. "No," she said.</p>

<p>She had no answer when Mr Krishnamoorthi asked if the assassin was on the roof and everybody was yelling at him, but the Secret Service took no action.</p>

<p>"We are currently still combing through communications and when communications were passed," she said.</p>

<p>"I can point you to this communication as two minutes before the shots started ringing out. Director Cheatle, yes or no, was there ever a moment where the Secret Service actually considered pausing the rally?" an angry Krishnamoorthi asked.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service would have paused the rally had they known or been told there was an actual threat," she said.</p>

<p>"The people that are in charge of protecting the president on that day would never bring the former president out if there was a threat that had been identified," Cheatle said.</p>

<p>In response to a question from Congressman James Cooper about why the Secret Service didn't place a single agent on the roof, she said: "We are still looking into the advanced process and the decisions that were made."</p>

<p>The building was outside of the perimeter on the day of the visit, she said. "That is one of the things that during the investigation we want to take a look at and determine whether or not other decisions should have been made," she added.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has acknowledged it denied some requests by Trump's campaign for increased security at his events in the years before the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>The attack on Trump was the latest in a series of security lapses by the agency that has drawn investigations and public scrutiny over the years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hindu temple in Canada's Edmonton was defaced with anti-India graffiti on Monday. The BAPS Swaminarayan Temple was targeted early this morning, the Hindu American Foundation said, adding that the slurs used in the grafitti attacked Indian-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya.</p>

<p>The organisation shared a photo of the defacement in a post on X.</p>

<p>"The @chcconline is confirming that the @BAPS temple in Edmonton, Canada became the latest Hindu temple targeted for an attack early this morning. The temple was defaced with slurs threatening @AryaCanada, one of a few Hindu Members of the Canadian House of Commons. We are outraged by this latest incident that mirrors several previous attacksâmany blamed on pro-Khalistan activists," the post read</p>

<p>MP Chandra Arya said that Hindu temples in Canada have increasingly being "vandalised".</p>

<p>"The Hindu temple BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton is vandalised again. During the last few years, Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area, British Columbia, and other places in Canada are being vandalised with hateful graffiti," Arya said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Arya, a Liberal member of Parliament known for his advocacy on multicultural issues, pointed to the impunity enjoyed by "Khalistani extremists" in Canada.</p>

<p>"As I have always been saying, Khalistani extremists seem to get away with ease with their public rhetoric of hate and violence. Again, let me put it on record. Hindu Canadians are legitimately concerned. Like a broken record, I again call on Canadian law enforcement agencies to take this issue seriously before these rhetorics get translated into physical action against Hindu Canadians," he said.</p>

<p>Canadian law enforcement agencies have been urged to take proactive measures to address these threats and ensure the safety and security of all religious communities in Canada.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sharks off the coast of Brazil have cocaine in them and scientists believe the drug may be altering their behaviour. In a study conducted on 13 Brazilian sharpnose sharks from waters near Rio de Janeiro, marine biologists found high levels of cocaine in their muscles and livers.</p>

<p>While it is not known how the sharks have been feeding on the drug, some theories exist. Scientists believe that the cocaine likely came from the drainage of illegal labs that produce drugs or from the excrement of drug users through untreated sewage.</p>

<p>It could also be that the sharks fed on bundles of cocaine that were lost or dumped in the sea by drug smugglers. âWe don't usually see many bales of coke dumped or lost at sea here, unlike in Mexico and Florida,â a scientist told The Telegraph, asserting that it was highly unlikely the sharks had been eating cocaine from dumped packages.</p>

<p>According to scientists, the test results showed âchronic exposure" to cocaine in the sharks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While they estimate that the cocaine was harmful to them, it is not known to what degree the drug could have affected their behaviour or if it made them more aggressive and unpredictable.</p>

<p>âThis may be the case, as cocaine targets the brain, and hyperactive and erratic behaviour has been noted in other animals. It's a possibility and further studies are required,â said Dr Enrico Mendes Saggioro, an ecotoxicologist.</p>

<p>The researchers, who picked the small sharks from the water on fishing near Rio de Janeiro, dissected them and tested their organs. In a worrying finding, they found concentrations of cocaine up to 100 times higher than previously found in other marine animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The results of those tests revealed that every single sample from the sharks tested positive for cocaine, with 92 percent of muscle samples and 23 percent of liver samples also testing positive for one of the drug's main metabolites, benzoylecgonine. This marks the first evidence of cocaine being identified in free-ranging sharks.</p>

<p>While the extent of the damage to the animals from the cocaine is not known, scientists suspect that one way the drug can affect the sharks is by damaging their eyesight, affecting their capacity to hunt.</p>

<p>They may not be going nuts from the cocaine but it could reduce their life expectancy, a scientist said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, building Democratic backing for her sudden presidential run, rallied supporters on Monday with a debut campaign speech vowing to go after Republican nominee Donald Trump like the courtroom prosecutor she once was.</p>

<p>"I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain," Harris told campaign workers 28 hours after President Joe Biden, 81, abandoned the 2024 White House race and endorsed her.</p>

<p>"So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type. In this campaign, I will proudly, I will proudly put my record against his," said Harris, who was attorney general of California and a U.S. senator before serving as Biden's vice president.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign responded to Harris' comments. "Kamala Harris is just as incompetent as Joe Biden and even more liberal," said Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national press secretary. "Not only does Kamala need to defend her support of Joe Biden's failed agenda over the past four years, she also needs to answer for her own terrible weak-on-crime record in California."</p>

<p>Trump is due to be sentenced in September after having been found guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn star. He also faces criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn Biden's 2020 victory. He falsely claims he lost in 2020 because of election fraud.</p>

<p>Biden, who pulled out of the race on Sunday amid questions about his age and health, called into Harris' campaign event. Recovering from COVID-19 at his home in Delaware, he sounded hoarse but appreciative of his vice president.</p>

<p>Biden said he thought he had made the right decision by dropping out. Biden, the oldest person ever to occupy the Oval Office, said on Sunday he would remain in the presidency until his term ends on Jan. 20, 2025.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, outlined a series of policies she promised to pursue including signing laws to protect abortion rights and ban assault rifles and said she would make rebuilding the middle class the focus of her presidency.</p>

<p>Within minutes of receiving Biden's backing on Sunday, Harris began consolidating Democratic support for her presidential bid, securing commitments from hundreds of convention delegates, announcing a massive fundraising haul and earning endorsements from top party figures.</p>

<p>These included former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has remained influential since stepping down as the party's House of Representatives leader in 2022. The AFL-CIO labour union federation, which represents 12.5 million workers, said on Monday it had also endorsed Harris for president.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign aims to secure commitments from a majority of the nearly 4,000 Democratic delegates to next month's Democratic Party convention by Wednesday evening, sources told Reuters, effectively wrapping up the nomination.</p>

<p>Campaign officials and allies have made hundreds of calls urging delegates to nominate Harris for president in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Harris' campaign said it raised $81 million in the 24 hours following Biden's exit, the most for a single day in the 2024 campaign for either party.</p>

<p>Virtually all of the prominent Democrats who had been seen as potential challengers to Harris have declared support for her, including Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky. Whitmer, in a post on X, on Monday said she would serve as co-chair of Harris' campaign.</p>

<p>Biden's departure was the latest shock to a White House race that included his disastrous June 27 debate performance against former President Trump and the July 13 near-assassination of Trump by a gunman during a campaign stop.</p>

<p>Harris lauded Biden for his service to the country. At a White House event to honour college athletes earlier on Monday, she said: "Joe Biden's legacy over the last three years is unmatched in modern history."</p>

<p>Harris will travel on Tuesday to Milwaukee, the largest city in the battleground state of Wisconsin, which last week hosted a Republican National Convention that offered a stark display of Trump's dominance over his party.</p>

<p><strong>NEW GENERATION</strong></p>

<p>Harris, who is Black and Asian American, would fashion an entirely new dynamic with Trump, 78, offering a vivid generational and cultural contrast.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign has been preparing for her possible rise for weeks, sources told Reuters. It sent out a detailed critique of her record on immigration and other issues on Monday, accusing her of being more liberal than Biden.</p>

<p>It alleged that Harris favoured abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and decriminalizing border crossings, backed the so-called Green New Deal, supported the administration's electric vehicle mandates and encouraged "defund the police" efforts.</p>

<p>Some of those were positions Harris adopted as an unsuccessful presidential candidate in the 2020 election when she was running on a more liberal agenda than Biden but were not ones that the administration assumed, particularly with regard to border security and law enforcement issues.</p>

<p>Eric Holder, who was U.S. attorney general in the administration of President Barack Obama, and his law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP will conduct the vetting of Harris' potential running mates, according to two sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Trump, whose false claims that his 2020 loss to Biden was the result of fraud inspired the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, on Monday, questioned Democrats' right to change candidates.</p>

<p>"They stole the race from Biden after he won it in the primaries," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>At a rally for Trump's running mate, JD Vance, on Monday, Ohio state Senator George Lang called for civil war to save the country if Trump didn't win the November election. Lang later said on X that he regretted the remarks. "We should all be mindful of what is said at political events, myself included," he wrote.</p>

<p>Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's foreign policy playbook on such issues as China, Iran and Ukraine, but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she wins the November election.</p>

<p>Some Democrats were concerned about the country's long history of racial and gender discrimination. The U.S. has not elected a woman president in its nearly 250-year history.</p>

<p>Most public opinion polls conducted before Biden dropped out did not find that Harris performed better statistically against Trump than Biden had.</p>

<p>Biden has not been seen in public since testing positive for COVID on Wednesday. He tentatively plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday if he has recovered.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is planning to keep third-party cookies in its Chrome browser, it said on Monday, after years of pledging to phase out the tiny packets of code meant to track users on the internet.</p>

<p>The major reversal follows concerns from advertisers - the company's biggest source of income - saying the loss of cookies in the world's most popular browser will limit their ability to collect information for personalizing ads, making them dependent on Google's user databases.</p>

<p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority had also scrutinized Google's plan over concerns it would impede competition in digital advertising.</p>

<p>"Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they'd be able to adjust that choice at any time," Anthony Chavez, vice president of the Google-backed Privacy Sandbox initiative, said in a blog post.</p>

<p>Since 2019, the Alphabet unit has been working on the Privacy Sandbox initiative aimed at enhancing online privacy while supporting digital businesses, with a key goal being the phase-out of third-party cookies.</p>

<p>Cookies are packets of information that allow websites and advertisers to identify individual web surfers and track their browsing habits, but they can also be used for unwanted surveillance.</p>

<p>In the European Union, the use of cookies is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which stipulates that publishers secure explicit consent from users to store their cookies. Major browsers also give the option to delete cookies on command.</p>

<p>Chavez said Google was working with regulators such as the UK's CMA and Information Commissioner's Office as well as publishers and privacy groups on the new approach, while continuing to invest in the Privacy Sandbox program.</p>

<p>The announcement drew mixed reactions.</p>

<p>"Advertising stakeholders will no longer have to prepare to quit third-party cookies cold turkey," eMarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in a statement.</p>

<p>Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said cookies can lead to consumer harm, for instance predatory ads that target vulnerable groups. "Google's decision to continue allowing third-party cookies, despite other major browsers blocking them for years, is a direct consequence of their advertising-driven business model," Cohen said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has raised USD 81 million in the first 24-hour period since incumbent President Joe Biden stepped aside from the presidential race and endorsed his deputy as the Democratic Party's new nominee.</p>

<p>Biden's decision to nominate Harris (59) follows weeks of intense pressure from fellow Democrats after his disastrous presidential debate performance against his Republican rival and former US President Donald Trump last month.</p>

<p>Kevin Munoz, the spokesperson for Harris' campaign, said, "There is a groundswell behind Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is terrified because he knows his divisive and unpopular agenda can't stand up to the vice president's record and vision for the American people." "Team Harris raised USD 81 million in its first 24 hours, adding to the near quarter-of-a-billion dollar war chest already amassed this election cycle. This haul reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees," a media release said.</p>

<p>Over 8,88,000 grassroots donors made donations in the past 24 hours, 60 per cent of whom made their first contribution of the 2024 cycle, it said, adding, "Team Harris' 24-hour raise is the highest 24-hour raise of any candidate in history." "In the last 24 hours, Team Harris has added 43,000 new recurring donors, with over half of these recurring donors signing up for weekly donations. A call on Sunday evening hosted by Win with Black Women raised approximately USD 1.6 million in grassroots contributions alone. And Harris for President's official social media, @KamalaHQ, doubled its following overnight," the campaign said in a statement.</p>

<p>Reacting to the support for the campaign, Munoz said, "The historic outpour of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections." "Already, we are seeing a broad and diverse coalition come together to support our critical work of talking to the voters that will decide this election," he added.</p>

<p>Though Biden's endorsement almost seals Harris' position as the presidential nominee of her party, she still needs to get elected by the party's delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from August 19-22.</p>

<p>Biden has won 3,896 delegates as against 1,976 required to win the party's presidential nomination.</p>

<p>In a move that would give her access to the campaign funds, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president.</p>

<p>Following Biden's decision, Harris, who has been serving as the US' first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021, immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the party convention.</p>

<p>An "overwhelming majority" of state Democratic Party chairs have announced their support for Vice President Harris as their nominee for president, the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Monday that an Israeli operation in Khan Yunis killed 70 people and wounded more than 200, after the military warned it would "forcefully operate" in the area.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Monday that an Israeli operation in Khan Yunis killed 70 people and wounded more than 200, after the military warned it would "forcefully operate" in the area.</p>

<p>The military warning affected the eastern Khan Yunis sector of the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone in southern Gaza and sent thousands of Palestinians fleeing.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it would act to curb rocket fire in the area. Khan Yunis had already seen heavy fighting earlier this year.</p>

<p>The latest incident comes nine days after the health ministry said 92 people were killed in a strike on Al-Mawasi, when Israel said it was targeting Hamas's commander.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and has launched intense military operations in areas of Gaza that it previously had declared free of the militants.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure to reach a truce and hostage-release deal, was on his way to Washington to address the US Congress.</p>

<p>Netanyahu will meet US President Joe Biden, who has pushed him to agree to a ceasefire, more than nine months into the Gaza war ignited by the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>In late June, Netanyahu had said the war "in its intense phase" was about to end.</p>

<p>- 'Enough!' -</p>

<p>The evacuation order for the Al-Mawasi area came just two months after the military directed Palestinians there for their own safety.</p>

<p>"Due to the Israeli occupation's attacks and massacres in Khan Yunis governorate from the early hours of this morning until now, 70 people have been martyred and more than 200 wounded," the Gaza health ministry said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not offer comment on the toll, when asked by AFP.</p>

<p>But in a statement, the military said its fighter jets and tanks "struck and eliminated terrorists in the area".</p>

<p>It said forces targeted more than "30 terror infrastructure" sites in Khan Yunis. Israeli warplanes also hit a weapons storage facility, observation posts, tunnel shafts and structures used by Hamas militants, it added.</p>

<p>Facing yet another displacement, Palestinians filled the dusty streets of Khan Yunis with cars, motorbikes, donkey-drawn carts, and on foot, carrying what belongings they could.</p>

<p>Hassan Qudayh said his family fled in "panic".</p>

<p>"We were happily making breakfast for our children, as we had been safe for a month, only to be stunned by shells, warning leaflets and martyrs in the streets," he told AFPTV.</p>

<p>"This is the 14th or 15th time we've been displaced.</p>

<p>"Enough! We've been suffering for 10 months."</p>

<p>- 'Tired and fed up' -</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Yussef Abu Taimah from Al-Qarara in Khan Yunis said his family went to the humanitarian zone but found no space.</p>

<p>"Even the sidewalks are full of people and tents. We are tired and fed up. Enough of this displacement and migration".</p>

<p>Months of intermittent talks for the first ceasefire and hostage-prisoner swap since November have yielded little progress.</p>

<p>Netanyahu will meet Biden this week and deliver a landmark speech to Congress on Wednesday, amid unprecedented strains between Israel and its ally the United States.</p>

<p>The Israeli leader has repeatedly resisted pressure from the Biden administration to accept a truce, which far-right members of his coalition opposes.</p>

<p>Biden on Monday vowed to continue working to find a solution during his final months in office, a day after announcing his withdrawal from the US presidential race.</p>

<p>"I'll be working very closely with the Israelis and with the Palestinians" to end the war, achieve peace in the Middle East and return the hostages, he said in a public call into his campaign headquarters.</p>

<p>Netanyahu will hold a separate meeting during his visit with US Vice President Kamala Harris, who looks set to replace Biden atop the Democratic ticket, an aide to Harris told AFP on Monday.</p>

<p>Washington fears a voter backlash over the mounting civilian war toll in Gaza, while protests by anti-government demonstrators and families of hostages in Israel are pressuring Netanyahu at home.</p>

<p>"Never before has the atmosphere been so fraught," said Steven Cook, a Middle East specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>"There is clearly tension in the relationship, especially between the White House and the Israeli prime minister," Cook said in a commentary.</p>

<p>The visit comes with the Gaza war again fuelling regional violence.</p>

<p>Israel on Saturday attacked Yemen for the first time, in retaliation for a deadly drone strike on Tel Aviv by the Iran-backed Huthi rebels.</p>

<p>There were also further exchanges of fire between Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and the Israeli military at the weekend, as tensions remained high along the border.</p>

<p>An Israeli delegation will travel to Doha on Thursday to discuss new demands for a Gaza truce and hostage-prisoner exchange, a source with knowledge of the talks said.</p>

<p>Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been working to secure a deal between Israel and Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday compared her election rival Donald Trump to "predators" and "cheaters," as she attacked the first former US leader to be convicted of a crime.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris launched her election campaign Monday with a blistering personal attack on Donald Trump and vowed to win in November despite the "rollercoaster" of President Joe Biden's shock exit.</p>

<p>As she closed in on the Democratic party's nomination with the support of a slew of heavyweights and massive voter donations, Harris lashed out at Trump in her first speech to campaign workers since Biden's announcement Sunday.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, meanwhile made his first public remarks for nearly a week as he recovers from a bout of Covid.</p>

<p>He called in to the campaign meeting to say that dropping out -- after mounting party and voter concerns over his health and mental acuity -- had been the "right thing to do" and he praised Harris as "the best."</p>

<p>"We are going to win in November," a smiling Harris told campaign workers in her fiery speech at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

<p>She said she had gone to the Wilmington office to address them personally after the "rollercoaster" of the last few days.</p>

<p>Turning her fire on Trump, Harris referred to her past role as California's chief prosecutor, saying she "took on perpetrators of all kinds."</p>

<p>"Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type," she said to applause.</p>

<p>Harris also pledged to focus on the politically explosive issue of abortion, after Trump praised the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn the long-held federal right to the procedure.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Limitless optimism' -</strong></p>

<p>Biden dropped out on Sunday and endorsed Harris after three weeks of intensifying pressure, triggered by a disastrous debate performance against Trump.</p>

<p>Aiming to become the first woman president in US history, the 59-year-old Harris won the backing of a seemingly unassailable number of Democrats, most notably powerful former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>Pelosi's was the biggest yet as the influential 84-year-old said she endorsed Harris "with immense pride and limitless optimism"</p>

<p>Donors have also rallied, pouring a record $81 million into Harris's campaign in 24 hours after Biden stood aside.</p>

<p>The campaign claimed the $81 million haul since Sunday was the largest one-day haul in presidential history -- and that, among the 888,000 grassroots donors, some 60 percent were making their first 2024 contribution.</p>

<p>In his comments, Biden's voice sounded husky as he explained his decision to step aside from the race and pledged that he would keep working on key topics, including ending the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Addressing Harris, he added: "I'm watching you kid. I love you."</p>

<p>In a strikingly symbolic moment on Monday morning, Harris hosted a ceremony for college athletes at the White House on Monday while Biden remained stuck in isolation with Covid at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history," Harris said in her brief remarks on the White House South Lawn, as a light rain fell.</p>

<p>Biden's symptoms "have almost resolved completely," his doctor said Monday, though the White House has not yet announced any events on his schedule this week.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Threat to democracy' -</strong></p>

<p>Biden's stunning withdrawal has completely upended the 2024 race, transforming a long slog between two unpopular elderly men into one of the most compelling in modern US history.</p>

<p>The move has jolted a demoralized party that Harris could now unify, and could give America its first female president.</p>

<p>It has also hit Republicans hard, with former president Trump, 78 -- now the oldest presidential nominee in US history -- having to completely retool a strategy that had been built around attacking Biden over his age and physical frailty.</p>

<p>Harris's entry not only flips the age issue, but puts Trump -- a convicted felon also found liable of sexual assault -- up against a woman and former prosecutor.</p>

<p>And Trump has seemingly found it hard to move on from Biden.</p>

<p>He launched a series of invective-filled social media posts after Biden quit, mocking the president's age and saying he and Harris posed a "threat to democracy."</p>

<p>Trump's running mate J.D. Vance echoed that line of attack at a rally in Ohio Monday, telling supporters that Harris had the momentum because "elite Democrats got in a smoke-filled room and decided to throw Joe Biden overboard."</p>

<p>"That is not how it works. That is a threat to democracy," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I want to say to the team, embrace her. She's the best," Biden, phoning in from his beach home, told staff at his campaign headquarters, which has transitioned to supporting Harris.</p>

<p>"I know yesterday's news is surprising and it's hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do," he said of his decision to drop out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris has quickly risen as the Democratic Party's likely presidential candidate since Joe Biden dropped out of the race Sunday and endorsed her, buoyed by support from other leading party figures as well.</p>

<p>However, the question remains, who will be her running mate?</p>

<p>Choosing one is a delicate matter, with several factors that need to be considered, whether it's winning key states, picking up votes in rural areas, appealing to moderates or considering different demographics.</p>

<p>The selection process, usually conducted over the course of several months, will move at a quickened pace this time so the ticket can be finalized at the Democratic National Convention, which begins on August 19 in Chicago.</p>

<p><strong>- Josh Shapiro -</strong></p>

<p>One of the top potential choices is Josh Shapiro, the 51-year-old governor of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Adding him to the ticket would make a strong play for his state's crucial electoral college votes, as Pennsylvania is one of the most important swing states this election.</p>

<p>Shapiro, an effective orator and assertive political centrist, was elected governor in 2022 when he faced off against a far-right candidate backed by Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Shapiro previously served as Pennsylvania's attorney general, a role in which he denounced sexual misconduct by Catholic priests against thousands of children and sued Purdue Laboratories, the manufacturer of the highly addictive opioid OxyContin.</p>

<p><strong>- Mark Kelly -</strong></p>

<p>Mark Kelly, a 60-year-old former astronaut and US Navy captain, has been a senator for Arizona since 2020.</p>

<p>He represents another swing state that Biden narrowly won over Trump in 2020; the margin between them was the slimmest anywhere in the country. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelly's Senate campaign was particularly notable because of his efforts to promote gun control. His wife, former Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, almost died in 2011 when she was shot in the head at close range while meeting with constituents in Tucson.</p>

<p><strong>- Andy Beshear -</strong></p>

<p>Andy Beshear,&nbsp; the 46-year-old Kentucky governor, won reelection last November, campaigning on abortion rights against a candidate backed by Trump.</p>

<p>Beshear could bring votes from his state, located on the edge of the Rust Belt -- a large part of the United States marked by decline in steel and other industries -- which could form a balance with affluent California, Harris's home state.</p>

<p>When asked on MSNBC on Monday morning about the possibility of being considered for vice president, Beshear simply replied: "If somebody calls you on that, what you do is at least listen."</p>

<p>Beshear also took aim at Trump's vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, who was elected as senator from the neighboring state of Ohio but has grandparents from Kentucky.</p>

<p><strong>- Roy Cooper -</strong></p>

<p>Roy Cooper, the 67-year-old governor of North Carolina, is another leader from a mixed, so called purple state, this one won by Trump by just one percentage point in 2020.</p>

<p>Cooper was first elected in 1986 and he has never lost an election since. A moderate Democrat, picking him could convince centrist voters to lean left.</p>

<p>One of his key issues is the protection of abortion rights, a major issue this election taking place two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed federal abortion protections.</p>

<p>Cooper was interviewed Monday morning on MSNBC, where he declined to comment about the prospect of being Harris's running mate, instead calling for people to focus on her, whom he strongly supports.</p>

<p><strong>- Other possibilities -</strong></p>

<p>Some other people being mentioned as possible vice presidential candidates include Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.</p>

<p>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who for a time sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, is also on the list, as is Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, the state's first Black senator.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

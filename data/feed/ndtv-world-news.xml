       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said late Friday he had agreed with Fox News to debate Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4.</p>

<p>"I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, but it was not immediately clear if Harris had agreed to the debate.</p>

<p>Trump's post came hours after Harris secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination as party standard bearer in November's election.</p>

<p>Trump's White House bid was turned upside down on July 21 when President Biden, 81, facing growing concerns about his age and lagging polling numbers, withdrew his candidacy and backed Harris.</p>

<p>Biden bowed out following a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June on CNN.</p>

<p>A second Trump-Biden televised debate had been scheduled for September 10 on ABC television.</p>

<p>That was expected to remain in place, with Harris replacing Biden, but Trump's spokesman Steven Cheung last week said it was "inappropriate" to schedule it before Harris was formally the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>In his post Trump gave details of the debate venue and the moderators, saying it it would be held before a full audience.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the US Presidential election in its last stretch, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are leaving no stone turned to win voters. While Harris has been trying to play on her prosecutor past and how she will indict the ex president for crimes he's being tried for, Trump has questioned the Vice-President's racial identity.</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has launched a racially insensitive attack on Kamala Harris by questioning whether she is "Indian or Black".</p>

<p>“I've known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage," Trump said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black," he added.</p>

<p>Despite the remarks snowballing into a massive controversy, the 78-year-old doubled down and shared a picture on social media which shows Kamala Harris' "Indian heritage".</p>

<p>"Thank you Kamala for the nice picture you sent from many years ago! Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian Heritage are very much appreciated," Trump said while sharing the photo on Truth Social.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="truthsocial-embed" src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112887108527191005/embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600"></iframe><script src="https://truthsocial.com/embed.js" async="async"></script></p>

<p>Trump has a history of attacking his opponents based on race. He falsely accused Barack Obama, the country's first black president, of not being born in the US.</p>

<p>Trump attacked the former UN ambassador and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley by falsely claiming she could not be president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born.</p>

<p>And now, Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was Indian and her father, Donald Jasper Harris, is Jamaican; both immigrated to the US.</p>

<p>She is seeking to become the first Black woman and Asian-American president in US history and her entry into the 2024 contest has seen a surge of enthusiasm for her candidacy among Black voters and young people — groups with which Trump has sought to broaden his appeal.</p>

<p>Trump's controversial remarks come as the race for the November 5 presidential election gained momentum with opinion polls showing that Vice President Harris, abruptly thrust into the role of presidential candidate fewer than 10 days ago, has narrowed the gap with her Republican rival.</p>

<p>Harris condemned Trump's comments later Wednesday as “the same old show” of "divisiveness" and "disrespect".</p>

<p>"Let me just say: The American people deserve better. The American people deserve better than that," Harris said during a speech to a historically Black sorority convention in Houston.</p>

<p>A July Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released Tuesday showed Harris erased the lead Trump enjoyed in seven states likely to determine the election, leading the former president 48% to 47% — a statistical tie. The survey also showed that across those states, Harris enjoyed the support of 75% of Black voters, compared to 19% for Trump.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Their parents were posing as an Argentine couple in Slovenia and were later convicted of spying. The two children accompanied them to Moscow on Thursday from Turkey]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Much like the script of a film, young Sofia and Daniel had no clue about their parents being undercover Russian spies pretending to be Argentine expats in Slovenia. The children were able to discover their nationality only when they were flown to Moscow, the Kremlin said. The parents -- Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva -- were among the 24 prisoners who were released as part of the landmark prisoner swap deal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva were posing as an Argentine couple in Slovenia and were later convicted of spying. Their two children -- Sofia, 11, and Daniel, 8 -- accompanied them to Moscow on Thursday from Turkey, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/02/europe/russian-spies-children-prisoner-swap-intl/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the children “found out that they were Russian only when the plane took off from Ankara”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Interestingly, as soon as they landed in Moscow they were greeted by Russian President Vladimir Putin on the tarmac in Spanish since they did not speak Russian. They also were unaware of who Putin was, Peskov noted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“When the children came down the plane's steps – they don't speak Russian – and Putin greeted them in Spanish, he said ‘Buenas noches',” Peskov said.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He added that later on the children asked their parents who had greeted them as they didn't even know who Putin was.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the family came down from the aircraft's stairs, Anna, while holding her tears, hugged the Russian President, who stood on the red carpet rolled on the tarmac holding bouquets of flowers.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Putin greeted her with a kiss on the cheek and shoulder, and even gave her and her daughter bouquets.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Further, he greeted the rest of the released Russians and later on they walked together on the red carpet away from the plane.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The historic swap came as a result of years of behind-the-scenes negotiations that involved the US, Russia, Belarus and Germany. This ultimately led Berlin to agree to Moscow's key demand – release convicted Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As per reports, a total of eight people, including Krasikov, have been sent back to Russia in exchange for 16 people, who were in detention in Russia, including former US Marine Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, and two other Americans.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Wednesday, both Dultsev and Dultseva had pleaded guilty to espionage at a Ljubljana court. They were sentenced to serve time in prison.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dultsev, who lived undercover in Slovenia, was posing as an IT businessman named Ludvig Gisch. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to over a year and a half in prison.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dultseva, on the other hand, was posing as an art dealer and gallery owner named Maria Rosa Mayer Munos. Both of them were set to be deported.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tensions have escalated in the Middle East after Iran and the groups it supports vowed revenge for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.</p>

<p>Israel killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut on Tuesday, a move it said was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Hours later, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in the Iranian capital, while Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur died in a strike in Lebanon in quick succession last month.</p>

<p>The killings of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders are the latest of several major incidents that have inflamed regional tensions during the Gaza war which has drawn in Iran-backed groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>This escalation has prompted India and several other countries to tread with caution in the region.</p>

<p>Indian nationals in Israel have been asked to stay vigilant and adhere to the safety protocols following the escalating tension in the region.</p>

<p>The advisory for the Indian citizens in Israel comes a day after the Indian Embassy in Beirut strongly advised Indian nationals against travelling to Lebanon till further notice. It also advised them to leave Lebanon.</p>

<p>Air India yesterday also suspended its flights to and from Israel's Tel Aviv with immediate effect till August 8.</p>

<p></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said late Thursday he was "very concerned" about rising tensions in the region, adding that the killing of Haniyeh had "not helped" the situation.</p>

<p>Sources close to Hezbollah said that Iranian officials met in Tehran on Wednesday with representatives of the so-called "axis of resistance", a loose alliance of Tehran-backed groups hostile to Israel, to discuss their next steps.</p>

<p>"Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Israel, which said Shukr's assassination was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights, warned its adversaries they would "pay a very high price" for any "aggression".</p>

<p>"Israel is at a very high level of preparation for any scenario, both defensive and offensive," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's elite intelligence agency Mossad enlisted Iranian security agents to plant explosives in a building in Tehran where armed Palestinian group Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was staying, The Telegraph reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's elite intelligence agency Mossad enlisted Iranian security agents to plant explosives in a building in Tehran where armed Palestinian group Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was staying, The Telegraph <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/02/mossad-hired-iranian-agents-to-plant-bombs-haniyeh-rooms/">reported</a>.</p>

<p>The initial plan was to assassinate Haniyeh in May during his visit to Tehran for the funeral of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. The operation was aborted due to overwhelming crowds, which posed a major risk of failure, according to two Iranian officials who spoke to The Telegraph.</p>

<p>Therefore, the operation had to be modified. Two agents, working under Mossad's direction, placed explosive devices in three separate rooms of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) guesthouse in northern Tehran. This location was strategically chosen as it was likely that Haniyeh would stay there.</p>

<h3><strong>How Mossad Functions&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>With a $3 billion annual budget and 7,000-strong staff, Mossad is the second-largest espionage agency in the West after the CIA.</p>

<p>Mossad has several departments, but the details of its internal structure are mostly hidden. It not only has a network of informants and agents inside Palestinian militant groups, but also in hostile countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. The intelligence agency's vast spy network provides them with intimate knowledge of militant leaders' movements, enabling them to execute precise assassinations as and when necessitated.</p>

<p><strong>Explained </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-palestine-mossad-gaza-hamas-attackexplained-how-mossad-functions-and-how-it-failed-to-stop-hamas-attack-4463289">How Mossad Functions And Why It Failed To Stop Hamas Attack</a></p>

<p>The Special Operations Division, also known as Metsada, carries out highly sensitive assassinations, sabotage, paramilitary, and psychological warfare operations.</p>

<h3><strong>Operation To Eliminate Haniyeh</strong></h3>

<p>According to The Telegraph, surveillance footage, held by Iranian officials, shows the agents moving stealthily, entering and exiting multiple rooms within minutes. After planting the devices, they exited Iran undetected but maintained a source within the country. In the early hours of Wednesday, at 2 am, the operatives remotely detonated the explosives in the room where Haniyeh was staying.</p>

<p>The explosion resulted in the death of Haniyeh, who was in Tehran to attend the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian. This assassination has been confirmed by officials within the IRGC, who now believe Mossad employed agents from the Ansar-al-Mahdi protection unit, a group responsible for safeguarding high-ranking officials inside and outside the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a humiliation for Iran and a huge security breach," an IRGC official told The Telegraph. A special working group has been established to devise strategies to mitigate the perception of this breach, the official added.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Ramifications</strong></p>

<p>In response to this breach, the IRGC is considering its options for retaliation. A direct strike on Tel Aviv, potentially involving Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies, is reportedly a primary option under evaluation.</p>

<p>Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 that upended Iran's political and societal structure, the country has made a conscious effort to fan its influence across the Middle East with proxy groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explained</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis Of Resistance And Iran's Proxy Network Across Middle East</a></p>

<p>The Quds Force, one of the five branches of the IRGC, which specialises in intelligence and covert operations, serves as the main point of contact for these proxy groups, providing them with weapons and training to solidify Iran's regional agenda.</p>

<p>The timing of the assassination, coinciding with President Pezeshkian's first day in office, has sparked suspicions about its intentionality. During his campaign, President Pezeshkian had pledged to move away from the Islamic Republic's provocative policies and to restore Iran's standing through dialogue.</p>

<p>President Pezeshkian, a seasoned lawmaker and cardiac surgeon, has<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/masoud-pezeshkian-iran-has-a-new-reformist-president-what-it-would-mean-for-india-6045285"> long supported both domestic and international reforms in Iran</a>. His win in the recent elections is viewed as a call for change since it follows a general unhappiness with the hardline policies of his predecessors. But the dynamics of Iranian politics, where hardliners still control the majority and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains ultimate authority, will put Mr Pezeshkian's ability to carry out his vision to the test.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[OpenAI recently announced that it anticipates "superintelligence" - AI surpassing human abilities - this decade. It is accordingly building a new team, and devoting 20% computing resources to ensurw such AI systems are aligned with human values.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New scientific understanding and engineering techniques have always impressed and frightened. No doubt they will continue to. OpenAI recently announced that <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-48585-000">it anticipates “superintelligence”</a> – AI surpassing human abilities – this decade. It is accordingly <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/">building a new team</a>, and devoting 20% of its computing resources to ensuring that the behaviour of such AI systems will be aligned with human values.</p>

<p>It seems they don't want rogue artificial superintelligences waging war on humanity, as in James Cameron's 1984 science fiction thriller, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">The Terminator</a> (ominously, Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator is sent back in time from 2029). OpenAI is calling for top machine-learning researchers and engineers to help them tackle the problem.</p>

<p>But might philosophers have something to contribute? More generally, what can be expected of the age-old discipline in the new technologically advanced era that is now emerging?</p>

<p>To begin to answer this, it is worth stressing that philosophy has been instrumental to AI since its inception. One of the first AI success stories was a 1956 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154193120605000904">computer program</a>, dubbed the the Logic Theorist, created by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Its job was to prove theorems using propositions from Principia Mathematica, a 1910 a three-volume work by the philosophers Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, aiming to reconstruct all of mathematics on one logical foundation.</p>

<p>Indeed, the <a href="http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/mcc59/mcc59.pdf">early focus on logic in AI</a> owed a great deal to the foundational debates pursued by mathematicians and philosophers.</p>

<p>One significant step was the German philosopher Gottlob Frege's development of modern logic in the late 19th century. Frege introduced the use of quantifiable variables – rather than objects such as people – into logic. His approach made it possible to say not only, for example, “Joe Biden is president” but also to systematically express such general thoughts as that “there exists an X such that X is president”, where “there exists” is a quantifier, and “X” is a variable.</p>

<p>Other important contributors in the 1930s were the Austrian-born logician Kurt Gödel, whose theorems of completeness and incompleteness are about the limits of what one can prove, and Polish logician Alfred Tarski's “proof of the indefinability of truth”. The latter showed that “truth” in any standard formal system cannot be defined within that particular system, so that arithmetical truth, for example, cannot be defined within the system of arithmetic.</p>

<p>Finally, the 1936 abstract notion of a computing machine by the British pioneer Alan Turing drew on such development and had a huge impact on early AI.</p>

<p>It might be said, however, that even if such <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/HAUAIT">good old fashioned</a> symbolic AI was indebted to high-level philosophy and logic, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262043045/the-promise-of-artificial-intelligence/">the “second-wave” AI</a>, based on deep learning, derives more from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Data_Happened">concrete engineering feats</a> associated with processing vast quantities of data.</p>

<p>Still, philosophy has played a role here too. Take large language models, such as the one that powers ChatGPT, which produces conversational text. They are enormous models, with billions or even trillions of parameters, trained on vast datasets (typically comprising much of the internet). But at their heart, they track – and exploit – statistical patterns of language use. Something very much like this idea <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12073.Philosophical_Investigations">was articulated</a> by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in the middle of the 20th century: “the meaning of a word”, he said, “is its use in the language”.</p>

<p>But contemporary philosophy, and not just its history, is relevant to AI and its development. Could an LLM truly understand the language it processes? Might it achieve consciousness? These are deeply philosophical questions.</p>

<p>Science has so far been unable to fully explain how consciousness arises from the cells in the human brain. Some philosophers even believe that this is such a “hard problem” that is <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-mystery-of-consciousness-shows-there-may-be-a-limit-to-what-science-alone-can-achieve-225034">beyond the scope of science</a>, and may require a helping hand of philosophy.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, we can ask whether an image generating AI could be truly creative. Margaret Boden, a British cognitive scientist and philosopher of AI, argues that while AI will be able to produce new ideas, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370298000551">it will struggle to evaluate them</a> as creative people do.</p>

<p>She <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ai-9780198777984?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">also anticipates</a> that only a hybrid (neural-symbolic) architecture – one that uses both the logical techniques and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">deep learning</a> from data – will achieve artificial general intelligence.</p>

<h2>Human values</h2>

<p>To return to OpenAI's announcement, when prompted with our question about the role of philosophy in the age of AI, ChatGPT suggested to us that (amongst other things) it “helps ensure that the development and use of AI are aligned with human values”.</p>

<p>In this spirit, perhaps we can be allowed to propose that, if AI alignment is the serious issue that OpenAI believes it to be, it is not just a technical problem to be solved by engineers or tech companies, but also a social one. That will require input from philosophers, but also social scientists, lawyers, policymakers, citizen users and others.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people are worried about the <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Why+AI+Undermines+Democracy+and+What+To+Do+About+It-p-9781509560929">rising power and influence</a> of tech companies and their impact on democracy. Some argue we need a whole new way of thinking about AI – taking into account the underlying systems supporting the industry. The British barrister and author Jamie Susskind, for example, has argued it is time to build a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/19/the-digital-republic-by-jamie-susskind-review-why-the-west-was-no-match-for-the-tech-giants">digital republic</a>” – one which ultimately rejects the very political and economic system that has given tech companies so much influence.</p>

<p>Finally, let us briefly ask, how will AI affect philosophy? Formal logic in philosophy actually dates to Aristotle's work in antiquity. In the 17th century. the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz suggested that we may one day have a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93779-3_4">“calculus ratiocinator”</a> – a calculating machine that would help us to derive answers to philosophical and scientific questions in a quasi-oracular fashion.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are now beginning to realise that vision, with some authors advocating a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02950-3">“computational philosophy”</a> that literally encodes assumptions and derives consequences from them. This ultimately allows factual and/or value-oriented assessments of the outcomes.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://polygraphs.sites.northeastern.edu/">the PolyGraphs project</a> simulates the effects of information sharing on social media. This can then be used to computationally address questions about how we ought to form our opinions.</p>

<p>Certainly, progress in AI has given philosophers plenty to think about; it may even have begun to provide some answers.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos's net worth shrank by $15.2 billion Friday, leading a wide-ranging slump that erased $134 billion from the fortunes of the 500 richest people in the world.</p>

<p>Shares of Amazon.com Inc. slid 8.8% amid a broader selloff in the market, dropping Bezos' net worth to $191.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The one-day wipeout is his third-worst, trailing only April 4, 2019, when the Amazon co-founder's wealth tumbled $36 billion following his divorce settlement, and April 29, 2022, when Amazon shares plunged 14%.</p>

<p>The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 2.4%, dragging down the fortunes of other tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison, whose net worths were pared $6.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. Uncertainty over possible Federal Reserve rate cuts, as well as some high-profile earnings disappointments, have helped plunge the tech-heavy index into correction territory, wiping out more than $2 trillion in value in just over three weeks.</p>

<p>Investors have also become jittery over fears that this year's AI-fueled gains are overdone or the market is too concentrated. The decline in Amazon shares - the biggest drop since April 2022 - came after the company said on an earnings call that it planned to continue spending big on AI even at the expense of short-term profits.</p>

<p>Technology billionaires Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin and Larry Page also each lost more than $3 billion Friday as shares of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet fell in New York trading. Tech tycoons in total saw $68 billion carved from their fortunes, according to Bloomberg's wealth index.</p>

<p>Bezos, 60, the world's second-richest person, has been steadily offloading Amazon shares this year. He sold stock worth about $8.5 billion over nine trading days in February. And on a day last month when Amazon hit a fresh record, he disclosed a plan to sell 25 million additional shares worth $5 billion.</p>

<p>The additional sales would bring his total this year to roughly $13.5 billion, according to Bloomberg's calculations. He would still hold almost 912 million shares, or about 8.8% of Amazon, once those sales are complete.</p>

<p>His wealth also derives from space-exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from the partial collapse of a residential building in the Russian city of Nizhny Tagil has risen to 10, said the Ministry of Emergency Situations.</p>

<p>The Ministry said on Friday that rescuers have found 10 bodies and 15 people have been rescued from under the rubble, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Five people are reportedly in critical condition at a hospital.</p>

<p>Local authorities have declared August 3 as a mourning day for the victims of the tragedy.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry, search and rescue operations are ongoing.</p>

<p>The tragedy occurred on Thursday when two entrances of a five-storey gas-powered building in Nizhny Tagil, a city located in Russia's Sverdlovsk Oblast, caved in due to an explosion of a gas-air mixture, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rioting erupted Friday evening in Sunderland, northeast England, where police said officers faced "serious and sustained levels of violence", the latest unrest linked to a mass stabbing earlier this week that killed three young girls.</p>

<p>Eight people were arrested and three officers required hospital treatment following hours of "utterly deplorable" disturbances, Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Helena Barron said.</p>

<p>Two officers remained in hospital early Saturday, she added.</p>

<p>Footage broadcast by the BBC showed a mob of several hundred rampaging in Sunderland's city centre, attacking police and setting fire to at least one car and a building next to a police office.</p>

<p>Other images shared on social media showed balaclava-clad youths throwing bricks and other missiles as fireworks and flares were let off.</p>

<p>"The shocking scenes we have witnessed in Sunderland this evening are completely unacceptable," Barron said, adding the "disorder, violence and damage" seen "will not be tolerated".</p>

<p>"A full investigation is now under way to identify anyone else responsible" in addition to the eight people arrested, she added.</p>

<p>The disorder came as police nationwide prepared for planned far-right rallies and other demonstrations this weekend, after two nights of unrest in several English towns and cities in the wake of Monday's knife attack.</p>

<p>London's Metropolitan Police said it had a "proportionate and risk-based" plan for rival pro-Palestinian and anti-immigration protests Saturday. Its officers arrested 111 people as a rally in Westminster turned violent late Wednesday.</p>

<p>But Friday night's disturbances in Sunderland, after a calm night nationwide Thursday, were an ominous sign for the coming days.</p>

<p>'Deeply anxious'</p>

<p>Responding to events there, interior minister Yvette Cooper vowed rioters will "pay the price for their violence and thuggery". She gave police "the full backing of government to take the strongest possible action and ensure they face the full force of the law".</p>

<p>"They do not represent Britain," Cooper said.</p>

<p>Earlier, Merseyside Police said extra officers had been deployed in and around Liverpool city centre "to help prevent disorder or criminality" there. Despite a minor skirmish near a mosque, the evening passed off peacefully.</p>

<p>Liverpool lies close to the seaside town of Southport where Monday's knife attack occurred.</p>

<p>Far-right elements have been blamed for the disturbances in the aftermath of the stabbing spree targeting children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.</p>

<p>Officials have said online disinformation about the British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana helped fuel the unrest.</p>

<p>He faces murder and attempted murder charges over the stabbing rampage that also left five children and two adults critically wounded.</p>

<p>Police have said the case is not being treated as terror-related but have not revealed a motive.</p>

<p>Anger over the tragedy has fused with growing anti-immigration sentiment on the right of English politics, pushed by openly Islamophobic far-right figures.</p>

<p>After violence in Southport late Tuesday, unrest rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later.</p>

<p>In Southport, the mob targeted a mosque, prompting hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security amid fears of more anti-Islamic demonstrators.</p>

<p>Faith leaders say mosques have been hiring paid security staff and checking their CCTV cameras are working.</p>

<p>"The Muslim community is deeply anxious right now," Zara Mohammed, secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, told AFP.</p>

<p>'Sow hatred'</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts will "face the full force of the law".</p>

<p>In power for less than a month, Starmer met Friday with local leaders in Southport to discuss "a package of support for the local community", his Downing Street office said.</p>

<p>Starmer's visit came the day after he announced a new "national capability" to tackle disorder in the wake of the recent disturbances.</p>

<p>The new measures will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.</p>

<p>The police alert for the weekend comes after far-right social media channels advertised "enough is enough" anti-immigrant rallies, and anti-facism groups vowed to stage counter-protests.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough" has emerged as a rallying online slogan for the far-right and others following Monday's attack.</p>

<p>South Yorkshire police said Friday they knew of a planned protest in the town of Rotherham, while officers in south Wales said they were preparing for events being planned for Saturday in Cardiff.</p>

<p>Police in Northern Ireland noted social media posts calling for roadblocks "using women and children", as well as a march to an Islamic centre in Belfast on Saturday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran and its regional allies vowed retaliation for the deaths of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, raising regional tensions as mourners filled Tehran's city centre calling for revenge.<br />
<br />
A public funeral was held for Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital where he was killed early Wednesday in an attack on which Israel has not commented.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's body was then flown to Qatar, where he had resided and where he will be laid to rest on Friday, when his group called for a "day of furious rage" in the Palestinian territories and across the region.</p>

<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, addressing the funeral of the Lebanese group's top military commander, said Israel and "those who are behind it must await our inevitable response" to Fuad Shukr's and Haniyeh's killings within hours of each other.</p>

<p>"You do not know what red lines you crossed," Nasrallah said, addressing Israel, a day after Shukr was killed in a strike in south Beirut.</p>

<p>Israel, which said Shukr's assassination was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights, warned its adversaries on Thursday they would "pay a very high price" for any "aggression".</p>

<p>"Israel is at a very high level of preparation for any scenario, both defensive and offensive," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Those who attack us, we will attack in return."</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah told AFP that Iranian officials met in Tehran on Wednesday with representatives of the so-called "axis of resistance", a loose alliance of Tehran-backed groups hostile to Israel, to discuss their next steps.</p>

<p>"Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>The leader of Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels vowed a "military response" to Israel's "major escalation".</p>

<p>Analysts told AFP that the retaliation would be measured to avoid a wider conflagration.</p>

<p>Iran and the groups it backs "will more than likely try to avert a war, while also strongly deterring Israel from continuing with this new policy, this targeted shock and awe," said Amal Saad, a Hezbollah researcher and lecturer at Britain's Cardiff University.</p>

<p>In Tehran, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Roaring marches' -</strong></p>

<p>Crowds, including women shrouded in black, carried posters of Haniyeh and Palestinian flags in a procession and ceremony that began at Tehran University, an AFP correspondent reported.</p>

<p>Senior Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and Revolutionary Guards chief General Hossein Salami, attended the ceremony, state television images showed.</p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards announced the day before that Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in a pre-dawn strike Wednesday on their accommodation in Tehran.</p>

<p>The New York Times however reported, citing anonymous sources including two Iranian officials, that the blast was caused by an explosive device planted several months ago.</p>

<p>When asked about the report, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters "there was no other Israeli aerial attack... in all the Middle East" on the night of Shukr's killing.</p>

<p>Qatar-based Haniyeh had been visiting Tehran for Pezeshkian's swearing-in on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said Iran "will continue to support with firmer determination the axis of resistance", the official IRNA news agency said.</p>

<p>Qatar-based network Al Jazeera reported that the plane carrying Haniyeh's body had landed in Doha, where the Palestinian leader is to be buried following prayers at the Qatari capital's largest mosque.</p>

<p>Hamas called in a statement for a day of protests on Friday.</p>

<p>"Let roaring anger marches start from every mosque," it said.</p>

<p><strong>- Regional tensions -</strong></p>

<p>The international community has called for calm and a focus on securing a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip -- which Haniyeh had accused Israel of obstructing.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said late Thursday he was "very concerned" about rising tensions in the region, adding that the killing of Haniyeh had "not helped" the situation.</p>

<p>The White House said Biden spoke with Netanyahu by phone on Thursday, promising to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran".</p>

<p>"We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it and they should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call.</p>

<p>The prime minister of key ceasefire broker Qatar said Haniyeh's assassination had thrown the whole Gaza war mediation process into doubt.</p>

<p>"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on social media site X.</p>

<p>The killings are the latest of several major incidents that have inflamed regional tensions during the Gaza war which has drawn in Iran-backed militant groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 31-year-old Indian national was rushed to a hospital in Vietnam's capital Hanoi after experiencing severe abdominal pain due to a live eel he had inserted into his anus, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://vietnamnews.vn/society/1660152/expat-put-live-eel-into-anus-gets-colon-punctured.html">a report said</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 27, The man <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/world-news/live-2-foot-eel-chews-through-mans-intestines-after-he-put-it-up-his-anus/">arrived at the hospital in excruciating pain</a>, prompting immediate medical attention. The doctors reported that the patient had inserted the eel earlier in the day, leading to a desperate attempt by the eel to escape. The creature bit through the patient's rectum and colon, entering the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>Imaging tests, including an X-ray, revealed the eel's skeleton lodged within the patient's abdomen. Initial efforts to remove the eel through the anus were hindered by another foreign object - a lemon - that had been inserted and blocked the passage, prompting the medical team to initiate an emergency surgery.</p>

<p>During the surgery, doctors discovered the live eel, measuring over 25 inches in length and about 4 inches in diameter, inside the patient's abdominal cavity. Both the eel and the lemon were successfully removed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to the significant contamination and the presence of fecal matter in the abdominal cavity, a colostomy was performed, the report added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday scrapped a plea agreement with 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, just two days after the announcement of a deal that reportedly would have taken the death penalty off the table.</p>

<p>Agreements with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices announced Wednesday had appeared to have moved their long-running cases toward resolution -- but sparked anger among some relatives of those killed on September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>"I have determined that, in light of the significance of the decision to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused... responsibility for such a decision should rest with me," Austin said in a memorandum addressed to Susan Escallier, who oversaw the case.</p>

<p>"I hereby withdraw from the three pre-trial agreements that you signed on July 31, 2024 in the above-referenced case," the memo said.</p>

<p>The cases against the 9/11 defendants have been bogged down in pre-trial maneuverings for years while the accused remained held at the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump has lashed out at Google over reports that was censoring news and photos of the Republican presidential candidate.</p>

<p>"Google has been very bad. They've been very irresponsible and I have a feeling that Google is going to be close to shut down because I don't think Congress is going to take it. I really don't think so. Google has to be careful," Trump told Fox News in an interview.</p>

<p>Early this week, Trump alleged that it was virtually impossible to find pictures or anything about the failed assassination bid on him on July 13 on Google. Google, however, denied those allegations.</p>

<p>"Over the past few days, some people on X have posted claims that search is 'censoring' or 'banning' particular terms. That's not happening, and we want to set the record straight. The posts relate to our Autocomplete feature, which predicts queries to save you time. Autocomplete," it said in a social media post.</p>

<p>Google said autocomplete wasn't providing predictions for queries about the assassination attempt against former President Trump. That's because it has built-in protections related to political violence - and those systems were out of date. After the horrific events in Butler, Pennsylvania, those predicted queries should have appeared but didn't, it said.</p>

<p>"Once the issue was flagged, we started working on improvements, and they're already rolling out," it said.</p>

<p>"Secondly, people posted about how Autocomplete wasn't showing relevant predictions for 'President Donald'. This particular issue was a bug that spanned the political spectrum, also affecting queries for several past presidents, such as former President Obama, as you can see in the attached image. Typing 'vice president k' was also showing no predictions. We've made an update that has improved these predictions across the board," it said.</p>

<p>Some people, it said, also posted that searches for "Donald Trump" returned news stories related to "Kamala Harris." These labels are automatically generated based on related news topics, and they change over time.</p>

<p>"They span the political spectrum as well: For example, a search for 'Kamala Harris' showed Top Stories labelled with 'Donald Trump', because many articles cover the two of them together. You can see this happening across a range of topics, like the Olympics, other public figures, companies, and more. Our goal is to help people get relevant results for their query," Google said.</p>

<p>Overall, these types of prediction and labelling systems are algorithmic, it said.</p>

<p>"While our systems work very well most of the time, you can find predictions that may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur. Many platforms, including the one we're posting on now, will show strange or incomplete predictions at various times. For our part, when issues come up, we will make improvements so you can find what you're looking for, quickly and easily. We appreciate the feedback," it explained.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States will bolster its military presence in the Middle East, deploying additional warships and fighter jets to protect US personnel and defend Israel amid soaring tensions in the region, the Pentagon said Friday.</p>

<p>The announcement comes after Iran and its regional allies vowed retaliation for the killings of a Hamas leader in Tehran and a Hezbollah commander in Beirut, fueling fears of a broader Middle East conflict.</p>

<p>"The Department of Defense continues to take steps to mitigate the possibility of regional escalation by Iran or Iran's partners and proxies," deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Since the horrific Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, the Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel."</p>

<p>The aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln will replace one helmed by the USS Theodore Roosevelt in the region, Singh said.</p>

<p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has also ordered additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers to the Middle East and areas under US European Command, as well as a new fighter squadron to the Middle East.</p>

<p>Israel killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut on Tuesday, a move it said was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Hours later, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in the Iranian capital -- an attack on which Israel has not yet commented.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah told AFP that Iranian officials met in Tehran on Wednesday with representatives of the so-called "axis of resistance," a loose alliance of Tehran-backed groups hostile to Israel, to discuss their next steps.</p>

<p>"Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source, who had been briefed on the meeting, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>In April, Iran carried out its first direct attack on Israeli soil, firing a barrage of drones and missiles after a strike blamed on Israel killed Revolutionary Guards at Tehran's consulate in Damascus.</p>

<p>American forces helped defend Israel against the attack.</p>

<p>"As we have demonstrated since October and again in April, the United States' global defense is dynamic and the Department of Defense retains the capability to deploy on short notice to meet evolving national security threats," Singh said.</p>

<p>"The United States also remains intently focused on de-escalating tensions in the region and pushing for a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal to bring the hostages home and end the war in Gaza."<br />

<p>"So, Mark Zuckerberg called me. First of all, he called me a few times. He called me after the event and he said, 'That was really amazing, it was very brave,'" Trump told Fox News in an interview.</p>

<p>"He actually announced he's not gonna support a Democrat because he can't because he respected me for what I did that day," Trump said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the southern Philippines early Saturday, the United States Geological Survey said, with no tsunami warning issued.</p>

<p>The quake hit at a depth of 17 kilometres (10.5 miles) about 20 kilometres from the village of Barcelona on the east of Mindanao island, the USGS said.</p>

<p>The local seismological agency said no damage was expected, but it warned of aftershocks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earthquakes regularly strike the Philippines, which sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of intense seismic and volcanic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.</p>

<p>Most are too weak to be felt by humans but strong and destructive quakes come at random with no technology available to predict when and where they will happen.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Service has owned its failure to protect former president Donald Trump at an election rally in Pennsylvania on July 13.</p>

<p>A young gunman shot at Trump, 78, when he was addressing an election rally in Butler. Trump escaped the assassination attempt, as a bullet flew within a millimetre of him and one of them hit his right ear.</p>

<p>“The Secret Service takes full responsibility for the tragic events of July 13th. This was a mission failure. The sole responsibility of our agency is to make sure our protectees are never put in danger. We fell short of that in Butler. And I'm working to make sure that this failure does not happen again,” Acting Director of the US Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, told reporters at a news conference here.</p>

<p>The main role of Secret Service is to protect the President, the former presidents and their family members. Presidential nominees also get protection of the secret service.</p>

<p>Rowe said that the Secret Service will continue to cooperate with pending oversight investigations of the July 13 failure being done now by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, and the independent review directed by President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>“I am not waiting for the completion of those reports, and I've directed the Secret Service to take immediate steps to ensure our protectees are indeed safe. I am committed to pursuing accountability for the Secret Service's failure in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>“But let me be clear. If policy violations by Secret Service personnel are identified by the agency's Mission Assurance Review, those individuals will be held accountable. They will be held accountable to our fair and thorough disciplinary process,” he said.</p>

<p>Giving the sequence of events of July 13, Rowe said at 5.30 pm, Trump arrived at the campaign rally via Secret Service motorcade, and at that time, he met with supporters in a secure backstage area within the protective site.</p>

<p>At 5.45 pm, a local Butler County Emergency Services Unit counter sniper team member texted the Secret Service counter sniper team leader about a suspicious person and sent two photos of the individual, later identified as the assailant.</p>

<p>At 5.53 pm, the Secret Service counter sniper team leader texted the Secret Service counter sniper teams that local law enforcement was looking for a suspicious individual outside of the perimeter lurking around the AGR building.</p>

<p>At this time, Secret Service personnel were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working on an issue of a suspicious individual.</p>

<p>At 6 pm, former President Trump took the stage to begin remarks.</p>

<p>“Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the AGR building with a firearm. It is my understanding that personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,” he said.</p>

<p>“At 6.11 pm, a member of the former President Trump's protective detail contacted their Pittsburgh field office counterpart to inquire about the radio update that there was an issue local law enforcement was looking into near the perimeter.</p>

<p>“At 6.11 pm, the assailant's first volley of three shots was fired, and within three seconds, the former president's detail rushed the stage and covered Trump, shielding him with their own bodies,” Rowe said giving the timeline of the failed assassination bid on July 13.</p>

<p>“The fourth-through-eight shots took place over the next several seconds. Fifteen and a half seconds after the assailant's first shot, a Secret Service counter sniper fired a single round that neutralised the assailant,” he said.</p>

<p>Rowe told reporters that this was a failure.</p>

<p>“We should have had better protection for the protectee. We should have had better coverage on that roof line. We should have had at least some other set of eyes from the Secret Service point of view covering that. That building was very close to that outer perimeter, and we should have had more of a presence,” he said.</p>

<p>“This was a Secret Service failure. That roof line should have been covered. We should have had better eyes on that,” he added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah forces on Friday resumed rocket and artillery attacks against Israel, ending the lull along the border following Israel's killing of the Lebanese group's military commander in Beirut.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had fired a surface-to-air missile at an Israeli warplane flying in Lebanese airspace overnight and forced it to turn back. Its forces also carried out two artillery attacks and two rocket strikes at military positions in northern Israel, it said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement it had successfully intercepted an aerial target coming from Lebanon into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire hit several villages in southern Lebanon on Friday, according to Lebanese state media, a day after an Israeli strike killed at least five Syrian migrant workers in southern Lebanon, according to medics.</p>

<p>The Israeli military also said it had hit two Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in an address on Thursday that he had ordered calm along the border following the Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday that killed military commander Fuad Shukr out of respect for the victims and to consider what the next steps should be.</p>

<p>The strike on the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh in Beirut's southern suburbs also killed an Iranian military adviser and five civilians.</p>

<p>Nasrallah said Hezbollah would retaliate but it would need to study what their response would be, and would otherwise resume its usual military operations against Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been trading fire for nearly 10 months in parallel with the Gaza war, with exchanges mostly limited to the border area.</p>

<p>But strikes since last week have threatened to tip the conflict into a full-scale regional war.</p>

<p>Israel and the United States have accused Hezbollah of killing 12 youths in a July 27 rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, a claim Hezbollah has denied.</p>

<p>The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, told Reuters on Friday it had not investigated the incident as the Israeli-occupied Golan is outside its mandated area of operations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Israeli military confirmed on Thursday it had killed Al Jazeera journalist Ismail Al-Ghoul in an airstrike in Gaza, saying he was a Hamas operative who had taken part in the October 7 attack on Israel, without offering proof for the assertion.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military confirmed on Thursday it had killed Al Jazeera journalist Ismail Al-Ghoul in an airstrike in Gaza, saying he was a Hamas operative who had taken part in the October 7 attack on Israel, without offering proof for the assertion.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera dismissed what it said were "baseless allegations" which it said were an attempt to justify the deliberate killing of its journalists.</p>

<p>"The network condemns the accusations against its correspondent Ismail Al-Ghoul, without providing any proof, documentation or video," it said in a statement, adding that it reserved the right to take legal action against those responsible.</p>

<p>The Qatari broadcaster said on Wednesday that Al-Ghoul and cameraman Ramy El Rify were killed in an Israeli strike on Gaza City while on an assignment to film near the house of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas chief killed in Iran earlier on the same day.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Al-Ghoul was a member of the elite Nukhba unit who took part in the Oct. 7 attack and instructed Hamas operatives on how to record operations. It said he was involved in recording and publicizing attacks on Israeli troops.</p>

<p>"His activities in the field were a vital part of Hamas' military activity," the Israeli military said in a statement.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera said Al-Ghoul had worked for the network since November 2023 and his only profession was as a journalist.</p>

<p>It said he had been arrested and detained at Al-Shifa Hospital in the northern part of the Gaza Strip when it was taken by Israeli forces in March before being released, which it said "debunks and refutes their false claim of his affiliation with any organization."</p>

<p>The Israeli government has banned Al-Jazeera from operating in Israel, accusing it of posing a threat to national security.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera, which has been heavily critical of Israel's campaign in Gaza, has denied inciting violence.</p>

<p>The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said the deaths of the two Al Jazeera crew raised to 165 the number of Palestinian journalists killed by Israeli fire since Oct 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A zookeeper in Nigeria was mauled to death by a lion after he failed to secure the locks on its enclosure when he went to feed it. According to the <em>BBC</em>, the victim, identified as a 35-year-old man named Babaji Daule, worked at the Presidential Library Wildlife Park, owned by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta. He was bitten in the neck on Saturday after agreeing to take guests into the enclosure even though they arrived after hours at the wildlife park.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The zookeeper, apparently, feeling comfortable with the animal, left the safety protection gate open and proceeded to feed the animal. He was mauled by the animal and died on the spot," the park management said in a statement, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e9zv1ypxko" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, local police spokesperson Omolola Odutola said that the "lion inflicted serious fatal injuries to the man's neck". He said that the lion was shot dead "to release its grip on the handler".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is important to state that this activity fell completely outside the standard feeding routine of the park," the wildlife park stressed in its statement.</p>

<p>The police described the 35-year-old as a trained lion handler. It is not clear if Mr Daule had permission to take the guests into the closure when it was supposed to be closed. Either way, he "carelessly neglected to secure the locks and barricade the lion's enclosure before approaching the cage to feed the animal," Mr Odutola said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This negligence allowed the lion to escape and attack the handler, resulting in fatal injuries to the handler's neck and eventual death. The wild lion was shot to release its grip on the handler," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The management of the wildlife park expressed condolences to the deceased's family, and reassured the public of its commitment to ensuring the safety of its employees, visitors, and the animals themselves, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/world-news/zookeeper-mauled-to-death-by-lion-while-feeding-it-after-hours/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this incident comes less than a year after another zookeeper was attacked and killed by a lion at the Obafemi Awolowo University, in Nigeria. Olabode Olawuyi was a veterinary technologist who had been taking care of the lions since they were born on campus about nine years ago. Tragically, in February, one of the male lions killed the man when he was feeding them. His colleagues tried to save him but by the time they could do anything, one of the lions had already fatally wounded him, the university said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanese militant group Hezbollah on Tuesday said it had targeted the Israeli military intelligence base of Glilot near Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed group "launched salvoes of Fadi 4 rockets at the Glilot base of the military intelligence's unit 8200 and the Mossad headquarters located on the outskirts of Tel Aviv," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>After an Israeli strike killed its leader Hassan Nasrallah in the Beirut suburbs on Friday, the group said it had dubbed the operation "at your service Nasrallah".</p>

<p>Nasrallah in late August said his group had launched a large-scale attack on Israel, targeting "the Glilot base -- the main Israeli military intelligence base".</p>

<p>The Israeli army said Hezbollah had failed to strike the installation at the time.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive 43-foot-tall naked statue of Donald Trump suddenly appeared alongside the Las Vegas Strip highway over the weekend, only to vanish just as mysteriously. This gigantic effigy, dubbed "Crooked and Obscene," was strategically placed on a plot of land off a highway in Nevada, about 28 miles away from the Trump International Hotel, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/us-news/pop-up-exhibit-43-foot-naked-nevada-trump-effigy-vanishes-after-roadside-ruckus/">New York Post</a></em> reported. Its location was near the highway connecting Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, but far enough from main traffic points, likely due to its explicit nature.</p>

<p>The statue, made of foam over rebar and weighing around 6,000 pounds, was designed as a marionette with movable arms.&nbsp;The identity of the person or group behind the provocative installation remains unknown, and the only clue is that the landowner is a trust registered in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the anonymous artist behind the work said the installation is "43ft tall, 10ft wide… weighs 6,000lbs, and is made of foam over rebar," adding that it intended to "ignite conversations".The statue was due to be removed by Monday night and will be moved to "key swing states," the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The mysterious artwork has generated significant attention, with mixed reactions on social media ranging from amusement to outrage. Some conservatives condemned the display and accused it of inciting violence against the former president.</p>

<p>The Nevada unit of Trump's Republican party described the pop-up as an ''offensive marionette.'' In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nevadagop.org/press-release-the-nevada-republican-party-strongly-condemns-the-deplorable-statue-of-president-donald-j-trump/">press release,</a> the party said, ''While families drive through Las Vegas, they are forced to view this offensive marionette, designed intentionally for shock value rather than meaningful dialogue. President Trump and Republicans are focused on delivering results that matter—reducing inflation, securing our borders, creating jobs, and ensuring a brighter future for all Americans. While Democrats, especially Kamala Harris, continue to prioritize shock value over substance. President Trump is the only candidate in this race standing up for working men and women across Nevada.''</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time a naked Trump statue has made headlines. In 2016, several similar statues popped up in cities across the US, including New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. A baby blimp of Trump was also floated in London ahead of the 2020 election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel announced Tuesday it had launched a ground offensive targeting Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, days after killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike on a bunker in Beirut.</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of what is known about Israel's ground operation so far.</p>

<p><strong>When did the offensive begin</strong></p>

<p>Late Monday, Israel's military began what it called "limited, localised and targeted raids" against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon's border areas.</p>

<p>Its ground forces are backed by fighter jets and artillery fire.</p>

<p>The military formally announced the start of the ground offensive hours after the United States said Israeli forces were conducting limited operations in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The military did not reveal how many soldiers were involved in the incursion, but said its 98th division - including paratroopers and commando units - was taking part.</p>

<p>The division had been previously deployed in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces continue to battle Palestinian militants led by Hamas.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, the military declared three areas along the northern border with Lebanon a "closed military zone", providing the first indication of a possible ground offensive.</p>

<p><strong>What are Israel's targets?</strong></p>

<p>The military said it was acting on "precise intelligence" targeting Hezbollah positions and infrastructure in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel," it said.</p>

<p>The ground assault comes after Israeli air strikes killed several top Hezbollah commanders in recent weeks, including Nasrallah on Friday.</p>

<p>"The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the final one," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday, hours before the offensive was announced.</p>

<p>"We will use all the means that may be required - your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land," Gallant told soldiers in the north.</p>

<p><strong>What are Israel's goals?</strong></p>

<p>Since October 8, Hezbollah has been firing rockets from across the border, displacing more than 60,000 residents in northern Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said it was acting in solidarity with its Islamist ally Hamas in Gaza, following the unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The ensuing cross-border clashes have intensified in recent weeks.</p>

<p>While Israel engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas in Gaza, Gallant announced on September 18 that the "centre of gravity" of the war was now pivoting to the north.</p>

<p>"It was now time to ensure that those displaced from the north would be able to return to their homes," he said.</p>

<p>Other officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have repeatedly vowed to return those displaced back to their homes.</p>

<p>"We will continue to hit Hezbollah... the one who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his home will not have a home," Netanyahu said in a statement last month.</p>

<p><strong>How has Hezbollah responded?</strong></p>

<p>Since the ground offensive began, Hezbollah has fired several rockets into Israel, with explosions heard in the commercial city of Tel Aviv on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A statement said it had "launched salvoes of Fadi 4 rockets at the Glilot base of the military intelligence's unit 8200 and the Mossad headquarters located on the outskirts of Tel Aviv".</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it also targeted Israeli troop movements in Metula in northern Israel "with artillery shells" and later a "gathering of enemy soldiers" in the same area with rockets.</p>

<p>Israeli troops in northern Israel's Avivim were also targeted, the group added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Hawaii has filed a lawsuit against a North Shore Oahu homeowner after his luxurious property partially collapsed into the ocean, the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/real-estate/hawaii-sues-homeowner-because-his-house-fell-into-the-ocean-despite-efforts-to-save-it/">New York Post</a> </em>reported. On September 25, 2024, the state filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against Josh VanEmmerik, seeking to hold them accountable for the damage.&nbsp;A shocking video circulating on social media shows the precarious state of the house, prompting widespread concern. In the footage, a voice can be heard warning onlookers, "Be careful where you're standing. The whole roof is gonna come down right now," highlighting the danger posed by the collapsing structure.&nbsp;Glass, metal and wood can be seen strewn across the sand as the waves pull debris into the sea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands reported that waves destroyed the Haleiwa home, causing debris to fall onto state land and into the ocean. Officers responding to the scene found large parts of the structure on state land and debris washing into the sea.</p>

<p>''On September 24, 2024, large pieces of cement, wood, glass, electrical components, rebar, geotextile fabric, and other unidentified solid materials cover the State land spanning between the property boundary line and the ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;An unknown quantity of solid material from the dwelling on Subject Property 2 entered the ocean and was taken away from the location due to the ocean's natural processes,'' the complaint reads.</p>

<p>Notably, VanEmmerik's beachfront property purchase in 2021 for $1 million came with a warning about erosion, which ultimately led to the house collapsing into the ocean. Despite the risks, he remodelled the property and listed it for $2.5 million, later reducing the price to $2 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Private landowners take a risk when they allow structures to be so close to the shoreline. The people of Hawaii are now confronted with the consequences of property owners' failures to take heed of the ocean's warning signs of erosion,'' &nbsp;Deputy Attorney General&nbsp;Danica Swenson told&nbsp;<em><a data-link="native" href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/09/26/state-files-legal-action-against-homeowner-whose-house-partially-collapsed-into-ocean/">Hawaii News Now</a>.</em></p>

<p>This isn't the first time the property owner has faced issues with the state. Last year, they received a $110,000 penalty for "erosion control violations" related to sandbags placed at the residence.</p>

<p>Hawaii's coastal erosion problem has been an ongoing issue, with nearly a third of beachfront homes on O‘ahu's North Shore sitting precariously close to the shoreline. Many locals are frustrated with both VanEmmerik and the state government, accusing them of dragging their feet in addressing the erosion issue.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has targeted Indian-American billionaire Vinod Khosla in a sharp social media exchange. Musk called him “dumb” and disputed Khosla's claims about Argentina's economic state under its new conservative president, Javier Milei. The argument, which quickly went viral, stemmed from Khosla's criticism of Milei's policies, much to the dismay of Musk, a vocal admirer of the Argentinian leader.</p>

<p>Vinod Khosla posted on X, linking President Milei's austerity programme to economic downturns and likening it to former US President Donald Trump's policies. “Argentina's unemployment rate soars to 52% under Mileis dictatorial austerity program. Same will happen under @realDonaldTrump&nbsp; as he slashes spending. His tariffs will simultaneously increase inflation.” Khosla wrote, sharing a Financial Times article about Argentina's worsening poverty rate.</p>

<p>Musk, a strong supporter of Milei's libertarian approach, responded bluntly, calling Khosla “dumb” for what he probably deemed a misleading post.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">You are dumb</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1839904894339236261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>X's community notes also fact-checked Khosla's claims, pointing out that Argentina's unemployment rate had actually decreased to 7.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, down slightly from the previous period's 7.7 per cent – far from the 52 per cent unemployment figure Khosla cited.</p>

<p>The exchange escalated when another commenter questioned how Khosla could make such an outlandish claim, writing, “How did Khosla not think this through? A 52% unemployment rate is just absurd; it should have triggered something in his brain to say this doesn't seem right.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk jumped in with a sarcastic reply, saying, “seriously.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Seriously</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Vinod Khosla, refusing to back down, responded directly to Musk's post. &nbsp;“Poverty is gross underemployment. Too nuanced for macho brains to understand. My nuance vs. your outright posting of false pics? I get a community comment and yours didn't. I thought you were above this kind of bias at X,” Khosla fired back, accusing Musk of selective bias on the platform he now owns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/business/argentina-poverty-rate-increase-50-percent/index.html">CNN report</a> noted that under President Milei, Argentina's poverty rate surged to nearly 53 per cent, the worst level in two decades. The country's economic challenges have left approximately 3.4 million more Argentinians living in poverty in 2024 alone.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A luxury round-the-world cruise ship beset with technical delays and docked in rainy Belfast since May finally departed from the Northern Irish capital late Monday, prompting celebration among its passengers.</p>

<p>"We are going to have one heck of a time tonight, we are going to party like there's no tomorrow," beaming passenger Joe Martino told AFP before boarding.</p>

<p>The Odyssey residential cruise ship pulled out from Belfast harbour at 2240 GMT as passengers cheered on board.</p>

<p>But even Monday's departure was hit with yet another technical hiccup.</p>

<p>Dozens of passengers were left waiting in Belfast's cruise terminal beyond the scheduled boarding time as a last piece of required paperwork was held up.</p>

<p>After Mike Petersen, head of the US-based firm Villa Vie Residences that owns the Odyssey ship, at last, announced the green light for the ship's exit passengers shrieked with elation and hugged each other.</p>

<p>"The exhilaration of getting on that ship, when it takes off it will be the feeling of a lifetime," said Martino, 61, an actor from Chicago who spent the last four months waiting in Belfast.</p>

<p>Passenger Holly Hennessy, holding her cat named "Captain", said ecstatically: "I've been in Belfast for four months and two days, but hey, who's counting!"&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Everything went wrong'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Odyssey was scheduled to set sail from the Northern Irish capital on May 30 on a three-and-a-half-year cruise.</p>

<p>But outfitting, certification processes and engine repairs all took much longer than expected.</p>

<p>"Everything that could go wrong went wrong," Martino said.</p>

<p>The ship had undergone repairs for engine trouble in drydock at Belfast's Harland &amp; Wolff, the famed shipyard where the doomed Titanic was built more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Further delay was caused by the shipbuilder going into financial administration this month.</p>

<p>Passengers are able to either buy or rent long-term cabins on the so-called "residential" cruise ship, with the promise of unlimited voyages around the globe.</p>

<p>During the long wait, passengers could spend all day on board the ship but were not allowed to sleep there, so spent the nights in hotels or rented apartments instead.</p>

<p>Some decided to explore Northern Ireland, while others took the opportunity to travel in Europe or join other cruises while the Odyssey remained stuck.</p>

<p>They then flocked back to Belfast in recent days for the expected departure, which will see the ship head first to Brest, then Bilbao, the Azores, and across the Atlantic towards the Caribbean.</p>

<p>The floating town, which can accommodate around 600 passengers, is due to visit all seven continents with more than 425 stops in 147 destinations planned.</p>

<p>Port stays will last between two to seven days.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A devastating fire tore through a Thai bus carrying 44 students and teachers on a school trip Tuesday, officials said, with up to 25 feared dead.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said there were fatalities and offered condolences to the victims' families.</p>

<p>Transport minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit said the number of fatalities was not clear but 25 people were unaccounted for after the blaze.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Initial reports said there are 44 on board, 38 students and six teachers. As far as we know now, three teachers and 16 students got out," he told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For those still missing, we are not clear yet."</p>

<p>The bus was carrying students from Uthai Thani province when a tyre burst on a highway in a northern Bangkok suburb, sending the vehicle crashing into a barrier, a rescue worker said in footage broadcast on local TV.</p>

<p>The bus was running on compressed gas and the crash ignited its fuel tanks, the rescue worker said.</p>

<p>Video footage from the scene showed flames engulfing the bus as it burned under an overpass, huge clouds of dense black smoke billowing into the sky.</p>

<p>"I have learned of the fire on a bus carrying students from Uthai Thani... resulting in deaths and injuries," Paetongtarn wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"As a mother, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of the injured and deceased."</p>

<p>The blaze has been put out but rescue workers have had to wait for the bus to cool down before searching it for bodies, a rescue worker said.</p>

<p>Thailand has one of the worst road safety records in the world, with unsafe vehicles and poor driving contributing to the high annual death count.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on Tuesday said he was released after years of incarceration only because he had pleaded guilty to doing "journalism", which he described as a pillar of a free society.</p>

<p>Assange spent most of the last 14 years either holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London to avoid arrest or locked up at Belmarsh Prison in the British capital.</p>

<p>He was released from jail in June, after serving a sentence for publishing hundreds of thousands of confidential US government documents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am not free today because the system worked. I am free today after years of incarceration because I pleaded guilty to journalism," Assange told the Council of Europe rights body at its Strasbourg headquarters in his first public comments since his release.</p>

<p>"I eventually chose freedom over unrealisable justice... justice for me is now precluded," Assange said, noting he had been facing a 175-year jail sentence.</p>

<p>Speaking calmly and flanked by his wife Stella who fought for his release, he added: "Journalism is not a crime, it is a pillar of a free and informed society."</p>

<p>"The fundamental issue is simple. Journalists should not be prosecuted for doing their jobs," said Assange.</p>

<p>The trove of confidential documents released by Wikileaks included searingly frank US State Department descriptions of foreign leaders, accounts of extrajudicial killings and intelligence gathering against allies.</p>

<p>Assange argued his case provided an insight into "how powerful intelligence organisations engage in transnational repression" against their foes, adding that this "cannot become the norm here."</p>

<h3><strong>'More impunity, more secrecy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>He said that during his incarceration "ground has been lost", regretting that he now sees "more impunity, more secrecy and more retaliation for telling the truth."</p>

<p>"Freedom of expression and all that flows from it is at a dark crossroads," he told the hearing of the legal committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).</p>

<p>"Let us all commit to doing our part to ensure the light of freedom never dims and the pursuit of truth will live on and the voices of many are not silenced by the interests of the few," he said.</p>

<p>Assange's case remains deeply contentious.</p>

<p>Supporters hail him as a champion of free speech and say he was persecuted by authorities and unfairly imprisoned. Detractors see him as a reckless blogger whose uncensored publication of ultra-sensitive documents put lives at risk and jeopardised US security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, who is likely to issue some pardons before leaving office next January, has previously described Assange as a "terrorist".</p>

<p>Assange's timing and his choice of venue have puzzled some observers.</p>

<p>The Council of Europe brings together the 46 signatory states of the European Convention on Human Rights, with little say over Assange's legal fate.</p>

<p>Assange is still campaigning for a US presidential pardon for his conviction under the Espionage Act.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from its territory deep into the Pacific Ocean on September 25, the first such test since 1980.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from its territory deep into the Pacific Ocean on September 25, the first such test since 1980.</p>

<p>Beijing's explanation of this extremely rare event was perfunctory, with the Ministry of National Defence (MND) downplaying this hurling of a strategic weapon far across the Pacific. China's MND described the test thus: "The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) launched an ICBM carrying a dummy warhead to the high seas in the Pacific Ocean at 08:44 on September 25th, and the missile fell into expected sea areas. This test launch is a routine arrangement in our annual training plan. It is in line with international law and international practice, and is not directed against any country or target."</p>

<p>Of course, this ICBM launch was anything but "routine," for China has not conducted such a test for 44 years. So significant was the event that Beijing deemed it necessary to warn select nations in advance, including France and the USA.</p>

<p>Sabrina Singh, Pentagon deputy spokeswoman, acknowledged, "We did receive some advance notification of this ICBM test, and we believe that was a good thing. That was a step in the right direction, and it does lead to preventing any misperception or miscalculation."</p>

<p>Singh added that the USA had pressed China for "a more regular bilateral notification arrangement when it comes to ballistic missiles and space launches". She described this as "a common sense, confidence-building measure".</p>

<p>China has a 2009 agreement with Russia for each side to notify the other of ballistic missile launches, but so far China has rejected all American suggestions for such a mechanism.</p>

<p>Warned in advance, the US Air Force deployed an RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft--one of only three existing to collect optical and electronic data on the missile and its warhead about halfway along its flight path. The USAF describes the RC-135 as "a national asset uniquely suited to provide America's leaders and defence community with vital information that cannot be obtained by any other source".</p>

<p>The missile splashed down near the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia, not far from the Marquesas Islands. China had sent its Yuan Wang 5 tracking ship near the landing site to collect data. New Zealand described the ICBM test as an "unwelcome and concerning development". Indeed, nations like Australia, Japan and New Zealand asked China for an explanation.</p>

<p>Importantly, this test came precisely ten years after the DF-31AG achieved its first launch on 25 September 2014. Symbolism and dates are important to the PLA, and at that time the then-new missile used a lofted trajectory to limit its ground range. However, this latest provocative test came at a time of heightened tensions with neighbours like Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately tweeted, "PLA's 1st ICBM launch in 44 years exposes the regime's expansionist ambitions &amp; malign nature. Taiwan vehemently condemns the PRC for its reckless moves destabilising the region &amp; urges China to exercise restraint &amp; cease all actions that undermine global efforts for peace." This was more than a routine test. China was sending a signal, an intimidating one at that.</p>

<p>China launched this missile from a countryside site in the northern part of Hainan Island, a Chinese island sitting north of the South China Sea. The ICBM flew approximately 12,000km. It is most notable that the distance between Hainan Island and Los Angeles on the west coast of the USA is some 12,100km. China therefore effectively demonstrated its ability to reach the USA with this type of nuclear weapon, even though the newer DF-41 has an even longer range.</p>

<p>Decker Eveleth, an analyst at the American research organization CNA, explained further why China lobbed this missile in the direction it did. "Generally, the PLARF tests ICBMs from the interior of the country, out in the northern desert shooting east to west. This is satisfactory for most system tests (many missile tests are actually conducted to test a specific subsystem). The problem is that this forces you to use a lofted trajectory. The distance from the ICBM test site to the target ranges is around 2,000-3,000 kilometres, so China has to fire their ICBMs very high to compensate. That's maybe a quarter of an ICBM's actual range. That means, if the PLARF wanted to test a depressed trajectory, they're going to need to find another place to test their ICBMs--like the Pacific Ocean."</p>

<p>Eveleth also identified one possible reason why the missile was fired from Hainan: "Another reason you'd test like this is to test speed and the competence of your missile crews. Launching a missile is complicated, and there are a variety of tasks that, if you mess it up, that missile is going to miss the target, especially considering the ICBM they launched is almost certainly launched from a mobile launcher. By doing it out at Hainan and launching from a launch location the missile crew may be unfamiliar with, you can identify potential pitfalls in the process."</p>

<p>Eveleth said there is a precedent for this kind of end-to-end test, for China did something similar with a DF-2 in 1966. He said on that occasion the PLA's launch "was conducted partly to test the entire transportation and launch support infrastructure". He suggested it was possibly a "similar deal" on this latest occasion.</p>

<p>This was a complex operation for the PLARF, for it entailed transporting a massive HTF5980A 16x16 transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) plus support vehicles from the Chinese mainland across to Hainan Island. A photo circulating on the internet, and others of the launch itself released by the MND, showed that the missile was launched from an unprepared site. Such a procedure with minimal supporting infrastructure makes it much more difficult for an adversary to identify launch sites.</p>

<p>What kind of missile was it? Most analysts agree it was a DF-31AG, a type that publicly debuted in a parade in Beijing on 1 October 2019. The DF-31AG is externally very similar to the earlier DF-31A, suggesting the two ICBMs are not substantially different.</p>

<p>However, the latter uses a truck-and-trailer launcher unit, whereas the DF-31AG is more mobile on an eight-axle truck chassis. Eveleth published a PLARF order of battle in July 2023, where he described the DF-31AG thus: "It is unclear at this point what precisely the difference between the DF-31A and the DF-31AG is, besides the change in transporter and support equipment. PLA military newspapers mention that the AG has upgraded cabling, reducing the number of necessary cables and allowing for faster data transmission times. But what changes, if any, have been made to the missile itself, are still unknown."</p>

<p>The American researcher added, "The big, big thing they'd want to modernize is the guidance system, which still relies on an antiquated alignment system the US got rid of in the 1990s. As Chinese state media still talk about cable vans and alignment, the AG's guidance system has likely not been modernized. It's possible China is working on a new model that updates the guidance system that removes these problems."</p>

<p>The PLARF's 624 Missile Brigade is stationed in Hainan, but that unit possesses DF- 21D anti-ship ballistic missiles. In fact, the nearest DF-31AG unit to Hainan is 632 Brigade stationed in Shaoyang (27.2532°N, 111.3859°E). This is approximately 800km away from the Hainan launch site.</p>

<p>Eveleth, in his PLARF order of battle from 2023, estimated China had anywhere from 48-56 DF-31AG TELs. He listed the 621 Brigade in Yibin, the aforementioned 632 Brigade, 642 Brigade in Datong, 643 Brigade in Tianshui and the 664 Brigade in Xiangyang as units operating the DF-31AG.</p>

<p>In a report published by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists earlier this year, it estimated China had 64 DF-31AGs. The same document calculated that China currently fields a total of 438 nuclear warheads, plus another 62 warheads that have been produced but not operationalized. This assessment corresponds almost identically to the 500 warheads estimated by the Pentagon's 2023 report on China's military capabilities.</p>

<p>The Pentagon predicts the PLARF's nuclear warhead stockpile will reach 1,000 by 2030. Eveleth also predicted in his report that, by 2028, China will own more than 1,000 ballistic missile launchers. Of these, 507 will be nuclear-capable, 342-432 will be conventional missile launchers, and at least 252 dual-capable launchers.</p>

<p>However, Eveleth offered this opinion: "The most concerning change to China's nuclear forces is not actually the numerical expansion in launchers, but their apparent shift from a retaliation plan that imagined firing a salvo of nuclear missiles after an adversary had already completed an attack against the Chinese homeland to a posture of launch on warning (LOW). Under launch on warning, an incoming nuclear attack is detected in flight with satellites and ground-based radar, allowing a state to retaliate before the incoming missiles have struck their targets.</p>

<p>"China's developing LOW capability, combined with solid-fueled missile silos, means that they can quickly launch a nuclear attack at a moment's notice. A LOW posture presents new challenges in ensuring conventional conflicts stay conventional."</p>

<p>Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang, a Chinese MND spokesperson, said at a 26 September press conference, "China's nuclear policy is very stable, consistent and predictable. We strictly follow a nuclear policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons, and pursue a nuclear strategy of self-defence."</p>

<p>Zhang added, "We've promised not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against no-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones. China will continue to keep its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security."</p>

<p>Zhang further noted that "At present, there's a more stable momentum in the overall defence relationship between China and the US. The two militaries maintain high-level strategic communication, policy communication, institutionalised dialogues and exchanges in specialized fields. These engagements could help enhance mutual understanding, avoid miscalculation and manage and control risks."</p>

<p>China may well be hoping to solidify its international status as a global power boasting a world-class military. The USA routinely conducts long-range tests of ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, so China is demonstrating that it can do so too.</p>

<p>Indeed, Beijing now seems unapologetic about conducting military activities that mirror American ones. Therefore, perhaps a pertinent question to ask is whether this latest test has set a precedent for beyond-border flight tests and whether China will continue to do the same in the future. In 2019-20, China launched multiple DF-21D and DF-26 missiles into the South China Sea. That episode might have been a portent for an ongoing practice of splashing missiles down in extraterritorial waters.</p>

<p>Another purpose for this test across the Pacific may relate to reassuring the Chinese people and demonstrating to the world of the credibility of the PLARF. The aforementioned Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists report noted, "The readiness of the Chinese nuclear missile force was challenged in early 2024 with the disclosure that a US intelligence assessment had found that corruption within the People's Liberation Army had led to an erosion of confidence in its overall capabilities, particularly when it comes to the Rocket Force."</p>

<p>Remember too that the PLARF was embroiled heavily in a corruption scandal that saw the force's top two leaders removed and prosecuted. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists report pointed out that "recent dismissals of top defence officials and widespread corruption might chill the Chinese leadership's willingness to arm missiles with warheads in peacetime."</p>

<p>The PLARF is a strategic force, but Chairman Xi Jinping has been ruing the lack of loyalty amongst its top leadership, and he was angered by the corruption that appears rife in the organisation. By demonstrating the ability to relocate a sophisticated ICBM and its launch apparatus from the mainland by sea, and by firing a missile thousands of kilometres at a distance sufficient to reach the USA, the PLARF has sharply demonstrated to Xi that this force is politically reliable and that it is combat ready.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 36-year-old California man turned a short-term teaching stint in Spain's Mallorca into a successful new life, despite initially struggling with the language. Ted Purdom, who had difficulty with foreign languages in school, moved to the Balearic islands in 2011 as part of a nine-month programme to teach English. He planned to return to the US after the contract ended. However, what started as a short-term stay in Mallorca turned into a life-changing journey, both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>Mr Purdom, who hails from San Anselmo, California, always struggled with Spanish. “Foreign languages was always my most difficult subject,” he told CNN. “I failed second-year Spanish twice and the third time I was able to pass by the skin of my teeth.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this, a college exchange programme in Spain brought him to the Balearic Islands in 2009, where he spent three months immersed in Spanish culture. That initial visit left a mark, and a desire to return to Spain led him to apply for a programme that placed American “language coaches” in Spanish schools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had no teaching experience when I arrived, Mr Purdom admitted. But what started as a temporary gig grew into a full-time opportunity. “I decided to stay because the job opportunities in the US weren't great in 2013, so I felt another year wouldn't be such a bad idea,” he told CNN.</p>

<p>Over time, Mr Purdom integrated into Mallorcan society, learning not only Spanish but also Mallorquin, a Catalan dialect spoken locally. His language skills flourished, and he married a former student, Lluisa, in 2017. Together, they have a four-year-old daughter and are expecting their second child, as per CNN.</p>

<p>In 2017, Mr Purdom took a bold step, opening The Bridge English Academy in Manacor. “The business has grown, we have close to 200 students, beginning at seven years of age and all the way up to adults,” he explained. His background, he believes, helps him connect with students who struggle with language learning, as he once did. To make students more enthusiastic about a subject that some may not find the most interesting, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Purdom plans to expand his academy and has recently purchased the office space next door. He also plans to increase the number of courses and enroll more students.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British journalist, who lost his legs in a 2004 war reporting attack, faced a humiliating and discriminatory experience on a LOT Polish Airlines flight. Frank Gardner, returning from Warsaw, needed to use the toilet but was informed by the crew that the airline didn't provide onboard wheelchairs. With no alternative, he was forced to crawl across the cabin floor.</p>

<p>Frank Gardner, a seasoned correspondent for the BBC, shared his experience on X, expressing his frustration over the airline's lack of support for disabled passengers. "Wow. It's 2024 and I've just had to crawl along the floor of this LOT Polish airline to get to the toilet during a flight back from Warsaw as 'we don't have onboard wheelchairs. It's airline policy. If you're disabled and you can't walk, this is just discriminatory," he wrote.</p>

<p>Despite the shocking situation, Frank Gardner acknowledged the efforts of the cabin crew, who, he said, were "helpful and apologetic throughout" the ordeal. "Not their fault, it's the airline. Won't be flying A LOT again until they join the 21st century," he added.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The Pentagon Chief discussed security developments and Israeli operations with counterpart Gallant and made it clear that the US supports Israel's right to defend itself.</p>

<p>"I spoke with Israeli Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant today to discuss security developments and Israeli operations. I made it clear that the United States supports Israel's right to defend itself. We agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hizballah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel's northern communities," Austin said, sharing a post on X on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The US Defence Secretary in his talks to Gallant, further ensured that the US is "well-postured to defend" US personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran.</p>

<p>He said, "I reaffirmed that a diplomatic resolution is required to ensure that civilians can return safely to their homes on both sides of the border and made clear that the United States is well-postured to defend US personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations and determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict."</p>

<p>"I reiterated the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel," Austin added.</p>

<p>The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) launched precision strikes on the Lebanese capital in Beirut on September 27, which led to the death of Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Following the death of Nasrallah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning to Iran's Ayatollah regime and asserted that those who target Israel will face consequences and that no location in Iran or West Asia is beyond Israel's reach.</p>

<p>Netanyahu called Nasrallah the "main engine of Iran's axis of evil" and added, "Nasrallah was not just another terrorist, he was the terrorist. He was the axis of the axis, the main engine of Iran's axis of evil. He and his people were the architects of the plan to destroy Israel. He was not only operated by Iran, he also frequently operated Iran."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tech entrepreneur from Utah finds himself coming to terms with the ramifications of a decision he made back in 2008. Chris Willson purchased a historic cruise ship after discovering a listing on Craigslist. This purchase led to a 15-year journey of passionate restoration, transforming the 293-foot vessel into a treasure that boasted 85 cabins, a swimming pool, and a theatre. However, despite his efforts and dreams of establishing a museum aboard, Mr Willson was forced to sell the ship in October 2023 - a decision that continues to "haunt" him.</p>

<p>The ship, originally named Wappen von Hamburg and built in 1955, had a storied history as one of Germany's first post-World War II passenger liners. Feeling inspired, Mr Willson bought the vessel and 'sank' his life savings - over $1 million - into the project.</p>

<p>Renaming it Aurora, he relocated it to California and moved aboard with his partner, Jin Li. He dedicated years to its renovation. With the help of volunteers, he made substantial progress, restoring 10 major areas of the ship. Mr Willson's goal was to turn Aurora into a floating museum.</p>

<p>However, Chris Willson's dream of transforming the vessel into a museum met with resistance from locals. His restoration project did not sit right with residents, particularly after another nearby ship, the Canadian minesweeper HMCS Chaleur, sank in 2021.</p>

<p>In January 2023, a military tugboat docked near the Aurora also sank, sparking a pollution issue that attracted the attention of local authorities. With the pressure mounting, Mr Willson and his partner realised they could no longer sustain the project.</p>

<p>"Maybe Aurora wasn't in the right place," Ms Li told CNN. "Maybe if Aurora was in a different state, or a different country it would have been different."</p>

<p>In late 2023, Mr Willson made the difficult decision to sell the ship. While he believed the buyer shared his passion for preserving the Aurora, disaster struck just seven months later.</p>

<p>In May 2024, the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office reported that the Aurora was sinking. A hole in the vessel caused it to take on water, leaking diesel fuel and oil into the Delta Waterway. Contractors hired by the US Coast Guard managed to refloat the ship, but it was clear the vessel's future was bleak.</p>

<p>"I meticulously maintained that ship," Mr Willson told CNN, shocked over the sinking. "We had it for 15 years, and we had no problem with it."</p>

<p>"It haunts me, and I lose sleep over it," he said.</p>

<p>Today, the city of Stockton is managing the operation to remove the Aurora, though no clear ownership of the ship exists. Chris Willson, who built a large following on YouTube around the restoration project, continues to reflect on his time with the ship, describing it as one of the most fulfilling experiences of his life despite the unfortunate outcome. "I don't have any regrets on what I've done," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces today began "ground raids" in southern Lebanese villages, targeting Hezbollah strongholds. As the Israeli invasion begins, the ghost of past incursions into the Levantine nation is still fresh in the minds of its citizens. The last invasion, the 2006 Lebanon War, was a 34-day conflict that exposed military, political, and strategic gaps on both sides. The Israeli forces, initially confident in their superiority, were soon bogged down by Hezbollah's guerilla tactics, leading to heavy losses and a stalemate that both sides declared as a victory.</p>

<p>Now, nearly two decades later, Israel's military appears to have internalised the lessons from that conflict, preparing for what may be the most decisive military engagement in its history with Hezbollah, whose leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an airstrike in Beirut two days ago.</p>

<h2><strong>1982: The First Invasion</strong></h2>

<p>Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 which gave birth to Hezbollah, was born out of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. With Israel pushing into Lebanese territory, particularly in the country's eastern Bekaa region, Hezbollah emerged as a resistance force with the backing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Over time, Hezbollah would become one of the most formidable non-state actors in the Middle East and a persistent thorn in Israel's side.</p>

</div>

<p>Three years later, in 1985, Hezbollah took a more formal shape with the establishment of its military arm, the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon. Early operations focused on suicide bombings and guerrilla warfare, particularly targeting Israeli forces in the south, often in coordination with the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a mostly Christian militia allied with Israel.</p>

<h2><strong>The 2006 Lebanon War</strong></h2>

<p>The 2006 Lebanon War began on July 12, when Hezbollah fighters staged a cross-border raid, capturing two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. What followed was an escalation of military conflict that saw Israeli forces pushing into southern Lebanon to confront Hezbollah. However, from the outset, Israel's military faced unexpected resistance.</p>

<p>Less than a mile into Lebanese territory, Israeli soldiers found themselves entangled in fierce battles with Hezbollah. The 34-day conflict witnessed the deaths of 121 Israeli soldiers, the destruction of several tanks by shoulder-fired missiles, and Hezbollah's continued ability to launch rocket attacks into Israel.</p>

<p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who led the country during the war, later reflected on the conflict's shortcomings, stating that the Israeli army had been unprepared for a comprehensive ground operation. The Winograd Commission, a government-appointed body tasked with evaluating the war's outcome, accused the Israeli leadership of rushing into a poorly planned operation. Intelligence failures, logistical missteps, and underestimating Hezbollah's capabilities led to what the commission described as a "serious, missed opportunity" to deal a more decisive blow to the militant group.</p>

<p>Despite these setbacks, the war officially ended with both Israel and Hezbollah claiming victory. Israel's military had inflicted significant damage on Hezbollah, while Hezbollah managed to withstand the assault and continue launching attacks until the ceasefire brokered by the United Nations took effect.</p>

<h2><strong>Learning From The Past</strong></h2>

<p>Today, as Israeli forces prepare for another potential invasion of Lebanon, the lessons of 2006 are key to their strategy. In recent weeks, Israel has employed a pre-emptive approach, targeting Hezbollah's logistics and communication infrastructure. Key weapons depots have been destroyed, and senior Hezbollah commanders, including Nasrallah, have been eliminated. This decapitation of Hezbollah's leadership has shocked the organisation, which had built its identity around resisting Israeli incursions.</p>

</div>

<p>These attacks are the culmination of years of intelligence gathering and military planning. Unlike in 2006, when Israeli forces struggled to locate and target Hezbollah's positions, Israel today appears to have built a robust intelligence network capable of pinpointing key Hezbollah assets. Military exercises, refined battle plans, and a multilayered air defence system now form the backbone of Israel's defensive and offensive might.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has amassed an arsenal of an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, has been significantly weakened in recent weeks. With its leadership in disarray and hundreds of its fighters either killed or wounded, it is unclear how effectively the group can mount a challenge.</p>

<h2><strong>Risk Of Regional Escalation</strong></h2>

<p>While Israel's military might has grown significantly since 2006, the landscape of the region has also changed. One of the most pressing concerns for Israel is the possibility of the conflict expanding beyond Lebanon's borders. Hezbollah's ties to Iran, and the growing coordination between Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, present a real risk of the war becoming a regionwide conflagration. Iran's Axis Of Resistance - a collective of armed Shia militias around the Middle East - is capable of launching ballistic missiles into Israel.</p>

<p>Tehran, which has invested heavily in Hezbollah's military infrastructure over the past two decades, may not sit idly by if Israel continues its offensive. In such a scenario, the risk of Iranian forces or their proxies becoming directly involved in the conflict increases, potentially drawing the United States and other regional powers into the fray.</p>

<h2><strong>Challenges Of A Ground Invasion</strong></h2>

<p>A ground invasion of Lebanon comes with significant risks. Hezbollah, while weakened, still poses a threat to Israeli forces, particularly in close-quarters combat. Over the years, Hezbollah has developed extensive defensive infrastructure, including tunnels, bunkers, and fortified positions, which could turn any ground operation into a prolonged and bloody conflict - as evident from Israel's ongoing war in Gaza where they have faced similar threats.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">A fire following Israeli bombardment on an area of south Lebanon.<br />
<span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>Hezbollah's fighters are also battle-hardened from their involvement in Syria's civil war, where they fought alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces against a variety of rebel groups.</p>

<p>Adding to these challenges is the terrain of southern Lebanon, a region that Hezbollah knows intimately. The dense urban and mountainous landscapes provide ample cover for guerrilla fighters, making it difficult for Israeli forces to engage Hezbollah without suffering significant casualties.</p>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah's Response</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah, for its part, has also learned from its past encounters with Israel. Following the 2006 conflict, former Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah admitted that the group had miscalculated Israel's response to its cross-border raid. In the years since, with the backing of Iran, Hezbollah has bolstered its military capabilities. It has amassed a vast arsenal of rockets, missiles, and drones, while also constructing elaborate defences in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>However, with Nasrallah and other senior Hezbollah commanders now dead, the organisation's ability to coordinate a coherent response to Israel's strikes is in question. The extent to which Hezbollah can resist Israel's military onslaught may ultimately depend on Iran's role in the conflict. Tehran has long used Hezbollah as a proxy to exert influence in the region and challenge Israeli power. With Hezbollah now reeling from Israel's recent attacks, Iran may seek to provide additional support to prevent the collapse of its most important ally in the Levant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wanted for alleged money laundering charges, controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik has arrived in Pakistan on Monday morning at the invitation of the Government of Pakistan, amid tight security for his lecture series at Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore.</p>

<p>According to the Express Tribune, he is set to have public interactions across the country. He is accompanied by his son, Fariq Naik, who is an Islamic scholar and will tour the country with him for the lectures.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at the New Islamabad Airport, he was received by leaders from the top echelons of the Pakistan government, which included the Chairman of the Pakistan Prime Minister's Youth Program, Rana Mashhood and Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Syed Atta-ur-Rehman, as reported by the Tribune.</p>

<p>Official sources note that his month-long tour will include meetings with senior government officials and involve participation in various public events.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Zakir Naik's team announced," On the invitation of the Government of Pakistan Dr Zakir Naik &amp; Shaikh Fariq Naik's Pakistan Tour 2024 Public Talks: Karachi - 5th &amp; 6th Oct Lahore - 12th &amp; 13th Oct Islamabad - 19th &amp; 20th Oct."</p>

<p>Earlier on August 20, while on a visit to India, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that if sufficient evidence is presented in the case related to fugitive preacher Zakir Naik then the country will 'not condone terrorism'.</p>

<p>Addressing the 50th Sapru House Lecture the Malaysian Prime Minister said, "I am talking about sentiment of extremism, of compelling case, evidence that suggest that atrocities committed by an individual, group or factions or parties. These are of concern to us."</p>

<p>Zakir Naik is known for his inflammatory speeches and is currently wanted by the National Investigation Agency of the Government of India under a 2016 money laundering case. He is also alleged to have incited people by his hate speech.</p>

<p>Naik runs a channel by the name PeaceTV, which is banned across India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka due to its controversial nature and he has also been denied entry into Canada and the United Kingdom because of it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google plans to invest $1 billion to build digital infrastructure in Thailand, including a new data centre, the US tech giant has announced, saying the move would support 14,000 jobs in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The new hubs in Bangkok and the industrial area of Chonburi are intended to help meet the growing demand for cloud computing in Southeast Asia, the company said in a Monday statement.</p>

<p>Google's investment comes after Microsoft announced in May that it would create Thailand's first data centre region to boost cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure.</p>

<p>"These investments will empower Thai businesses, innovators, and communities to harness the power of cloud and AI technology," Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Google and its parent company Alphabet, said.</p>

<p>The investment's details were unveiled after a Bangkok meeting between Porat and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who hailed the move as proof Thailand was becoming a major digital hub in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The data centre will be located in Chonburi, a major industrial area southeast of Bangkok, while the cloud facilities will be in the capital itself.</p>

<p>Google's expansion in Thailand will add $4 billion to the kingdom's GDP by 2029 and support 14,000 jobs between 2025 and 2029, the company said, citing a report from consultancy Deloitte.</p>

<p>The announcement comes a year after Shinawatra's predecessor Srettha Thavisin made a major push for investment from US tech giants during a trip to New York, seeking finance from Google, Microsoft and Elon Musk's Tesla.</p>

<p>Thailand is Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, but its tech sector has lagged behind the likes of Singapore and Indonesia.</p>

<p>The Thai economy, long focused on traditional manufacturing, agriculture and tourism, has struggled to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The government hopes investment from Google, Microsoft and their ilk will diversify and modernise the kingdom's economy.</p>

<p>Thailand's Office of the National Digital Economy and Society Commission has said the digital economy could contribute as much as 30 per cent of GDP by 2027.</p>

<p>Across the region, governments are vying for US tech dollars, with Vietnam making a drive to move up the value chain from its traditional base as a hub for producing shoes, clothes and furniture.</p>

<p>Vietnam hopes to cash in on the US move to become less dependent on China for key resources including high-tech chips.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[After centuries of decline, concerted conservation efforts have led to a remarkable resurgence of the Northern Bald Ibis in Europe.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After over three centuries of absence in Europe, the northern bald ibis, once thought to exist only in drawings, has made a comeback. This bird, with its glossy plumage and distinctive curved beak, once thrived across three continents and held symbolic significance in ancient cultures, where it even had its own hieroglyph symbolising the word "spirit."</p>

<p>However, by the late 20th century, the species dwindled to just 59 breeding pairs, all confined to Morocco. Human activities, including hunting, habitat destruction and pesticide use, drove the bird to the edge of extinction. Yet, through dedicated conservation efforts, the northern bald ibis is now clawing its way back from near oblivion, according to a report in CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>Conservation success in Morocco</strong></h3>

<p>The remaining wild population of northern bald ibises is primarily found in Morocco, where conservation initiatives have stabilised their numbers. In 1991, the establishment of the Souss-Massa National Park on Morocco's west coast provided much-needed protection for the bird's breeding and feeding habitats. A research programme launched in 1994 helped monitor the population, leading to a significant recovery. Today, there are over 500 individuals in the wild, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has downgraded the species' status from "critically endangered" to "endangered."</p>

<p>These birds, which prefer to nest in cliffs, rocky outcrops and even urban ruins, are adaptive foragers. Their diet consists mainly of insects and larvae, though they are forced to adapt to the remote and changing nature of their habitats.</p>

<h3><strong>Comeback in Europe</strong></h3>

<p>Though the Moroccan population was always thriving, the species long disappeared from its European range. Projects to reintroduce the northern bald ibis to Europe have now begun yielding results, stated the CNN report. One of the most notable efforts is underway in Spain, where a programme in Andalusia has successfully reintroduced birds into the wild. Hand-reared by human 'parents,' the chicks are gradually released into their natural habitat. This initiative, which began in 2004, has helped re-establish the species in southern Europe.</p>

<p>In Austria and Germany, a programme led by Austrian biologist Johannes Fritz is taking a unique approach to reintroducing a migratory population. The birds, raised in captivity and lacking the knowledge of migratory routes, are taught to migrate by following a tiny aircraft. As the ultralight aircraft soars through the sky, human foster parents cheer and wave from the back, offering encouragement to the birds in flight, reported The Guardian.</p>

<p>At the controls is Fritz, piloting the aircraft equipped with a small fan motor at the rear and a yellow parachute to keep it airborne. Since 2003, Fritz and his team have guided northern bald ibises from Germany to southern Europe in this manner. The birds now follow a route that has recently been adjusted to end in Spain due to environmental changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Challenges and threats</strong></h3>

<p>While conservation efforts have brought some success, the northern bald ibis still faces a few challenges. Threats such as poaching, pesticides and climate change continue to jeopardise their survival. In 2023, poaching alone accounted for the loss of 17 per cent&nbsp;of migrating birds in Europe. The changing climate is also forcing the ibises to adjust their migration patterns, and the timing of their journeys has had to shift to account for altered environmental conditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inauguration of a new runaway in the Maldives built under an airport redevelopment project assisted by India and the official launch of the RuPay card in the island nation on Monday are aimed at boosting economic ties and tourism cooperation between the two countries.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian Mohamed Muizzu jointly virtually inaugurated the runway at the Hanimadhoo International Airport and also witnessed via weblink a live transaction using a RuPay payment service card in the Maldives.</p>

<p>The launch took place after the two leaders held extensive talks which Muizzu in his press statement said were to "chart a new path for the future".</p>

<p>The Maldivian president accompanied by First Lady Madam Sajidha Mohamed and a Maldivian delegation arrived in India on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Though the Maldivian president attended PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony in June, it is his first bilateral visit to India.</p>

<p>Prior to the launch of different India-assisted projects in the Maldives, a small official video was played in which details about these projects were shared in the presence of the two leaders at the Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>"The bonds between India and Maldives stretch back centuries, woven together through rich trade and cultural exchanges," it was narrated in the video.</p>

<p>Over the years, this relationship has evolved, characterised by "mutual respect and unwavering support", underpinned by India's Neighbourhood First policy and SAGAR vision, it said.</p>

<p>India has always been the first responder in the Maldives during times of crisis.</p>

<p>"Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Mohamed Muizzu, this relationship is to achieve greater heights," it added.</p>

<p>The RuPay card launch today will pave the way for strengthened India-Maldives relations by boosting tourism and economic cooperation, according to the India-Maldives video.</p>

<p>"It will allow Indian tourists to make cashless transactions easily, reducing cost and enhancing convenience, especially in the Maldives tourism sector," it said.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the new runaway at Hanimadhoo International Airport marks a "significant milestone in the airport's ongoing expansion project".</p>

<p>Its redevelopment, under an "Indian Line of Credit of USD 132 million", aims to provide complete new infrastructure including runaway, ATC tower, ARFF block, hangar, cargo facilities, and passenger terminal building, it added.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi in his press statement after the bilateral talks said President Muizzu's visit adds "another chapter to our ties".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab government on Monday banned jailed former premier Imran Khan from meeting his family members, lawyers and party leaders till October 18 due to "security concerns", amidst his party staging anti-government protests in several cities.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Khan has been lodged in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail in multiple cases since August 2023.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused PTI of trying to disrupt the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit scheduled to be held on Oct 15 and 16 in Islamabad and emphasised that the government will ensure that these plans do not succeed.</p>

<p>"Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been banned from meeting their family, lawyers, and party leaders at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, till Oct 18," a Punjab government official said.</p>

<p>The government has decided given "security concerns", he said.</p>

<p>According to PTI sources, the government has decided in anticipation of the upcoming SCO summit.</p>

<p>The coalition government led by PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that PTI is staging protests in Islamabad to sabotage the summit. The Pakistan Army has been called in to provide security for the SCO summit.</p>

<p>Earlier, security agencies arrested six Adiala jail staff for aiding the PTI founder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a PTI spokesperson said the legal team of Khan will file a petition in court, requesting the lifting of a ban on meetings with Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi. "Justice Sardar Ijaz of Islamabad High Court had ordered the authorities not too long ago to arrange meetings via video link, if not possible physically, given the number of cases Imran Khan has to deal with, legal consultation is given and, therefore should be provided," he said.</p>

<p>PTI supporters held anti-government protests in several parts of Pakistan, including Islamabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero was killed on Sunday less than a week after he took office, the state's governor confirmed.</p>

<p>Alejandro Arcos was killed just six days after he took office as mayor of the city of Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in southwestern Mexico.</p>

<p>"His loss mourns the entire Guerrero society and fills us with indignation," Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said in a statement shared on social media.</p>

<p>Guerrero's state attorney general's office also said it was investigating his murder.</p>

<p>The official confirmation came after photos circulated on the messaging app WhatsApp depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos. Reuters could not independently verify the photos' authenticity.</p>

<p>Arcos' death comes just three days after the new city government's secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot to death.</p>

<p>"They were young and honest officials who sought progress for their community," Senator Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Moreno, who is the head of Mexico's PRI political party, called on the federal attorney general's office to lead the investigation into Arcos and Tapia's murders, given "the situation of ungovernability in Guerrero."</p>

<p>Guerrero has become one of the deadliest states for aspiring and elected public officials, as well as for journalists.</p>

<p>At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's June 2 elections.</p>

<p>Arcos' social media posts show the mayor in recent days had been supervising disaster relief efforts following the impact of Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding in beach resort Acapulco and surrounding towns.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Monday that illegal immigrants were bringing "bad genes" into the United States, doubling down on previous inflammatory rhetoric about migrants poisoning the blood of the country.</p>

<p>Trump was criticizing his Democratic presidential rival Vice President Kamala Harris in a radio interview when he brought up government figures showing there were 13,000 immigrants in the United States who were not in federal immigration detention, despite homicide convictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers, many of them murdered far more than one person? They are now happily living in the United States," he told conservative host Hugh Hewitt.</p>

<p>"You know now, a murderer -- I believe this -- it's in their genes. We've got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. They had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn't be here that are criminals."</p>

<p>Trump was misconstruing data released in September by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.</p>

<p>The figures don't include people incarcerated outside of ICE facilities -- in state, local or other federal facilities, for example -- and they cover a period spanning decades, including when Trump was president.</p>

<p>US media reported Monday that migrant apprehensions at the US-Mexico border fell 75 per cent year-on-year in September -- to the lowest level since the Trump administration -- citing Department of Homeland Security statistics.</p>

<p>"I don't normally defend Trump's statements, and even here he drops the 13,000 released murderers lie," said conservative political commentator Richard Hanania, president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology.</p>

<p>"But he's right that crime is largely genetic. He should just learn about the low crime rate among immigrants and think about the implications."</p>

<p>Trump, who is neck-and-neck with Harris in nationwide and swing-state polling ahead of November's election, has spent much of his campaign demonizing both undocumented immigrants and those in the United States legally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a rally last month, the 78-year-old former reality TV star said Harris should be prosecuted over President Joe Biden's border policies and called illegal immigrants "animals," out to "rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill."</p>

<p>"They will walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat," he said.</p>

<p>And he repeatedly threatened legal Haitian residents in Ohio with deportation, falsely accusing them of eating locals' pets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump -- the oldest major-party White House candidate in history and the first convicted felon to run -- accused immigrants of "poisoning the blood of our country" in December in a phrase that earned him comparisons with Adolf Hitler.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[One year after Hamas's deadly attack on Israel unleashed war in Gaza, the Palestinian territory is unrecognisable and its residents are exhausted by displacement and shortages, with no end in sight.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year after Hamas's deadly attack on Israel unleashed war in Gaza, the Palestinian territory is unrecognisable and its residents are exhausted by displacement and shortages, with no end in sight.</p>

<p>"It felt like the first day of the war all over again", said Khaled al-Hawajri, 46, as the Israeli forces bombarded his Gaza neighbourhood on Monday, even as Israel marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack.</p>

<p>"Last night we were terrorised by the bombardments from quadcopters and tank shells," said Hawajri, who has been displaced 10 times with his family of seven in the past year.</p>

<p>"We have endured a whole year in the north under bombardment, terror, and fear in the hearts of my children," he said, adding he had stayed in Gaza's devastated north because "there is no safe place in the entire Strip".</p>

<p>On Monday, Gaza City was barely recognisable, ravaged by relentless air strikes and fighting.</p>

<p>Residents walked along sand-covered streets stripped of pavements, with buildings either destroyed or left without facades, while piles of rubble littered the roads.</p>

<p>With fuel in short supply and expensive, car traffic was almost nonexistent. Most people walked, cycled or used donkey carts.</p>

<p>"There is no electricity or petroleum products. Even firewood is not available. Food is almost non-existent", said 64-year-old Hussam Mansour, speaking from a street in Gaza City, surrounded by piles of rubble and sand.</p>

<p>The United Nations says 92 per cent of Gaza's roads and more than 84 per cent of its health facilities have been damaged or destroyed in the war.</p>

<p><strong>- Long war -</strong></p>

<p>Mansour and his sons have all been displaced, and his apartment building was destroyed in an air strike.</p>

<p>"Now when I walk the streets, I do not recognise them anymore," he said.</p>

<p>Like Hawajri and Mansour, Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants have endured hardship, with no signs of relief, even after Israel reassigned divisions to the north of the country where troops are fighting Hamas's Lebanese ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>About 90 per cent of the population has been displaced at least once, the United Nations says.</p>

<p>"Last night was one of the hardest nights of the war as if the war had just begun!" said 46-year-old Muhammad al-Muqayyid, displaced from the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>"I never imagined the war would last this long," he said.</p>

<p>"A year has gone and we have seen every kind of suffering -- disease, hunger, danger and loss."</p>

<p>The Israeli military has been fighting Hamas in Gaza since the unprecedented attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,909 people, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The UN acknowledges the figures to be reliable.</p>

<p>A year on, Israel has yet to achieve one of its main objectives: securing the return of all those taken hostage on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>Of the 251 captured that day, 97 are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>The Israeli military is still carrying out operations in Gaza to free the hostages and crush Hamas, in power since 2007.</p>

<p>"There was a sudden ground invasion by tanks, and people were rushing out of their homes without taking anything with them, just carrying their children and running through the streets with fire and shells raining down on them", Muqayyid said, referring to an Israeli military operation in northern Gaza on Sunday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hamas keeps fighting. Its armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said it launched a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.</p>

<p>Samah Ali, a 32-year-old woman displaced in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah, said rocket launches were predictable on this day.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, we heard the sound of rockets launching, and everyone in the camp came out to see where they had been fired from," she said, adding some people fled fearing retaliatory Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>"It's certain that the occupation army will return and strike."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ports throughout Europe have not allowed the ship to dock because it is carrying a staggering 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MV Ruby, a Maltese-registered cargo ship, has been drifting at sea for six weeks after sustaining damage shortly after departing from Russia. Ports throughout Europe have not allowed the ship to dock because of its contents and&nbsp;compromised state. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/europe/ship-explosives.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Times,&nbsp;</a></em>the ship is<em> c</em>arrying a staggering 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in agricultural fertilizers.&nbsp;Due to the dangerous nature of its cargo and damage to the vessel, no port has granted entry for long-term repairs, leaving the MV Ruby in limbo.</p>

<p>When improperly stored or exposed to stressors like heat and pressure, ammonium nitrate can become highly unstable and explosive. Notably, ammonium nitrate was the same substance responsible for the catastrophic Beirut port explosion in August 2020 that&nbsp;claimed 200 lives, displaced 300,000 people, and inflicted 15 billion pounds in damage on the Lebanese capital.&nbsp;Alarmingly,&nbsp;MV Ruby's cargo holds approximately seven times the amount. The potential blast equivalent to an atomic bomb has raised serious concerns, emphasising the urgent need to ensure the safe disposal or repair of the vessel.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the MV Ruby remained 14 miles off the coast of Kent, in southeastern England, where it has been since last month, as per <em>NYT.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The ship, registered in Malta and owned by Ruby Enterprise, is managed by Serenity Shipping based in the UAE, but its Russian cargo has raised suspicions. Its stalled journey has sparked concerns among governments that it could be a Trojan horse aimed at sabotaging vital shipping and port infrastructure.</p>

<p>The ship's journey began in late August from the Russian port of Kandalaksha, with a reported destination of the Canary Islands. However, after sustaining damage, the Ruby attempted to dock at Norwegian and Lithuanian ports, only to be refused due to security concerns.&nbsp;Lithuania's Foreign Minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, made it clear that despite no evidence of malicious intent, the country cannot afford to let its guard down when dealing with Russia.</p>

<p>''When we are dealing with Russia or other international actors that are unfriendly to us, we always keep this possibility in mind,'' Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authorities in Sweden also denied the vessel to dock in Gothenburg and Uddevalla ports which are closer to populated regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MV Ruby then headed to Britain, only to be met with heightened scrutiny. Lithuania's former ambassador to Britain, Eitvydas Bajarunas labelled the ship a "floating megabomb" in a think tank column, warning of potential Russian sabotage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MV Ruby's managers have requested permission to dock, transfer its 20,000 tons of ammonium nitrate to another vessel, and undergo essential repairs. However, British authorities have yet to respond. In the meantime, the ship has refuelled while anchored at sea, according to the British Coast Guard.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air raid sirens echoed across central Israel including Tel Aviv after surface-to-surface missiles were fired from Yemen on Israel on the first anniversary of deadly attacks in Israel where over 1,200 people were killed. Israel did not mention who fired the missile, but Iran-backed Houthis - A Shia militant group in Yemen - have over the past year attacked Israel several times in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>Several events were organised across Israel to remember those who died in the attacks carried out by Hamas. Videos show people hiding for cover as air raid sirens went off. Several journalists lying on the ground when missile warnings were issued.</p>

<p>In another video, people in a mall were running for safety after the aerial missile attack, which Israel said was intercepted by the air force.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Militants abducted 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>At least 41,870 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The UN has acknowledged these figures as reliable.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Sunday it <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-deploys-more-troops-near-gaza-ahead-of-oct-7-attack-anniversary-6731132">deployed more troops</a> to defend southern communities and areas bordering Gaza, ahead of the anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas.</p>

<p>Inside Gaza, the military said three divisions were working to "dismantle terrorist infrastructure and degrade Hamas's capabilities".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said it struck more than 120 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon within a 60-minute period as part of extensive strikes on Monday.</p>

<p>"The IAF (air force) conducted an extensive aerial operation and struck over 120 terror targets in southern Lebanon within an hour," the military said in a statement, adding the targets belonged to the group's elite Radwan forces and other units.</p>

<p>Israel on Monday battled on multiple fronts, intensifying its battle with Lebanon's Hezbollah as Hamas warned of a long war on the first anniversary of the deadliest attack in Israeli history.<br />
But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said both wars would ensure the violence his country endured last October 7 could never be repeated.</p>

<p>Israel's military said air defences also intercepted a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-people-run-for-cover-after-air-raid-sirens-go-off-in-israel-6738131">missile fired from Yemen</a>.</p>

<p>Tehran, which arms and finances Hezbollah and backs the Yemeni rebels, praised Hamas's October 7 attack as Iran awaits what Israel said will be retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Israel last week.</p>

<p>Pope Francis condemned the "shameful inability" of world powers to end the conflict in the Middle East, which European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said is "on the verge of a complete conflagration that the international community looks unable to control".</p>

<p>Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said the movement "choose to keep up the fight in a long war of attrition, one that is painful and costly for the enemy".</p>

<p>He also said scores of people taken <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/on-first-anniversary-of-war-with-israel-fate-of-63-hostages-held-in-gaza-unknown-6736725">hostage into Gaza </a>last October 7 were enduring a "very difficult" situation.</p>

<p><strong>Thousands of militants killed</strong></p>

<p>A senior Hamas official has acknowledged that "several thousand fighters from the movement and other resistance groups died in combat".</p>

<p>When the Gaza war began, Netanyahu vowed to "crush" Hamas, but troops have found themselves returning again to areas to confront signs the movement was trying to rebuild.</p>

<p>"We are changing the security reality in our region; for the sake of our children, for the sake of our future, to ensure that what happened on the seventh of October will not happen again. Never again," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-october-7-the-day-we-failed-israels-army-chief-on-gaza-war-anniversary-6733766">Netanyahu said</a> in a cabinet address.</p>

<p>"Never again" is a phrase associated with efforts to ensure the Holocaust and other genocides are not repeated.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has also vowed to bring home hostages still held in Gaza, but critics in Israel have accused him of obstructing international efforts for a truce and hostage-release deal.</p>

<p>Late last month Israel turned its focus north towards Hezbollah, with intensified air strikes in Lebanon and, since last week, "targeted" ground raids.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says the aim is to ensure tens of thousands of Israelis forced to flee Hezbollah fire can return home safely.</p>

<p>On Monday the military said it would expand its operations against Hezbollah to Lebanon's coast south of the Al-Awali river, and warned people to stay away from the shore in the area.</p>

<p>It said Hezbollah had fired about 135 projectiles into Israel on Monday while Israeli forces hit back by striking "over 120 terror targets in southern Lebanon within an hour".</p>

<p><strong>More troops deployed</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli soldiers in two south Lebanon border villages, including Maroun al-Ras where it has reported previous clashes, as the army said it had deployed another division for operations across the border.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said bombardment killed 10 firefighters earlier.</p>

<p>Israel's military said at least four projectiles were fired from Gaza just after October 7 commemorations began, and it hit back at "terrorist infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>Hamas said it had fired rockets near the border with Gaza and at Tel Aviv, while Hezbollah twice said it had fired rockets at areas north of Haifa, a major coastal city.</p>

<p>As troops fought what Israel says is a war for its very existence, vigils at massacre sites and rallies called for the return of hostages a year after their abduction.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Families of the dead wept in Reim, a kibbutz community where Hamas fighters killed at least 370 people at the site of the Nova music festival, that day's deadliest attack.</p>

<p>President Isaac Herzog led a moment's silence there at 6:29 am - the time the attack began.</p>

<p>Mourners also gathered in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv amid the sound of war as Hamas fired a rocket barrage.</p>

<p>"It still feels surreal, like a nightmare that we are still supposed to wake up from eventually," said resident Ariel Tamir.</p>

<p>In Jerusalem, Shir Siegel said the wait for her hostage father's return from captivity has been agonising.</p>

<p>"A year has passed but actually one long day has passed that feels like an eternity," she said.</p>

<p>Early on October 7, 2023, the Hamas attack began with thousands of rockets fired at Israeli border communities.</p>

<p>At the same time militants stormed across Gaza's fortified border and attacked nearly 50 different sites, including kibbutzim communities and army bases as well as the music festival.</p>

<p>Militants went door-to-door shooting residents dead.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza's 'graveyard'</strong></p>

<p>Hours later, Israel launched a military offensive that has reduced <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/theres-no-safe-place-exhausted-gazans-after-1-year-of-war-6738373">swathes of Gaza to rubble</a>, and displaced nearly all of its 2.4 million residents at least once amid an unrelenting humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X Monday the war had turned Gaza into a "graveyard".</p>

<p>Militants took 251 people hostage into Gaza, where 97 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>An Israeli campaign group on Monday announced the death of Gaza hostage Idan Shtivi, 28, who was abducted at the music festival.</p>

<p>Since Israel's escalation in Lebanon began in late September, more than 1,110 people have been killed and more than one million are displaced, official figures show.</p>

<p>According to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry, 41,909 people, the majority civilians, have been killed there since the start of the war. The figures have been deemed reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Israel's military says 349 soldiers have been killed since the Gaza ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>People in Gaza just want the war to end.</p>

<p>"It feels like the world stopped on October 7," said one displaced woman, Israa Abu Matar, 26.</p>

<p>"I have grown old while watching my children hungry, scared, having nightmares and screaming day and night from the sound of the bombing and shells."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Monday arrested a medic for "Satanism" and "promoting same-sex relationships", as Moscow intensifies a legal crackdown on LGBTQ rights, in defence of what it calls "traditional family values".</p>

<p>Moscow has for years created a hostile environment for LGBTQ people, a trend it hugely accelerated since sending troops to Ukraine in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The powerful FSB security service said it had arrested the head of a medical institution in the central Ulyanovsk region, accusing him of "devil worshipping".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such accusations from state authorities are rare, but the influence of the Orthodox Church has steadily risen as Russia takes an increasingly conservative social turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In the course of operational searches, it was established that this person, being a supporter of Satanism, promoted the idea of same-sex relations among subordinate employees as a way of initiating them into devil worshipping," the FSB said.</p>

<p>It said the man had "misled citizens into believing that it was necessary to adopt the cult in order to gain financial prosperity and achieve career advancement". &nbsp;</p>

<p>It said a criminal case has been opened over coercion to engage in sexual acts and participate in an extremist organisation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The FSB published a video of the man being arrested in his apartment and led away by masked men in camouflage uniform.</p>

<p>Russia banned what it called the "international LGBT movement" in November last year. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It ranks last place -- 48th -- in a European ranking of countries' laws and policies that have a direct impact on LGBTQ people. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu is in India for a state visit, a significant moment in bilateral relations after the diplomatic relations between the states were severely affected when three Maldivian ministers made derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Modi. Mr Muizzu has sought a Rs 3,000 crore currency swap deal with India to boost Maldivian foreign exchange reserves amid an economic crisis.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, briefed the media on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maldives-president-mohamed-muizzi-india-visit-wont-do-anything-to-undermine-security-of-india-maldives-president-6732730">bilateral talks</a> held between the leaders of the countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A journalist asked Mr Misri in Hindi about the turnaround in the India-Maldives relationship and said, "Sir, yeh Maldives <em>ke saath dooriyan nazdeekiyan mein badal gayi, yeh kya ittefaq hai</em>? (The differences with Maldives have been turned to closeness. Do you think this is a coincidence?) To which Misri replied in Hindi, "<em>Dooriyan, nazdeekiyan, ittefaq</em>...I don't think you could add more names of Hindi films in one question but I would say, "Yaarana chalta rahega" (Friendship will continue).</p>

<p>"We are making progress on several development projects in the Maldives, today there was recognition by both leaders of the importance of this relationship, especially given the geographical proximity that exists between the two countries and the many ways in which the relationship is mutually beneficial," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maldives-president-mohamed-muizzu-arrives-in-india-for-1st-bilateral-visit-6729397">Muizzu arrived in Delhi </a>Sunday evening and, after a day's rest, was accorded a ceremonial welcome by President Droupadi Murmu and the Prime Minister at Raj Bhavan, after which he paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat and then went into a huddle with Prime Minister Modi.</p>

<p>At a joint statement after the two leaders met, Prime Minister Modi underlined New Delhi's position as a "close friend" of the island nation, emphasising his 'neighbourhood first' foreign policy that has seen India act as a 'first responder' to emergencies affecting Male, including supplying Covid vaccines.</p>

<p>"Be it essential commodities, vaccines during Covid, or drinking water... we have played a good neighbour," he said, adding India had today also virtually inaugurated the Hanimaadhoo International Airport on the Haa Dhaalu Atoll and, earlier, handed over 700 social housing units, as well as set up a drinking water and sewerage project to serve nearly 30,000 people across 28 Maldivian islands.</p>

<p>The Maldives, the PM then said, also has an important role - to help ensure the security of the Indian Ocean Region. This is an issue that was red-flagged by many within the government after Mr Muizzu - seen as a 'pro-China' leader - won last year's election on what was called an 'India out' platform.</p>

<p>That platform included requesting Delhi to withdraw 90 military personnel in the Maldives to maintain and operate three aviation platforms for humanitarian and medical aid.</p>

<p>These three - two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft - were a gift from India.</p>

<p>After talks, Delhi replaced military personnel with "competent technical" staff.</p>

<p>Apart from the ejection of the military staff - of which Mr Muizzu has said he simply "did what the people of Maldives asked of me" - February's docking of a Chinese spy ship masquerading as a research vessel also raised eyebrows after similar vessels docked at Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accepted Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu's invitation to travel to Male on a state visit next year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri announced on Monday.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary said that the dates for PM Modi's visit will be worked out through diplomatic channels.</p>

<p>"President Muizzu expressed his gratitude for the very warm welcome that he and his delegation have received here. He extended an invitation to the Prime Minister to visit Maldives on a State visit next year. The Prime Minister accepted the invitation and the dates for the visit will worked out through diplomatic channels," Mr Misri said at a special briefing on Monday.</p>

<p>He said that the engagements and outcomes during Muizzu's visit will enable the ties between the two nations to scale new heights in the coming years.</p>

<p>"Overall, I would say that the engagements and outcomes during this visit will enable the India-Maldives relationship to scale new heights in the coming years and make it more fit for purpose to handle the challenges that we see emerging in this region in the coming years," Misri said in the briefing.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, PM Modi and President Muizzu held bilateral talks at Hyderabad House on Monday. Following the bilateral meeting, the two leaders also held delegation-level talks at Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh were among other delegates who were present on the occasion.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, "Taking forward India-Maldives special ties! PM Narendra Modi warmly received President Mohamed Muizzu of Maldives as the latter arrived at Hyderabad House. Extensive discussions on India-Maldives bilateral relations lie ahead."</p>

<p>Following his meeting with the Maldives President, PM Modi said that India would cooperate in training the Maldivian Defence Forces to bring about peace and stability in the Indian Ocean Region.</p>

<p>"We also held a detailed discussion on different aspects of security cooperation. Work is being done rapidly in Ekatha Harbour project. We will continue our cooperation towards training and capacity building of Maldives National Defence Forces. For stability and prosperity in Indian Ocean Region, we will work together," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that climate change is a huge challenge for both nations and he would share India's experiences with Maldives regarding solar and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>"Climate change is a huge challenge for both of our countries. In this regard, India is ready to share its experiences with Maldives regarding solar and energy efficiency," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu, who arrived in India on Sunday on a five-day visit was accorded a ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan earlier today.</p>

<p>President Droupadi Murmu and PM Modi received the Maldivian President and First Lady Sajidha Mohamed as they arrived at Rashtrapati Bhavan.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu and Maldives First Lady paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. After paying tribute at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial, Muizzu also signed the visitors' book at Rajghat.</p>

<p>It is President Muizzu's first bilateral visit to India after assuming office. He visited India in June 2024 to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Modi and the Council of Ministers.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded on Monday to two US scientists for discovering microRNA, a previously unknown type of genetic switch which is hoped can pave the way for new medical breakthroughs.</p>

<p>But while several treatments and tests are under development using microRNAs against cancer, heart disease, viruses and other illnesses, none have actually yet reached patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the world paid little attention when the new Nobel laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun revealed their discovery decades ago, thinking it was just "something weird about worms", Cambridge University geneticist Eric Miska told AFP.</p>

<p>Here is an explainer about how exactly these tiny genetic switches work inside our bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- What is microRNA? -</strong></p>

<p>Each cell in the human body has the same set of instructions, called DNA. Some turn into brain cells, while others become muscles.</p>

<p>So how do the cells know what to become? The relevant part of the DNA's instructions is pointed to via a process called gene regulation.</p>

<p>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) normally serves as a messenger. It delivers the instructions from the DNA to proteins, which are the building blocks of life that turn cells into brains -- or muscles.</p>

<p>Miska gave the example of the messenger RNA vaccines rolled out against Covid-19 during the pandemic, which insert a message with new instructions to build proteins that block viruses.</p>

<p>But the two new Nobel winners Ambros and Ruvkun discovered a whole new type of gene regulator that had previously been overlooked by science.</p>

<p>Rather than being the messenger which relays information, microRNA instead acts as a switch to turn other genes off and on.</p>

<p>"This was a whole new level of control that we had totally missed," said Miska, who has worked on microRNA for two decades, including with the new Nobel laureates.</p>

<p>"The discovery of microRNAs brought an additional level of complexity by revealing that regions that were thought to be non-coding play a role in gene regulation," French researcher Benoit Ballester told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- What did the Nobel winners do? -</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1980s, Ambros and Ruvkun had been working separately on how genes interact in one-millimetre-long roundworms called C.elegans.</p>

<p>When they compared their work, it led to the discovery of microRNA. Ambros revealed the finding in a 1993 paper.</p>

<p>"Nobody really paid much attention," Miska said, explaining that most scientists at the time thought it only applied to worms.</p>

<p>Then in 2000, Ruvkun published research showing that microRNA is present right across the animal kingdom, including in humans and even some viruses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This was not just something weird that worms do, but in fact all animals and plants are totally dependent for development and normal function on them," Miska said.</p>

<p>More than a thousand genes that respond to microRNAs are now believed to be in the human body.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- How could this help us? -</strong></p>

<p>There are numerous new treatments and tests using microRNA that are undergoing trials but none have been made widely available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Though there are no very clear applications available yet in microRNAs, understanding them, knowing that they exist, understanding their counter-regulatory networks, is always the first step," the Karolinska Institute's Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam told journalists in Stockholm.</p>

<p>MicroRNAs are particularly promising for fighting cancer because some of these switches "act as a tumour suppressor, so they put a brake on cells dividing inappropriately," Miska said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Others, meanwhile, induce "cells to divide, which can lead to cancer", he added.</p>

<p>Because many viruses use microRNAs, several antiviral drugs are at varying stages of development, including for hepatitis C.</p>

<p>One complicating factor has been that microRNAs can be unstable.</p>

<p>But scientists also hope they can be used as a test called a "biomarker", which could reveal what type of cancer a patient could be suffering from, for example.</p>

<p><strong>- What next? -</strong></p>

<p>It also appears probable that microRNAs could be involved in the evolution of our species, Miska said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It seems very likely that microRNAs have important roles in why the human brain is different from the brains of other primates," Miska said.</p>

<p>While human brains are difficult to study, Miska hoped future research would discover more.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revolutionary hypersonic jet, capable of flying from London to New York in just one hour, is set to take to the skies for its inaugural test flight in 2025. Developed by startup engineering company Venus Aerospace, this futuristic plane will reach astonishing speeds of up to Mach 6 (3,600mph/5,795km/h),&nbsp;which is six times the speed of sound. According to a report by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/07/hypersonic-jet-can-reach-speeds-3-600mph-take-test-flight-2025-21744504/#:~:text=The%20Venus%20Detonation%20Ramjet%202000,miles)%20in%20just%20one%20hour." rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro</a></em>, the Venus Detonation Ramjet 2000 lb Thrust Engine, or VDR2, is the powerhouse behind this breakthrough, enabling hypersonic flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In partnership with aerospace company Velontra, Venus Aerospace plans to conduct the test flight next year, paving the way for the "high-speed flight economy." Unlike traditional aircraft, this hypersonic jet will fly higher than traditional aircraft, utilising conventional jet engines for takeoff before transitioning to rocket propulsion at altitude. Although not technically reaching the edge of space, passengers will witness breathtaking views of the Earth's curvature and the darkness of space above.</p>

<p>Unveiling the new engine at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17947070029975807/?hl=en">Up. Summit</a>, Venus Aerospace co-founder Andrew Duggleby said, ''This engine makes the hypersonic economy a reality.&nbsp;We are excited to partner with Velontra to achieve this revolution in high-speed flight, given their expertise in high-speed air combustion.''</p>

<p>Eric Briggs, Velontra's Chief Operating Officer, said, ''We can't wait to dig in, make the first one fly, and ultimately perfect an engine concept that has lived mostly in textbooks but never as a production unit in the air. We couldn't think of a better partner than Venus. Rocketry pioneers in their own right, and ready to tackle the hard problems, we are eager to fly the same path with them.''</p>

<p>The hypersonic aviation landscape is heating up, with multiple players racing to develop revolutionary aircraft. Sierra Space and Hermeus are also joining Venus Aerospace in the pursuit of Mach 6-capable planes. Meanwhile, China's Space Transportation is working on a "rocket with wings" for space tourism and intercity travel.</p>

<p>These innovative aircraft will transform the flying experience, offering unprecedented speed and efficiency. However, challenges remain, such as managing sonic boom noise and ensuring safety.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared 51 of the state's 67 counties under a state of emergency, predicting Hurricane Milton could have "major, major impacts".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Survivors of deadly Hurricane Helene along the Florida coast were ordered to evacuate again on Monday as authorities warned another major storm was building into a Category 3 and would cause "devastating damage".</p>

<p>Relief workers in the area are still racing to find survivors in the aftermath of Helene, which killed more than 225 people across a handful of states.</p>

<p>Storm surge warnings were issued once again for parts of Florida as Milton, currently a Category 1, approached with winds of 100 miles (161 kilometers) an hour, the US National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory Monday.</p>

<p>Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told CNN that the city was "still cleaning up from Helene" and that the rain from the new storm would be "difficult enough, not to mention the storm surge and wind damage."</p>

<p>Milton "is forecast to intensify rapidly and become a major hurricane later today," and was expected to hit Florida's west coast on Wednesday, the NHC said.</p>

<p>Major hurricanes -- categories 3 and above -- carry minimum wind speeds of 111 miles (178 kilometers) an hour, according to the NHC, which warns "devastating damage will occur" to even well-built homes, while "electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes."</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared 51 of the state's 67 counties under a state of emergency, predicting Milton could have "major, major impacts."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden was briefed on Milton and said in a statement his administration was readying "life-saving resources."</p>

<p>Milton is forecast to move north of the Yucatan Peninsula and across the southern Gulf of Mexico Monday and Tuesday, the NHC said.</p>

<p>Its storm surge will "raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) above ground level" along the northern Yucatan coast and cause "large and destructive waves," it said Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Disinformation blitz</strong></p>

<p>Hurricane Helene hit the Florida coastline as a Category 4 storm, dumping torrential rainfall and causing flash flooding in remote towns in states such as North Carolina.</p>

<p>The storm, which struck Florida on September 26, was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the United States since 2005's Hurricane Katrina -- with the toll still rising.</p>

<p>Communities, particularly those in remote mountainous areas, have been left without power and drinking water.</p>

<p>However, relief efforts have been hit by a wave of false claims and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Among the litany of disinformation is the falsehood pushed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that relief funds have been misappropriated by his rival for the White House, Democrat Kamala Harris, and redirected toward migrants.</p>

<p>The head of the US disaster relief agency has lashed out at a "dangerous" misinformation war being waged over the aftermath.</p>

<p>"It's frankly ridiculous and just plain false ... it's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people," Deanne Criswell, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told ABC.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign nevertheless doubled down, repeating the assertion in a statement Sunday.</p>

<p>FEMA and outside fact-checkers note that a program under the agency's aegis to provide shelter and aid to migrants is funded directly by Congress, entirely separate from disaster-related funding.</p>

<p>ABC reported that law enforcement officials are monitoring threats toward FEMA officials and other recovery agencies prompted by the disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition to Trump's false claim, the Washington Post reported Sunday on other lies about Helene that it said were "adding to the chaos and confusion."</p>

<p>They include a false claim that a dam was about to burst, which the Post said prompted hundreds of people to evacuate unnecessarily, and a "troubling" lie that officials planned to bulldoze bodies under the rubble in one North Carolina town.</p>

<p>One user suggested "a militia go against fema" in a post on social media platform X that has received more than half a million views.</p>

<p>Asked about that post, Criswell said it "has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there."</p>

<p>FEMA has begun debunking the rumors online, as have North Carolina authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US scientist Gary Ruvkun, who on Monday won the Nobel Prize in Medicine with fellow American Victor Ambros for their discovery of microRNA, said winning the honour was like "an earthquake".</p>

<p>"It's a big deal. It's a big one. It's an earthquake," the 72-year-old professor at Harvard Medical School told Swedish public radio SR just after the announcement was made in Stockholm.</p>

<p>He was woken by a call from the Nobel prize committee in the early hours of Monday in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The dog is confused by why it's dark outside and we are running around the house," laughed Ruvkun.</p>

<p>He said he looked forward to attending the Nobel gala in Stockholm on December 10, when the laureates receive their prizes from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf.</p>

<p>He said he had already attended the ceremony "a few times".</p>

<p>"It's a party. You don't think of a bunch of scientists as party animals but we really are."</p>

<p>The Nobel committee failed however to reach Ambros, who learned the news from an SR reporter who called and broke the news.</p>

<p>"Wow, that's incredible! I didn't know that," the 70-year-old professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school said, adding: "Good. Wonderful."</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and a $1 million cheque to be shared by the pair.</p>

<p>Collaborating but working separately, they discovered microRNA, a new class of tiny RNA molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation, which in turn allows each cell to select only relevant instructions.</p>

<p>Gene regulation that goes wrong can lead to serious diseases, such as cancer or diabetes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[For Hamas, the hostages are key bargaining chips in negotiations with Israel aiming to secure a truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hamas militants staged the worst-ever attack on Israel on October 7 last year, they took 251 hostages into the Gaza Strip. Some were already dead.&nbsp;On the first anniversary, Israel believes 63 people, including two children, are still alive, while 34 are confirmed dead but remain in Gaza.</p>

<p>For Hamas, which rules Gaza, the hostages are key bargaining chips in negotiations with Israel aiming to secure a truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Here is what we know about the hostages still held in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>- 51 men, 10 women, two children -</strong></p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by militants on October 7, 2023, 117 have been freed, most of them women, children and foreign workers.</p>

<p>Most were released during a week-long truce in November in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later, Israel believes 63 hostages still held in Gaza are alive.</p>

<p>The army and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum have confirmed 71 others are dead, 34 of whose bodies are still in Gaza. The death of Idan Shtivi was announced on Monday by the Forum.</p>

<p>The military has repatriated the bodies of 37 hostages who either died in Gaza or were killed on October 7 and taken to the territory.</p>

<p>Of the 63 thought to be alive, 56 are Israelis, though some of them have more than one nationality. Another six are Thais and one is Nepalese.</p>

<p>Fifty-one are men and 10 are women. Eleven are military personnel.</p>

<p>Two are children.</p>

<p>The youngest hostage, Kfir Bibas, was just eight-and-a-half months old when he was kidnapped. His brother Ariel was four years old when he was taken to Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas has said the two children are dead, but Israel has not confirmed this.</p>

<p><strong>- No proof of life -</strong></p>

<p>Since the last truce ended on December 1, seven other hostages have been freed alive, all during Israeli military operations.</p>

<p>With no proof of life, it remains uncertain whether the 63 are still alive.</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing said on August 12 that its fighters had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others.</p>

<p>Hamas has announced on several occasions deaths of hostages that Israel has yet to confirm, leaving families in agonising limbo.</p>

<p><strong>- Bodies taken to Gaza -</strong></p>

<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants took several dead back into Gaza with them, including the bodies of 10 Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p>At least 28 other hostages have died in the territory since the start of the war.</p>

<p>Three were killed in error by the Israeli army on December 15, 2023. They were Yotam Haim, 28, Samer El-Talalqa and Alon Shamriz, 26.</p>

<p>The Israeli army accuses Hamas of executing six others in August: Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobonov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino.</p>

<p>They were found dead by soldiers in a tunnel in Rafah, in southern Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>- Festival, kibbutz survivors -</strong></p>

<p>Most of the hostages were taken during the attacks on the Nir Oz kibbutz and the Nova music festival.</p>

<p>At Nir Oz kibbutz, of the at least 76 hostages taken on October 7, 40 were released alive. Another 20 are still in Gaza and believed to be alive. The remaining 16 are dead.</p>

<p>Sixteen people abducted from the festival are thought to be alive and still held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Only nine of at least 43 hostages taken from Nova have been released, while 18 others have died.</p>

<p><strong>- Whole families -</strong></p>

<p>On October 7, whole families were taken to Gaza. For them, the November 2023 truce brought relief but also the heartache of leaving loved ones behind.</p>

<p>French-Israeli children Eitan, Erez and Sahar were freed but their fathers Ohad Yahalomi and Ofer Kalderon are still held.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The teacher was charged with improper relationship between educator and student, a second-degree felony, and is being held at the Comal County Jail.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking incident unfolded in Texas on October 3 when police responded to a 911 call about a suspicious person at an under-construction home in Garden Ridge. Upon arrival, deputies from the Comal County Sheriff's Office made a disturbing discovery - 51-year-old Jennifer Massey, an art teacher at Davenport High School, was found inside with a male juvenile student. The situation quickly escalated, leading to Massey's arrest. Authorities confirmed that Massey was caught having sex with the minor student.&nbsp;The age of the male student was not immediately known.</p>

<p>Massey was charged with improper relationship between educator and student, a second-degree felony, and is being held at the Comal County Jail, as per the <em><u><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/us-news/texas-teacher-51-caught-having-sex-in-under-construction-home/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post.&nbsp;</a></u></em>If convicted, she faces up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="776" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCOMALCOUNTYSO%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02krHZAhjSn2SXGddi9vL1ctKwJobTkcNYYW97a7UbAvg6iWJ9rJbFLoy73oDjeFnrl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p></p>

<p>Comal Independent School District responded to the allegations against Jennifer Massey, condemning the suspected misconduct and placing her on leave. In a statement to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kens5.com/article/news/crime/high-teacher-sexual-contact-student-garden-ridge-texas/273-481d64e5-4714-4799-b46d-8d9eaff00ea8" rel="nofollow, noindex">KENS 5,</a></em> the district emphasized, "We do not tolerate inappropriate relationships between teachers and students. Student safety and security are our utmost priority."</p>

<p>Comal ISD also pledged full cooperation with law enforcement during the ongoing investigation. Additionally, the district sent a notification to parents on Friday, reassuring them of their commitment to student well-being.</p>

<aside>
<p>"The district learned that last night Mrs. Massey was charged with having an improper relationship with a student.&nbsp;Mrs. Massey was placed on administrative leave this morning, and she will not be returning to Davenport High School," the message said.</p>

<p>The principal of Davenport High School also issued a letter to parents on Friday informing them that the teacher&nbsp;was placed on administrative leave and will not be returning to the school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The disturbing phenomenon of teachers engaging in illegal sexual relationships with students is a growing concern in the United States. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ferretly.com/blog/teacher-student-sexual-misconduct-the-critical-role-of-social-media-screening">recent reports</a>, there were over 500 reported cases of teacher misconduct between 2014 and 2019, with nearly 1 in 10 students experiencing some form of sexual misconduct by an educator. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend, including increased reporting and awareness, social media facilitating inappropriate interactions, breakdowns in teacher-student boundaries, inadequate screening and hiring practices, and insufficient teacher training on ethics and boundaries.</p>

<p>Last month, a 26-year-old former high school math teacher in Missouri, US, pleaded guilty to felony sexual contact with a 16-year-old student. Hailey Clifton-Carmack was arrested in January for her relationship with the student, which included having sex in a driveway while other students served as "lookouts," reported&nbsp;<em><a href="https://people.com/hailey-clifton-carmack-missouri-teacher-pleads-guilty-felony-sexual-contact-student-8709913%C2%A0">People magazine</a>.</em> She is currently under house arrest as she awaits her sentencing on October 11.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"God save the Tsar!" was one of the first public birthday wishes for President Vladimir Putin who turns 72 on Monday and who has been Russia's paramount leader for nearly quarter of a century.</p>

<p>The greeting came from ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin on his Telegram messaging channel minutes after midnight.</p>

<p>Dugin, 62, has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a vast new Russian empire, which he wants to include Ukraine, where Russia has been waging a war. Dugin's daughter was killed in a suspected car bomb in 2022.</p>

<p>Putin, who ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in 2022, won a record post-Soviet landslide in a March election. His new six-year term, if completed, would make him Russia's longest-serving leader for more than 200 years when tsars and empresses ruled the country.</p>

<p>The victory cemented Putin's already tight grip on power and, he said, showed Moscow had been right to stand up to the West and send its troops into Ukraine.</p>

<p>The West casts Putin as an autocrat and a killer. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the March vote that extended the rule of the former KGB spy illegitimate.</p>

<p>Putin portrays the war in Ukraine as part of a centuries-old battle with a declining West which he says humiliated Russia after the Cold War by encroaching on Moscow's sphere of influence.</p>

<p>Kyiv and its Western allies call the war an imperialistic land grab. The conflict has killed thousands of civilians, the vast majority of them Ukrainians. It has turned cities into rubble and displaced millions.</p>

<p>"Today, friends is the birthday of our national leader," Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechen Republic who calls himself Putin's "foot soldier," wrote in a congratulatory message on Telegram at midnight on Monday.</p>

<p>"This is a significant day for our entire Fatherland."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last year's October 7 terror attacks by Hamas unleashed carnage on ordinary civilians, the aftermath of which continues to this day. Today marks one year since that fateful morning. Both the attack by a non-state actor and the state response to it were unprecedented in terms of their sheer scope, firepower and destruction. Gaza has been flattened out, with millions of people internally displaced within a narrow Gaza strip. Israel, too, has lost some 1,200 civilians and soldiers; this is in addition to over 250 people who were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7.</p>

<p>Many forget that the date of the Hamas attack also marked the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. The gravity of the day and the need to beef up security should not have been lost on Mossad, the Shin Bet and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). But perhaps Israel was overconfident. So when the agencies were caught unawares, Benjamin Netanyahu, heading Israel's ultra-right government, naturally vowed to destroy Hamas, with only one goal in mind: reoccupation of Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The World Has Failed To Understand The Conflict</strong></h2>

<p>However, despite the carpet bombing of Palestine and the assassination of a number of Hamas militants and leaders, the group survives a year on. It continues to hold around 100 hostages captive even now, hoping to use them as leverage for a permanent ceasefire and release of their prisoners from Israeli jails. But Netanyahu is in no mood for negotiation. Already, he has extended his tenure to escape legal action, in the process subjecting himself to International Court of Justice (ICJ) rulings and International Criminal Court (warrants). Those things matter little to him though - if anything, Netanyahu seems to be wearing this international criticism as a medal of honour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The international community's approach to resolving the conflict has been flawed since the very beginning. The focus has always been on avoiding the escalation and expansion of the war without showing much commitment towards addressing the root cause of the tensions, including the Palestinian issue. Iran and Israel both suffer from the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) syndrome, that is, in case of conflict, they'd strive for each other's complete destruction. Iran's quest for nuclear parity with Israel and its asymmetrical advantage and influence exercised through its proxies, the three or four 'H's - Hamas in Gaza and Palestine, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq - have been a constant source of worry for the Jewish state as well as its benefactors in the West, especially the US.</p>

<h2><strong>The 'Neutrality' Of Arab Countries</strong></h2>

<p>Even Arab countries in the region are wary of Iranian power pursuits and projections - which is why, even as many nations continue their rapprochement with Iran, the ongoing Israeli campaign against its proxies does not raise many eyebrows. This was evident during the recent Iran-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting in Doha, where the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, met the Qatari Emir and Foreign Ministers of GCC countries. The Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia forthrightly claimed that his country was committed to resolving all differences with Iran. "We seek to close the page of differences between the two countries forever and work towards the resolution of our issues and expansion of our relations like two friendly and brotherly states," he said.</p>

<p>The Gulf countries also assured Iran of their neutrality in the ongoing war and stated that they would not allow US bases to operate against Iran. How that will play out is a million-dollar question, given how many of these countries recently closed their airspaces; in fact, the missiles Iran fired at Israel recently were neutralised by the US airbase in Jordan.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why Iran Responded With Force</strong></h2>

<p>In April, the bombing of the Iranian mission in Damascus led to a calibrated exchange of missiles and attacks and counter-attacks. Post that, Tehran was persuaded not to retaliate to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh since a ceasefire deal had been in the offing. The new, somewhat moderate, President of Iran, has been keen to reopen channels of communication with the West and the US, including its nuclear files, which explains the "strategic restraint and patience" Iran showed initially.</p>

<p>But with the shocking execution of the Hamas and Hezbollah's political and military leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon, the Iranian regime was left with little choice but to respond, lest it be seen as a mere Paper Tiger by its people and proxies. Hence, on October 1, it fired some 181 missiles, most of which were intercepted by the US and others, though some did penetrate Israeli territory, hitting Mossad and military establishments. Of course, the information of this operation is said to have been shared through common interlocutors.</p>

<h2><strong>The 'Oil' Factor</strong></h2>

<p>Netanyahu has called this escalation a direct attack by Iran and has vowed to respond and retaliate at a time and place of its choosing. Reports indicate that Tel Aviv wants to attack Iranian nuclear installations - it had done so earlier too, though clandestinely - but US President Biden is not in favour of this. Instead, they are reportedly planning to target a few oil installations and refineries. Already, oil prices have shot up by over $8 per barrel and may even breach the steady band, impacting several economies, including India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, Israel is engaged on several fronts simultaneously, including Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, Iraq and Iran. Iraqi militia groups have also used UAVs and missiles to attack Israeli positions, stating that any attacks on Iranian fields will deprive the world of oil supplies from others.</p>

<p>As of now, the IDF's main priority in Lebanon is the elimination of Hezbollah. Heavy clashes have been reported from southern Lebanon, forcing nearly a million Lebanese and Syrian refugees to flee for safety. Israel feels that the relentless attacks by Hezbollah across the border into Northern Isreal were putting its sovereignty at risk, with over 70,000 displaced Israelis unable to return to their homes. But even in leaning towards this logic, it fails to realise the consequences of what is happening in Gaza to a 20 times bigger Palestinian population, being flung around from place to place under inhumane conditions. The Lebanese army has also been dragged into the war and has responded to attacks as it continues to urge adherence to the UNSC Resolution 1701.</p>

<h2><strong>World Watches With Bated Breath</strong></h2>

<p>The international community has expressed deep concern at the deteriorating situation in Lebanon as intense firing continues across the Blue Line and areas observed by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) are breached. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati also continues to urge for the implementation of a 21-day ceasefire proposed by the US and France and the provision of uninterrupted humanitarian and relief supplies as his country has been already reeling under deep political uncertainty and financial crunch. Meanwhile, the Iranian Foreign Minister on his recent visits to Beirut and Damascus promised humanitarian support and assured the disjointed Hezbollah and Hamas of their full assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although G7 leaders have condemned Iran's missile attacks, they have issued a statement that there is a need for cessation of hostilities as soon as possible to create space for a diplomatic solution along the Blue Line. The Arab League also expressed its concern and full support for Lebanon. As for Iran, it now appears to have abdicated its strategic restraint and has maintained that though it did not want to escalate the war, an attack by Israel would force it to respond in an unconventional manner. A rare Friday sermon by Ayatollah Khamenei underlined that sentiment. Some even argue that with its nuclear enrichment at threshold levels, Iran is capable of building small nuclear weapons in a much shorter duration. And if Israel chooses to target in its next strike Iranian missile storages, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, air or sea bases, or nuclear or oil and gas facilities, then that could push Iran to even block the Strait of Hormuz, further choking maritime trade and hydrocarbons transit.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Things May Turn Complicated For India, Too</strong></h2>

<p>India has been urging restraint and resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. Three of its ships remain in Iranian ports for some exercises. Indian naval assets have also been guarding sea lanes and commercial shipping since the Houthis attacked vessels in the Red Sea. New Delhi shares a close relationship with both Iran and Israel. The region - India's extended neighbourhood - is critical as any instability and security deficit will mean a risk to the three 'E's - economy, energy supplies and the welfare of roughly 9 million expats.</p>

<p>As things stand, unless sanity prevails on all sides, we are heading irreversibly into an abyss of disaster that's being facilitated, primarily, by the absence of any effective multilateral deterrence.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation, the award-giving body said on Monday.</p>

<p>The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute Medical University and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).</p>

<p>As every year, the medicine prize is the first in the crop of Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature and humanitarian endeavour, with the remaining five set to be unveiled over the coming days.</p>

<p>Created in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes have been awarded for breakthroughs in science, literature and peace since 1901, while economics is a later addition.</p>

<p>Different institutions award the prizes in the various fields, with Peace being the only one awarded in Oslo rather than Stockholm, possibly as a result of the political union that existed between the two Nordic countries when Nobel penned his will.</p>

<p>Last year's medicine prize was awarded to the runaway favourites Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian scientist, and U.S. colleague Drew Weissman, for discoveries that paved the way for COVID-19 vaccines that helped curb the pandemic.</p>

<p>Past winners of the Nobel medicine prize include many famous researchers such as Ivan Pavlov in 1904, most known for his experiments on behaviour using dogs, and Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin.</p>

<p>Steeped in tradition, the science, literature and economics prizes are presented to the laureates in a ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, followed by a lavish banquet at Stockholm city hall. Separate festivities attend the winner of the peace prize in Oslo on the same day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Thursday he would have the government or insurance companies cover the cost of in-vitro fertilization for "all Americans who need it" in a second term -- although he declined to say how he would pay for it.</p>

<p>Reproductive rights have been a major vulnerablity for the Republican White House nominee ever since the Supreme Court gutted federal protections for abortion access in 2022.</p>

<p>Trump's weakness was further exacerbated after an Alabama court ruled in February that frozen embryos created via IVF should be considered children.</p>

<p>Trump said he supported IVF after several clinics paused their care following the Alabama decision.</p>

<p>"I'm announcing today in a major statement that, under the Trump administration, your government will pay for -- or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for -- all costs associated with IVF treatment," he told a rally in Potterville, Michigan.</p>

<p>He offered no detail on how his proposal would work, including how it would be funded, but when the announcement was previewed in an interview with NBC ahead of the event, Trump said one option would be to have insurance companies pay "under a mandate."</p>

<p>Experts say the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling effectively granted states the final say on questions of personhood, paving the way for wide-reaching impacts on other areas of reproductive health, including IVF.</p>

<p>Few Americans have insurance plans that cover fertility treatments in any case, with costs of $20,000 or more for a single, 18-month round of IVF treatment too expensive for many.</p>

<p>The ex-president added that under a second Trump term, new parents would be able to deduct "major newborn expenses" from their tax bill, proclaiming that "we're pro-family."</p>

<p>Although his support for IVF has been consistent since the February ruling, Trump claimed numerous ideological positions on abortion before settling on his current view that the legalities around the procedure should be up to the states.</p>

<p>He told NBC News in 1999 he was "very pro-choice" before announcing he was "pro-life" in 2011 and that women who seek abortions should get "some form of punishment" in 2016.</p>

<p>Trump has taken credit for installing the Supreme Court justices who struck down federal abortion rights, and signaled Thursday how he may vote in a Florida referendum this fall which seeks to reverse his home state's six-week ban.</p>

<p>"I want more than six weeks," he told the Daily Mail. "I think six weeks is a mistake. And I'll be expressing that soon, but I want more than six weeks."</p>

<p>Trump and his election rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, are campaigning in swing states this week as they embark on the most intense phase of the campaign.</p>

<p>Harris, rallying in Savannah, Georgia, told supporters Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law if he won.</p>

<p>"Ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body, and not have her government tell her what to do," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Japan's strongest typhoons in decades dumped torrential rain across southern regions on Thursday, leaving at least five people dead and injuring dozens, local media reported, as authorities warned millions to seek higher ground due to possible flooding and landslides.</p>

<p>Typhoon Shanshan packed gusts of up to 252 kilometres (157 miles) per hour as it smashed into Japan's main southern island of Kyushu early Thursday, making it the most powerful storm this year and one of the strongest at landfall since 1960.</p>

<p>The storm then weakened, with maximum gusts of 162 kph at 5:00 pm (0800 GMT), the weather office said, but it was still dumping heavy rain across Kyushu and beyond as it moved slowly towards the main island of Honshu.</p>

<p>Five people have been found dead in the storm, Jiji Press reported, including a man whose two-story home collapsed in Tokushima Prefecture.</p>

<p>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned that "the risk of a disaster due to heavy rain can rapidly escalate in western Japan as Friday approaches".</p>

<p>Even before Shanshan hit, heavy precipitation led to three members of the same family being killed in a landslide late Tuesday in Aichi prefecture around 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from Kyushu.</p>

<p>Authorities issued their highest alert in several areas of the country, with more than five million people advised to evacuate, although it was unclear how many did.</p>

<p>Kunisaki city in the Oita region of Kyushu warned inhabitants to "evacuate to a safe place or higher place such as the second floor of your house" because of the risk of flooding.</p>

<p>At least 80 people were injured across Kyushu, the JMA said.</p>

<p>Rains turned rivers into raging torrents while winds smashed windows and blew tiles off roofs. TV images showed flooded roads and power lines being repaired.</p>

<p>The coastal city of Miyazaki, littered with debris from nearly 200 damaged buildings, reported 25 injuries -- including some from a tornado.</p>

<p>Some parts of Miyazaki prefecture saw record rains for August, with the town of Misato recording a staggering 791.5 millimetres (31 inches) in 48 hours, the JMA said.</p>

<p>Worried student Aoi Nishimoto, 18, said he had called his family in Miyazaki to see if they were safe.</p>

<p>"Our home is fine, but there was a tornado in Miyazaki and power went out in some places," he told AFP in Kyushu's main city of Fukuoka.</p>

<p>"This year, I am away from my parents' home for the first time. So it's a bit scary being all alone," fellow student Rio Ohtsuru, 19, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Maybe I will look for a flashlight in case of a power outage," she said.</p>

<p>Kyushu's utility operator said 187,010 houses were without power elsewhere on the island.</p>

<p>- Climate change -</p>

<p>Shanshan comes in the wake of Typhoon Ampil, which dumped heavy rain that disrupted hundreds of flights and trains this month but caused only minor injuries and damage.</p>

<p>Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released last month.</p>

<p>Another released by World Weather Attribution (WWA) on Thursday said that climate change turbocharged Typhoon Gaemi, which killed dozens of people across the Philippines, Taiwan and China this year.</p>

<p>In the city of Usa, retiree Fukashi Oishi looked forlornly at an old tree opposite his house that was already mature when he was a child but had snapped and fallen on the road.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so sad," he told AFP.</p>

<p>- Toyota production halt -</p>

<p>Auto giant Toyota suspended production at all 14 of its factories in Japan.</p>

<p>Nissan and Honda also halted operations at their Kyushu plants, as did chipmakers including Tokyo Electron, reports said.</p>

<p>Kyushu is a hub for the semiconductor industry, with chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company opening a plant there in February.</p>

<p>Japan Airlines and ANA cancelled more than 1,000 domestic flights and four international flights for Thursday and Friday, affecting more than 44,000 passengers.</p>

<p>Rail operators suspended most Shinkansen bullet trains between Kyushu's Hakata and Tokyo, and said services would be disrupted elsewhere on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday emphasised that the current presidential fight is for the future of the United States and asserted that the future is always worth fighting for.</p>

<p>The remarks by Harris came while she addressed a rally in Georgia. Harris during the rally said that they are running as the underdog in the upcoming presidential elections in the country and expressed confidence that she will secure victory in the elections.</p>

<p>"68 days to go... We are here to speak the truth and one of the things that we know is that we are running as the underdog. And we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we are going to win this November," Harris said.</p>

<p>She further said that during her entire career, she has always stood up for people. She said, "I am no stranger to tough fights... I was a courtroom Prosecutor. So every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I spoke five words--Kamala Harris For The People. My entire career, I only had one client--the people. I stood for women and children against predators who used to abuse them... and for seniors facing abuse. I would tell you that those fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices."</p>

<p>She further said, "But we never gave up because the future is always worth fighting for. And that is the fight we are in right now. A fight for America's future. We fight for the future with affordable childcare, paid leave and affordable healthcare."</p>

<p>Earlier, Harris said that she intends to appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she wins the upcoming presidential elections, CNN reported.</p>

<p>The remarks by the Vice President came in a joint interview with Walz on CNN.</p>

<p>Harris pledged to serve as a president for all Americans. In the interview, she expressed her willingness to appoint a Republican to her Cabinet if elected. However, she didn't specify a particular individual.</p>

<p>"I've got 68 days to go with this election, so I'm not putting the cart before the horse," she said. "But I would, I think. I think it's really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican," according to CNN.</p>

<p>Harris was nominated as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden quit the presidential race amid mounting concerns over his age, particularly after his poor show in the debate with Donald Trump in June.</p>

<p>If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's military campaign in Gaza - which started after the deadly October 7 last year in which over 1,100 people were brutally killed - has entered its 10th month and over 40,000 people have died.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza - which started after the deadly October 7 last year in which over 1,100 people were brutally killed - has entered its 10th month and over 40,000 people have died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As violence rages in the Gaza Strip, Israel has opened a different front in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory. The large-scale military operation in the West Bank has entered its second day and at least 16 people have died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Israel's "war" drags on for 10 months, the focus is back on Israel's AI tools that have been extensively used in its bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>'Gospel', 'Alchemist', 'The Death of Wisdom' and 'Lavender' are not titles of a novel but names of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that have been used to process vast amounts of data, identify suspects who have links with Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and to strike them.</p>

<p>A detailed investigation by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/" rel="no index, no follow">+972 Magazine and Local Call</a> reveals some disturbing details from Israel's bombing campaign, especially how the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) fully relied on a tool for its bombing missions.</p>

<p><strong>'Lavender' and its use case</strong></p>

<p>Lavender, developed by Israel's elite intelligence division, Unit 8200, operates as an AI-powered database designed to identify potential targets linked to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Lavender uses machine learning algorithms and processes vast amounts of data to pinpoint individuals deemed "junior" militants within these armed groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lavender initially identified as many as 37,000 Palestinian men associated with Hamas or PIJ. The usage of AI to identify targets marks a significant change in how the Israeli intelligence apparatus, Mossad and Shin Bet, function - relying on more labour-intensive human decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/o4og57oo_deir-elbalah-gaza-israel-strike_625x300_27_August_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Soldiers often made decisions in as little as 20 seconds to determine whether to bomb these identified targets based on Lavender's information, primarily to ascertain the gender of the target. Human soldiers frequently followed the machine's information unquestioningly, despite the AI program's error margin of up to 10 per cent, meaning it could be incorrect up to 10 per cent of the time.</p>

<p>According to the report, the program often targeted individuals with minimal or no affiliation with Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>Gospel - Israel's Another AI Arm</strong></p>

<p>Systems such as "Gospel" are being used to allow automatic tools to produce targets at a fast pace, and works by improving accurate and high-quality intelligence material according to the requirement," the IDF said.<br />
"With the help of artificial intelligence, and through the rapid and automatic extraction of updated intelligence - it produces a recommendation for the researcher, with the goal being that there will be a complete match between the machine's recommendation and the identification performed by a person," the IDF added.</p>

<p>The AI platforms crunch data to select targets for air strikes. Ensuing raids can then be rapidly assembled with another artificial intelligence model called Fire Factory,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-16/israel-using-ai-systems-to-plan-deadly-military-operations" rel="no index, no follow"> Bloomberg reported</a>. Fire Factory calculates munition loads, prioritizes and assigns thousands of targets to aircraft and drones, and proposes a schedule, the report added.</p>

<p>The report by +972 Magazine mentions the book 'The Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World'. The author 'Brigadier General YS', who is reportedly the commander of the 8200 Intelligence Unit of Israel, makes a case for the use of AI in "deep defence" and gives scenarios that could threaten Israel in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the chapter "Deep Defense:" New Potentials, the author says "Deep defence is the ability of national establishments to use The Human-Machine Team concept to address security challenges to expose issues in new ways that were heretofore impossible."</p>

<p>The Human-Machine Team should have the ability to identify tens of thousands of targets before the battle begins and thousands of targets should be identified every day. The author makes a case where he explains why it is important to create such tools so that the military can strike at the right targets at the right time with less collateral damage.</p>

<p><strong>What About AI in the Russia-Ukraine War?</strong></p>

<p>AI begets AI. The use of automated tools like unmanned FPV drones, and robots has reduced the human-risk factor for warring nations but has increased the dependency on technology, which seems like a win-win situation for a nation but the ethical and legal concerns of using AI are always followed by the benefits of the technology.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war is a testing lab for future tools for fighting in combat. The concept of drone attacks has proliferated to different conflicts in different regions, especially non-state actors like Houthi rebels and Hezbollah fighting Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The deployment of automated drones does not simply define the use of AI in conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-01/3un9tu5g_ukraine-drone_625x300_10_January_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>AI is primarily used to analyze geospatial intelligence by processing satellite images and decoding open-source intelligence like videos, and photos available online. Surveillance drone footage, on-ground human intelligence (HUMINT), satellite images, and open-source data are all combined and processed by AI tools to deliver an outcome that is used to conduct missions. This represents the use of data analytics on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report by National Defense magazine, Ukraine reportedly used Clearview AI, a software tool from a US-based firm, for facial recognition to identify dead soldiers and Russian assailants and combat misinformation. US firms like Primer have deployed tools to decode Russian encrypted messages delivered through radio.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine is working on developing AI-enabled drones to counter radio jamming. Cheap FPV drones, widely used for several months, have witnessed a drop in their hits due to the jamming of radio signals, a form of Electronic Warfare which Russians are masters of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are already working with the concept that soon, there will be no connection on the front line" between pilot and UAV, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ukraine-rushes-create-ai-enabled-war-drones-2024-07-18/#:~:text=AI%20is%20already%20being%20used,hundreds%20of%20kilometres%20inside%20Russia." rel="no index, no follow">Reuters reported</a>, quoting Max Makarchuk, the AI lead for Brave1, a defence tech accelerator set up by the Ukrainian government.</p>

<p>Radio jamming blocks the operator's contact with the munition (a drone) by forming a protective invisible layer around the target, therefore resulting in damage to the drone. Automating the final part of the drone's flight can enable success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/struggling-not-crumbling-russian-defence-ai-time-war" rel="no follow, no index">Russia is focusing on developing AI</a> systems to counter the West and fight Ukraine on the battlefield. If numbers are compared then Russia is way ahead of Ukraine in terms of military prowess but the Red Army has suffered huge losses on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Areas like increasing command, control and communication with AI-enabled decision-making, developing smarter weapons, which it calls "intellectualization of weapons", and developing more unmanned aerial/ground vehicles and AI-enabled guidance systems for missiles, are in Moscow's focus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The maker of the Russian Kamikaze drone KUB-LA, ZALA Aero Group, claims it is capable of selecting and engaging targets using AI. The Lancet-3 loitering munition is highly autonomous and the use of sensors enables it to locate and destroy a target without human guidance, even being capable of returning to the operator if a target has not been found.</p>

<p>In May, a Russian <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ria.ru/20230524/spetsoperatsiya-1873760329.html" rel="no index, no follow">S-350 Vityaz</a>, surface-to-air-missile reportedly shot down an aircraft in autonomous mode, which was claimed as the first AI-enable missile kill. The system detected, tracked and destroyed a Ukrainian air target without human assistance. The claim remains contested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heavy investment on both sides of the border reaffirms the central role of AI in war and how future wars could be co-commanded by technology and a human.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron was not aware of Telegram owner Pavel Durov's arrival in France on Saturday and had not been scheduled to meet him, he told a news conference on Thursday during a two-day visit in Serbia.</p>

<p>"I was absolutely unaware of Mr Durov's arrival in France, and that is quite normal because I'm not aware of the comings and goings of citizens from all over the world, whether they have French citizenship or not," Macron said.</p>

<p>Durov was arrested by French police after his jet landed at an airport near Paris. On Wednesday, a French judge put Durov, who has French and UAE citizenship, under formal investigation for suspected complicity in running an online platform that allows illicit transactions, child sex abuse images, drug trafficking and fraud.</p>

<p>Macron also defended France's decision in 2021 to give Durov French citizenship under a rare procedure for high-profile individuals.</p>

<p>"It's part of a strategy to allow women and men, whether artists, athletes or entrepreneurs, when they make the effort to learn the French language and that they develop wealth, innovation ... to be given French nationality," Macron said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Thursday pressed a large-scale military operation in the occupied West Bank that killed at least 16 Palestinians in two days, despite UN concerns it was "fuelling an already explosive situation".</p>

<p>The "counter-terrorism" operation underway across the northern West Bank since early Wednesday has killed 16 Palestinians, the Israeli military said. The Palestinian health ministry gave the same figure, after both revised earlier tolls.</p>

<p>The raids on several towns and refugee camps were launched as violence raged on in the war-battered Gaza Strip, the besieged Palestinian territory separated from the West Bank by Israel.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization said Israel had agreed to at least three days of "humanitarian pauses" in parts of Gaza, starting Sunday, to facilitate a vaccination drive after the first case of once-eradicated polio had been confirmed in the territory.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday the measures were "not a ceasefire" in the nearly 11-month-old war triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack.</p>

<p>In the West Bank, columns of Israeli armoured vehicles backed by troops and aircraft were sent in before soldiers encircled refugee camps in Tubas and Tulkarem, as well as Jenin, and exchanged fire with Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>The army said it killed seven militants on Thursday, including five militants in the Tulkarem refugee camp.</p>

<p>A military statement said one of the five was Muhammad Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa, who Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said was its commander in the nearby Nur Shams refugee camp.</p>

<p>Two other militants were killed in Jenin on Thursday, the army said.</p>

<p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres called for an "immediate cessation of these operations", which were "fuelling an already explosive situation in the occupied West Bank".</p>

<p>- 'Continuation' of Gaza war -</p>

<p>The violence has caused significant destruction, especially in Tulkarem, whose governor Mustafa Taqatqa described the raids as "unprecedented" and a "dangerous signal".</p>

<p>The UN humanitarian office OCHA said "Israeli forces have repurposed homes as military positions" and were "effectively besieging" several medical facilities.</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed bulldozers ripping up the asphalt from streets in the city. Widespread damage was reported to infrastructure.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the Israeli forces had withdrawn from Al-Farra refugee camp in Tubas where several Palestinians were killed on Wednesday, including two teenagers according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.</p>

<p>AFP correspondents said clashes were ongoing in Jenin, where a drone was seen flying overhead and the streets were empty, and Israeli soldiers were operating in Tulkarem.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said at least 45 people had been detained in the West Bank since Wednesday. An Israeli military spokesman said "10 wanted individuals were arrested".</p>

<p>Jordan's King Abdullah II appealed for a ceasefire in Gaza to stop the spread of violence and Iran's foreign ministry condemned the Israeli operation as a "continuation of the genocide in the Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>The United Nations on Wednesday said at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war erupted on October 7.</p>

<p>Nineteen Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, when it also seized the Gaza Strip, from which it withdrew troops and settlers in 2005 but later imposed a crippling blockade followed by a siege shortly after the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>In Gaza, the Israeli military said it had "eliminated dozens" of militants in a day of combat and strikes.</p>

<p>The civil defence agency in the Hamas-ruled territory said Israeli shelling killed five displaced Palestinians in a tent east of Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's main city.</p>

<p>- 'Lost everything' -</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,602 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The war has devastated Gaza, repeatedly displaced most of its 2.4 million people and triggered a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Palestinians militants on October 7 also seized 251 hostages, 103 of whom are still captive in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Increasingly desperate families of the hostages gathered at the border with Gaza on Thursday to deliver symbolic messages to their loved ones.</p>

<p>Rachel Goldberg-Polin, the mother of the hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, yelled into a microphone: "I love you, stay strong, survive."</p>

<p>She later told AFP that the war had "gone on way too long" and there was "suffering on all sides... it has to stop".</p>

<p>In central Gaza, some Palestinians returned to parts of Deir al-Balah after the military had amended a previous evacuation order.</p>

<p>Mohamed Abu Thuria told AFP he had "found massive destruction everywhere".</p>

<p>Another displaced Gazans back in Deir al-Balah, Ibrahim al-Tabaan, said: "We lost everything."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TV show producer Banijay Asia has tied up with Space Exploration and Research Agency (SERA) for a reality show to send an Indian into space on a future Blue Origin New Shepard mission.</p>

<p>Recently, SERA announced India as a partner nation for their human spaceflight programme.</p>

<p>"We're embarking on an unprecedented journey with SERA to create a reality format that transcends the ordinary. It's a privilege to document this journey of an ordinary Indian space traveller and show how this programme will not only transform their life but also democratise space travel more broadly," Deepak Dhar, Founder and Group CEO, Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India said in a statement.</p>

<p>The format will capture the drama, disappointment, and joy as the shortlisted individuals participate in various challenges that test their mettle and readiness for space travel, a company statement said.</p>

<p>It said the show will culminate in the selection of a final winner who will have the opportunity to travel into space.</p>

<p>"We will pioneer an innovative and inspirational format by blending the thrill of reality television with the awe of space exploration. This will be a game-changing format showing every step of the journey from selection to space," said Mrinalini Jain, Group Chief Development Officer, Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India.</p>

<p>"This partnership with Banijay Asia will bring space and science-related content to a diverse audience. We look forward to their innovative approach to transform this historic endeavour into a movement that will not only inspire millions but also cultivate a global dialogue on the future of space exploration," Joshua Skurla, Co-Founder, SERA, said.</p>

<p>SERA's spaceflight programme will offer citizens from across the world six seats on a future mission of New Shepard, Blue Origin's reusable suborbital rocket.</p>

<p>The mission will fly the selected astronauts on an 11-minute journey past the Karman line (100 km), the internationally recognised boundary of space.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has targeted to train 175 civil servants from Maldives through tailor-made programmes in specific disciplines, according to an official statement issued today.</p>

<p>A bilateral meeting was held today between National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG) Director General V Srinivas and Maldives Civil Service Commission President Mohamed Nasih to firm up the implementation modalities of the India-Maldives MoU for imparting training to the civil servants of Maldives over a period of five years 2024 -2029, it said.</p>

<p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed and renewed between the NCGG, government of India, and the Civil Service Commission (CSC), Republic of Maldives, for capacity building programs for 1,000 Maldivian civil servants on August 9 in Male, Maldives.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Maldives' Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer renewed the MoU for the period 2024-2029 as part of the development partnership discussions between both nations, said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.</p>

<p>In view of the need of the CSC Maldives, the NCGG agreed to having customised programmes for middle level civil servants and senior civil servants of Maldives, it added.</p>

<p>"The CSC Maldives requested for tailor made specialised programmes in specific disciplines for which NCGG will be designing need-based modules. Five (5) programmes will be held in the year 2024-25 targeting a total of 175 civil servants," the statement said.</p>

<p>In 2024, the NCGG had achieved the remarkable milestone by fulfilling the mandate of training a total of 1,000 civil servants, including Permanent Secretaries, Secretary Generals and high-level delegates from Maldives over a total of 32 capacity building programmes in field administration for the civil servants of Maldives, including programmes for Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and for Information Commission Office of Maldives (ICOM) under the MoU signed on June 8, 2019.</p>

<p>Recognising the success of this collaboration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maldives, had requested for the renewal of the MoU for another five years, the statement said.</p>

<p>This renewed partnership will continue to enhance the capabilities of Maldives civil servants in public policy, governance and field administration, further strengthening the ties between India and the Maldives, it added.</p>

<p>The NCGG is committed to fostering knowledge exchange and collaboration on public policy and governance across several countries.</p>

<p>Its mid-career capacity building programs emphasise citizen-centric governance, improving service delivery and promoting innovations in governance. These programs also showcase India's best practices in digital empowerment of citizens and digital transformation of institutions.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military and Palestinian militant group Hamas have agreed to three separate, zoned three-day pauses in fighting in the Gaza Strip to allow for the vaccination of some 640,000 children against polio, a senior WHO official said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The vaccination campaign is due to start on Sunday, said Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization's senior official for the region.</p>

<p>He said the campaign would start in central Gaza with a three-day pause in fighting, then move to southern Gaza, where there would be another three-day pause, followed by northern Gaza. Peeperkorn added that there was an agreement to extend the humanitarian pause in each zone to a fourth day if needed.</p>

<p>The WHO confirmed on Aug. 23 that at least one baby has been paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>The Israeli military's humanitarian unit (COGAT) said on Wednesday that the vaccination campaign would be conducted in coordination with the Israeli military "as part of the routine humanitarian pauses that will allow the population to reach the medical centers where the vaccinations will be administered."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The interim government in Bangladesh on Thursday withdrew the special security cover accorded to deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close relatives, days after revoking their diplomatic passports.</p>

<p>The Council of Advisers with Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus in the chair decided to amend the Special Security Force Act 2021 lifting special security for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her close relatives, the official BSS news agency reported.</p>

<p>After Sheikh Hasina, 76, fled to India on August 5, Bangladesh President Mohammad Shahabuddin dissolved Parliament.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina currently faces more than 75 cases in Bangladesh, nearly half of them murder charges.</p>

<p>"Against the backdrop of student-people mass upsurge the interim government has been formed on August 8, 2024, comprising the Chief Adviser and other advises," the chief adviser's office (CAO) said in a statement following an advisory council meeting.</p>

<p>The statement noted that the act was enacted and enforced following the previous government's decision. Subsequently, on May 15, 2015, a gazette was issued under this law to provide special security and benefits to Sheikh Hasina and her close relatives.</p>

<p>"The law was made solely to provide special state benefits to the members of one family, which constitutes clear discrimination." The interim government is firmly committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination, it said.</p>

<p>Because of the changed scenario "it is not possible to implement under administrative management the provisions relating to 'Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's family' in line with the existing law, it said.</p>

<p>Talking to journalists after the meeting, advisory council member Syeda Rizwana Hasan said "The interim government was the outcome of an anti-discrimination movement".</p>

<p>Syeda Rizwana, entrusted with the portfolio of environment, forest and climate change ministry, said the council decided to amend the law considering it "discriminatory".</p>

<p>Recently, the Ministry of Home Affairs cancelled the diplomatic passports of Sheikh Hasina, her advisers, former cabinet members, and all members of the 12th Parliament. Diplomatic passports for their spouses and children have also been revoked with immediate effect.</p>

<p>Syeda Rizwana said Bangladesh signed the Instrument of Accession to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance on Thursday, "demonstrating its commitment to investigate each and every case of enforced disappearances".</p>

<p>"The Chief Advisor has signed the instrument. About 700 people are still missing due to enforced disappearance.</p>

<p>The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was adopted in New York on December 20, 2006.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Army on Thursday took aim at Donald Trump's staff over a visit by the Republican presidential candidate to the country's most hallowed resting place for its war dead.</p>

<p>Trump went to the Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington with family members of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing during the last hours of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>His campaign posted photos from the visit, including one showing him giving a thumbs-up gesture while standing with relatives at the grave of one of the Marines killed.</p>

<p>The Army said an Arlington employee was "abruptly pushed aside" when she sought to ensure a law prohibiting political activity on cemetery grounds was followed.</p>

<p>"This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the (Arlington National Cemetery) employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked," an Army spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>Going on the offensive, Trump's campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita has described the employee as a "despicable individual," while campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said she was "clearly suffering from a mental health episode."</p>

<p>Trump has made criticism of President Joe Biden's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a key note of his campaign ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>The withdrawal was made as part of a peace deal signed by the Trump administration with the Taliban.</p>

<p>Uproar over the incident at Arlington on Monday is the latest controversy in Trump's troubled relationship with the military.</p>

<p>While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The arrest and charging by France of Telegram founder Pavel Durov has thrown a spotlight on the international connections of a man with at least four passports and high-level contacts but who has also aroused the attention of security agencies around the world.</p>

<p>Born in 1984 under the USSR into a family of academics in Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg, Durov spent his childhood in Italy before his family returned to Russia when the Soviet Union fell.</p>

<p>He stopped living in Russia a decade ago as he set up the Telegram messenger, picking up the citizenship of the Caribbean archipelago of Saint Kitts and Nevis as he sought a base.</p>

<p>Finally basing his company in Dubai, he was given Emirati citizenship in 2021 and in the same year, via a special procedure that remains shrouded in secrecy, French nationality.</p>

<p>Here AFP looks at Durov's key relationships with world powers.</p>

<h3><strong>Russia</strong></h3>

<p>Durov says he left Russia in 2014, accusing Kremlin allies of seizing ownership of his first social network, the Russian-language VKontakte, after he refused to hand over data of users involved in 2011-2012 protests in Russia and then 2013-2014 demonstrations in Ukraine.</p>

<p>He was regarded by many at the time as a dissident. The Russian authorities in later years sought to block Telegram but unsuccessfully, and the app is seen as a key tool for the military in the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Speaking to US right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in an interview in April, Durov said only people with "very limited knowledge of where Telegram came from" could claim it was an instrument of the Russian government.</p>

<p>But Moscow has in no way disowned Durov during his current legal problems, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warning France against turning the case into "political persecution".</p>

<p>According to the Vazhnye Istorii news site, citing leaked border data, his departure from Russia was anything but an abrupt exile and he visited the country more than 50 times between 2015 and 2021.</p>

<h3><strong>France</strong></h3>

<p>Media have repeatedly noted that Durov's reception when he was arrested on arrival at Paris Le Bourget airport Saturday was in stark contrast to previous visits.</p>

<p>Le Monde newspaper reported Wednesday that Durov had met President Emmanuel Macron on several occasions prior to receiving French nationality in 2021, via a special procedure reserved for those deemed to have made a special contribution to France.</p>

<p>A source close to the case, who asked not to be named, told AFP on Thursday that after his arrest Durov requested that French telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel, chairman and founder of the Iliad mobile operator and seen as close to Macron, be informed of his arrest.</p>

<p>Durov has said his name in his French passport is written as Paul du Rove, a humorous French translation. His personal Telegram channel is called "Du Rove's Channel".</p>

<p>Another source close to the investigation said Durov had emphasised his links to the French head of state during questioning.</p>

<p>Both Pavel Durov and his elder brother Nikolai, a lower-profile figure seen as the mathematical brain behind Telegram, have been wanted by France since March this year.</p>

<h3><strong>United Arab Emirates</strong></h3>

<p>Durov says he chose to base Telegram in Dubai after finding the UAE offered a far better business climate than European cities, allowing the company to hire the best people, enjoy a tax-efficient regime and the city's infrastructure.</p>

<p>"We tried several places. We first went to Berlin... We tried London, Singapore. San Francisco. You name it -- we have been everywhere," Durov told Carlson.</p>

<p>"The bureaucratic hurdles were too difficult to overcome," whereas the UAE "turned out to be a great place", he said, lauding the state as "a neutral place... not aligned geopolitically".</p>

<h3><strong>The United States</strong></h3>

<p>There is no indication Durov ever sought US citizenship but his interview with Carlson threw up some interesting -- if unconfirmed -- insights about his relationship with the country.</p>

<p>He said that at one point he thought San Francisco "would be the place for us" but he was then attacked by "three big guys" who tried to grab his phone while he was tweeting about meeting then Twitter chief Jack Dorsey.</p>

<p>Durov claimed to have come out the better in the altercation. "There was a short fight and a bit of blood involved."</p>

<p>He also said US security agencies gave him "too much attention" whenever he visited, complaining that two FBI agents would always meet him at the airport asking questions.Durov's international network</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Thursday the government would toughen knife controls and limit the support given to some illegal migrants following a suspected Islamist stabbing.</p>

<p>Three people were killed and eight others injured at a festival in the western city of Solingen on Friday, in an attack allegedly carried out by a 26-year-old Syrian man with links to the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The knife attack has inflamed the debate over immigration in Germany and put pressure on the government to act ahead of key regional elections on Sunday.</p>

<p>The stabbing has "shocked us deeply", Faeser said at a press conference on Thursday.</p>

<p>In response to the threat highlighted by the attack, the government is preparing "tough measures", Faeser said alongside Justice Minister Marco Buschmann.</p>

<p>Carrying knives at festivals, like the one in Solingen, as well as "sports events and other similar public events" will be banned, Faeser said.</p>

<p>There will be reasoned exceptions to the ban, including for those working in hospitality and performers, she added.</p>

<p>A ban will also be introduced on long-distance trains, the minister said, with police given more powers to search members of the public for knives.</p>

<p>Germany will also refuse benefits payments to migrants set to be deported to other countries in the European Union, Faeser announced.</p>

<p>The government will continue to work "intensively" to restart deportations to Afghanistan and Syria, which have been halted for years, she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The videos, shot at the UNESCO World Heritage site, have raised concerns about potential damage to the nearly 900-year-old temple structures and the disrespect of their spiritual and cultural significance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A growing trend on social media has sparked concern among conservationists and historians as tourists film themselves reenacting the popular "Temple Run" video game at Cambodia's ancient temple. The temple run videos are being shot at the UNESCO World Heritage Site Angkor Wat, a Hindu-Buddhist temple in Siem Reap, Cambodia, which has received an influx of tourists reportedly disrespecting their religious structure by replicating a Temple Run mobile game experience that was very popular in 2011.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-22/tiktok-tourists-trample-on-angkor-wat-in-viral-temple-run-recreation"><em>Bloomberg,</em></a> TikTokers, Facebook users, and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/w5dEBa9Sg_g?si=V_xaVvRx6IAJU0YN">YouTubers </a>are making videos of themselves running, jumping, and crashing through the historic Angkor Wat complex and other temple ruins as a mimic of what happens in the game. These short videos, set with fun sound effects, have gained widespread attention, with some clips receiving more than 2 million views.</p>

<p>However, experts caution that such stunts might seriously damage the structures, which are nearly 900 years old. Conservationists are afraid that in the gambit for viral content, sacred sites are being disrespected and cause a serious threat to the preservation of ancient cultural treasures. The trend continues to rise because new videos pop up every day.</p>

<p>"It's not just potential damage to the stones by people bumping into them and falling or knocking things over-which is real," conservation consultant Simon Warrack told Bloomberg, "but it's also damage to the spiritual and cultural value of the temples."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Milan has resulted in four deaths and numerous hospitalizations. Authorities are disinfecting the city's water supply while investigations continue to identify the source of the infection.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Milan, Italy, has killed at least four people and hospitalised several dozen more, according to <em>The Metro</em>. The health authorities say that at least 53 cases have been confirmed in two regions inside the Milan metropolitan area of a severe lung infection.</p>

<p>In response, local authorities are taking urgent measures to control the situation, including deploying chemicals to disinfect the city's water supply. However, despite extensive testing of water supply systems in private residences and cooling towers, the exact source of the outbreak remains unidentified, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/26/no-one-knows-source-stealth-disease-killed-four-milan-21492952/"><em>news report.</em></a></p>

<p>The continuous investigation of finding the source of infection has left the city in great suspense, and sensitivity has developed regarding what efforts should be present to prevent further cases.</p>

<p><strong>What is Legionnaires' disease?</strong></p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/13/legionnaires-disease-symptoms-cause-treatment/"><em>Washington Post report,</em></a> Legionnaires' is a serious form of pneumonia caused by the bacteria Legionella. The pathogen can also cause Pontiac fever, a flu-like illness considered to be a less serious disease.</p>

<p>The bacteria was first discovered decades ago when a mysterious illness sickened dozens attending a 1976 convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia. In that outbreak, 221 people were infected, and 34 died.</p>

<p>The disease initially alarmed health officials, who feared the sickness might spread beyond the conferencegoers. Ultimately, scientists found the bacteria bred in the water of a cooling tower of the air-conditioning system at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, where the conference was being held.</p>

<p><strong>How does Legionnaires' disease spread?</strong></p>

<p>Legionella grow in biofilms lining water pipes, pipes that lead to showers, drinking faucets, and HVAC systems for cooling, said Panagis Galiatsatos, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Centre at Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>Legionella can even grow in the tanks that hold windscreen wiper fluid in a car, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>People can become infected by breathing in mist or swallowing water into the lungs that's contaminated with the bacteria. "Less commonly, people can get sick by aspiration of drinking water containing Legionella," a CDC spokeswoman said Tuesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Now that France has charged Telegram's founder with failing to stop illegal activity on his platform, other tech bosses may have reason to weigh the wisdom of jetting into Europe themselves.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that France has charged Telegram's founder with failing to stop illegal activity on his platform, other tech bosses may have reason to weigh the wisdom of jetting into Europe themselves.</p>

<p>Russia-born Pavel Durov is accused of "complicity" in running an online platform that allowed illicit transactions, child sex abuse images and other illegal content.</p>

<p>French lawyers told AFP it was "unprecedented" for an individual to be held criminally liable for what users chose to do on a tech platform.</p>

<p>Chat apps like Telegram -- which boasts having more than 900 million users -- were almost certainly hosting illegal content whether the bosses knew it or not, experts told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's clear that if they take this case against Pavel Durov all the way, any other platform could be threatened with the same thing," lawyer Guillaume Martine told AFP.</p>

<p>However, the idea of X owner Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta group includes Facebook and WhatsApp, being arrested in Europe remained beyond the realms of likelihood.</p>

<p>"I would be very surprised if any EU member state, including France, arrested Elon Musk under similar charges," Jan Penfrat of the European Digital Rights (EDRi) advocacy group told AFP.</p>

<p>"But then again, I was also surprised that they arrested Durov."</p>

<h3><strong>'Limited cooperation'</strong></h3>

<p>Although comparing these platforms is superficially appealing -- like its competitors, Telegram is not based in France, and Durov is an ally of Musk -- there are key differences.</p>

<p>For one, Durov is a French citizen, making him a much likelier target in France.</p>

<p>But also, although Musk trumpets an extreme free-speech position, he generally complies with government takedown orders on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Telegram, however, refuses on principle.</p>

<p>"It's true that Telegram is characterised by extremely limited cooperation, if any at all," said digital rights lawyer Alexandre Lazaregue.</p>

<p>"They don't respond to letters, they don't respond to summonses, they don't even have legal representation in court... Whereas Facebook, Twitter, etc still have well-known lawyers in Paris."</p>

<p>And Penfrat said comparisons with services like Signal or WhatsApp were also misleading as they are encrypted by default -- unlike Telegram.</p>

<p>"So Signal and WhatsApp can say: 'We're cooperating, we just don't have the information,'" he said.</p>

<p>"But Telegram says: 'Well, we could give you all that information because it's in plain text on our servers, but we're not going to, sorry.'"</p>

<h3><strong>'Red flags'</strong></h3>

<p>The particular position of Durov and Telegram suggests other tech bosses do not have anything immediately to worry about.</p>

<p>But Penfrat said he was concerned that the move against Telegram could be used as a precedent to go after other encrypted services.</p>

<p>Law enforcement agencies across the world have long argued they need access to encrypted messages to stop criminal activity.</p>

<p>But services like WhatsApp and Signal have pushed back, saying the only way to do that would be to outlaw encryption.</p>

<p>"It does raise a lot of red flags to see these charges, which seem random and also are just not very convincing," said Penfrat, suggesting it was like trying to blame a knife-maker for a stabbing.</p>

<p>Lawyer Martine said it was "extremely dangerous" to try to hold Telegram accountable for the actions of its users, likening it to prosecuting Europcar for renting a vehicle to a drug trafficker.</p>

<p>Lazaregue concluded that the charges against Durov were pushing the legal definition of "complicity" to breaking point.</p>

<p>"To be convicted of complicity, you still need to be aware that a crime is happening and intend to participate in it," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An F-16 fighter jet used by Ukraine crashed on Monday, Kyiv's military said, the first such loss reported since the long-awaited arrival of the U.S.-made planes in the country was confirmed this month.</p>

<p>The jet came down and its pilot died while it was approaching a target during a Russian airstrike, the Ukrainian General Staff said on Thursday in a statement on Facebook.</p>

<p>The F-16s had "demonstrated high efficiency" and downed four Russian cruise missiles, it added. "Connection with one of the aircraft was lost while it was approaching the next target. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died," the statement added.</p>

<p>Ukraine has not given detail on the size of its new fleet, though the loss is likely to have left a significant dent. The Times of London has cited a source familiar with the matter as saying Ukraine had six of the jets.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed on Aug. 4 his pilots had started flying F-16s, hailing the moment as a major milestone in the fight against the invasion Russia launched 29 months ago.</p>

<p>He said on Tuesday F-16s were used to repel a major Russian attack a day earlier of more than 200 missiles and drones, which targeted the energy sector.</p>

<p>Monday's crash did not appear to be the result of Russian fire, and possible causes from pilot error to mechanical failure were still being investigated, a U.S. defense official told Reuters.</p>

<p>Military analysts have said the arrival of the small number of planes, while significant, is unlikely to be a turning point in the conflict.</p>

<p>Russia has had time to prepare defences to try to nullify the F-16s' impact, and Ukraine has had to survive with a depleted air force that is a fraction of the size and sophistication of its enemy's.</p>

<p>Ukraine's Air Force Western command posted on Facebook an obituary of a pilot, Oleksiy Mes, saying he died while repelling Monday's attack, but did not say he was an F-16 pilot.</p>

<p>CNN said Mes had a call sign Moonfish and reported in 2023 he was training for F-16 missions.</p>

<p>Kyiv has been urging allies to supply modern jets since the start of Russia's invasion to bolster its small and old post-Soviet fleet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Floods have killed at least 179 people and displaced around 200,000 more in parts of Nigeria after a "few weeks" of intense rain, an emergency official said on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the serious flooding has been in the north of Nigeria so far. At least 107,600 hectares (265,885 acres) of farmlands have also been affected, figures published by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) showed.</p>

<p>Most of the deaths were in the country's northern region, but NEMA spokesman Ezekiel Manzo said the central and southern parts of Nigeria may be hit harder as rain intensifies.</p>

<p>He did not say exactly when the deaths and displacements had occurred.</p>

<p>"The collection of water from the northern part flowing downward will also mean that the situation being witnessed the same in central and southern parts of the country will become worse," Manzo told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Communities along the banks of major rivers Niger and Benue are at higher risk. Some parts of the country previously not known to be flood-prone have seen floods, Manzo said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flooding, usually caused by abundant rains and poor infrastructure, has caused large-scale destruction in Africa's most populous country in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 360 people died and more than 2.1 million were displaced in 2012.</p>

<p>In 2022, more than 500 people died and 1.4 million were displaced in the worst floods in a decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said in a statement on Wednesday that authorities would provide warnings to mitigate the impact of environmental mishaps.</p>

<p>Manzo said emergency officials have mapped out plans to forestall a recurrence.</p>

<p>"We don't have time to waste any longer so people will not be caught unaware," he told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government said on Thursday it had imposed a travel ban on Mustafa Ayash, who it sanctioned earlier this year for promoting terrorism, and suspected Hezbollah financier Nazem Ahmad.</p>

<p>The pair, who were already subject to asset freezes under domestic counter-terrorism powers, now cannot enter Britain, it said.</p>

<p>"The travel bans are a part of continued efforts to protect the integrity of the UK economy from terrorist financing threats," the British government said in a statement.</p>

<p>Ayash was sanctioned in March this year for providing financial support to a media network which the government said supported the Palestinian Hamas militant group and promotes terrorism.</p>

<p>Britain banned Hamas in 2021 and under the Terrorism Act, anyone expressing support for the group, flying its flag or arranging meetings for the organisation is in breach of the law.</p>

<p>Britain sanctioned Ahmad in April 2023 on suspicion of financing Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement. He was also sanctioned by the US in 2019.</p>

<p>He has an extensive art collection in the UK and conducts business with multiple UK-based artists, art galleries and auction houses, according to a 2023 statement by the British government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

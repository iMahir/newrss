       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel said Thursday its spy chief will attend Gaza ceasefire talks and Hamas vowed to stop fighting if a truce is reached, as long-stalled efforts to end the war appeared to gain momentum.</p>

<p>Previous bids to stop the year-long war have failed, though the United States has voiced hope the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week could serve as an opening for a deal.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP that a delegation from the group's Doha-based leadership discussed "ideas and proposals" related to a Gaza truce with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Hamas has expressed readiness to stop the fighting, but Israel must commit to a ceasefire, withdraw from the Gaza Strip, allow the return of displaced people, agree to a serious prisoner exchange deal and allow the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza," the official said.</p>

<p>The talks in Cairo were part of Egypt's ongoing efforts to resume ceasefire negotiations, he added.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Egypt's readiness to reach a deal "for the release of the hostages" still held by militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>After the Cairo meeting, Netanyahu directed the head of Israel's Mossad spy agency to leave for key mediator Qatar on Sunday to "advance a series of initiatives that are on the agenda," the prime minister's office said.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, the United States and Qatar said Gaza ceasefire talks would resume in the Qatari capital.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Qatar's leaders in Doha on Thursday on his 11th trip to the region since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Time is running out' -</strong></p>

<p>During the trip, which comes less than two weeks before US elections, Blinken said that mediators would explore new options.</p>

<p>He said they were seeking a plan "so that Israel can withdraw, so that Hamas cannot reconstitute, and so that the Palestinian people can rebuild their lives and rebuild their futures".</p>

<p>Qatar said that US and Israeli teams would fly to Doha, with Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani adding that Qatari mediators had "re-engaged" with Hamas since Sinwar's death.</p>

<p>Israeli and US officials as well as some analysts said Sinwar had been a key obstacle to a deal allowing for the release of 97 hostages still held in Gaza, 34 of whom the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>An Israeli group representing families of hostages called on Netanyahu and Hamas to secure an agreement to free the remaining captives.</p>

<p>"Time is running out," the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.</p>

<p>Blinken landed late Thursday in London, where a US official said he would meet on Friday with the foreign ministers of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, two key partners in a post-war plan for Gaza.</p>

<p>The official said Blinken would also meet with Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati to discuss the parallel conflict in that country.</p>

<p>- Hundreds dead in days -</p>

<p>On the battlefield, the Israeli military has kept up pressure on Hamas, launching an operation earlier this month in the north of Gaza where tens of thousands of civilians are trapped.</p>

<p>"More than 770 people have been killed" in the territory's north in the 19 days since the operation started, Gaza civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said, adding that the toll could rise as people were buried under the rubble.</p>

<p>He also said a strike on a school-turned-shelter killed 17 people on Thursday in central Gaza, where the Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas militants.</p>

<p>One Palestinian woman, Umm Muhammad, told AFP she was sitting in a classroom when the strike hit.</p>

<p>"I hugged my little girl and I couldn't see anything through the thick plume of smoke," she said.</p>

<p>"I ran and screamed for my sister and found her alive downstairs, but there were (some) children torn to pieces."</p>

<p>The civil defence agency said it can no longer provide first responder services in northern Gaza, accusing Israeli forces of threatening to "bomb and kill" its crews.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says the goal of its assault is to destroy the operational capabilities it says Hamas is trying to rebuild in the north.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 42,847 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, data which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>- Lebanon strikes, clashes -</p>

<p>After nearly a year of war in Gaza, Israel expanded its focus to Lebanon a month ago, vowing to secure its northern border against near-daily attacks by Hamas ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>It launched a massive bombing campaign targeting mainly Hezbollah strongholds around Lebanon, and sent in ground troops on September 30.</p>

<p>Since September 23, the war in Lebanon has killed at least 1,580 people, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher.</p>

<p>The ministry said three children were among 12 people killed in Israeli strikes on two villages in eastern Lebanon on Thursday.</p>

<p>Later Lebanese state media said Israel struck Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah bastion, about half an hour after Israel issued evacuation warnings.</p>

<p>Israel said five of its soldiers were killed fighting in southern Lebanon, scene of daily fighting with Hezbollah militants since the ground offensive began.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it attacked Israeli troops and positions in Israel's north and also soldiers inside Lebanese territory.</p>

<p>The war has sparked a huge displacement crisis in Lebanon, already suffering from a years-long political and economic crisis.</p>

<p>A conference in Paris on Thursday raised $800 million in aid for cash-strapped Lebanon, according to the French government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday that his invasion of neighboring Ukraine violated the United Nations charter and international law, according to a readout of their meeting.</p>

<p>The UN secretary-general met with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, after a speech in which Guterres called for a "just peace" in Ukraine.</p>

<p>He "reiterated his position that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law," a readout from the UN chief's spokesperson said after their meeting, which had been criticized by Kyiv.</p>

<p>Guterres also emphasized his commitment to "establishing freedom of navigation in the Black Sea," saying the move was vital for both Ukraine and Russia, as well as global "food and energy security."</p>

<p>"He fully supports the continuation of negotiations in this regard," the statement said, citing "deep appreciation" to Turkey's mediating efforts.</p>

<p>The Black Sea is a significant trade route for Ukraine, one of the largest exporters of grain in the world, but it has been mired since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>A UN-brokered agreement allowed Ukraine to export agricultural exports on the Black Sea, but Moscow withdrew from the deal in 2023.</p>

<p>Kyiv has nonetheless carved out a maritime corridor allowing trade to continue.</p>

<p>Guterres and Putin, who last met in April 2022, also discussed the conflict in the Middle East, "in particular the absolute need for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the need to avoid a further regional escalation," the readout said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Vastly superior" is what 15 Nobel Prize-winning economists had called President Joe Biden's economic plan in June, and this is what 23 of them now call Vice President Kamala Harris' plan. The group now also includes two of the most recent laureates - Simon Johnson and Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>In a recent, 228-word letter signed by 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists, Kamala Harris has got a symbolic sanction on an issue quite commonly ranked as the most important: the economy.</p>

<p>In a letter procured by CNN, the economists write, "While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we believe that, overall, Harris' economic agenda will improve our nation's health, investment, sustainability, resilience, employment opportunities, and fairness and be vastly superior to the counterproductive economic agenda of Donald Trump."</p>

<p>The letter, a brainchild of Joseph Stiglitz, reads, "Among the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these."</p>

<p>The letter delineates how Republican nominee Donald Trump's tariff and tax policies are inflationary. However, Trump sticks to the view that his tariff plans would "have a massive effect, a positive effect."</p>

<p>"The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff," he said. "It's my favorite word."</p>

<p>However, the situation on the ground tells a different tale. According to the major polls, Americans prefer Trump over Harris when it comes to economic development. Based on the survey taken by The Financial Times, 45% of Americans favour Trump when it comes to financial decisions while only 37% lean towards Harris. Similarly a CNBC survey found that 42% of participants trusted Trump to deliver economic benefits compared to 29% for Harris.</p>

<p>Despite the discrepancy, economists remain confident in Harris' plan. "Simply put, Harris's policies will result in a stronger economic performance, with economic growth that is more robust, more sustainable, and more equitable," the economists write.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Criminal Court on Thursday accused member state Mongolia of failing to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin during a trip there last month, and referred the matter for further action.</p>

<p>The Russian leader visited Ulaanbaatar in early September despite an arrest warrant issued against him by the Hague-based court, for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children after his troops invaded the country in 2022.</p>

<p>"The International Criminal Court found that, by failing to arrest Mr Putin while he was on its territory and surrender him to the Court, Mongolia has failed to comply with the Court's request to cooperate," the ICC said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Rome Statute, the court's founding treaty signed by all member states, compels countries to arrest wanted suspects.</p>

<p>"States Parties and those accepting the Court's jurisdiction are duty-bound to arrest and surrender individuals subject to ICC warrants, regardless of official position or nationality," the ICC's judges said.</p>

<p>"In view of the seriousness of Mongolia's failure to cooperate with the Court, the Chamber deemed it necessary to refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties," the judges said, referring to the ICC's overseer body.</p>

<p>The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023.</p>

<p>It said there were "reasonable grounds to believe" that Putin "bears responsibility for the war crime of unlawful deportation" of Ukrainian children to Russia.</p>

<p>Kyiv says thousands of Ukrainian children were forcibly deported from orphanages and other state institutions after Russian forces took control of swathes of the country in its 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Russia said it moved some children away from areas close to the fighting for their own protection.</p>

<p>Moscow has dismissed the warrant as having no consequence, but the Mongolia trip marked Putin's first to an ICC member in the 18 months since it had been issued.</p>

<p>Last year he called off a visit to a BRICS summit in South Africa, another ICC member, after internal and external pressure on Pretoria to arrest the Russian leader should he attend.</p>

<p>Past instances of ICC members failing to execute arrest warrants have had little consequence beyond verbal dressing-downs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[He persuaded people to vote saying, "People vote on everything, they are voting on American Idol, you can vote to decide who's gonna represent you and our country."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president Barack Obama made an appearance on the basketball podcast, "The Young Man &amp; the Three" and exhorted young people to exercise their right to vote. The podcast was hosted by Tyrese Haliburton and Tommy Alter.</p>

<p>During the podcast, Obama urged young men to not get frustrated when it comes to the slow progress of politics and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"It's not that hard to vote," he said. "You're not gonna vote which means you're going to let a bunch of old people decide your future. You wouldn't do that about your music, you wouldn't do that about your clothes but you're gonna let them decide what your future, your potential careers, what the environments gonna look like, you're gonna let them decide that?"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here's my message to young people: you wouldn't let a bunch of old people decide what music you're going to listen to or what clothes you're going to wear – so don't let them decide your future.<br />
<br />
Make a plan to vote today: <a href="https://t.co/V3uLF7XRqt">https://t.co/V3uLF7XRqt</a> <a href="https://t.co/VR5T97x8K1">pic.twitter.com/VR5T97x8K1</a></p>
— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1849110018467017165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>He persuaded people to vote saying, "People vote on everything, they are voting on American Idol, you can vote to decide who's gonna represent you and our country."</p>

<p>One X user commented saying, "We the People see right through you... &nbsp;Race baiting trash." While another said, "Don't know how to say it more clearly, but to young people especially: If you don't vote for Kamala Harris in this presidential election, you might not have a country left in which you can ever truly be free again."</p>

<p>According to the University of Chicago's latest GenForward poll, obtained by NPR, Harris has significant support among young Black Americans, with six in 10 backing her. However, this is a notable decline from the support President Biden received four years ago, when more than seven in 10 young Black Americans supported him.</p>

<p>In contrast, former President Donald Trump has garnered support from one in five young Black Americans, with a notable 25% backing from Black men specifically. Meanwhile, only 12% of young Black women support Trump, while 16% express a desire for "someone else" beyond Trump and Harris.</p>

<p>These findings highlight challenges for Harris in maintaining strong support among young Black Americans, particularly men, ahead of the election.</p>

<p>In the episode, Obama also attacked Trump's work ethic saying, "I don't think it's any secret that I think Donald Trump is not somebody who is going to work hard on behalf of ordinary people," he said. "I think his agenda is basically about himself. His status is ego and self-promotion."</p>

<p>This year, the election campaign has seen some unorthodox stops on both sides of the coin. Obama has not been the only one endorsing Harris on a podcast, but this Friday, Trump is set to record an interview with "The Joe Rogan Experience". Harris has also become a member of the podcasting world by giving an interview on, "Call Her Daddy", a popular podcast among women.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Privacy campaigners filed a complaint this week against lifestyle website Pinterest, accusing it of secretly gathering personal data to use for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>Pinterest users are automatically opted-in to data sharing, in a breach of European Union privacy laws, Austria-based group None Of Your Business said in a statement received by AFP on Thursday.</p>

<p>The group filed the case on Tuesday in France after receiving a complaint from a French user of the platform, where subscribers swap ideas on home furnishings, travel, recipes and other lifestyle concerns.</p>

<p>"Pinterest is secretly tracking European users without asking for their consent," Kleanthi Sardeli of NOYB said in the statement.</p>

<p>"This allows the social media platform to unlawfully profit from people's personal data without them ever finding out."</p>

<p>Pinterest told news agency AFP they had not seen the complaint yet, but a company spokesman insisted their approach to targeted advertising complied with European privacy law.</p>

<p>NOYB spearheads a campaign to have Europe's 2018 regulation on data privacy (GDPR) enforced by complaining to data regulators in jurisdictions across the bloc.</p>

<p>GDPR imposes strict limits on the reasons a company or other entity can use to justify gathering personal data in Europe.</p>

<p>But many tech companies built their businesses by taking people's data and using it to sell targeted advertising.</p>

<p>These firms initially relied on an exception that allowed them to bypass GDPR's restrictions by claiming they had a "legitimate interest" in harvesting the data.</p>

<p>But EU regulators and the European Court of Justice have repeatedly ruled that "legitimate interest" cannot be used to warrant collecting such information for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>"It appears that Pinterest is actively ignoring a European Court of Justice ruling in order to maximise its profits," said Sardeli.</p>

<p>The group is asking France's data regulator CNIL to erase users' information, impose a fine on Pinterest and oblige it to comply with the GDPR rules.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris has Bruce Springsteen and Eminem. Donald Trump has the world's richest man. But will it make any difference on Election Day?</p>

<p>Celebrity endorsements do little to sway voter opinion, experts say, and polls show only a sliver of the electorate have yet to make up their mind before the November 5 vote.</p>

<p>But big names appearing at campaign events help to grab headlines and boost enthusiasm among key groups, which could spur higher turnout or motivate more early voting -- as millions have already done.</p>

<p>With two weeks to go, "your real goal right now has to be to get your audience, your voters to show up," Megan Duncan, a communications professor at Virginia Tech, told AFP.</p>

<p>In an election expected to be decided by razor thin margins in a handful of states, any marginal lift could prove decisive.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Harris got the endorsement of rapper and Detroit icon Eminem at a rally in the city. Also attending was former president Barack Obama, a superstar in the Democratic Party who rapped the opening segments of Eminem's famous hit "Lose Yourself" to cheers from the crowd.</p>

<p>Duncan said celebrities would be used more by campaigns in the final two weeks to tap into a localized "sense of identity," with appearances becoming "more targeted" to specific cities.</p>

<p>Popstar Lizzo joined Harris last weekend for an event to mark the first day of early voting in the "About Damn Time" singer's home city of Detroit, while R&amp;B star Usher appeared with the vice president in Atlanta, where he launched his career.</p>

<p>Democrats hope that the potent presence of Obama, America's first Black US president, and his popular wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, will shore up support among African American voters, particularly men, in key cities.</p>

<p>The former president is also set to hold multiple events with rocker Bruce Springsteen in the coming days, with Harris joining them in Atlanta on Thursday, her campaign said.</p>

<p>Superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris minutes after her first and only debate against Trump, in early September, timing which Duncan called "very strategic... to have the most impact."</p>

<h2><strong>TEAM TRUMP</strong></h2>

<p>Trump has relatively few celebs in his corner, but a few power hitters are nonetheless working to push him over the finish line.</p>

<p>Most notably is the world's richest person, Elon Musk, who has donated at least $75 million to efforts at electing Trump and other Republicans.</p>

<p>The SpaceX and Tesla boss has also used his influential platform on X, which he rebranded from Twitter after buying it, to boost Trump-aligned and often false narratives about immigration and other hot-button issues.</p>

<p>In recent days, he has campaigned for Trump in Pennsylvania, telling voters there that the key swing state could decide the "fate of Western civilization."</p>

<p>But the eccentric billionaire has also courted controversy, including by launching a legally dubious $1 million daily sweepstakes that only registered voters in swing states can win.</p>

<p>While Musk's support could lift enthusiasm among some who view him favorably, particularly young men, it also risks alienating moderate voters weary from almost a decade of Trump's norm-breaking.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign's push to expand support among young men has received a boost from Dana White, the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July and recently on ex-NFL star Robert Griffin III's podcast.</p>

<p>Trump's backers also include several financial personalities with large social media followings, including David Sacks and Bill Ackman, and a few prominent Hollywood actors such as Jon Voight and Dennis Quaid.</p>

<p>But aside from Kid Rock and country singer Lee Greenwood, who frequently performs his patriotic anthem "God Bless the USA" at rallies, Trump has few star musicians to lean on in the final two weeks.</p>

<p>The Republican instead uses on an oft-repeated playlist, which includes the Village People's 1978 hits "Y.M.C.A." and "Macho Man."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has seen several musicians or their estates threaten legal action against unapproved uses of their songs.</p>

<p>The most recent action came last week, after the 78-year-old played Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," as performed by Rufus Wainwright, at an event in Pennsylvania.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly amended laws in Nepal to tackle crimes committed during its decade-long bitter civil war could instead deprive victims of justice and grant amnesty to those culpable, rights lawyers warned Thursday.</p>

<p>Both government forces and former rebels are accused of carrying out torture, killings, rapes and forced disappearances during Nepal's Maoist insurgency.</p>

<p>The conflict ended in 2006 with a peace deal that brought the rebels into government and promised justice for the victims, whick included more than 16,000 dead and around 1,000 missing.</p>

<p>Nepal's two transitional justice commissions began operating in 2015, but failed to resolve a single case, despite receiving over 60,000 complaints of murders, torture and unexplained disappearances.</p>

<p>In August, parliament passed long-delayed amendments to the transitional justice act aiming to address this.</p>

<p>But a team of international rights lawyers, in a report released Thursday and based on a research mission to Nepal, warned the changes could do the opposite and exclude "swathes of victims" from justice.</p>

<p>The lawyers added that the new law "permits amnesties which would prevent criminal accountability for gross violations of human rights".</p>

<p>The lawyers said that until addressed, the "doors to the regular justice system should not be closed".</p>

<p>The group was supported by rights organisation Peace Brigades International (PBI).</p>

<p>Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, a constitutional lawyer from Sri Lanka, and part of the team, said effective justice was not possible so long as the law "excludes certain gross violations, opens the door for amnesties and allows for the exclusion of certain victims".</p>

<p>Just two convictions related to crimes committed during the civil war crimes have been handed down in civilian courts.</p>

<p>One was linked to the murder of a teenage girl. The other was related to the killing of a journalist.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin today said he welcomed "sincere" comments made by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump about bringing an end to Russia's conflict with Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday his relationship with the United States after the presidential elections would depend on what attitude Washington adopts, as he welcomed comments by Donald Trump on his desire to end the Ukraine conflict as "sincere".</p>

<p>But the Kremlin leader struck a hardline tone, warning the West it was an "illusion" to think Russia could be defeated on the battlefield and that any peace deal would have to recognise Russia's control of swathes of Ukrainian territory.</p>

<p>Putin was speaking at the end of the BRICS summit in the city of Kazan, where he had faced calls from some of Russia's most important allies for the fighting in Ukraine to end.</p>

<p>"How Russian-American relations will develop after the election will depend on the United States. If they are open, then we will also be open. And if they don't want it, then fine," Putin told reporters in Kazan.</p>

<p>Relations between the two superpowers have sunk to their lowest since the Cold War amid Moscow's military offensive on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Next month's US election is set to be critical to the course of future ties and the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly expressed scepticism over Washington's multi-billion dollar aid to Ukraine and claimed that if elected he could end the fighting in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>Putin said Trump "spoke about his desire to do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine. I think he is being sincere. Of course we welcome statements like this, whoever they come from."</p>

<h2><strong>REALITIES ON GROUND</strong></h2>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among around 20 leaders that gathered for the BRICS summit, the largest diplomatic event in Russia since Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>The Kremlin leader said Moscow was open to considering peace initiatives and welcomed BRICS leaders offering to mediate.</p>

<p>But he said any deal must consider the "realities on the ground" -- a reference to Ukrainian territory controlled by Russian forces.</p>

<p>"We are ready to look at any proposals for peace negotiations that are based on the realities on the ground. We won't accept anything else," he said.</p>

<p>Putin has previously demanded Kyiv effectively capitulate by pulling its troops back as a precondition to ceasefire talks.</p>

<p>And on Thursday he blasted the West for thinking Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Moscow's opponents "do not conceal their aim to deal our country a strategic defeat", he said.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I will say directly that these are illusionary calculations, that can be made only by those who do not know Russia's history."</p>

<p>Russia has faced fresh accusations of escalating the conflict this week with the United States, South Korea, NATO and Kyiv all saying North Korea had sent troops to Russia.</p>

<p>Kyiv said Thursday it had intelligence that the soldiers had already been deployed to Russia's western Kursk region, where Ukraine is mounting a cross-border offensive.</p>

<p>Putin refused to confirm or deny the reports on Thursday, instead accusing Ukraine and the West of aggravating the conflict.</p>

<h3><strong>MIDDLE EAST</strong></h3>

<p>Putin also held talks with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in the pair's first meeting since April 2022.</p>

<p>The Kremlin did not broadcast opening remarks, though both sides had said the talks would cover Ukraine.</p>

<p>The UN chief had pleaded earlier for a "just peace" in Ukraine in a speech delivered in front of Putin.</p>

<p>"We need peace in Ukraine. A just peace in line with the UN Charter, international law and (UN) General Assembly resolution," Guterres told the summit.</p>

<p>Ukraine has strongly criticised Guterres's decision to meet the "criminal Putin".</p>

<p>Guterres also demanded an "immediate ceasefire" in Gaza, the release of hostages and an "immediate cessation of hostilities" in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Other world leaders at the summit also called for an end to Israel's wars in Lebanon and Gaza, with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas saying Israel was trying to starve Gazan civilians and drive them from their territory.</p>

<p>Xi warned about "serious challenges" in the world and said he hoped BRICS countries could be a "stabilising force for peace".</p>

<p>"We need to continue to push for a ceasefire in Gaza, relaunch the two-state solution and stop the spread of war in Lebanon. There should be no more suffering and destruction in Palestine and Lebanon," Xi said.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian slammed the UN Security Council's role in front of Guterres, saying international bodies "lack the necessary efficiency to extinguish the fire of this crisis".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wire-tapping scandal has rocked Mauritius just weeks before the Indian Ocean island nation goes to the polls.</p>

<p>Phone calls by politicians, journalists, members of civil society and even foreign diplomats have been recorded and leaked online this month, local media reports said.</p>

<p>Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF, said five well-known journalists were among those wiretapped and called for an independent investigation into who was responsible.</p>

<p>"Eavesdropping on journalists' telephone conversations and exposing them on social media constitutes a serious threat to their safety and the protection of their sources," it said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>"As Mauritius is heading into legislative elections, RSF is concerned about these leaks, which point to a system of widespread wiretapping that does not spare media professionals."</p>

<p>Mauritius, a prosperous and stable democracy in a sometimes volatile region, will hold a general election on November 10.</p>

<p>RSF said Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth and police had claimed the leaked calls were manipulated using artificial intelligence, but added that the five journalists had confirmed the authenticity of the conversations.</p>

<p>"The authorities are hiding behind the artificial intelligence argument because they are embarrassed," RSF quoted Nawaz Noorbux, news director of private radio station Radio Plus, as saying.</p>

<p>Mauritius Telecom issued a statement earlier this week in light of the phone-tapping allegations, saying the company "does not in anyway whatsoever, intercept, monitor, or manipulate any communication".</p>

<p>In the November 10 election, Jugnauth's ruling Militant Socialist Movement is looking to hold on to its majority in the National Assembly and give the prime minister a new five-year term.</p>

<p>Jugnauth took over as premier from his father in 2017 without going through a vote, before his coalition secured victory in the 2019 polls.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The IMF wants to know more about a cross-border payments system discussed by the BRICS group of countries this week and aimed at boosting non-dollar transactions, the Fund's managing director said Thursday.</p>

<p>The meeting of the BRICS -- meaning Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- took place in the Russian city of Kazan at the same time as the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Washington.</p>

<p>The BRICS group has expanded significantly since its inception in 2009, and now includes countries such as Iran, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Altogether the BRICS coalition accounts for a significant minority of the world's economic output.</p>

<p>At the Kazan summit, Russia secured a joint declaration encouraging the "strengthening of correspondent banking networks within BRICS and enabling settlements in local currencies in line with BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI)."</p>

<p>The system is designed to rival the European-headquartered SWIFT payments system, from which Russia was barred following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at the IMF's headquarters in Washington on Thursday, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the Fund wanted additional information about the proposed payments system before taking a firm stance on it.</p>

<p>"The idea of having a payments system of a group of countries is not new," she said.</p>

<p>"What we need to see is more details," she added. "What is it in this idea? How that may translate into reality? And then we will be able to assess it."</p>

<p><strong>Decline in Suez revenues&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>During her press conference, Georgieva said the Fund was focused on two main objectives going forward: Ensuring inflation rates return to central bank targets without spurring a deep recession; and fixing the current "low growth, high debt path" that many countries are on.</p>

<p>She also addressed what she called the tragedy in the Middle East, which she said was affecting both citizens and regional economies.</p>

<p>"Egypt is losing 70 percent of the revenues it used to collect from the Suez canal because of the impact of the conflict," she said, adding that the IMF had downgraded the MENA region by 0.6 percentage points since April.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi said the country had lost "$6-7 billion" this year, in an apparent reference to Suez Canal revenues.</p>

<p>Georgieva also welcomed the progress made in helping countries facing debt crises, notably via the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) forum for dialogue between creditors and countries in debt distress.</p>

<p>While the GSDR was helping to make the process of debt restructuring "more predictable and efficient," there was more work to do, she said.</p>

<p>"We need to do more to help countries in debt distress get back on their feet faster," she added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada said today that it was significantly curbing immigration targets in an effort to "pause population growth," a shift that comes as public support for immigration declines.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada said Thursday it was significantly curbing immigration targets, a dramatic shift that comes as public support for new arrivals declines.</p>

<p>This marks a big pivot for a country with a long-standing reputation as a destination for immigrants, including economic migrants from the developing world seeking better living conditions.</p>

<p>Canada's population jumped 3.2 percent from 2023 to 2024, the biggest annual rise since 1957, and now stands at 41 million, the national statistic agency said.</p>

<p>It said the rise was partly fuelled by an unprecedented wave of new arrivals.</p>

<p>Announcing the curbs, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the influx helped the Canadian economy bounce back from disruptions caused by the Covid pandemic but the time had come to make "adjustments."</p>

<p>"Today, we're announcing that we will reduce the number of immigrants we bring in over the next three years, which will result in a pause in the population growth over the next two years," Trudeau said.</p>

<p>Trudeau said Canada needed to stabilize its population to give "all levels of government time to catch up, time to make the necessary investments in health care, in housing, (and) in social services to accommodate more people in the future."</p>

<p>The immigration ministry had previously planned to let 500,000 new permanent residents settle in the country in 2025 and 2026.</p>

<p>But the new targets were revised down to 395,000 next year and 380,000 for 2026. It set the 2027 target at 365,000.</p>

<p>Immigration Minister Marc Miller called the plan "probably the first of its kind," in terms of its broad efforts to control population growth in Canada.</p>

<p>According to the last census in 2021, 23 percent of the population was foreign-born.</p>

<p>Statistic Canada said that as of 2021 most immigrants were from Asia and the Middle East, but an increasing share were coming from Africa. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly one of five recent immigrants were born in India, the statistics agency said.</p>

<h2><strong>ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT?</strong></h2>

<p>A survey last month from the Environics Institute on public attitudes toward immigration found that "for the first time in a quarter century, a clear majority of Canadians say there is too much immigration."</p>

<p>Fifty-eight percent of Canadians believe the country takes in too many immigrants, up 14 percentage points from 2023, the survey found.</p>

<p>In figures released last week, Abacus Data found that one of every two Canadians say immigration is harming the country.</p>

<p>The Abacus figures also noted that concern among Canadians about the impact of immigration is mostly linked to unease regarding a perceived lack of essential resources, notably affordable housing.</p>

<p>Miller in particular stressed the new plans efforts to address what many Canadians refer to as a housing crisis.</p>

<p>He predicted that revising immigration targets downwards will address the housing supply gap, reducing by 670,000 the number of homes Canada needs to build by 2027.</p>

<p>"That is significant," Miller told reporters.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US government is concerned about China's use of artificial intelligence to repress its population, spread misinformation and undermine the security of the United States and its allies, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Sullivan told an event at the National Defense University that a new US directive on AI was intended in part to help address those concerns, and to help offer alternatives to developing economies and other partners around the world.</p>

<p>"We know that China is building its own technological ecosystem with digital infrastructure that won't protect sensitive data, that can enable mass surveillance and censorship, that can spread misinformation and that can make countries vulnerable to coercion," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris heads to the battleground of Georgia on Thursday for a star-studded rally featuring rock legend Bruce Springsteen, entertainer Tyler Perry and former President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>It's the latest attempt by the Kamala Harris campaign to capitalize on the backing of movie and music stars to rally voters in the closing days of a tight election race against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris' whirlwind campaign started with a big jump in polls after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in late July, but her lead has narrowed in national polls and evaporated in the battleground states that will decide the U.S. election.</p>

<p>Celebrity endorsers add cultural cachet to candidates, and have typically helped campaigns raise money, turn out crowds at rallies and generate excitement on social media. For both the Harris and Trump campaigns, they are part of the down-to-the-wire blitz to mobilize voters ahead of Election Day on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>It will also mark the first time Harris and Obama will campaign together. Harris is also slated to appear with Michelle Obama on Saturday in Michigan, one of seven swing states expected to decide the winner on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>The latest polls in Georgia show Trump with a slight lead, but Harris campaign officials say they remain confident the state - along with its neighbor North Carolina - are still in play come November. President Joe Biden pulled off a surprise victory in Georgia in 2020, and Democrats won two hard-fought Senate seats there that gave them control of both houses in Congress for the first half of Biden's term.</p>

<p>Some 1.9 million residents have already cast their ballot in Georgia, according to the secretary of state's office.</p>

<p>On Monday, Springsteen, 75, will also appear in Philadelphia with Obama and the Harris campaign has signaled more concerts with other musicians will be announced soon.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Current climate policies will result in global warming of more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, according to a United Nations report on Thursday, more than twice the rise agreed to nearly a decade ago.</p>

<p>The annual Emissions Gap report, which takes stock of countries' promises to tackle climate change compared with what is needed, finds the world faces as much as 3.1 C (5.6 F) of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100 if governments do not take greater action on slashing planet-warming emissions.</p>

<p>Governments in 2015 signed up to the Paris Agreement and a cap of 1.5 C (2.7 F) warming to prevent a cascade of dangerous impacts.</p>

<p>"We're teetering on a planetary tight rope," U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a speech on Thursday. "Either leaders bridge the emissions gap, or we plunge headlong into climate disaster".</p>

<p>Global greenhouse gas emissions rose by 1.3% between 2022 and 2023, to a new high of 57.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, the report said.</p>

<p>Under current pledges to take future action, temperatures would still rise between 2.6 C (4.7 F) and 2.8 C (5 F) by 2100, the report found. That is in line with findings from the past three years.</p>

<p>"If we look at the progress towards 2030 targets, especially of the G20 member states ... they have not made a lot of progress towards their current climate targets for 2030," said Anne Olhoff, chief scientific editor of the report.</p>

<p>The world has currently warmed by about 1.3 C (2.3 F).</p>

<p>Nations will gather next month at the annual United Nations climate summit (COP29) in Azerbaijan, where they will work to build on an agreement made last year to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Negotiations in Baku will help to inform each country's updated emissions-cutting strategy, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which are due in February 2025.</p>

<p>The report suggests that nations must collectively commit to and implement a cut of 42% on yearly greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and reach 57% by 2035 for any hope of preventing warming beyond 1.5 C - a target now seen as likely out of reach.</p>

<p>Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, urged countries to use the Baku talks to increase action in their NDCs. "Every fraction of a degree avoided counts," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A broad consensus has been achieved by India and China on restoring the "ground situation" along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) pursuant to talks, including for patrolling and grazing cattle in the traditional areas, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Chanakya Defence Dialogue 2024, Singh described the agreement reached between the two countries as a "significant development" that underscores the importance of defence dialogue on the global stage.</p>

<p>"India and China have been involved in talks both at military and diplomatic levels to resolve differences in certain areas along the LAC. Pursuant to the talks, a broad consensus has been achieved to restore the ground situation based on the principle of equal and mutual security," Singh said.</p>

<p>"The consensus achieved includes patrolling and grazing (cattle) in the traditional areas. This is the power of engaging in continuous dialogue because sooner or later, solutions will emerge," the defence minister added.</p>

<p>In a major breakthrough in ending the over four-year-long military standoff, India on Monday announced that it has reached an agreement with China on patrolling along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.</p>

<p>It is understood that the agreement will facilitate patrolling in Depsang and Demchok areas as there were major unresolved issues in these two places.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping endorsed the India-China agreement on patrolling and disengagement along the LAC in eastern Ladakh on the margins of the BRICS Summit in Russia.</p>

<p>They also issued directions to revive various bilateral dialogue mechanisms, signalling attempts to normalise ties that were hit by a military clash at Galwan in eastern Ladakh in 2020.</p>

<p>Speaking at the event, Singh also said security is a broad and multifaceted concept that encompasses many other factors, including internal stability, economic resilience, and the protection of critical infrastructure, all of which are essential to a nation's overall security framework.</p>

<p>"Security is often associated with border protection. When we think of security, images of soldiers stationed on the borders, aircraft patrolling the skies, and naval ships guarding the seas typically come to mind. However, as you all know, security extends far beyond border defence," Singh said.</p>

<p>The defence minister also said that indigenous manufacturing of arms and defence equipment strengthens the security infrastructure as well as the economy of the country.</p>

<p>Had defence been recognised as an integral component of development and studied more comprehensively in the past, India might have achieved self-reliance in the defence sector much earlier, Singh said, adding that self-reliance in defence is a prominent national goal, but does not imply working in isolation from the global community.</p>

<p>"When India speaks of self-reliance, it is important to clarify that it does not imply working in isolation from the global community. Instead, as we pursue our goal of self-reliance, we remain dedicated to fostering an equitable and inclusive world order," he said.</p>

<p>India is committed to collaborating closely with all the nations to promote a fair and just international system, the defence minister said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's King Charles III's remote private estate in the Scottish Highlands could become an exclusive location for weddings, if an application to the local council is approved.</p>

<p>Documents submitted for consideration next week by the licencing board of Aberdeenshire Council outline plans to allow "weddings, dinners, meetings and associated events" at the Queen's Building on the royal Balmoral Estate.</p>

<p>The Queen's Building lies just north of Balmoral Castle near the estate office and stables, and was built in the 1980s as staff quarters and a canteen.</p>

<p>It was converted last year to accommodate dining for visitors.</p>

<p>If approved at next Wednesday's licencing board meeting, the venue could host up to 277 guests inside, with a further 144 on an outside patio.</p>

<p>Permission to sell alcohol and play music is also part of the application, which was submitted on April 30, the documents showed.</p>

<p>"These events may involve live performances and dancing, where alcohol may be sold up to 12:30 am. These events will be rare throughout the year," the application added.</p>

<p>Balmoral, set in 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of sprawling grouse moors, forest and farmland, is located around 50 miles (31 kilometres) west of Aberdeen and was the late Queen Elizabeth II's favourite royal residence.</p>

<p>She died there on September 8, 2022, aged 96 after a period of ill health.</p>

<p>Privately owned by the monarch, the castle was bought by Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert in the mid-19th century and has since become a favoured summer retreat for the royals.</p>

<p>Its grounds have been open to the public for many years and provision for tourists has gradually increased in recent times, with holiday cottages and Land Rover tours of the estate.</p>

<p>This year the rest of the venue was opened to visitors for the first time, billed as part of plans by King Charles III to give a better insight into royal life.</p>

<p>Tickets for the guided tours were snapped up within 24 hours of going on sale, despite prices upwards of £100 ($130).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France should charge visitors a small fee to see the Notre-Dame cathedral to help the country keep its world-famous churches and cathedrals in shape, the culture minister said.</p>

<p>Rachida Dati told newspaper Le Figaro in an interview published late on Wednesday that by charging only 5 euros per visitor Notre-Dame could raise 75 million euros ($81 million) a year.</p>

<p>In France, where secularism is part of the national identity, the state is in charge of maintaining the country's religious sites, including 15,000 classified as historic monuments, which are usually free of charge.</p>

<p>Notre-Dame has been undergoing reconstruction after a fire severely damaged its roof and spire. President Emmanuel Macron had pledged to rebuild Notre-Dame within five years, drawing massive private-sector financial support.</p>

<p>Dati, a former Paris district mayor, also said tourists from outside the European Union should pay more to visit non-religious landmarks.</p>

<p>"Is it normal that a French visitor pays the same entrance fee to the Louvre as a Brazilian or Chinese visitor?", Dati said, adding:</p>

<p>"I want visitors from outside the EU to pay more for their entrance ticket and for this supplement to go towards financing the renovation of our national heritage."</p>

<p>The minister said many of the country's famous buildings attracting millions of tourists per year were in a degraded state and that new funding sources were needed to address mounting preservation challenges, especially in the capital.</p>

<p>She said the ministry was working on implementing a new pricing policy, which is likely to require coordination with various public and private entities, from January 2026.</p>

<p>"A country that gives up on carrying out major cultural projects gives up on being a great nation," Dati said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Jensen Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India on Thursday, with passes sold out and tech enthusiasts spending thousands of rupees to travel to the event.</p>

<p>The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the "Jensanity" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.</p>

<p>The event, where the US company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was "easily a few thousand".</p>

<p>"This was Coldplay, but for tech bros. The passes were all sold out," Yuvraj Mehta, a robotics engineer for an AI startup that is part of the Nvidia incubation program said, referring to the British rock band.</p>

<p>Two engineers, who declined to be named, said they had spent more than 40,000 rupees ($476) in total to travel to Mumbai to attend the summit from Surat in the Western state of Gujarat and Gurgaon in the northern state of Haryana.</p>

<p>Big Tech CEOs enjoy strong popularity in India, where engineering degrees from colleges including the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) are considered a path to prosperity.</p>

<p>But some attendees said that even among them Huang - who has built Nvidia as the dominant provider of the processors essential to generative AI - stands out.</p>

<p>"He's a hero". "He's a hero in the academic and student communities, and the AI ecosystem community," said Akash Bansal, founder of robotics startup Orangewood Labs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, was released from prison on Thursday, a day after she was granted bail in a case linked to the illegal sale of state gifts, ending about nine months of imprisonment.</p>

<p>The release is the biggest legal relief for Imran Khan and his family since he was imprisoned in August last year. Bushra Bibi, who was arrested in January, was released from Adiala Jail in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where Imran Khan still remains.</p>

<p>Local television channels showed a small number of supporters throwing rose petals on two white SUVs escorting her from the jail.</p>

<p>Bushra Bibi faces at least one other graft case linked to receiving land from a real estate developer.</p>

<p>"Welcome back Bushra Bibi! You have faced extremely difficult times, disgusting campaign and character assassination attempts against your during your illegal time in jail," Imran Khan's party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Imran Khan himself faces dozens of other cases, including charges of violating anti-terrorism laws, brought since he was removed as premier in 2022 and launched a protest movement against a coalition of his rivals led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>

<p>The Khans deny all the charges, saying they are trumped up by the government to discredit the 72-year-old former cricket star, who remains widely popular and whose candidates won the most seats in February's general election.</p>

<p>The Sharif-led government says it does not interfere in the judicial process. Imran Khan's standoff with the country's powerful military, who he says backs Sharif, has spawned the worst political turmoil in decades in the nation of 241 million people.</p>

<p>Bushra Bibi, whose actual name is Bushra Khan, is Imran Khan's third wife. The two married six months before he became prime minister for the first time in 2018.</p>

<p>Imran Khan has often called her his spiritual leader and she is known for her devotion to Sufism, a mystical form of Islam. She has mostly remained away from the public eye, appearing in only one television interview - that too wearing her traditional veil.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

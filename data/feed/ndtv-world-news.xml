       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes on Saturday killed at least 48 people in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian health authorities said, as clashes took place in central and southern areas of the enclave ahead of the planned start of a polio vaccination campaign.</p>

<p>The United Nations is due to start vaccinating some 640,000 children in the territory against polio, relying on daily eight-hour pauses in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas in specific areas of the besieged enclave.</p>

<p>Yousef Abu Al-Reesh, Gaza's deputy minister of health, said vaccination teams would try to get to as many areas as possible to ensure wide coverage but he said only a comprehensive ceasefire could guarantee enough children are reached.</p>

<p>"If the international community truly wants this campaign to succeed, it should call for a ceasefire, knowing that this virus does not stop, and can reach anywhere," he told reporters at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>On Saturday, medics administered vaccines on some of the children at Nasser Hospital wards in a symbolic move before the official campaign begins.</p>

<p>The campaign follows confirmation last week that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>WHO officials say at least 90% of the children need to be vaccinated twice with four weeks between doses for the campaign to succeed, but it faces huge challenges in Gaza, which has been largely destroyed by nearly 11 months of war.</p>

<p>On Saturday, as more than 2,000 medical and community workers prepared for the start of the campaign, medics in Nuseirat, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, medics said separate Israeli strikes killed at least 19 people, including nine members of the same family.</p>

<p>More than 30 other people were killed in a series of strikes in other areas of Gaza, medics said.</p>

<p>Residents and militant sources said fighters from Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and other groups fought against Israeli forces in the northern Gaza Zeitoun neighborhood, where tanks have been operating for days, and in Rafah, near the border with Egypt.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement it continued to operate in the central and southern Gaza Strip. It said troops killed militants and dismantled military infrastructure in Gaza City, while they located weapons and killed gunmen in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.</p>

<p>In Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, families returned to their areas after the army ended a 22-day offensive it said was aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. Footage showed large areas were flattened, and buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.</p>

<p>Medics said they recovered at least nine bodies from the area where the army operated.</p>

<p>The latest episode in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed more than 40,600 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry. Nearly the entire Gaza population of 2.3 million has been displaced and the enclave has a hunger crisis. Israel faces genocide allegations at the World Court that it denies.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Israel forces pushed on with a military operation in the city of Jenin. Drones and helicopters circled overhead while the sound of sporadic firing could be heard in the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent Russian media outlet Mediazona said Saturday according to its estimates more than 66,000 Russian military personnel have died during the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Mediazona has been drawing up a list of known soldier deaths in conjunction with the BBC Russian Service using open-source data.</p>

<p>Previously in April, they announced they had found more than 50,000 names of Russians killed.</p>

<p>Mediazona said Saturday that "as of August 30, we know the names of 66,471 Russian soldiers killed in the war".</p>

<p>The list has gone up by more than 4,600 in the last four weeks, it said, while stressing this was not a definitive figure since many soldiers' deaths are not made public.</p>

<p>Anastasia Alekseyeva, a journalist at Mediazona, stressed that the latest death numbers were "not linked to Ukraine's offensive in the Kursk region or Russia's advance in the east".</p>

<p>This is because researchers are still working through a backlog of death reports, she said.</p>

<p>The report found that 172 conscripts doing national service have been killed in the war, with the highest figures in early months.</p>

<p>However these figures may be inexact since conscripts can sign professional army contracts and some may have done so without telling relatives, Mediazona editor Dmitry Treshchanin said.</p>

<p>According to Mediazona's breakdown, the region with the largest absolute number of deaths -- 2,578 -- is the southern republic of Bashkortostan, which has a large Muslim population.</p>

<p>The most represented age group overall was 33-35 (6,877 deaths).</p>

<p>More than 12,000 of the dead were prisoners, after Russia sought to recruit inmates by promising them freedom after a period on the front line.</p>

<p>But numbers have dropped recently, Alekseyeva said: "evidently the recruitment drive is not as active".</p>

<p>Mediazona and the BBC along with volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022, using open-source information from official reports and the media, as well as using satellite images of Russian cemeteries to estimate the number of new graves.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that almost 700,0000 Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Moscow rarely talks about the losses it has sustained in what it calls a "special military operation".</p>

<p>The defence ministry in September 2022 said 5,937 soldiers had been killed in combat.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the first two years of the war.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete slabs and sheet metal were piled high alongside streets in Jenin on Saturday, as residents assessed the damage from Israel's latest West Bank raid even as explosions persisted nearby.</p>

<p>The scars of ongoing clashes in the occupied Palestinian territory, which began on Wednesday as part of what Israel has described as a counter-terrorism operation, were everywhere: collapsed walls, uprooted trees, tiled roofs covering mounds of rubble.</p>

<p>Bulldozers rumbled through the streets on the first day of the raid, clearing the way for Israeli soldiers while tearing up the asphalt and piercing underground pipes, residents of one neighbourhood in east Jenin told AFP.</p>

<p>Three days later, with fighting elsewhere in the city continuing, "we are cut off from the world", Taher al-Saadi said.</p>

<p>"The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work."</p>

<p>He added: "The bakeries are at a standstill. We can't find milk for the children."</p>

<p>Israel raids are not unusual in Jenin, whose refugee camp is a bastion for armed groups fighting Israel.</p>

<p>But the operation launched on Wednesday was unusually large and long, hitting multiple West Bank cities at once and, in Jenin, showing no sign of letting up.</p>

<p>"I think it's the worst day since the start of the raid," Wisam Bakr, director of Jenin Government Hospital, said on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We hear from time to time clashes and sometimes there is big bombing."</p>

<h3><strong>'Dark days'</strong></h3>

<p>Not far from where Faiza Abu Jaafar lives, an 82-year-old man was shot dead on Friday by an Israeli sniper, residents say, bringing to 20 the number of Palestinians killed in the operation so far.</p>

<p>Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have said at least 13 of the dead were members of their armed wings.</p>

<p>While Israeli military vehicles and bulldozers left the area near her home on Saturday morning, apparently heading for Jenin's refugee camp, Abu Jaafar said she and her relatives were still shaken.</p>

<p>"It's very hard, for the children and for everyone. We are afraid, we are terrified, look at all the damage," she said, standing amid piles of rubble.</p>

<p>"We are living in dark days."</p>

<p>Just how dark is still unclear, as Jenin governor Kamal Abu al-Rub told AFP that even he does not know exactly what is happening inside the camp, where the latest fighting appeared to be concentrated.</p>

<p>"The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access," he said.</p>

<p>"Neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there."</p>

<p>The Israeli army has denied cutting off access to hospitals, saying it has positioned its forces to prevent militants from gathering in them while allowing ambulances to come and go.</p>

<p>Violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The United Nations said on Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Nineteen Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said the forces involved in the current raid, which began on Wednesday, were fewer than the number who carried out a large-scale raid in July 2023 that left 13 dead.</p>

<p>Yet Abu al-Rub, the Jenin governor, said the latest operation made him think of a notorious 2002 battle in Jenin that left dozens of Palestinians and Israelis dead.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Shoshani explicitly rejected the comparison, saying the ongoing operation in the West Bank was not "extremely different" from regular activity.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[By analyzing seismic waves generated by large earthquakes, geophysicists identified a region where these waves slow down as they pass through the outer core.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have unravelled a doughnut-like structure buried deep within Earth's swirling outer core of molten metal. The exciting discovery was reported in a new study published in Science Advances.</p>

<p>The discovery was made by a research team that analysed seismic waves generated by large earthquakes. The expert team included Professor Hrvoje Tkalcic, a geophysicist from the Australian National University. These waves travel through Earth, giving scientists information about its internal composition.</p>

<p>As <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn5562">Professor Tkalcic explained</a>, the researchers focused on how these seismic waves were slowing down while passing through a certain portion of the outer core near its boundary with the mantle.</p>

<p>"By understanding the paths of those waves and their travel times, we reconstructed their journey through the Earth's outer core," he added.</p>

<p>These waves were slower, indicating that a torus-shaped, or doughnut-shaped, region within the outer core was orientated parallel to the equator. This finds a new layer of complexity to the structure at the interior of the Earth.</p>

<p>The authors of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn5562">study write,</a> "Thermochemical inhomogeneities in the Earth's outer core that enhance our understanding of the geodynamo have been elusive. Seismic constraints on such inhomogeneities would provide clues on the amount and distribution of light elements in the core apart from iron and nickel."</p>

<p>"Here, we present evidence for a low-velocity volume within the outer core via the global coda correlation wavefield. Several key correlogram features with a unique sensitivity to the liquid core show variations with wave paths remarkably slower in the equatorial than polar planes. We constrain a torus structure at low latitudes with 2% lower velocity than the surrounding liquid outer core via waveform modeling. We propose a thermochemical origin for such a low-velocity torus, providing important constraints on the dynamical processes of the Earth's outer core," the author said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five people were killed and 46 injured in a Ukrainian attack on the southwestern Russian city of Belgorod late on Friday, the local governor said, the latest in a series of strikes by Ukraine on the city in recent months.</p>

<p>Vyacheslav Gladkov said 37 of the injured, including seven children, were taken to hospitals in the city, which lies 40 km (25 miles) north of the border with Ukraine.</p>

<p>Video filmed from inside a vehicle, posted on social media and purporting to show the attack, showed a car being blown up while moving along a road. Seconds later another explosion is seen metres away. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.</p>

<p>Russia's Foreign Ministry condemned the attack.</p>

<p>"Once again we call on all responsible governments and relevant international structures to strongly condemn this brutal terrorist attack and publicly distance themselves from the Kyiv regime and its Western curators who commit such crimes," it said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The ministry added that Russia's "special military operation" will continue until it reaches all the goals including Ukraine's "demilitarisation and de-nazification".</p>

<p>Russia's Investigation Committee said on its Telegram channel that it had initiated a criminal case into the attack.</p>

<p>Authorities also reported that a woman was injured on Saturday during Ukrainian shelling of the border town of Shebekino in the Belgorod region.</p>

<p>Ukraine has staged frequent attacks on Belgorod and other Russian border regions in recent months, with the city the focal point of the attacks.</p>

<p>Ukraine and Russia say they do not deliberately target civilians in the war that began when Russia sent thousands of troops into its smaller neighbour in February 2022.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The search and rescue operation for an Indian woman who fell into a sinkhole in Malaysia eight days ago has been halted at the site in Jalan Masjid India, Kuala Lumpur, the fire and rescue department said as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/kl-sinkhole-search-for-victim-halted-at-jalan-masjid-india-continues-at-sewage-plant" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Straits Times.</a></p>

<p>However, rescue efforts would continue at the Pantai Dalam IWK sewage plant, the department added.</p>

<p>Findings revealed it was too risky to continue search and rescue using scuba diving methods, the department's director-general Nor Hisham Mohamad told The Straits Times.</p>

<p>Strong underground water currents, limited space for rescuers and the presence of debris and hard blockages are some of the risk factors that led to the decision, Mr Nor Hisham said, according to state news agency Bernama.</p>

<p>"When we saw the entry point, which was about two feet (60cm) wide, we were really worried that they might get stuck. There was a 'piston effect' from the water, making it impossible for them to retreat, which is very dangerous," he was quoted as saying by Bernama.</p>

<p>"Besides posing a high risk to scuba divers, there are also obstructions difficult for divers to navigate," he said.</p>

<p>Indian tourist Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, who frequently travelled to Singapore and Malaysia for business, disappeared after falling into an 8 metre-deep sinkhole on August 23. She was on her way to a temple when the ground suddenly caved in. Her husband and son were able to escape the collapse.</p>

</div>

<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Friday assured tourists that Kuala Lumpur is safe, adding that any areas considered to be at risk of turning into sinkholes will be dealt with immediately. During a visit to Penang, he told reporters that a geotechnical study had found the cause of the incident.</p>

<p>Monitoring the situation, the Indian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur had explained how the search operation for the woman was being carried out and that it was in touch with the woman's family members.</p>

<p>"Officers are also in touch with the family members to extend continued support," it said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu had directed officials from the Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu (APNRT) Society to ensure that the search operations are conducted effectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A helicopter with 22 people aboard, most of them tourists, has gone missing in Russia's Kamchatka peninsula in the far east, regional authorities said Saturday.</p>

<p>"Today at about 1615 (0415 GMT) communication was lost with a Mi-8 helicopter...which had 22 people on board, 19 passengers and three crew members," Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on Telegram.</p>

<p>Rescue teams in helicopters have been searching into the night for the missing aircraft, focusing on a river valley that the helicopter was due to fly along, Russian authorities said.</p>

<p>The Mi-8 is a Soviet-designed military helicopter that is widely used for transport in Russia.</p>

<p>The missing helicopter had picked up passengers near the Vachkazhets ancient volcano in a scenic area of the peninsula known for its wild landscapes and active volcanoes.</p>

<p>A source in the emergency services told TASS news agency that the helicopter disappeared from radar almost immediately after taking off and the crew did not report any problems.</p>

<p>The local weather service said that there was poor visibility in the area of the airport.</p>

<p>Accidents involving planes and helicopters are very frequent in Russia's far eastern region, which is sparsely populated and where there is often harsh weather.</p>

<p>In August 2021, a Mi-8 helicopter with 16 people on board including 13 tourists crashed into a lake in Kamchatka due to poor visibility, killing eight.</p>

<p>In July the same year, a plane crashed as it came in to land on the peninsula, with 22 passengers and 6 crew aboard, all of whom were killed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after a four-year-old kid unintentionally smashed an ancient jar at an archaeological museum in Israel, he was invited to the assemblage again on Saturday for a guided tour. Ariel Geller hit the headlines a few days ago when he accidentally shattered a 3500-year-old jar, placed at the entrance of the Hecht Museum in Haifa.</p>

<p>BBC shared a video of Ariel's visit to the museum. It featured him dressed in a white t-shirt and denim shorts. He also wore a blue hat. The 4-year-old was accompanied by his parents, Anna and Alex Geller, on this guided tour. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c623dpev3x4o">In a video interview with BBC</a>, Anna talked about the incident and revealed that she was distracted by her daughter when Ariel accidentally damaged the ancient jar.</p>

<p>The boy "pulled the jar slightly" because he was "curious about what was inside," said Ariel's father, Alex. He added that when he saw his son next to the shattered pieces, he was "in shock" and immediately assumed that "my child hadn't done it."</p>

<p>"At first, I was in shock," Alex remarked. "Then I felt a bit angry with him." Later, the couple went up to a security guard and admitted what transpired. However, they were not prepared for what came next. "Instead of levying penalties or fines, they extended an invitation for us to return," Alex stated.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boy-accidentally-shatters-3-500-year-old-rare-jar-at-israel-museum-6438540">Reacting to the mishap</a>, the museum's head Inbal Rivlin told Israeli news outlet Ynet, "The museum is not a mausoleum but a living place, open to families (and) accessible. We are appealing to parents: Don't be afraid. Things like this happen. We will fix (the jar) and put it back."</p>

<p>The museum estimates that the jar was made between 2200 and 1500 BC, and was probably used to transport regional goods like olive oil and wine. It was found during central Israel's Samaria excavations, and the museum has owned it for thirty-five years.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The policy, which requires applicants to confirm they were assigned female at birth and identify as women, has sparked criticism from students and faculty.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sweet Briar College, a private liberal arts college for women based in Virginia, United States just introduced a new policy of its admissions, and that is not to allow transgender women to join on campus for this new academic year, according to <em>New York Post</em>. By this decision Sweet Briar College has joined the few remaining women's colleges in the United States that have taken similar stances.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/31/us-news/virginia-sweet-briar-college-bans-transgender-women-from-admission-based-on-founders-will-from-1900/">news outlet,</a>&nbsp;college officials said the policy reflects the will of its founder, Indiana Fletcher Williams, who died in 1900. Officials explained that Williams's will mandates the institution to serve "girls and young women," and they assert that these terms must be understood according to the meaning they held at the time the will was written.</p>

<p>In a letter to the college community, Sweet Briar President Mary Pope Hutson and the chair of the board announced that the new policy requires applicants to affirm that they were assigned female at birth and constantly live and identify as women.</p>

<p>President Hutson made it clear that single-sex education was both a tradition and a singular cultural resource for the college. But the policy has outraged students and faculty, who said it could discourage prospective students-both transgender and not-from applying to the college at a time when many women's colleges are closing, merging, or going co-ed. Sweet Briar itself almost closed in 2015.</p>

<p>Critics have also cited the originalist interpretation of the will - which at one point explicitly excluded non-white students from the college - by the board as something that is very problematic. The college did not begin to admit Black students until a federal judge gave approval after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The reasoning behind the transgender policy was "absurd," said John Gregory Brown, chair of the faculty senate and an English professor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China and the Philippines accused each other on Saturday of deliberately ramming their coast guard ships near a flashpoint shoal in the South China Sea, the latest in a spate of similar incidents in recent weeks.</p>

<p>China claims almost all of the economically vital waterway despite competing claims from other countries and an international court ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.</p>

<p>A Chinese coast guard spokesperson said Saturday's incident took place off the disputed Sabina Shoal, which has emerged as a new hotspot in the long-running maritime confrontations between Manila and Beijing.</p>

<p>Sabina Shoal is located 140 kilometres (86 miles) west of the Philippine island of Palawan and about 1,200 kilometres from Hainan island, the nearest major Chinese landmass.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon (0400 GMT), a Philippine ship "deliberately collided with" a Chinese vessel near the shoal, known in Chinese as Xianbin, China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>"China exercises indisputable sovereignty" in this zone, Liu said, condemning the "unprofessional and dangerous" conduct of the Philippine vessel.</p>

<p>However, Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Commodore Jay Tarriela said it was the China Coast Guard vessel 5205 that "directly and intentionally rammed" the Philippines' 97-metre ship, BRP Teresa Magbanua.</p>

<p>The vessel has been anchored inside Sabina Shoal since April to assert Manila's claim over the area.</p>

<p>Tarriela said the ramming happened three times, hitting the BRP Teresa Magbanua's port bow, starboard quarter and port beam.</p>

<p>No crew members were injured during the incident but the ship's bridge wing and freeboard were damaged. A hole was also found.</p>

<p>"It is important for us to take note that this ramming happened despite... our unprovoked action and presence in Escoda Shoal," Tarriela told reporters, using the Filipino name for Sabina Shoal.</p>

<h3><strong>'Serious concern'</strong></h3>

<p>The collision was the fifth incident of Chinese maritime harassment this month, Tarriela said.</p>

<p>National Maritime Council Spokesperson Alexander Lopez said a report about the latest clash would be sent to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs for review and appropriate action.</p>

<p>"We take this with serious concern," Lopez told a news conference.</p>

<p>"We are there on a legal basis because that is ours, we don't need to ask for permission in our own territory. Let us be very clear about it," he said.</p>

<p>Philippine and Chinese vessels have collided near Sabina Shoal at least twice this month and analysts say Beijing is trying to move deeper into Manila's exclusive economic zone and normalise Chinese control of the area.</p>

<p>The discovery this year of piles of crushed coral at the shoal ignited suspicion in Manila that Beijing was planning to build another permanent base there, which would be its closest outpost to the Philippine archipelago.</p>

<p>Recent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have also taken place around Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands.</p>

<p>A Filipino sailor lost a thumb in a clash there in June when Chinese coast guard members wielding knives, sticks and an axe foiled a Philippine Navy attempt to resupply a small garrison.</p>

<p>Sabina Shoal is also the rendezvous point for Philippine resupply missions to the garrison on Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

<p>The repeated confrontations prompted Manila to brand Beijing the "biggest disruptor" to peace in Southeast Asia at a defence conference this month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The third case of M-Pox virus in Pakistan was confirmed at the Peshawar airport, Dawn reported on Saturday citing officials.</p>

<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Health Director Dr Irshad Ali Roghani informed that another suspected patient has also been moved to a hospital.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the recent M-Pox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern following the identification of a new variant of the virus, Clade 1b. The Clade 1b variant has triggered global concern due to its ease of spread through routine close contact.</p>

<p>However, the WHO has clarified that the M-Pox outbreak is not another Covid-19, adding that much is already known about the virus and the means to control it.</p>

<p>Pakistan's health ministry had previously stated that the first M-Pox case detected in the country involved the Clade 2 variant. The second case of M-Pox was confirmed last week, with the patient also identified at Peshawar airport, as reported by Dawn.</p>

<p>On Thursday, medical personnel at Bacha Khan International Airport detected two travellers displaying symptoms of the M-Pox virus, previously known as monkey pox. They were transferred to the Police and Services Hospital (PSH) for immediate treatment.</p>

<p>Documents including the 'Suspected Passengers Data Form' for each individual, indicated that both passengers were on the same flight from Jeddah to Peshawar, reported Dawn News.</p>

<p>The confirmed case involved a 51-year-old man from Orakzai, who is currently in stable condition and undergoing treatment at the PSH.</p>

<p>"This is the third confirmed case of M-Pox in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the year 2024," Roghani stated, adding that no locally transmitted cases had been reported thus far. "The Rapid Response Team took the patient's samples and sent them to the laboratory."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, samples from the second patient, a 47-year-old man from Peshawar, were also sent to the laboratory for testing, and results are awaited.</p>

<p>The Health Director informed that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Department has established an integrated surveillance and response system for M-Pox.</p>

<p>The WHO raised its highest level of alert over the outbreak in Africa after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to neighbouring countries. Since January 2023, there have been 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths, primarily among children, in the DRC, Dawn reported.</p>

<p>One case each of the Clade 1b variant has been confirmed in Sweden and Thailand, marking the first instances of its spread beyond Africa. However, the WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions to curb the spread of M-Pox.</p>

<p>The disease presents with flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. While typically mild, it can be fatal, particularly for children, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The investigation into Telegram boss Pavel Durov who has fired a warning shot to global tech titans was started by a small cybercrime unit within the Paris prosecutor's office, led by 38-year-old Johanna Brousse.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The investigation into Telegram boss Pavel Durov who has fired a warning shot to global tech titans was started by a small cybercrime unit within the Paris prosecutor's office, led by 38-year-old Johanna Brousse.</p>

<p>The arrest of Durov, 39, last Saturday marks a significant shift in how some global authorities may seek to deal with tech chiefs reluctant to police illegal content on their platforms.</p>

<p>The arrest signalled the mettle of the J3 cybercrime unit, but the true test of its ambitions will be whether Brousse can secure a conviction based on a largely untested legal argument, lawyers said.</p>

<p>In an unprecedented move against a major tech CEO, prosecutors argued that Durov bears responsibility for the alleged illegality on his platform, placing him under formal investigation on organized crime charges. He is suspected of complicity in running an online platform that allows the posting of child sex abuse images, drug trafficking and fraud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Durov's lawyer said on Thursday it was "absurd" for him to be held responsible and that the app abided by European laws, echoing an earlier statement by Telegram itself.</p>

<p>Being placed under formal investigation in France does not imply guilt or necessarily lead to trial, but indicates judges consider there is enough evidence to proceed with the probe. Investigations can last years before being sent to trial or dropped. Durov is out on bail but barred from leaving France.</p>

<p>Brousse's unit began investigating Durov earlier this year after seeing his app being used for countless alleged crimes, and growing frustrated by the "almost total lack of response from Telegram to judicial requests", Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Brousse declined to comment.</p>

<p>In an interview with the newspaper Liberation in January, Brousse said her office was overseeing a growing number of probes involving Telegram and rival messaging app Discord, adding that tackling crime on them was "one of my battles".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jason Citron, Discord's CEO, did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brousse's J3 cybercrime unit is France's most important, with a licence to prosecute nationwide. But it also is small, with just five prosecutors, well below the 55-60 cybercrime prosecutors in Switzerland, a 2022 parliamentary report found. With limited resources, they "prioritize the most serious crimes", Brousse told Le Figaro last year.</p>

<p>Brousse said in a 2022 podcast appearance she wanted to be tough "so cybercriminals believe that if they attack France, they will be judged and punished very severely".</p>

<p>"We want people to be prosecuted, either in their country ... or in France through arrest warrants," she said.</p>

<p>Her office was used to "extremely sensitive cases", she added. "Sometimes, legal and geopolitical issues intersect."</p>

<p>Patrick Perrot, who coordinates AI-assisted probes at the French gendarmerie and advises the Interior Ministry's cyber command unit, said the J3 had been innovative in seeking to prosecute cases that set an international precedent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think it shows that you can't do whatever you want with these platforms," he told Reuters. "It's a real question for the future, because these platforms won't stop multiplying, so the challenge of regulation is essential."</p>

<h3><strong>TOUGH LEGAL GROUND?</strong></h3>

<p>Brousse has led the J3 since 2020, which has given her oversight of one of the most important - and controversial - French cybercrime cases ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In late 2020, the J3 took charge of the probe into Sky ECC, which alongside Encrochat was one of the main encrypted communications services used by gangsters to buy drugs and weapons, or murder rivals. A few years earlier, French, Dutch and Belgian police had hacked into their servers, which were housed in northern France, giving French prosecutors jurisdiction over many of the resulting probes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been more than 6,500 arrests since the takedown of Encrochat in 2020, according to Europol, with the legality of the intercepts challenged in appeals courts across Europe.</p>

<p>Paul Krusky, the Canadian Encrochat boss, was extradited in February from the Dominican Republic to France, where he now awaits trial. Lawyers for Sky ECC's Jean-François Eap are contesting his French arrest warrant.</p>

<p>Stephane Bonifassi, Eap's lawyer, said his client was innocent, adding that "Sky ECC was not conceived as a tool for criminals, nor commercialized as such".</p>

<p>Krusky's lawyer, Antoine Vey, said his client was innocent.</p>

<p>"The service set up by Paul Krusky, like other services that have enjoyed global success, was only intended to protect the privacy and freedom of exchange of its users, and in no case to support criminal activities," Vey said in a statement.</p>

<p>Two other French lawyers who have worked on Sky ECC and Encrochat cases told Reuters that these earlier probes gave prosecutors the ambition - and a blueprint - to target Durov.</p>

<p>Robin Binsard, who has fought Encrochat cases at France's top court, said prosecutors would need to prove that Durov knew and approved of the criminality on the app, calling their argument "totally questionable".</p>

<p>The fact that Telegram didn't comply with law enforcement requests "does not automatically make one an accomplice to a criminal project", he added.</p>

<p>Binsard said it was clear "France is pursuing encrypted messaging providers", and that other operators of such apps, such as Signal, "should be concerned about whether or not they are in compliance with French regulations. Because the message is clear if they are not, legal action will take place".</p>

<p>Signal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source at the Paris prosecutor's office said the Sky ECC probe had no links to the Telegram investigation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin woman in the UK has pleaded guilty to murdering her 10-year-old daughter who was found dead with stab wounds earlier this year. Jaskirat Kaur, 33, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of her daughter at the Wolverhampton Crown Court today.</p>

<p>10-year-old Shay Kang was found dead at home on March 4 with stab wounds in her chest.</p>

<p>Jaskirat Kaur, also known as Jasmine Kang, was arrested by West Midlands Police shortly after the body was discovered at approximately 12.10 pm. At the time of her arrest, Kaur denied the murder charge.</p>

<p>Kaur though admitted to the lesser charge of manslaughter during the court session. Judge Michael Chambers has set her sentencing on that charge for October 25, when she is expected to attend the court in person.</p>

<p>Prosecution counsel Sally Howes KC informed the court that the guilty plea to manslaughter was acceptable to the Crown, and there was no dispute over the facts of the case.</p>

<p>Brickhouse Primary School, where Shay was a pupil, issued a statement at the time to say the school was deeply saddened by the tragic death.</p>

<p>“Shay was a bright, happy, fun-loving child who was well-liked by all, and she will be very sadly missed by everyone,” read the statement.</p>

<p>Tributes including toys, cards, and balloons poured in and some parents of children who attended the same school had set up an online GoFundMe fundraiser to collect money for Shay's funeral.</p>

<p>The fundraiser read: "As you may be aware she had no family except her mum. The purpose of this is to come together as a community to help raise funds for her funeral and to also help with flowers, head stone etc. She didn't deserve this at all and the best we can do is make sure she flys (sic) high in the most beautiful way."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The port city of Volos in central Greece declared a state emergency following an inundation of dead fish that local residents say could threaten their livelihoods, the state news agency announced Saturday.</p>

<p>The month-long emergency declaration issued by the climate ministry's secretary general of civil protection, Vassilis Papageorgiou, will inject funding and resources to speed up the cleaning of the Pagasetic Gulf port where tons of dead fish have piled up along the coast and in rivers, according to Athens News Agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the second environmental catastrophe to hit the port of Volos, a three-and-a-half-hour drive north of Athens after catastrophic floods hit the Thessaly region last year.</p>

<p>Those floods refilled a nearby lake that had been drained in 1962 in a bid to fight malaria, swelling it to three times its normal size.</p>

<p>"After the storms, Daniel and Elias last autumn, around 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) of plains in Thessaly were flooded, and various freshwater fish were carried by rivers" to the sea, Dimitris Klaudatos, a professor of agriculture and environment at the University of Thessaly had said.</p>

<p>Since then the lake waters have receded drastically, forcing the freshwater fish toward the Volos port that empties into the Pagasetic Gulf and the Aegean Sea, where they cannot survive.</p>

<p>On Tuesday alone, authorities had removed 57 tons of the dead fish washed up on beaches near Volos.</p>

<p>Most of the thousands of dead fish that flooded the Pagasetic have been recovered, while two boats are completing the process Saturday, Ertnews channel reported.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A newly elected British Sikh Labour Member of Parliament has defended his record as a landlord after UK media reports highlighted anonymous complaints from his tenants of being subjected to poor living conditions in properties owned by him.</p>

<p>Jas Athwal, elected to Parliament in last month's general election from Ilford South constituency in east London, said he was "shocked" and "profoundly sorry" to hear of residents' issues after the BBC <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ants-everywhere-tenants-reveal-state-of-indian-origin-uk-mps-flats-6457102">reported on mould and ant infestations</a> on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr Athwal, 60, is said to own 15 rental flats and says he had not been aware of the issues due to the properties being managed by an agency. He has now promised that repairs and maintenance will be completed through immediate action. &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a renters champion. I'm proud to rent out homes with secure tenancies at below-market rents," Mr Athwal said in a detailed statement.</p>

<p>"I want every one of my tenants to have excellent accommodation; I'm shocked at the reported condition of a number of the properties and have asked the managing agent for an explanation and immediate action to rectify any issues. I know it's my responsibility to have issues addressed as soon as they arise and have met with the property management company to understand failures in communication," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm profoundly sorry that tenants have been let down and will be reviewing the property management and how matters are escalated going forward," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Athwal, previously a local politician as leader of Redbridge Council, is also required to have a selective property licence in order to rent out a block of seven flats - a system he introduced in 2017 when he was in charge of the council.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the BBC found the council's public licence register indicated that none of the seven properties had a licence. Athwal admitted that he had "recently seen an email" which said the licences were due to expire.</p>

<p>He added: "I am in the process of renewing all licences. As council leader I implemented the most rigorous landlord licencing scheme in London in 2017, and expanded the scheme in 2023 and 2024 - the scheme would've been even stronger if Conservative housing secretaries had not repeatedly watered it down.</p>

<p>"In 2019, I led a campaign calling on the government to abolish Section 21 evictions, further protecting tenants' rights, which was again blocked by the Conservatives."&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the BBC investigation, in one block of seven flats owned by Athwal nearly half the tenants said they had to regularly clean their bathroom ceilings to remove mould.</p>

<p>The news corporation said it also saw evidence of ant infestations in a number of the seven properties.</p>

<p>Andrew Boff, a Conservative member of the London Assembly who also visited the flats, is calling on the governing Labour Party and local Redbridge Council to investigate as the party's 2024 general election manifesto included a commitment to "prevent private renters being exploited and discriminated against".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With his stern gaze and shiny-bald head, Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes has emerged as one of the most powerful and polarizing people in Brazil by probing far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro's alleged attacks on democracy.</p>

<p>The latest target in his disinformation crackdown: Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The billionaire X owner, who calls himself a "free-speech absolutist," in recent months went on the attack against Moraes, labelling him a dictator and threatening to defy the judge's rulings blocking users found to be spreading disinformation -- largely Bolsonaro supporters.</p>

<p>Moraes on Friday ordered the suspension of X, formerly known as Twitter, following a months-long standoff with the tech titan over disinformation in South America's largest nation.</p>

<p>Musk, who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, reacted with fury to the judge's order, branding Moraes an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge" and accusing him of "trying to destroy democracy in Brazil."</p>

<p>Known by his nickname, "Xandao," Moraes, 55, looms large over the fissures of a deeply divided Brazil.</p>

<p>The immensely powerful judge, who also heads the Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE), is hated by the far right, which accuses him of censorship and abuse of office.</p>

<p>To others, he is a hero using the bench to save Brazil's young democracy.</p>

<h3><strong>'Political animal'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>There was little in Moraes's background to hint he would become a conservative nemesis.</p>

<p>The constitutional law expert worked as a Sao Paulo state prosecutor, then went on to become state security secretary. Known as a hardliner, he drew criticism from left-wing activists, who accused him of repressing social movements.</p>

<p>He served as justice minister under centre-right ex-president Michel Temer, who named him to the Supreme Court in 2017.</p>

<p>"Legal expertise has played a part in his meteoric rise, but what put him on the Supreme Court, and 99 per cent of his career, is politics. He's a political animal," constitutional law expert Antonio Carlos de Freitas told AFP.</p>

<p>Despite his severe demeanour, Moraes is known for a sense of humour behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Supreme Court insiders call him a pragmatist with a gift for engaging in dialogue with various players, including the military.</p>

<p>But he soon found himself on a collision course with Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>During Bolsonaro's administration (2019-2022), Moraes ordered investigations of several of the president's allies. Bolsonaro called him "scum" and vowed to stop following his rulings.</p>

<p>Moraes has presided over a slew of cases targeting the politician dubbed the "Tropical Trump," who has been barred from running for office until 2030 over his attempts to discredit the electoral system -- a decision delivered by the TSE, the electoral court Moraes heads.</p>

<p>Moraes's current docket includes what may be the most damaging case against Bolsonaro: the investigation into charges the ex-president and his inner circle plotted a coup to stay in power despite losing the 2022 elections to veteran leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>

<p>"Bolsonaro's camp has found a favorite enemy in Moraes, who has dealt them their biggest defeats at the Supreme Court and blocked the spread of fake news," Freitas said.</p>

<p>Police investigating Bolsonaro's alleged coup plot say it included a presidential decree that would have declared a state of emergency, called new elections and ordered Moraes's arrest.</p>

<h3><strong>Disinformation war&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Moraes was an omnipresent figure during the polarizing 2022 campaign, aggressively using his rulings to fight election disinformation on social media.</p>

<p>That included blocking some prominent right-wing figures' accounts, leading to his standoff with Musk, who has been accused of turning his social media platform into a megaphone for right-wing conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Moraes gives few interviews, and rarely posts on his own X account, "@Alexandre," where he nevertheless has a million followers.</p>

<p>"Freedom of expression doesn't mean freedom of aggression," he has said.</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean the freedom to defend tyranny."</p>

<p>Still two decades away from the mandatory retirement age for judges in Brazil -- 75 -- Moraes has political ambitions, including being president someday, a source close to him told AFP.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Musk will want to watch out if he challenges Moraes to a cage fight, as he did with fellow tech titan Mark Zuckerberg -- and as some internet wags have been hoping: Moraes has studied "muay thai," the martial art known as Thai boxing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced the updated policy guidelines for international students' eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT) in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced the updated policy guidelines for international students' eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT) in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The revised guidelines, effective from August 27, offer clarity on rules concerning online study, school transfers, grace periods, and study abroad programmes. These will apply to all pending and future requests.</p>

<h3><strong>OPT duration extended for STEM students</strong></h3>

<p>As per USCIS, international students in STEM will now enjoy up to three years of OPT, compared to one year for the students of non-STEM fields. This will allow students to gain more work experience in the country.</p>

<h3><strong>Online Study Allowances</strong></h3>

<p>Eligible students will now be able to count one class or up to three credits per academic session towards their full course of study, without violating the F1 visa terms. It must be noted that the class is taken online or via distance learning, meaning that it does not require any physical attendance.</p>

<h3><strong>School Transfers</strong></h3>

<p>The new policy now grants permission to eligible students to transfer between Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) schools, certified by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), at the same educational level or even a switch between different educational levels.</p>

<h3><strong>Post-Completion OPT&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The new guidelines mention that students who have completed their associate, bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree programmes are now eligible for the post-completion OPT.</p>

<h3><strong>OPT extensions</strong></h3>

<p>Students will now be able to apply for STEM OPT extension up to 90 days before the expiry of their current employment authorisation.</p>

<p>To be eligible for the 24-month STEM OPT extension, they will require a valid post-completion OPT period; a qualifying STEM degree from an accredited institution; and work with an employer enrolled in E-Verify.</p>

<h3><strong>60-Day Grace Period</strong></h3>

<p>Once they complete their OPT, students will have a 60-day grace period. During this time, they remain eligible to change their educational level, consider transferring to another SEVP-certified school, or apply for changing to a different nonimmigrant or immigrant status.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this period, the employers can also sponsor the student's H-1B visa.</p>

<h3><strong>Clarification on the application period</strong></h3>

<p>The revised manual corrects the timeline during which the students can apply for the STEM OPT extensions, besides other technical adjustments. This ensures that the students can submit their applications.</p>

<h3><strong>Guidelines for the Study Abroad Programme</strong></h3>

<p>Students, who are enrolled in SEVP-certified schools, will be able to maintain active status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) during the study abroad programmes if its duration is less than five months. For longer programmes, they will require a new Form I-20.</p>

<p>Students, who receive a STEM OPT extension, will be required to report any changes in their legal name, address, or employment details to the DSO within 10 days. Even in case there are no changes, still they will have to confirm their information every six months.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A high-profile New York real estate developer, who died by suicide last month, was almost $34 million in debt and had just $8,000 in his bank account. Despite being in secret debt, Brandon Miller and his influencer wife, Candace, were known for flaunting his high-profile lifestyle on social media.<br />
<br />
A report in The Real Deal highlighted that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/us-real-estate-mogul-dies-suddenly-aged-43-6067767">Brandon Miller</a>, 43, was in more dire financial straits than was initially thought at the time of his death on July 3.<br />
<br />
On his wife's now-defunct lifestyle blog 'Mama + Tata,' Miller often showcased a fairy-tale lifestyle, portraying himself as a lucky head of an idyllic upper-crust family, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/us-news/hamptons-real-estate-mogul-brandon-miller-died-34m-in-debt-with-just-8k-in-the-bank-report/">The New York Post</a> reported.<br />
<br />
However, new facts reveal the family was living way beyond their means in reality and was in massive debt.<br />
<br />
According to a bond petition filed by Candice in a surrogate's court, around $11.5 million of Miller's debt was from mortgages on his Hamptons estate.<br />
<br />
The property at 25 Cobb Isle Road in the Water Mill was put on the market at an asking price of $15.5 million earlier this month.<br />
<br />
The family had four outstanding loans on the property. This includes $800,000 from lender Titan Capital, who earlier sued Candice Miller over missed mortgage payments. Besides this, he owed the company another $2 million on the property, besides having loans from UBS and Stevens Financial Group, The Real Deal reported.<br />
<br />
The real estate developer's largest outstanding debt was an unsecured $11.3 million loan from a Chicago-based bank. He owned an additional $6.1 million on an unsecured loan from Donald Jaffe.<br />
<br />
Jaffe funded Miller as well as his father, Michael Miller, on multiple projects. In 2019, he sued Brandon Miller over the unpaid balance on the loan and has yet to receive his money.<br />
<br />
That's not all. Miller even had unpaid debts of more than $300,000 to American Express and $266,000 to the Funding Club, a cash advance lender based in Brooklyn.<br />
<br />
A few weeks ago, he was found unresponsive in his car inside the garage of his 4,300-square-foot Hamptons home. Soon, he was taken to the Stony Brook Southampton Hospital, where he passed away a few days later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Bangladesh are bracing for the spread of waterborne diseases and racing to get drinking water to people after devastating floods last week that left at least 54 people dead and millions stranded.</p>

<p>As floodwaters recede slowly, many people remain stranded and in urgent need of food, clean water, medicine and dry clothes, especially in remote areas where blocked roads have hindered rescue and relief efforts.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Meteorological Department said that flood conditions could persist if the monsoon rains continued, as water levels were receding very slowly.</p>

<p>Around 470,000 people have taken refuge in 3,300 shelters across 11 flood-hit districts, where around 600 medical teams are helping provide treatment, with the army, air force, navy, and the border guard assisting in rescue operations, authorities said.</p>

<p>A disaster management ministry official warned that as floodwaters recede, there is a risk of an epidemic, adding that the outbreak of waterborne diseases is likely if clean water is not provided soon.</p>

<p>"Our top priority is to ensure the availability of safe drinking water," the official said.</p>

<p>In the past 24 hours, around 3,000 people have been hospitalized due to waterborne diseases in flood-hit areas, according to the Directorate General of Health Services. Many areas remained submerged, preventing stranded people from accessing healthcare facilities.</p>

<p>"Water is everywhere but there is no clean water to drink. People are getting sick," said Farid Ahmed, a resident of one of the worst-hit districts, Lakshmipur.</p>

<p>Vast areas of land are submerged, posing a significant threat to crops, agriculture ministry officials said.</p>

<p>The U.N. children's agency has warned that two million children were at risk as the worst floods in three decades sweep through eastern Bangladesh. The organization is urgently appealing for $35 million to provide life-saving supplies.</p>

<p>"The devastating floods in eastern Bangladesh are a tragic reminder of the relentless impact of extreme weather events and the climate crisis on children," said Emma Brigham, Deputy Representative of UNICEF Bangladesh.</p>

<p>An analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.</p>

<p>Farah Kabir, director of ActionAid Bangladesh, said that countries like Bangladesh, which contribute minimally to global emissions, urgently need funding to recover from climate-related losses and build resilience for future impacts while pursuing green development pathways.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris is aiming to make history as America's first Black and South Asian woman president -- but she has not leaned into the prospect.</p>

<p>Instead, Harris has steered well clear of mentioning race and gender during speeches, rallies and the first press conference of her lightning campaign.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Democrat has also refused to engage with Republican rival Donald Trump and his allies when they have tried to bait her by questioning her racial identity and making sexist attacks.</p>

<p>Rather, Harris seems to be focusing on the broader excitement over her replacing President Joe Biden as candidate, and on issues like the cost of living that she believes voters care more about.</p>

<p>Her reluctance to rely on her trailblazing status as a selling point was on full display when she and her running mate Tim Walz gave their first interview to CNN on Thursday.</p>

<p>Harris was asked about a photo circulating of her grand-niece watching her Democratic National Convention speech in Chicago, which went viral as a symbol of the breaking of racial and gender barriers in America.</p>

<p>But Harris was not biting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender," Harris told CNN.</p>

<p>Harris was equally dismissive when asked about Trump's inflammatory accusation that she leaned into her Black identity for political gain. "Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please," she said with a laugh.</p>

<h3><strong>'Precious time'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>One reason for her approach is that Trump's attacks are so far merely drawing attention to her history-making status, rather than damaging her, said Jesse J. Holland, an assistant professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.</p>

<p>"Why spend your precious time talking about things when your opponent's doing it for you -- and perhaps not successfully?" Holland told AFP.</p>

<p>Harris is also helped by the fact that she is already a known quantity as the first-ever Black, female and South Asian vice president, even if voters are still getting used to her as a presidential candidate.</p>

<p>She has not shied away from talking about her background as the daughter of a Jamaican-born father and an Indian-born mother.</p>

<p>She began her convention speech with a heartfelt tribute to her mother, a "brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman who taught her children to 'never complain about injustice, but do something about it.'"</p>

<p>But going further and explicitly ramming home a message on race and gender is not necessarily a vote winner across the board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her candidacy has fired up many young, female and Black voters, but there are equally voters who would be turned off by a female or Black president, said Holland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Democrats believe issues like the economy and migration are likely to play a bigger role in what is set to be another nail-biting election.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi -- the influential Democratic former House speaker who was critical in pushing Biden out of the race -- backed Harris's strategy of staying low-key on her race and gender.</p>

<p>A female president would be "icing on the cake. But it ain't the cake," Pelosi told a podcast with Barack Obama's one-time strategist David Axelrod, adding that "kitchen table" issues were more important.</p>

<h3><strong>'Resisting labels'</strong></h3>

<p>Democrats have also been stung by what happened in 2016 to Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Clinton made being a potential first female president a core part of her campaign with the slogan "I'm With Her" -- but then lost to Trump in a shocking result.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris is right not to make her race and gender a rallying cry," Zeeshan Aleem said in an opinion piece on MSNBC.</p>

<p>Aleem said Clinton's slogan "got it backwards: the president is supposed to be with us, not the way around."</p>

<p>There's also a personal element to it for Harris, who has avoided attempts to be categorized throughout a career as a prosecutor, California attorney general and senator.</p>

<p>In her media interactions, Harris often comes across as guarded, giving deliberative answers that can be hard to pin down.</p>

<p>But that same instinct could be politically valuable as she seeks to prevent Republicans from defining her in an aggressive election cycle with less than 10 weeks to decision day.</p>

<p>"At this very second, she may be resisting labels, maybe resisting being boxed in," said Holland.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

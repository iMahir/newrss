       <description><![CDATA[An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Milan has resulted in four deaths and numerous hospitalizations. Authorities are disinfecting the city's water supply while investigations continue to identify the source of the infection.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Milan, Italy, has killed at least four people and hospitalised several dozen more, according to <em>The Metro</em>. The health authorities say that at least 53 cases have been confirmed in two regions inside the Milan metropolitan area of a severe lung infection.</p>

<p>In response, local authorities are taking urgent measures to control the situation, including deploying chemicals to disinfect the city's water supply. However, despite extensive testing of water supply systems in private residences and cooling towers, the exact source of the outbreak remains unidentified, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/26/no-one-knows-source-stealth-disease-killed-four-milan-21492952/"><em>news report.</em></a></p>

<p>The continuous investigation of finding the source of infection has left the city in great suspense, and sensitivity has developed regarding what efforts should be present to prevent further cases.</p>

<p><strong>What is Legionnaires' disease?</strong></p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/13/legionnaires-disease-symptoms-cause-treatment/"><em>Washington Post report,</em></a> Legionnaires' is a serious form of pneumonia caused by the bacteria Legionella. The pathogen can also cause Pontiac fever, a flu-like illness considered to be a less serious disease.</p>

<p>The bacteria was first discovered decades ago when a mysterious illness sickened dozens attending a 1976 convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia. In that outbreak, 221 people were infected, and 34 died.</p>

<p>The disease initially alarmed health officials, who feared the sickness might spread beyond the conferencegoers. Ultimately, scientists found the bacteria bred in the water of a cooling tower of the air-conditioning system at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, where the conference was being held.</p>

<p><strong>How does Legionnaires' disease spread?</strong></p>

<p>Legionella grow in biofilms lining water pipes, pipes that lead to showers, drinking faucets, and HVAC systems for cooling, said Panagis Galiatsatos, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Centre at Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>Legionella can even grow in the tanks that hold windscreen wiper fluid in a car, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>People can become infected by breathing in mist or swallowing water into the lungs that's contaminated with the bacteria. "Less commonly, people can get sick by aspiration of drinking water containing Legionella," a CDC spokeswoman said Tuesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Now that France has charged Telegram's founder with failing to stop illegal activity on his platform, other tech bosses may have reason to weigh the wisdom of jetting into Europe themselves.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that France has charged Telegram's founder with failing to stop illegal activity on his platform, other tech bosses may have reason to weigh the wisdom of jetting into Europe themselves.</p>

<p>Russia-born Pavel Durov is accused of "complicity" in running an online platform that allowed illicit transactions, child sex abuse images and other illegal content.</p>

<p>French lawyers told AFP it was "unprecedented" for an individual to be held criminally liable for what users chose to do on a tech platform.</p>

<p>Chat apps like Telegram -- which boasts having more than 900 million users -- were almost certainly hosting illegal content whether the bosses knew it or not, experts told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's clear that if they take this case against Pavel Durov all the way, any other platform could be threatened with the same thing," lawyer Guillaume Martine told AFP.</p>

<p>However, the idea of X owner Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta group includes Facebook and WhatsApp, being arrested in Europe remained beyond the realms of likelihood.</p>

<p>"I would be very surprised if any EU member state, including France, arrested Elon Musk under similar charges," Jan Penfrat of the European Digital Rights (EDRi) advocacy group told AFP.</p>

<p>"But then again, I was also surprised that they arrested Durov."</p>

<h3><strong>'Limited cooperation'</strong></h3>

<p>Although comparing these platforms is superficially appealing -- like its competitors, Telegram is not based in France, and Durov is an ally of Musk -- there are key differences.</p>

<p>For one, Durov is a French citizen, making him a much likelier target in France.</p>

<p>But also, although Musk trumpets an extreme free-speech position, he generally complies with government takedown orders on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Telegram, however, refuses on principle.</p>

<p>"It's true that Telegram is characterised by extremely limited cooperation, if any at all," said digital rights lawyer Alexandre Lazaregue.</p>

<p>"They don't respond to letters, they don't respond to summonses, they don't even have legal representation in court... Whereas Facebook, Twitter, etc still have well-known lawyers in Paris."</p>

<p>And Penfrat said comparisons with services like Signal or WhatsApp were also misleading as they are encrypted by default -- unlike Telegram.</p>

<p>"So Signal and WhatsApp can say: 'We're cooperating, we just don't have the information,'" he said.</p>

<p>"But Telegram says: 'Well, we could give you all that information because it's in plain text on our servers, but we're not going to, sorry.'"</p>

<h3><strong>'Red flags'</strong></h3>

<p>The particular position of Durov and Telegram suggests other tech bosses do not have anything immediately to worry about.</p>

<p>But Penfrat said he was concerned that the move against Telegram could be used as a precedent to go after other encrypted services.</p>

<p>Law enforcement agencies across the world have long argued they need access to encrypted messages to stop criminal activity.</p>

<p>But services like WhatsApp and Signal have pushed back, saying the only way to do that would be to outlaw encryption.</p>

<p>"It does raise a lot of red flags to see these charges, which seem random and also are just not very convincing," said Penfrat, suggesting it was like trying to blame a knife-maker for a stabbing.</p>

<p>Lawyer Martine said it was "extremely dangerous" to try to hold Telegram accountable for the actions of its users, likening it to prosecuting Europcar for renting a vehicle to a drug trafficker.</p>

<p>Lazaregue concluded that the charges against Durov were pushing the legal definition of "complicity" to breaking point.</p>

<p>"To be convicted of complicity, you still need to be aware that a crime is happening and intend to participate in it," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Floods have killed at least 179 people and displaced around 200,000 more in parts of Nigeria after a "few weeks" of intense rain, an emergency official said on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the serious flooding has been in the north of Nigeria so far. At least 107,600 hectares (265,885 acres) of farmlands have also been affected, figures published by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) showed.</p>

<p>Most of the deaths were in the country's northern region, but NEMA spokesman Ezekiel Manzo said the central and southern parts of Nigeria may be hit harder as rain intensifies.</p>

<p>He did not say exactly when the deaths and displacements had occurred.</p>

<p>"The collection of water from the northern part flowing downward will also mean that the situation being witnessed the same in central and southern parts of the country will become worse," Manzo told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Communities along the banks of major rivers Niger and Benue are at higher risk. Some parts of the country previously not known to be flood-prone have seen floods, Manzo said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flooding, usually caused by abundant rains and poor infrastructure, has caused large-scale destruction in Africa's most populous country in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 360 people died and more than 2.1 million were displaced in 2012.</p>

<p>In 2022, more than 500 people died and 1.4 million were displaced in the worst floods in a decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said in a statement on Wednesday that authorities would provide warnings to mitigate the impact of environmental mishaps.</p>

<p>Manzo said emergency officials have mapped out plans to forestall a recurrence.</p>

<p>"We don't have time to waste any longer so people will not be caught unaware," he told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government said on Thursday it had imposed a travel ban on Mustafa Ayash, who it sanctioned earlier this year for promoting terrorism, and suspected Hezbollah financier Nazem Ahmad.</p>

<p>The pair, who were already subject to asset freezes under domestic counter-terrorism powers, now cannot enter Britain, it said.</p>

<p>"The travel bans are a part of continued efforts to protect the integrity of the UK economy from terrorist financing threats," the British government said in a statement.</p>

<p>Ayash was sanctioned in March this year for providing financial support to a media network which the government said supported the Palestinian Hamas militant group and promotes terrorism.</p>

<p>Britain banned Hamas in 2021 and under the Terrorism Act, anyone expressing support for the group, flying its flag or arranging meetings for the organisation is in breach of the law.</p>

<p>Britain sanctioned Ahmad in April 2023 on suspicion of financing Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement. He was also sanctioned by the US in 2019.</p>

<p>He has an extensive art collection in the UK and conducts business with multiple UK-based artists, art galleries and auction houses, according to a 2023 statement by the British government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain on Tuesday urged its citizens in Lebanon to leave the country, warning that tensions along the Israeli border could worsen quickly.</p>

<p>"There are frequent artillery exchanges and air strikes, tensions are high, and the situation could deteriorate rapidly," Foreign Secretary David Lammy told parliament.</p>

<p>"I am working with foreign office consular teams to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios, but if this conflict escalates, the government cannot guarantee we will be able to evacuate everyone immediately. People may be forced to shelter in place."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer chaired a meeting of the government's emergency response committee, known as COBRA, on the matter earlier on Tuesday, Lammy said.</p>

<p>"My message to British nationals in Lebanon is therefore quite simple: leave," Lammy said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Wednesday ordered billionaire Elon Musk to name a legal representative for his messaging platform X in Brazil within 24 hours or face the site's suspension in the country.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, X announced it would close its operations and fire its staff in Brazil due to what it called "censorship orders" from the judge, Alexandre de Moraes. Its service would remain available for users in Brazil, it said.</p>

<p>X, at the time, claimed Moraes secretly threatened one of the company's legal representatives in Brazil with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content from its platform.</p>

<p>In Wednesday's ruling, Moraes says that under the country's law regulating internet issues, companies that do not respect Brazilian legislation or the confidentiality of private information could have their activities temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court posted a screenshot of Wednesday's court decision on its X account, tagging Musk's and X's Global Government Affairs accounts.</p>

<p>Hours after the judge's decision, Musk said on X that Moraes "has repeatedly broken the laws he has sworn to uphold".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts implicated on investigations of so-called "digital militias" that have been accused of spreading fake news and hate messages during the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>After Musk challenged that decision and said he would reactivate accounts on X that the judge had ordered blocked, Moraes opened an inquiry into the billionaire in early April.</p>

<p>X representatives eventually reversed course and told the Supreme Court that the social media giant would obey the legal rulings. In April, however, Moraes asked X to explain why it allegedly had not fully complied with his decisions.</p>

<p>In response, lawyers representing X in Brazil told the Supreme Court that "operational faults" had allowed users who were ordered blocked to stay active on the social media platform.</p>

<p>Musk has called the Moraes' decisions regarding X "unconstitutional".</p>

<p>Topics such as "Twitter will end", "Elon Musk" and "Alexandre de Moraes" were trending on X in Brazil on Thursday, with hundreds of thousands of posts. Public reaction included mostly "memes" making light of the situation.</p>

<p>Among more serious reactions, some X users shared harsh criticism over Moraes' decisions, saying he was harming freedom of speech in Brazil. On the other hand, other users sided with Moraes, saying Musk should not be above Brazilian law.</p>

<p>X, formerly Twitter, is widely used in Brazil, and is an important means of communication for politicians especially.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telegram chief Pavel Durov was spending Thursday out on bail after four days of detention in France, banned from leaving the country as he faces a possible trial related to illegal content carried on his messaging app.</p>

<p>Russian-born Durov, dressed in black and wearing dark glasses, walked briskly out of the Paris court house late Wednesday into a waiting car after being charged but allowed to go free under judicial supervision.</p>

<p>He thanked his laywer and was rapidly ushered into the vehicle by a burly man appearing to be a bodyguard, video posted on social media channels showed.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/france-charges-telegram-chief-pavel-durov-prosecutor-6440551" target="_blank">Durov</a>, 39, was charged on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on the popular messaging app which now has over 900 million followers but has become increasingly controversial.</p>

<p>His lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said it was "absurd" to suggest Durov could be implicated in any crime committed on the app, adding: "Telegram complies in all respects with European rules concerning digital technology."</p>

<p>In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned France against turning the case into <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kremlin-warns-france-against-political-persecution-of-telegram-founder-pavel-durov-6444991" target="_blank">"political persecution"</a>, emphasising he is a "Russian citizen" and "we will be watching what happens next."</p>

<p>Among those also voicing support for Durov is fellow tech tycoon and chief executive of X, Elon Musk, who has posted comments under the hashtag #FreePavel.</p>

<p>After the charges, Musk posted a meme on X of a surveillance camera attached to buildings inscribed with France's motto, "liberty, equality, fraternity."</p>

<h3><strong>Near total absence</strong></h3>

<p>Durov was arrested at Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday and questioned in subsequent days by investigators.</p>

<p>He was granted conditional release on a bail of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-s-5-million-bail-but-with-conditions-831241" target="_blank">five million euros</a> and on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remaining in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.</p>

<p>The charges concern alleged crimes involving an organised group, including "complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable an illicit transaction".</p>

<p>This charge alone could see him jailed for up to 10 years and fined 500,000 euros if convicted.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pavel-durov-mysterious-and-controversial-telegram-founder-6441269" target="_blank">Durov </a>has also been charged with refusing to share documents demanded by authorities as well as "dissemination in an organised group of images of minors in child pornography" as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering.</p>

<p>The Paris prosecutor said the French judicial authorities had been made aware of the "near total absence of a response" from Telegram to requests from the authorities and had first opened an investigation in February 2024.</p>

<p>The next step will be for the case to be sent to trial.</p>

<p>Separately, Durov is also being investigated on suspicion of "serious acts of violence" towards one of his children while he and an ex-partner, the boy's mother, were in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/explained-why-telegram-ceo-was-arrested-in-france-831224" target="_blank">Paris</a>, a source said. She filed a criminal complaint against Durov in Switzerland last year.</p>

<p>The tech mogul founded Telegram as he was in the process of quitting his native Russia a decade ago following a dispute with authorities related to ownership of his first project, the Russian-language social network VKontakte.</p>

<p>An enigmatic figure who rarely speaks in public, Durov is a citizen of Russia, France and the United Arab Emirates, where Telegram is based.</p>

<p>Forbes magazine estimates his current fortune at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/mysterious-woman-linked-to-arrest-of-telegram-ceo-called-mossad-agent-all-about-juli-vavilova-6420329" target="_blank">$15.5 billion</a>, though he proudly promotes the virtues of an ascetic life that includes ice baths and not drinking alcohol or coffee.</p>

<h3><strong>Special procedure</strong></h3>

<p>Numerous questions have been raised about the timing and circumstances of Durov's detention, with supporters seeing him as a freedom of speech champion while his detractors paint him as a menace who wilfully allowed Telegram to get out of control.</p>

<p>Le Monde newspaper reported Wednesday that Durov had met President Emmanuel Macron on several occasions prior to receiving French nationality in 2021, via a special procedure reserved for those deemed to have made a special contribution to France.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal added that at one lunch in 2018, Macron -- who along with his team was in the past an avid user of Telegram -- had suggested it should be headquartered in Paris, but Durov refused.</p>

<p>According to a source, both Pavel Durov and his elder brother Nikolai, a lower-profile figure seen as the mathematical brain behind Telegram, have been wanted by France since March this year.</p>

<p>Durov's departure from Russia was reportedly not an abrupt exile: according to the Vazhnye Istorii news site, citing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-allowed-child-pornography-drug-trafficking-on-app-rules-france-court-6441623" target="_blank">leaked</a> border data, he visited the country more than 50 times between 2015 and 2021, adding to questions about his relationship with the Russian authorities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a UAE government official said it "prioritises the welfare of its citizens" and was "in touch with the French authorities about this case."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris launched a $50 million advertising blitz on Tuesday, capitalizing on the momentum of a fledgling campaign against Republican rival Donald Trump with a one-minute spot titled "Fearless."</p>

<p>It was Harris' first big ad buy since consolidating support for the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed her.</p>

<p>In addition to garnering the backing of big-money donors, Harris has sparked newfound energy among groups such as young voters that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-joe-biden-wins-huge-ovation-at-democratic-convention-farewell-6375158" target="_blank">Biden</a> had been struggling to win over.</p>

<p>Public opinion polls in the last week have shown Harris, 59, closing the gap with 78-year-old Trump, who still leads in some national surveys.</p>

<p>The ads will be rolled out on television as well as streaming and social channels across election battleground states in the weeks before the Democratic National Convention that starts on Aug. 19.</p>

<p>The first ad in the campaign begins with images of Harris as a little girl and follows her progression to a prosecutor, attorney general and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vice-president-tim-walz-pick-set-to-star-on-day-3-of-democratic-convention-6388689" target="_blank">U.S. vice president</a>. "The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless," the ad says.</p>

<p>Since stepping into her new role, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a hush-money trial involving a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-stormy-daniels-porn-star-at-center-of-donald-trumps-criminal-conviction-5783027" target="_blank">porn star</a> and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign's ad buy dwarfed the $10 million advertising buy announced by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-campaign-staff-had-physical-altercation-with-army-cemetery-official-report-6437702" target="_blank">Trump's</a> campaign on Monday, to be launched in six battleground states this week as it tries to counter a surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for Harris.</p>

<p>That was Trump's biggest ad buy since January.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sancho was found guilty of premeditated murder, concealing a corpse, and destroying property.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of a well-known Spanish actor has been sentenced to life imprisonment for killing and dismembering a man on the Thai island of Koh Phangan last year. Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, the son of television star Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre, claimed he acted in self-defence when he killed Colombian plastic surgeon Edwin Arrieta Arteaga. He pleaded guilty to the murder in August 2023, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxry3k9rgo" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Sancho, now 30, told the Spanish news agency EFE at the time that he had been a "hostage" to Arrieta, whom he described as obsessed with him. The case has attracted significant attention in Spain, with many journalists travelling to Thailand to cover the trial.</p>

<p>Sancho was found guilty of premeditated murder, concealing a corpse, and destroying property.</p>

<p>A court on the nearby island of Koh Samui, where the trial took place, initially sentenced him to death for murder. However, this was reduced to life imprisonment due to his cooperation during the trial.</p>

<p>Sancho, a chef with his own YouTube channel, was also ordered to pay 4 million baht ($118,000) to compensate Arrieta's family. Bussakorn Kaewleeled, the victim's family lawyer, expressed satisfaction with the verdict.</p>

<p>"The plaintiff is satisfied with the sentence because he (Sancho) will be put in prison for life and they (the plaintiff) receive some financial compensation," Bussakorn told reporters outside the Koh Samui court, as reported by AFP news agency.</p>

<p>Police found parts of Arrieta's body at a landfill in Koh Phangan in early August last year.</p>

<p>Around that time, Sancho reported to the police that Arrieta, then 44, was missing. After further questioning, Sancho confessed to the murder.</p>

<p>Thai media reported that investigations had shown Sancho had purchased a knife, rubber gloves, and a bottle of cleaning agent, leading police to conclude the murder was premeditated.</p>

<p>Sancho later led police to seven locations around the island where he had disposed of Arrieta's dismembered body in plastic bags.</p>

<p>Reports stated that Sancho and Arrieta had agreed to meet after becoming acquainted online.</p>

<p>The defence argued that Sancho acted in self-defence when Arrieta tried to force him into a sexual encounter. In a statement published by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Sancho said the plastic surgeon "tried to rape [him]."</p>

<p>Sancho comes from a family of actors; his mother is actress Silvia Bronchalo, and his grandfather was the late actor Felix Angel Sancho Gracia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong pro-democracy news outlet Stand News and its two former chief editors were found guilty of sedition on Thursday, the first conviction of its kind since the city came under Chinese rule in 1997.</p>

<p>The verdict is part of a crackdown on free speech in the former British colony that has seen critics of China jailed or forced into exile, following huge pro-democracy protests in 2019.</p>

<p>Editors Chung Pui-kuen, 54, and Patrick Lam, 36, are the first journalists to be convicted of sedition since Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997, and the ruling drew resounding international condemnation.</p>

<p>Chung and Lam were in charge of Stand News, a Chinese-language website that gained a massive following during the protests in 2019, before it was raided and shut down in December 2021.</p>

<p>On Thursday, district court judge Kwok Wai-kin said the pair were guilty of "conspiracy to publish and reproduce seditious publications". The parent company of Stand News, Best Pencil Limited, was also found guilty.</p>

<p>"The line (Stand News) took was to support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy," according to a written judgement by Kwok.</p>

<p>"It even became a tool to smear and vilify the Central Authorities (Beijing) and the (Hong Kong) SAR Government."</p>

<p>Kwok also pointed to 11 articles published by Stand News that "caused potential detrimental consequences to national security" and had the intention of "seriously undermining" authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Lam was absent from court on Thursday due to illness.</p>

<p>The judge granted the duo bail before their sentencing on September 26.</p>

<h3><strong>Colonial-era law</strong></h3>

<p>Chung and Lam were charged under a colonial-era law, which punishes sedition with a maximum jail term of two years.</p>

<p>A recent security law enacted in March raised the jail term for sedition to seven years.</p>

<p>In response to the verdict, the European Union called on Hong Kong to "stop prosecuting journalists".</p>

<p>"The ruling risks inhibiting the pluralistic exchange of ideas and the free flow of information, both cornerstones of the economic success of Hong Kong," a EU spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Speaking outside court, police chief superintendent Steve Li said the verdict "clearly illustrated the necessity and lawfulness" of the enforcement actions in 2021 against Stand News.</p>

<p>Asked if the verdict would further affect press freedom, Li said it would "actually help".</p>

<p>"It would let everyone know what kind of problems could risk breaching the law," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Not seditious</strong></h3>

<p>But Beh Lih Yi from the Committee to Protect Journalists said the ruling showed that Hong Kong was "descending further into authoritarianism".</p>

<p>"Journalism is not seditious," she said.</p>

<p>Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International's China Director, called the verdict "one more nail in the coffin for press freedom in Hong Kong".</p>

<p>Hong Kong has seen its standing in global press freedom rankings plummet in recent years.</p>

<p>Chung had testified that the outlet was a platform for free speech and defended his decisions to publish articles critical of the government.</p>

<p>But prosecutors accused them of bringing "hatred or contempt" to the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.</p>

<p>More than 100 people, including supporters and media professionals, queued up for spots in the public gallery on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The verdict was also attended by representatives from various consulates -- including the United States, Britain, France, European Union, and Australia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Film legend Errol Morris said the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents by Donald Trump's US administration was "inhumane and cruel" as his new documentary about the policy premiered at the Venice Film Festival Thursday.</p>

<p>"Do we need borders? Do we need immigration law? We do," the Oscar-winning US director told AFP ahead of the screening of his film "Separated". "But the idea is laws should be fair and humane."</p>

<p>"And this particular policy struck me, still strikes me, as inhumane, as cruel as mean."</p>

<p>In 2017, during Donald Trump's first year as US president, his administration raised the idea of separating children from their parents as a way to deter illegal immigration -- a key plank of his campaign.</p>

<p>Officially launched in April 2018, the "zero-tolerance" policy allowed criminal proceedings to be brought against anyone who crossed the US-Mexico border illegally, resulting in parents being immediately taken into custody without their children.</p>

<p>According to the documentary, which cited official government figures, at least 4,227 children were taken from their parents -- and more than 1,000 are still separated.</p>

<p>"What horrifies me is that they didn't keep records. They separated families in such a way that it might be impossible ever to reunite them," said Morris, 76.</p>

<p>The veteran director won an Oscar in 2004 for "The Fog of War", an astonishingly frank account of the Vietnam War by one of its architects, former US Secretary of defence Robert McNamara.</p>

<h3><strong>Divisive</strong></h3>

<p>Morris's new film -- being shown out of competition in Venice -- is based on a book by US journalist Jacob Soboroff, who helped expose the desperate plight of the children.</p>

<p>"He had called me and asked me if I knew anybody who might be willing to turn his book into a movie... I volunteered myself," Morris said.</p>

<p>The documentary is largely based on statements by Jonathan White, who was deputy director of the US Office for Refugee Resettlement (ORR) at the time and who opposed the policy applied by his superior, Scott Lloyd, who is also interviewed.</p>

<p>Lawsuits and a public outcry, even among Trump's own Republican Party, forced the administration by mid-2018 to halt the separations.</p>

<p>In practice, however, the Trump administration continued to separate families under another regulation which allowed undocumented parents to be arrested and deported if they had committed a serious crime.</p>

<p>Immigration remains a hugely divisive issue for many Americans ahead of November's presidential election, in which Trump is running against Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>A recent official US report found the government may have lost track of up to 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children in the past four years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sudden sinkhole appeared on a busy road in western Seoul's Seodaemun district on Thursday, swallowing an SUV, with two passengers inside. The vehicle, carrying a woman in her 70s and a man in his 80s, rolled over and crashed into the sinkhole, leaving both injured. The couple's white Tivoli "rolled over sideways, crashing into the sinkhole", the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240829050448" rel="nofollow, noindex">Korea Herald</a></em>&nbsp;reported. Both sustained serious injuries and were promptly transported to a hospital. The unexpected sinkhole caused chaos on the roads, leading to severe traffic congestion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dramatic photos from the scene revealed a white sport utility vehicle almost entirely swallowed by a massive sinkhole that unexpectedly opened on the road.&nbsp;No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred at around 11:20 am (0220 GMT), according to Seoul's Seodaemun district fire station,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/seoul-elderly-couple-injured-after-their-car-falls-into-sinkhole-13205224" rel="nofollow, noindex">Sky News</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>Authorities later cordoned off the area, restricting access as they launched an investigation into the cause of the sinkhole.</p>

<p>Sinkholes are a recurring issue in South Korea, with at least 879 reported cases between 2019 and June 2023, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The ministry attributed nearly half of these incidents to damaged sewer pipes.&nbsp;</p>

While her husband and son managed to escape the collapse, she was swept into the underground sewer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rescue operations were launched immediately by the civic authorities in Kuala Lumpur and are ongoing.&nbsp;Vijayalakshmi was known for frequently travelling to Malaysia and Singapore as part of her business.&nbsp;In response to the incident, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has directed officials from the Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu (APNRT) Society to ensure that the search operations are conducted effectively.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coastal cities are not doing enough to adapt to climate change, taking too long and implementing insufficient measures, according to a major study published this week.</p>

<p>While flood barriers and pumping systems are a step in the right direction, "across all regions and income groups, scientifically reported adaptation in coastal cities remains at rather low depth, scope and speed," said the study published in Nature Cities, which looked at 199 cities worldwide.</p>

<p>Given the high exposure and vulnerability of many <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-east-coast-cities-are-literally-sinking-millions-at-risk-study-shows-4853339" target="_blank">coastal cities</a>, "this finding is alarming as adaptation to future climate change will require many cities to go beyond business as usual risk management," it said.</p>

<p>Short- and mid-term solutions, as many cities are implementing, could even have an adverse effect, the study warned, leading to a "lock-in and maladaptive path dependency in the long-term."</p>

<p>Instead, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-study-warns-climate-change-will-make-you-poorer-5468268" target="_blank">adaptation</a> must aim at "transformation" of cities -- a change both of infrastructure and at the institutional level.</p>

<p>Positive models cited in the report include Singapore, Hong Kong and several Swedish cities.</p>

<p>But in the majority, the study found that coastal cities focus primarily on combating sea level rise, various types of flooding, and to a lesser extent the risks posed by erosion and storms.</p>

<p>And for scientists such a scope is too narrow -- cities need to address other problems linked to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/humanity-is-killing-the-great-barrier-reef-warns-report-6413023" target="_blank">climate change</a>, such as heatwaves.</p>

<h3><strong>Institutions and households</strong></h3>

<p>By comparing data from 199 cities, listed in 683 scientific articles, the researchers found that the actors driving adaptation changed according to the country and income category.</p>

<p>The richest coastal areas take a technological approach to dealing with climate change and the major players are institutions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, lower-income cities located mainly in Africa, Asia, and South and Central <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-climate-change-has-forced-us-to-change-policy-5651674" target="_blank">America</a>, have no other choice but to rely on a "behavioural and cultural" effort for populations to adapt.</p>

<p>In lower-income coastal cities, there is a lack of institutional and/or technological support, making it "more likely individuals/households are reported as prime adaptation actors."</p>

<p>The poorest economies remain under-represented in the scientific literature, which complicates their adaptation.</p>

<p>"A considerable gap in research that needs to be addressed urgently," the study warned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin warned France on Thursday not to turn a criminal case against Telegram founder Pavel Durov into "political persecution."</p>

<p>Russia, which has led an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents during its Ukraine offensive, has painted Durov's surprise arrest in Paris earlier this week as politically motivated.</p>

<p>France has charged Russian-born Durov -- who also has French citizenship -- on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on the popular social media platform.</p>

<p>"The main thing is for what is happening in France not to run into political persecution," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>"Of course we consider him a Russian citizen and as much as possible we will be ready to provide assistance," he added.</p>

<p>"We will be watching what happens next."</p>

<p>Durov was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remain in France, French prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Telegram is one of Russia's most popular messaging apps.</p>

<p>Russian officials have rushed to defend Durov since he was arrested last weekend at a Paris airport.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's latest move follows his promotion of an "official" cryptocurrency project, as the crypto industry faces increased regulatory scrutiny.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has unveiled the fourth series of his digital trading cards worth $99 each. The digital cards are named "Series 4: The America First Collection" non-fungible tokens (or NFTs).</p>

<p>Among the new additions to these cards are some interesting ones highlighting his influence and political career. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://collecttrumpcards.com">These cards feature</a> Donald Trump posing as a "sneakerhead," wearing his own line of golden shoes, wearing an Iron Man-style suit with the title "SuperTrump," and several with the label "crypto president."</p>

<p>In June Trump gave himself the tag of crypto president while speaking at a tech fundraiser, when he presented himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector. Trump touted crypto as important and stressed that he was very supportive of the sector.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/08/27/trump-selling-more-nft-trading-cards-as-he-courts-crypto-voters/"><em>Forbes,</em></a> the release includes pricy packages that promise physical gifts to buyers: Customers who hit a minimum spend could get autographed shoes from Trump's sneaker line, a piece of his suit from his debate with President Joe Biden and dinner with the former president, and up to 25 people who spend $24,750 (using only crypto) are promised tickets to a Trump gala in Florida next month and cocktails with the former president.</p>

<p>The launch of the new NFT cards comes less than a week after Trump promoted an "official" cryptocurrency project using his name on Truth Social and linked to a group in the Telegram messaging app run by his sons Eric and Don Jr called "The DeFiant Ones" (a nod to DeFi, short for decentralized finance).</p>

<p>The crypto industry is increasingly trying to influence US politicians as it faces heightened scrutiny from regulators, especially since bankruptcies at major crypto firms in 2022 spooked investors, exposed fraud and misconduct, and left millions of investors out of pocket.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters and shaking up the race ahead of the Nov. 5 election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters and shaking up the race ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>The 4 percentage point advantage among registered voters was wider than a 1 point lead Harris held over the former president in a late July Reuters/Ipsos poll. The new poll, which was conducted in the eight days ended Wednesday and had a 2 percentage point margin of error, showed Harris picking up support among women and Hispanics.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump by 49% to 36% - or 13 percentage points - among both women voters and Hispanic voters. Across four Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in July, Harris had a 9 point lead among women and a 6 point lead among Hispanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump led among white voters and men, both by similar margins as in July, though his lead among voters without a college degree narrowed to 7 points in the latest survey, down from 14 points in July.</p>

<p>The findings illustrate how the U.S. presidential race has been shaken up over the summer. President Joe Biden, 81, folded his flailing campaign on July 21 after a disastrous debate performance against Trump sparked widespread calls from his fellow Democrats to abandon his re-election bid.</p>

<p>Since then, Harris has gained ground against Trump in national polls and those in critical swing states. While national surveys including Reuters/Ipsos' give important signals on the views of the electorate, the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with a handful of battleground states likely to be decisive.</p>

<p>In the seven states where the 2020 election was closest - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada - Trump had a 45% to 43% lead over Harris among registered voters in the poll.</p>

<p>"It's obvious that running against Harris is more challenging for Trump given the shift in these numbers, but it's certainly not insurmountable," said Matt Wolking, a Republican campaign strategist who worked on Trump's 2020 campaign. He said Trump needs to stay as focused as possible in his campaign "so he's not scaring" away voters who were leaning his way because they didn't like Biden.</p>

<p>Since formally accepting the Democratic nomination last week, Harris has embarked on a tour of battleground states including Georgia, where Biden had been hemorrhaging support before he ended his campaign.</p>

<h3><strong>Rising Enthusiasm</strong></h3>

<p>Some 73% of Democratic registered voters in the poll said they were more excited about voting in November after Harris entered the race. And while a March Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% respondents who intended to vote for Biden were doing so mainly to stop Trump, 52% of Harris voters in the August poll were voting to support her as a candidate rather than primarily to oppose Trump.</p>

<p>"We see it in this poll that people are more motivated about the future than the past," said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a liberal group that aims to grow the numbers of women of color in elected office. "They see Kamala Harris as the future, and Republicans see this election as just about Trump. Voters are more likely to be engaged when given the option of 'more than' beating Trump."</p>

<p>But Trump voters also voiced enthusiasm about their candidate, with 64% saying their choice was more motivated by backing Trump than opposing Harris.</p>

<p>Voters picked Trump as having a better approach to managing the U.S. economy, 45% to 36%, a wider margin than Trump had in another Reuters/Ipsos poll this week.</p>

<p>Harris, by contrast, had a 47% to 31% advantage on abortion policy. The issue is salient for Democrats after the conservative U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 struck down women's national right to abortion. Trump nominated three conservative justices to the court during his 2017-2021 presidency. Some 41% of voters in the poll - and 70% of Democrats - said they were worried the next president might sign a national ban on abortions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest poll's survey period partially overlapped with the Aug. 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris formally accepted her party's nomination, and it remains to be seen whether the same level of enthusiasm for Harris will continue.</p>

<p>The poll was conducted nationally and gathered responses from 4,253 U.S. adults, including 3,562 registered voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign on Aug. 23 while the poll was still being conducted, had the support of 6% of voters in the survey.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's Constitutional Court ruled Thursday that much of the country's climate goals were unconstitutional, handing a landmark victory to young environmental activists, who wept for joy on the court steps.</p>

<p>The first such case in Asia, brought by children and teenagers who named an embryo as a lead complainant, claimed that South Korea's legally binding climate commitments were insufficient and unmet, violating their constitutionally guaranteed human rights.</p>

<p>"Just now, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional that there is no government goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 2031 to 2050," said Yoon Hyeon-jeong, one of the young activists involved.</p>

<p>"It was ruled that our right to live a safe life from the climate crisis should be guaranteed," she added, barely managing to finish her sentence as she choked up with tears.</p>

<p>The court ruled that the government's limited climate targets violate the constitution as they do "not sufficiently protect the basic rights of the people," the legal representatives of the complainants said after the hearing.</p>

<p>The case -- known as "Woodpecker et al. v. South Korea" after the in-utero nickname of an embryo, now toddler, involved -- included four petitions by children.</p>

<p>In 2021, South Korea made a legally binding commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 290 million tons by 2030 -- and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>To meet this goal, the country needs to reduce emissions by 5.4 percent every year from 2023 -- a target they have so far failed to meet.</p>

<p>As a result of the ruling, Seoul will now have to revise its climate goals, said Youn Se-jong, a lawyer for the complainants.</p>

<p>"The National Assembly and the government of the Republic of Korea will have to revise regulations related to the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and present greenhouse gas reduction goals considering the rights of future generations," Youn said.</p>

<p>"With today's ruling, we have confirmed that climate change is a matter of our fundamental rights and that everyone has the right to be safe from it," he said.</p>

<p>"Ordinary people like us have come this far. We have led the constitutional petition to protect our rights without relying on authority and power. It took us five years," said youth climate activist Kim Seo-gyeong, 21.</p>

<p>Kim was part of the group that filed the first of the cases in 2020, and said the ruling was a validation for young people who found themselves "living in the climate crisis."</p>

<h3><strong>'Wish came true'</strong></h3>

<p>Seoul's Ministry of Environment said in a statement that it respected the court's decision.</p>

<p>The ministry said it plans "to faithfully implement follow-up measures".</p>

<p>The complainants had argued that unless Seoul moved more quickly on climate goals, future generations would not only have to live in a degraded environment, but also have to bear the burden of undertaking massive greenhouse gas reductions.</p>

<p>This, the case claims, would mean that the state has violated its duty to protect their fundamental rights.</p>

<p>Similar climate cases globally have found success.</p>

<p>A youth-led effort recently succeeded in the US state of Montana, while another is being heard at the European Higher Court.</p>

<p>In Germany, in 2021 climate targets were ruled insufficient and unconstitutional, and lawyer Lee Chi-sun said the two cases were very similar.</p>

<p>"Just as Germany has further strengthened its reduction targets for 2040 and revised the goal for 2045 after their ruling, we expect Seoul's 2030 reduction targets will be strengthened" and expanded, he said.</p>

<p>Other cases have not fared so well globally -- a child-led suit in California over alleged government failures to curb pollution was thrown out in May.</p>

<p>The Thursday ruling is the first in Asia to question a country's national greenhouse gas reduction targets "and the court's ruling can set an important precedent for other courts in Asia to rule on similar cases," said Lin Yan-Ting, a climate activist who is a complainant for a similar case in Taiwan, filed in January.</p>

<p>Outside the Seoul court 12-year-old complainant, Han Jeah -- who started the case aged 10 -- said the verdict was "like a wish came true."</p>

<p>"We have the right to live safely and happily even in the climate crisis. This right should be protected under any circumstances and cannot be infringed upon by anyone," Han Jeah said.</p>

<p>"So I wanted to show people through this lawsuit how much we (young people) know and how deeply we worry about climate change."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan today formally announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting being held in Islamabad in mid-October.</p>

<p>Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, at her weekly press briefing, said Islamabad had sent invitations to the heads of countries to participate in the meeting, Pakistani media reported.</p>

<p>"An invitation has also been sent to the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi," she said, adding that some countries had already confirmed their participation in the meeting.</p>

<p>"It will be informed in due course which country has confirmed," Ms Baloch added.</p>

<p>Pakistan is set to host the SCO heads of government meeting on October 15-16. The event will be preceded by a ministerial meeting and several rounds of senior officials' meetings focused on financial, economic, socio-cultural, and humanitarian cooperation among the SCO member states.</p>

<p>Analysts see the invitation as a "protocol" as PM Modi is unlikely to accept the invitation as relations between the two neighbouring countries have been tense.</p>

<p>It is possible that PM Modi may depute a ministerial delegation to represent India as the SCO meeting does not require heads of state to participate. In the past as well, SCO CHG meetings have seen India represented by ministers and the same pattern is this time as well.</p>

<p>PM Modi had not attended the SCO's 24th annual summit of heads of state held in Kazakhstan on July 3-4 this year and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had represented India in Astana.</p>

<p>Pakistani analysts say they do not expect that PM Modi will come to Pakistan for the meeting.</p>

<p>"Extending invitations to PM Modi and all other member states is a compulsive protocol any host country follows. Pakistan has done the same. I do not see this as a political stunt. However, I do not see PM Modi landing in Islamabad," political analyst Kamran Yousaf said.</p>

<p>Last year, Pakistan's then-Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for the SCO Foreign Ministers' meeting.<br />

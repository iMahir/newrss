       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delaware state senator Sarah McBride won a seat in the US House of Representatives on Tuesday, making her the first openly transgender politician elected to Congress.</p>

<p>The Democrat was the comfortable winner against Republican John Whalen III, US news networks projected, as she built up an unassailable lead with around two-thirds of ballots counted.</p>

<p>"Delaware has sent the message loud and clear that we must be a country that protects reproductive freedom... and that this is a democracy that is big enough for all of us," she said in a statement posted to social media.</p>

<p>McBride told CBS in a recent interview her other priorities would be "affordable child care, paid family and medical leave, housing, health care."</p>

<p>Transgender rights have become a hot-button issue in the US election -- with the participation of trans people in competitive sports and the issue of access to gender-affirming care for minors triggering fiery debate.</p>

<p>Democrats broadly support transgender rights but many Republicans denounce what they see as political correctness that ignores the erosion of biological women's rights to their own spaces, from bathrooms and prisons to sports contests.</p>

<p>The fight has dominated TV advertising in the White House race between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with the Republican former president accusing Democrats last year of "left-wing gender insanity" with respect to transgender youth.</p>

<p>The LGBTQ+ Victory Fund congratulated McBride for "making history" in American politics.</p>

<p>"Sarah's voice is vital, and she will continue to be a tireless advocate for her constituents and community," the group said.</p>

<p>The fund has identified at least 62 transgender candidates running this year across the country -- nearly double the 34 who ran in 2020.</p>

<p>They include former Spanish teacher Mel Manuel, who identifies as transgender and nonbinary and was running for a seat in Louisiana, one of the most traditionally conservative in the country.</p>

<p>But they were trailing Republican heavyweight Steve Scalise by almost 50 percentage points in the early stages of the count.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Rafael is passing through the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean and is forecast to rapidly intensify before making landfall in western Cuba, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.</p>

<p>Rafael was blowing maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph) after skirting past western Jamaica around mid-day. The hurricane was located about 60 miles (95 km) east north-east of Grand Cayman, according to the NHC's latest advisory.</p>

<p>Residents in Jamaica hunkered down, with four emergency shelters activated, according to authorities. No deaths or injuries were reported as bursts of heavy rain dumped on the island.</p>

<p>As Rafael chugged toward the Cayman Islands, the British territory was setting up its own preparations and bracing for damages to infrastructure, power lines and water systems, the government said in a statement.</p>

<p>Premier Juliana O'Connor-Connolly told Radio Cayman that schools would remain closed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Rafael could briefly weaken over Cuba but is then expected to emerge into the southeastern Gulf Of Mexico as a hurricane, the NHC said.</p>

<p>In Cuba, officials quickly worked to collect garbage and clear drains, particularly in the capital Havana on the western end of the island, according to state media outlet Granma.</p>

<p>Cuba's energy grid collapsed last month, with recovery complicated by the passage of Hurricane Oscar. Another storm would further batter efforts to bring the lights back on.</p>

<p>After passing Cuba, tropical storm conditions could come to the Florida Keys, the NHC's forecast showed.</p>

<p>Oil and gas producers began shutting in U.S. Gulf of Mexico output and pulling workers off platforms ahead of hurricane Rafael's approach. Production may be reduced by between 3.1 million and 4.9 million barrels of oil and 4.56 billion to 6.39 billion cubic feet of natural gas, researchers predicted.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The famous election prognosticator, New York Times's “Needle”, was projecting an 84 per cent chance of a Donald Trump victory with about 295 electoral college votes based on its data at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday (9 a.m. Wednesday in India).</p>

<p>The “Needle” swings as the data that comes in is analysed in real-time and makes the projection it considers valid at that time.</p>

<p>A little before 10 p.m., it showed Trump at nearly 290 seats before swinging down five to 285 at 10 p.m. and rising 30 minutes later to 295.</p>

<p>The “Needle” makes longer-range projections beyond those made by The Associated Press and networks like NBC and Fox News by combining the incoming polling trends with demographic and historical data.</p>

<p>At 10 p.m., the electoral college votes that have been called by the media were 198 for Trump to 112 for Harris.</p>

<p>The New York Times was struggling with its computer systems because its union of technology workers was on strike over pay and working conditions.</p>

<p>The newspaper acknowledged the problem and wrote, “Publishing the ‘Needle' live on election night relies on computer systems maintained by engineers across the company, including some who are currently on strike”.</p>

<p>“How we display our election forecast will depend on those systems, as well as incoming data feeds, and we will only publish a live version of the ‘Needle' if we are confident those systems are stable”, it said.</p>

<p>Apparently, it is confident of the system's ability to handle the projections.</p>

<p>On the eve of the election, the newspaper's poll had given Harris a 3 per cent lead over Trump.</p>

<p>The RealClear Polling's aggregation had Trump with a 0.6 per cent lead, which is a virtual tie.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Snow has finally fallen on Mount Fuji, photographs shared by local authorities and residents showed Wednesday, after the Japanese mountain's longest-ever stint with bare slopes.</p>

<p>The national weather agency -- which compares conditions in exactly the same location each year -- has not yet announced a new record for the slowest formation of Mount Fuji's famous snowcap, due to cloudy conditions near its monitoring station.</p>

<p>But photographs taken from different points around the active volcano, where the skies were clearer early on Wednesday, showed a covering of snow on its peak.</p>

<p>"These are photos of Mount Fuji, seen from the city hall this morning. We could see a thin layer of snow cover near the summit," said a post on the official X account of Fuji City, in Japan's central Shizuoka region.</p>

<p>Many others in the area also posted their own photographs of snow on the country's highest mountain.</p>

<p>"Finally, the first snow cover! Mount Fuji looks good with snow," said a post from a nursing home, also in Fuji City.</p>

<p>Mount Fuji's snowcap begins forming on October 2 on average, and last year snow was first detected by government meteorologists stationed in Kofu City on October 5.</p>

<p>That makes this year the latest arrival of snow since comparative data became available in 1894, beating the previous record of October 26 -- seen twice, in 1955 and 2016.</p>

<p>A Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) official in the Kofu office told AFP it was still too cloudy there to declare a new record, but said they were hoping the skies there would clear up later Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The temperature is low today," so any snow on the mountain will likely stay put for now, the official added.</p>

<p>Global warming is one of many factors that led to the slow snow cover, he said. "The temperature in October at the top of Mount Fuji was warmer than the average."</p>

<p>Japan's summer this year was the joint hottest on record -- along with 2023 -- as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the July-September hiking season, more than 220,000 visitors trudge up its steep, rocky slopes.</p>

<p>Many climb through the night to see the sunrise from the 3,776-metre (12,388-foot) summit.</p>

<p>The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Musk, the world's richest man, has thrown his millions into backing the Republican presidential candidate since endorsing him in July. He has also reportedly donated at least $118 million to his political action committee, an organization that collects funds for elections.</p>

<p>Trump, 79, has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world" and to put tech Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.</p>

US networks have projected that Trump, 79, is winning 23 states and his 60-year-old rival 11.</p>

<p>He is also ahead in six out of seven swing states that hold the key to the White House. North Carolina has been called in favor of Trump and he is also ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Leads are not yet in for the swing states of Nevada.</p>

<p>As for electoral college numbers, which will determine the winner in this election, the former President is ahead with 230 votes, while Harris trails with 187. Each candidate is aiming for the magic figure of 270 electoral college votes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the US voters choose Trump, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, he would become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singer Beyonce today shared a picture of her in a t-shirt featuring a picture of Kamala Harris, who she has endorsed over Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential elections.</p>

<p>The picture was taken when the Democratic presidential nominee was at Howard University in 1986. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-2024-swing-states-donald-trump-kamala-harris-trump-ahead-of-harris-3-2-in-swing-states-that-hold-the-key-to-oval-office-6953824#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Harris</a> graduated from Howard with a bachelor's degree in political science and economics.</p>

<p>The picture was earlier used in various Harris campaign ads.</p>

<p>In a video on Instagram, Beyonce was seen getting off from her private jet and heading to a studio for a photoshoot. She was then seen wearing a printed skirt and a black t-shirt with Harris' face.</p>

<p>The video, shared without a caption, also included some shots of a young Harris.</p>

<p>As compared to her Republican rival, Harris has a much bigger list of celebrity endorsements - ranging from singer Taylor Swift and basketball superstar Lebron James and actress Meryl Streep to comedian Chris Rock and former talk show host Oprah Winfrey.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump Projected To Win US Elections</strong></h3>

<p>Various US networks have projected that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-leads-in-red-states-of-indiana-and-kentucky-as-counting-of-votes-begins-for-us-elections-6953293#pfrom=home-uselections_uselexhome">Donald Trump</a> is currently winning 20 states, while <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-live-updates-its-over-to-voters-as-america-decides-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-6948523">Kamala Harris</a> may take eight.</p>

<p>He has also surged ahead of his 60-year-old Democrat opponent in six out of seven swing states that hold the key to the White House. Trump, 78, is ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina. Leads are not yet in for the swing states of Nevada.</p>

<p>As for electoral college numbers, which will determine the winner in this election, the former President is ahead with 204 votes and Harris trails with 112.</p>

<p>Each candidate is aiming for the magic figure of 270 electoral college votes.</p>

<p>The 2024 US Presidential elections are historic because if Harris, the Indian-American who is the first female vice president, wins, she would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the US voters choose Trump, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, he would become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are locked in a tight race for the White House. While millions of Americans have cast their ballot, many are still at polling stations exercising their franchise. Early election trends suggest the Republicans have an edge over the Democrats, but they say nothing is over until the swing states deliver their verdict. Like in the past, seven crucial swing states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - are expected to play a major role in deciding the next president.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-2024-swing-states-donald-trump-kamala-harris-trump-ahead-of-harris-3-2-in-swing-states-that-hold-the-key-to-oval-office-6953824 " rel="nofollow,noindex">Trump has a slender lead</a> in Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, while <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-live-updates-its-over-to-voters-as-america-decides-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-6948523 ">Harris leads</a> in Michigan. Pennsylvania remains nearly tied, and the votes of the rest of the swing states are yet to be counted.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/battleground-breakdown-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-7-swing-states-6936093">Swing states</a>, also called battleground states, the support for both parties is evenly matched. These states, unlike others that lean towards one party or another, remain political wildcards. Over the past few decades, they have shifted back and forth between the Republicans and Democrats, making them key to any presidential race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's how the seven swing states have voted in the past:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania (19 Electoral Votes)</strong></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump has surged ahead of Democrat challenger Kamala Harris in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania as the votes cast in the US election are counted. According to The New York Times, Donald Trump holds a lead of three percentage points in the swing state. Earlier, Harris was leading in Pennsylvania. The state has 19 electoral college votes.</p>

<p>Nearly four hours into the counting, Trump is leading in six swing states. Trump is ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina. Leads are not yet in for the swing state of Nevada.</p>

<p>Also known as battleground states, swing states hold the key to victory in the US election. These states have a nearly equal level of support for both the Democrats and Republicans, and the election is won and lost in these states. This year, the swing states are Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral college votes, Michigan (10), Georgia (16), Wisconsin (10), North Carolina (16), Nevada (6) and Arizona (11).</p>

<p>Both the former President and the incumbent vice-president are pushing for the magic figure of 270 electoral college votes that will pave the way to the Oval Office in the White House. According to the current trends, Trump is leading with 230 votes, while Harris is at 179.</p>

<p>According to exit polls, the state of democracy, economy and abortion were the key issues on voters' minds when they headed to poll booths. A CBS News poll revealed that almost six in 10 people ranked the state of democracy as their number one issue, followed by abortion, which was picked by five per cent of voters as an important issue. The economy was a priority issue for one in ten.</p>

<p>A CNN exit poll said nearly three-quarters of the electorate holds a negative view of the way things are in the US today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the results of the US election will soon decide the fates of Presidential nominees Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, what remained unmissable during the high-octane campaign was the former's repeated distasteful comments on women.</p>

<p>From Ms Harris to&nbsp;Representative Nancy Pelosi to Hilary Clinton, Mr Trump and his supporters have not shied away from crude or even sexist remarks against women in speeches, also often supporting such remarks from spectators at their rallies.</p>

<p>At his final Wisconsin rally hours before the counting of votes began, Mr Trump said on Wednesday&nbsp;that "whether the women like it or not," he will "protect" them.&nbsp;"My people told me about four weeks ago, I would say 'no, I want to protect the people. I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women,'"&nbsp;he said, describing how his advisers said it would be "very inappropriate for you to say".&nbsp;"I said, 'Well, I'm going to do it, whether the women like it or not, I'm going to protect them,'" he went on to say.</p>

<p>The statement, according to Ms Harris, undermines women's agency, authority, their right and ability to make decisions about their lives and bodies. Moreover, they also come from a man who has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 20 women.</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;crude sexist remark&nbsp;attacked former House speaker and long-standing rival Representative Nancy Pelosi.&nbsp;"She's a bad person. Evil. She's an evil, sick, crazy.&nbsp;Bi-," he said in Michigan, mouthing the word into the microphone.</p>

<p>At Pennsylvania rally, when an audience member suggested the idea to&nbsp;Ms Harris in the ring with the boxer Mike Tyson, Mr Trump said to cheers, "That will be interesting."</p>

<p>His rival in Republican primary and former ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley urged the Trump campaign not to "get overly masculine". However, he has not shied from saying that if elected to the White House, Ms Harris will be "overwhelmed" and "melt down" facing male authoritarian leaders. At a Georgia rally, he also laughed along as a speaker at his Madison Square Garden rally last week&nbsp;suggested the vice president was like a prostitute controlled by "pimp handlers."&nbsp;Another ally called Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump's 2016 opponent, a "sick son of a bitch.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's PAC ran an advertisement that opened with "Kamala Harris is a C Word", later revealing the word to be communist.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Mr&nbsp;Trump's running mate JD Vance&nbsp;told an Atlanta rally,&nbsp;"We're going to take out the trash, and the trash's name is Kamala Harris." He has earlier&nbsp;called&nbsp;liberal women leaders "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made".</p>

<p>Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson likened the former President to an angry father providing tough love to a "bad little girl".&nbsp;Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, said wives who covertly vote for Harris "undermine their husbands".</p>

<p>A pollster for JL Partners Scarlett Maguire said Ms Harris showed a clear lead with women and that amongst undecided voters, the biggest hesitation about voting for Mr Trump would relate to concerns about what a conservative influence on his agenda would mean for women's rights.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-face-persistent-gender-gap-heading-election-day-rcna178662"><em>NBC News</em></a> has also quoted surveys showing that Trump has built a solid lead with men through various strategies like appearing on the popular "All-in Podcast" and others hosted by Joe Rogan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours before the US Presidential Elections, the Democrats warned voters that supporting Jill Stein, the US Green Party nominee, could inadvertently hand the presidency to <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-no-lesser-evil-between-donald-trump-kamala-harris-says-green-party-nominee-jill-stein-6740309">Donald Trump</a>. The ad, titled "Crucial", shows Stein's face transforming into Trump's within a blink, with the message, "A vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump." The video then cuts to Trump speaking at a Pennsylvania rally, saying, "Jill Stein? I like her very much. Do you know why? She takes 100 per cent from them."</p>

<p>On October 28, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) allocated roughly $500,000 for a last-minute campaign in swing states, urging voters not to back third-party candidates, including Stein and independent Cornel West. Both Trump and the Democrats suggest that Stein's presence on the ballot could syphon critical votes from Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, potentially aiding Trump's path to victory.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-jill-stein-green-party-s-us-presidential-candidate-against-harris-and-trump-6915502">Jill Stein</a>,&nbsp;who ran in 2012 and 2016, announced her 2024 candidacy on November 9, 2023, via a video on X. Known for her progressive policies, Stein calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, ending arms sales to human rights violators, and halting US vetoes in the UN Security Council. Her foreign policy platform also includes dismantling NATO in favour of a "modern, inclusive security framework."&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Green politicians across Europe have echoed concerns about Stein's impact on the election, releasing a statement on November 1 that urged her to withdraw and endorse Harris, reported <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-greens-tell-jill-stein-to-pull-out-of-us-election-to-defeat-trump/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">Politico</a>. "The race for the White House is too close for comfort," read the statement from Green parties in countries like Germany, France, and Italy, calling Harris the only viable candidate to block Trump's return.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stein's campaign dismissed the call to step down. "We are committed to this campaign for the presidency and would never betray our legion of supporters...regardless of which anti-democratic person or group makes the suggestion," her team responded.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-live-updates-its-over-to-voters-as-america-decides-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-6948523#pfrom=home-uselections_uselexhome">first results trends</a> are in, and Republican candidate Donald Trump is leading with 178 electoral votes and 52.1 per cent of the popular vote. His rival Kamala Harris follows with 99 electoral votes and 46.7 per cent of the popular vote. Green Party nominee Jill Stein, while not securing any electoral votes, has received 229,300 votes, making up 0.4 per cent of the popular vote.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All of us can be forgiven for mistaking 2024 as the year of the longest-running live TV entertainment. Thankfully, one leg of it is over. As the votes get counted, the world can take a breather while regrouping and replenishing supplies for the second. The race to become the President of the United States has never been so absurd for the onlookers. Who or what, for example, was anyone rooting for?</p>

<p>According to a Pew Research Centre survey conducted in September, 69% of Americans admitted to following news about the presidential candidates for the 2024 election very (28%) or fairly (40%) closely. But what exactly were they getting or hoping to get? The survey report says, “Americans most often see news about actions on the presidential campaign trail, though they are most interested in their stances on issues”. A fair ask. Obviously unmet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Circus Of The Absurd</strong></h2>

<p>What the American voter has received so far is a concept of a plan from Trump and a promised continuum of Biden's ‘problematic' policies from Harris. Many Americans are sitting this election out, and who can blame them? A campaign trail inundated with descriptions of a golfer's penis or how immigrants are eating other people's animals, insinuations about a potential election steal on one side and an undressed stream-of-consciousness word salad on the other, has done little to convince the average American voter about the nobility and grandiosity of the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Trump and Harris have demonstrated an utter inability to learn from the past. While Trump got too bored of a decent, non-dramatic campaign just a few months into 2024 and unleashed his 2020 MAGA-man energy, Harris stubbornly refused to bring any course correction in her agenda on foreign policy issues despite her fellow Democrats' public castigation. This election has been the most extensive testimony of what a lot of analysts within the US, as well as outside, have observed but have largely refrained from verbalising: both the Democrats and the Republicans fashion their electoral campaigns around the faults of the other side while doing absolutely nothing about their own.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala, The Saner One</strong></h2>

<p>Is it not ridiculous that the Harris campaign posited her only as the saner alternative to Trump? The fact that the Democrat incumbency became a burden and not a bolster for Harris should alert us that the new president's arrival in the White House will probably be an extension of all the gaffes this campaign saw. And what about the process of candidate selection for both parties? Declaring Trump as their candidate for the third time, the Republican Party demonstrated an utter lack of imagination at a time when President Biden's popularity was ebbing steadily. The Democrats changed their candidate from Biden to Harris with almost nil deliberations in their convention. The working-class voters, cold about Biden, have stayed cold towards her as well throughout the campaign.</p>

<p>But the US presidential elections are not about the American voters alone. What happens on Capitol Hill reverberates throughout the world. When Barack Obama won his first term, the symbolism of this victory was evident from young and old Indians celebrating at the India Gate in New Delhi. Presidents come and go, but their road to the Capitol paves ways across the world for ideologies, ideas, and geopolitical ramifications.</p>

<h2><strong>Nobody Knows Anything</strong></h2>

<p>From formulating trade controls to funding wars, what the POTUS decides goes a long way for the US and the rest of the world. Both Trump and Harris turned serious policy issues into farce during the campaign by sharpening the focus only on each other's personalities. We still do not know what Trump's plan is for the Middle East or the Russia-Ukraine war. Or China. Or Sudan or Bangladesh, for that matter. We only know that Harris is “committed to peace”, but her party's ongoing actions have suggested otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this moment, it is an exercise in futility to assess what a Trump or a Harris win might mean for India or the larger Global South. There are no guiding principles to launch any such enquiry. Any scenario study will yield only fallacious conclusions because, simply, neither Trump nor Harris has stuck to either the party line or even their own stated beliefs. Trump's transactionalism and Harris's hubris are enough to defy any projections.</p>

<p>The US presidential election was once a lesson in how democracy asserts itself. In 2024, it has become something else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A glorified version of Hulk Hogan wrestling with his shirt.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Two hours into the US election counting, Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democrat opponent Kamala Harris are leading in three and two swing states, respectively.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four hours into the US election counting, Republican candidate Donald Trump has surged ahead of his Democrat opponent Kamala Harris in six out of seven swing states that hold the key to the White House. North Carolina has been called in favor of Trump and he is also ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Leads are not yet in for the swing state of Nevada.</p>

<p>Also known as battleground states, swing states hold the key to victory in the US election. These states have a nearly equal level of support for both the Democrats and Republicans, and the election is won and lost in these states. This year, the swing states are Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral college votes, Michigan (10), Georgia (16), Wisconsin (10), North Carolina (16), Nevada (6) and Arizona (11).</p>

<p>Both the former President and the incumbent vice-president are pushing for the magic figure of 270 electoral college votes that will pave the way to the Oval Office in the White House. According to the current trends, Trump is leading with 230 votes, while Harris is at 205.</p>

<p>According to exit polls, the state of democracy, economy and abortion were the key issues on voters' minds when they headed to poll booths. A CBS News poll revealed that almost six in 10 people ranked the state of democracy as their number one issue, followed by abortion, which was picked by five per cent of voters as an important issue. The economy was a priority issue for one in ten.</p>

<p>A CNN exit poll said nearly three-quarters of the electorate holds a negative view of the way things are in the US today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, is commonly added to public drinking water to prevent tooth decay, a practice endorsed by numerous health authorities.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of voting for the US Presidential polls, former independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr announced that <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, if re-elected, would aim to remove fluoride from public drinking water on his first day in office.</p>

<p>"On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water," Kennedy wrote on X. He claimed fluoride is an "industrial waste" associated with various health risks, such as bone fractures, neurodevelopmental disorders, and IQ loss, adding that Trump and former First Lady Melania Trump seek to "Make America Healthy Again."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water. Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President…</p>
— Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Kennedy's statements came after his continued opposition to fluoridation, a stance often criticised by the broader medical community. Trump, who previously <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-says-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-will-have-big-role-in-health-care-if-he-wins-6927221">promised to make Kennedy a key figure</a> in healthcare policy if re-elected, has been open to reviewing such proposals.</p>

<p>He told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570" rel="nofollow,noindex">NBC News</a>, "I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me." before adding, "It's possible."</p>

<p>Trump was also willing to consult with other experts, calling Kennedy "a very talented guy with strong views."</p>

<h3><strong>What Is Fluoride</strong></h3>

<p>Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, is commonly added to public drinking water to prevent tooth decay, a practice endorsed by numerous health authorities.</p>

<p>"Fluoride is a natural substance," Professor Oliver Jones of RMIT University told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/fluoride-explainer-what-is-us-election-donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-jr " rel="nofollow,noindex">the Guardian</a>. "It's not an industrial waste product."</p>

<p>Dental experts have long touted fluoride's benefits, explaining that it strengthens tooth enamel and helps protect against cavities.</p>

<p>Studies linking fluoride to serious health issues, such as cancer or neurological problems, remain inconclusive. "Contrary to Kennedy's claims, studies have found no evidence linking fluoride in regular drinking water to conditions such as osteoporosis, bone fractures, or cancer," said Professor Loc Do of the University of Queensland.</p>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorse fluoride's safety. They have set a recommended limit of 1.5 mg per litre for drinking water. Fluoridation was named one of the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century by the CDC.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump's Potential Health Agenda</strong></h3>

<p>The former president has previously signalled a willingness to entertain Kennedy's views, including on other contentious health topics such as vaccine policy.</p>

<p>When asked about the possibility of banning certain vaccines, Trump stated, "Well, I'm going to talk to (Kennedy) and talk to other people, and I'll make a decision."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, counting has started for the US elections with several media networks currently projecting that Donald Trump is winning 10 states and Kamala Harris is winning five.</p>

<p>As for electoral college numbers, which will determine the winner in this election, the former President is ahead with 137 votes and Harris trails with 99. Each candidate is aiming for the magic figure of 270 electoral college votes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The study published in Nature Communications makes for the most compelling case to date about Mars' supposed 'life-rich' history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mars' magnetic field, which could have supported life, may have lasted longer than previously thought, a new <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/10/mars-may-have-been-habitable-much-more-recently-than-thought/#:~:text=Evidence%20suggests%20Mars%20could%20very,and,%20if%20so,%20when" rel="nofollow, noindex">study </a>by researchers at Harvard's Paleomagnetics Lab in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences has claimed. While Mars is now cold, barren and rocky, evidence suggests that the magnetic field may have lasted until 3.9 billion years ago, compared with previous estimates of 4.1 billion years -- making the Red Planet a prime candidate for a thriving environment for life.</p>

<p>The study published in <em>Nature Communications </em>makes for the most compelling case to date about Mars' supposed 'life-rich' history. The researchers used simulation and computer modelling to estimate the age of the Martian "dynamo," or global magnetic field produced by convection in the planet's iron core, like on Earth.</p>

<p>The scientists looked at the basins on Mars and concluded that the craters were formed while the dynamo of Mars was experiencing polarity reversal, which happens on Earth as well every few hundred thousand years.</p>

<p>"We are trying to answer primary, important questions about how everything got to be like it is, even why the entire solar system is that way," said Harvard's Sarah Steele, who led the research.</p>

<p>“Planetary magnetic fields are our best probe to answer a lot of those questions, and one of the only ways we have to learn about the deep interiors and early histories of planets," she added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/nasas-rover-captures-googly-eye-eclipse-on-mars-watch-6920035" rel="nofollow, noindex"><strong>WATCH | NASA's Rover Captures 'Googly Eye' Eclipse On Mars</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>What's the significance?</strong></h3>

<p>The extra 200 million years overlap with the era when the Martian surface became covered with water, the evidence for which has been gathered by several rovers sent by NASA. However, in the absence of a strong magnetic field, Mars lost its ability to ward off the solar wind which eroded its atmosphere, including the planet's water - making life unsustainable.</p>

<p>Scientists have long been seeking answers about the presence of life on Mars. Last month, a NASA <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasa-study-suggests-life-may-exist-on-mars-below-ice-surface-6825224" rel="nofollow, noindex">study </a>stated that microbes might find a potential home beneath the frozen water on the Red Planet's surface.</p>

<p>The authors of the study discovered that the amount of sunlight that penetrates the water ice could be enough for photosynthesis to occur in the shallow pools of meltwater beneath the surface of that ice. Since Mars has two kinds of ice -- frozen water and frozen carbon dioxide -- the research team looked at the water ice as a potential host of life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Americans on Tuesday voted in the US presidential election to decide whether Democrat nominee Kamala Harris will win the race to the White House or the Republican candidate Donald Trump will retain the top post for a second time.</p>

<p>According to the latest projections, Trump, 78, won several strongholds, including Florida, while Harris took a number of eastern states. US networks have projected that Trump is winning 10 states and Harris five. As for electoral college numbers, which will determine the winner in this election, the former President is ahead with 101 votes and Harris trails with 71. Each candidate is aiming for the magic figure of 270 electoral college votes.</p>

<p>Earlier, exit polls showed that most of the voters favoured Harris, 60, over her Republican rival. According to an exit poll by NBC News, 48 per cent of voters nationwide expressed a favourable view of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-leads-in-red-states-of-indiana-and-kentucky-as-counting-of-votes-begins-for-us-elections-6953293">Harris</a>, while 44 per cent supported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-2024-donald-trump-kamala-harris-over-70-of-voters-not-happy-with-how-things-are-going-in-us-exit-polls-6953111">Trump</a>.</p>

<p>The voters were also asked to choose between five issues - democracy, economy, abortion, immigration and foreign policy.</p>

<p>While 34% of voters said democracy mattered most to their vote, 31% said the economy. Abortion (14%) and immigration (11%) ranked as the next-most important issues and 4% of voters named foreign policy.</p>

<p>An exit poll by CNN said roughly three-quarters of the electorate holds a negative view of the way things are going in the US today. According to the poll, only about one-quarter call themselves enthusiastic or satisfied with the state of the nation, with more than four in 10 dissatisfied and roughly three in 10 saying they are angry.</p>

<p>Exit polls, however, are not always accurate and the preliminary results are subject to change as more voters are surveyed.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-live-updates-its-over-to-voters-as-america-decides-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-6948523" target="_blank">2024 US Presidential elections</a> are historic because if <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-asian-and-proud-how-kamala-harris-is-winning-over-indian-americans-6405829">Harris</a>, the Indian-American who is the first female vice president, wins, she would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the US voters choose Trump, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, he would become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Israelis rallied in Tel Aviv late Tuesday to protest the sacking of defence minister Yoav Gallant, calling on his successor Israel Katz to prioritise a hostage deal to return the captives still held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Chanting slogans against the government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the demonstrators carrying Israeli flags gathered in the commercial hub shortly after Gallant's dismissal was announced.</p>

<p>Protesters also blocked traffic and lit fires on the Ayalon highway in Tel Aviv, with some wearing "Bring them home now!" t-shirts referring to the hostages.</p>

<p>They held up signs with slogans such as "We deserve better leaders" and "Leaving no one behind!" and one protester wore handcuffs and a face mask with Netanyahu's likeness.</p>

<p>"Bibi traitor! You're guilty" chanted some, referring to Netanyahu and blaming for failing to prevent the Hamas attack on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>"We, the protesters, believe that Gallant... is actually the only normal person in the government," said 54-year-old teacher Samuel Miller, slamming Netanyahu's administration for opening "new fronts in uncalled-for wars".</p>

<p>"He's doing nothing to safeguard our peace, the peace of the Palestinians, the peace of everybody in this region," Miller told AFP.</p>

<p>He also criticised Netanyahu's government for "doing absolutely nothing to free the hostages" still held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Foreign minister Israel Katz took over the defence portfolio on Tuesday, after Netanyahu fired Gallant over eroded trust over the past months of the Gaza war.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Endangering Israel's security' -</strong></p>

<p>An Israeli group campaigning for the release of hostages in Gaza on Tuesday expressed "deep concern" over the sacking and urged Katz to "prioritise" a deal to free the captives.</p>

<p>"We expect the incoming defence minister, Israel Katz, to prioritise a hostage deal... to secure the immediate release of all hostages," the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.</p>

<p>Gallant also called on the government to bring home the hostages, saying in a televised speech: "We must do this quickly, while they are still alive."</p>

<p>Einav Tzangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, was among those protesting against Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"If it is possible to replace a defence minister in the middle of a war, then it is surely possible to replace a prime minister who is unqualified to bring back the hostages," she told Israel's Channel 12.</p>

<p>Netanyahu "is intentionally endangering Israel's security and all that because of a dispute between him and Gallant on how to continue the war," she added.</p>

<p>The war erupted on October 7, 2023 after Palestinian militants attacked Israel, resulting in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>During the October 7 attack, Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, of whom 97 are still in Gaza. The Israeli military says 34 of them are dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Counting has begun for the US elections; US networks have projected that Donald Trump is winning 23 states and Kamala Harris 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for electoral college numbers, which will determine the winner in this election, the former President is ahead with 230 votes and Harris trails with 205. Each candidate is aiming for the magic figure of 270 electoral college votes.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">These projections are from partisan states that have historically voted either Democratic or Republican and do not include the seven battleground or swing states that hold the key to this election. Current trends show Trump leading in six out of seven swing states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seven swing or battleground states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin are expected to effectively decide who will be the 47th President of the United States. The contest between Trump and Harris has been a fiercely fought one and both sides appeared to be in a dead heat even on Tuesday, which was the day of voting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exit polls showed that the state of democracy and the economy, and abortion were the most important issues for American voters heading into the election. A poll conducted by CBS News revealed that almost six in 10 people ranked the state of democracy as their number one issue, followed by abortion, which was picked by five per cent of voters as an important issue. Economy was picked as a priority issue by one in ten.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An exit poll by CNN said nearly three-quarters of the electorate holds a negative view of the way things are going in the US today. Only about a quarter said they were enthusiastic or satisfied with the state of the nation, with more than four in 10 dissatisfied and roughly 30% saying they are angry, according to the poll.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Israel Katz, formerly Israel's foreign minister, has been appointed defence minister after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sacked Yoav Gallant from the post.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he no longer had trust in Gallant's management of Israel's military operations, which include an ongoing war in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Below are some facts about Katz:</p>

<p>* Born in 1955 in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon, Katz was drafted into the military in 1973 and served as a paratrooper, leaving the service in 1977. He has not served in any senior military command position, unlike his predecessor Gallant, who had been a general before becoming defence minister in 2022.</p>

<p>* Katz, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, has been a member of the Knesset (parliament) since 1998. In the Knesset, he served on several committees including those covering foreign affairs, defence and justice.</p>

<p>* He has held several ministerial posts in the past two decades, including agriculture, transport, intelligence, finance and energy portfolios. He was appointed foreign minister in 2019.</p>

<p>* As foreign minister, Katz declared Antonio Guterres persona non grata in October over what he said was the U.N. secretary-general's failure to "unequivocally" condemn Iran's missile attack on Israel and for what he described as antisemitic and anti-Israel conduct.</p>

<p>* Also in October, he ordered his ministry to start legal proceedings against French President Emmanuel Macron after Paris banned Israeli firms from participating in an upcoming military naval trade show.</p>

<p>* Katz has been a low profile figure in Israeli-U.S. interactions during U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's 11 trips to Israel since Oct. 7, 2023. The top U.S. diplomat has held only a few meetings with Katz, while Blinken regularly met with Gallant.</p>

<p>* Katz studied as an undergraduate and graduate at Israel's Hebrew University. He is married with two children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump sought to undermine Tuesday the credibility of voting in the biggest city of must-win Pennsylvania, a soundly Democratic area that was part of the ex-president's unsupported 2020 fraud claims.</p>

<p>Amid reports of exceptionally high voter turnout in Philadelphia, Trump said there was "a lot of talk about massive cheating" in the city, as an official promptly denied the claim, calling it "yet another example of disinformation."</p>

<p>"Law enforcement coming!!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>He provided no evidence to support his claim made as Americans voted in a tense election that polls have suggested is effectively tied between Trump and Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no truth to this allegation," said City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican.</p>

<p>"Voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure."</p>

<p>Philadelphia police did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Trump's claim.</p>

<p>Trump rejected his loss in the 2020 election to Joe Biden, a denial that culminated with supporters of the ex-reality TV star violently attacking the US Capitol in a bid to block certification of the vote.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to reject the result if he loses again this year, raising the specter of chaos and violence in an already tense and deeply polarized United States.</p>

<p>The Republican has already started raising questions about the integrity of the vote in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that is a key prize in the battle for the White House.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania's Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, in a CNN interview last week, rejected Trump's allegations, noting that as the state's attorney general Shapiro defeated 43 challenges to the 2020 vote count from the ex-president and his allies.</p>

<p>When asked Tuesday whether he would accept defeat in the 2024 election, Trump offered a qualified response.</p>

<p>"If I lose an election, if it's a fair election, I would be the first one to acknowledge it. So far I think it's been fair," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of democracy, the shape of the economy and abortion are the most important issues for American voters in the US presidential election, according to the first wave of exit polls.</p>

<p>Almost six in 10 people ranked the state of democracy as their number one issue, according to polls released by CBS News.</p>

<p>It was followed by abortion as five per cent of the voters felt it was an important issue for them. Over one in 10 chose the economy as a priority issue.</p>

<p>Millions of Americans voted to elect the 47th President between Republican leader Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in an election billed as one of the most consequential contests for the White House in decades.</p>

<p>An exit poll by CNN said roughly three-quarters of the electorate holds a negative view of the way things are going in the US today.</p>

<p>Only about one-quarter call themselves enthusiastic or satisfied with the state of the nation, with more than four in 10 dissatisfied and roughly three in 10 saying they are angry, according to the poll.</p>

<p>Voters remain generally optimistic, with more than 6 in 10 saying that America's best days are in the future, and only about one-third said that they're already in the past, the CNN poll found.</p>

<p>It said President Joe Biden's approval rating is sliding nationally with about 4 in 10 voters saying they approve of his job performance and a majority disapproving.</p>

<p>The race between Harris and Trump remained stubbornly deadlocked for weeks with some of the election forecasters giving 60-year-old Vice President Harris an edge over former President Trump, 78, in some of the key battleground states like Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[China's drills come days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Beijing against taking action in response to a speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during the island's National Day celebrations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China deployed planes and ships to encircle Taiwan on Monday, in drills Beijing said were aimed at sending a "stern warning" to "separatist" forces on the self-ruled island.</p>

<p>Beijing has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control and Monday's drills represent its fourth round of large-scale war games in the past two years.</p>

<p>China's drills come days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Beijing against taking action in response to a speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during the island's National Day celebrations.</p>

<p>Lai, who took office in May, has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing, which calls him a "separatist". Taiwan condemned the latest exercises as "irrational and provocative" and said it has dispatched "appropriate forces" in response.</p>

<p>AFP journalists near the Hsinchu air force base, in the north of Taiwan, saw four fighter jets take off on Monday.</p>

<p>The drills, dubbed Joint Sword-2024B, "test the joint operations capabilities of the theater command's troops", Beijing said.</p>

<p>They are taking place in "areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan Island," said Captain Li Xi, spokesman for the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command.</p>

<p>The drills are "focusing on subjects of sea-air combat-readiness patrol, blockade on key ports and areas", Li said.</p>

<p>They also practised an "assault on maritime and ground targets" and "joint seizure of comprehensive superiority".</p>

<p>China's coast guard was also dispatched to conduct "inspections" around the island.</p>

<p>A diagram released by the coast guard showed four fleets encircling Taiwan and moving in an anticlockwise direction around the island.</p>

<p>Taiwan said it had detected "convoys" of China coast guard ships "in our northern, southwest and eastern waters".</p>

<p>China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent years, sending in warplanes and other military aircraft while its ships maintain a near-constant presence around the island's waters.</p>

<p>Taiwan said Sunday it had detected a Chinese aircraft carrier group to its south in the Bashi Channel, a waterway that separates the island from the Philippines, that appeared to be heading towards the western Pacific.</p>

<p>"In the face of enemy threats, all officers and soldiers of the country are in full readiness," Taiwan's defence ministry said Monday.</p>

<p>"We are determined and confident to ensure national defence security." - 'Provocations' - In his speech on Thursday, Lai vowed to "resist annexation" of the island, and insisted Beijing and Taipei were "not subordinate to each other". China warned after the speech that Lai's "provocations" would result in "disaster" for the people of Taiwan. Beijing on Monday said the drills were "a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity". Beijing's state broadcaster CCTV released a video warning: "the greater the provocation, the tighter the reins". The current dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to Taiwan in 1949. Lai's Democratic Progressive Party has long defended the sovereignty and democracy of Taiwan, which has its own government, military and currency. Beijing has sought to erase Taipei from the international stage, blocking it from global forums and poaching its diplomatic allies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the UN chief to move peacekeepers deployed in south Lebanon out of "harm's way", saying Hezbollah was using them as "human shields".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the UN chief on Sunday to move peacekeepers deployed in south Lebanon out of "harm's way", saying Hezbollah was using them as "human shields".</p>

<p>His call to UN chief Antonio Guterres came a day after the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) repeated its refusal to withdraw from the border area after five of its members were wounded in the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>"Mr Secretary General, get the UNIFIL forces out of harm's way. It should be done right now, immediately," Netanyahu said in a video statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of a cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said Israeli forces had asked UNIFIL several times to leave, saying that the peacekeepers' presence had "the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields".</p>

<p>"Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah. This endangers both them and the lives of our soldiers," the premier said.</p>

<p>"We regret the harm to UNIFIL soldiers and we are doing our utmost to prevent such harm. But the simplest and most obvious way to ensure this is simply to withdraw them from the danger zone."</p>

<p>UNIFIL has refused to leave its positions in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"There was a unanimous decision to stay because it's important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region, and to be able to report to the Security Council," UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti told AFP in an interview on Saturday.</p>

<p>He said Israel had asked UNIFIL to withdraw from positions "up to five kilometres (three miles) from the Blue Line" separating both countries, but the peacekeepers refused.</p>

<p>That would have included its 29 positions in south Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>'New chapter'</strong></p>

<p>UNIFIL, a mission of about 9,500 troops of various nationalities, was created following Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon.</p>

<p>It is currently tasked with monitoring a ceasefire that ended a 33-day war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Forty contributor nations to UNIFIL said on Saturday that they "strongly condemn recent attacks" on the peacekeepers.</p>

<p>"Such actions must stop immediately and should be adequately investigated," said the joint statement, posted on X by the Polish UN mission and signed by nations including leading contributors Indonesia, Italy and India.</p>

<p>On Sunday, UNIFIL said it had demanded explanations from the Israeli army over what it said were "shocking violations" against their force, including forcing entry into one of their positions.</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday morning Israeli tanks had "destroyed" a UNIFIL position and "forcibly entered" there, UNIFIL said.</p>

<p>But the Israeli military said a tank had collided with a UN peacekeeping post when it came under fire during an incident when multiple soldiers were injured.</p>

<p>Late Sunday, the Israeli military said that over the past month about 25 rockets and missiles had been launched at Israel from Hezbollah compounds "embedded near UNIFIL posts" in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>It said one of the attacks even killed two Israeli soldiers, but did not specify when the incident happened.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the Israeli call on UNIFIL to abandon the south.</p>

<p>"The warning that Netanyahu addressed to... Guterres demanding the removal of the UNIFIL represents a new chapter in the enemy's approach of not complying with international" norms, Mikati said. Earlier, Netanyahu said the criticism of Israel was misplaced and should be directed at Hezbollah. "Instead of criticising Israel, they should direct their criticism to Hezbollah, which uses UNIFIL as a human shield," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military said a Hezbollah drone had killed four soldiers at one of its northern bases Sunday, as it expanded its bombardments of Lebanon and troops battled militants across the border.</p>

<p>The attack on a military training camp in Binyamina, near Haifa, is the deadliest such assault on an Israeli base since September 23, when Israel increased its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon. Emergency services reported more than 60 wounded.</p>

<p>Authorities in Gaza, meanwhile, said the death toll from an Israeli strike Sunday on a school being used as a shelter for displaced people had risen to 15, including whole families.</p>

<p>And as fighting raged between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon's south, United Nations peacekeepers said they had again in the firing line.</p>

<p>They said Israeli troops "forcibly" entered a UN position with two tanks, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the force to withdraw from the area.</p>

<p>Israel's military said a tank had backed into the UN post while under fire.</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah promises worse</strong></p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah said late Sunday that it launched "a squadron of attack drones" at the Binyamina camp, around 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of the major city of Haifa.</p>

<p>The strike was in response to Israeli attacks, including air strikes on Thursday that Lebanon's health ministry said killed at least 22 people in central Beirut.</p>

<p>In a later statement, Hezbollah warned Israel that "what it witnessed today in southern Haifa is nothing compared to what awaits it if it decides to continue its aggression against our noble and dear people".</p>

<p>An Israeli volunteer rescue service, United Hatzalah, said its teams in Binyamina assisted "over 60 wounded people" with injuries from mild to critical.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been firing rockets and drones into Israel for more than a year in support of Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>Since late September, however, its strikes have reached further into the country.</p>

<p>Israel's sophisticated air defences have intercepted most of the projectiles, with few casualties caused by strikes or falling debris.</p>

<p><strong>Defend this 'blessed land'</strong></p>

<p>Israel's recent strikes have increasingly focused on areas beyond Hezbollah's traditional strongholds in southern Beirut, and Lebanon's south and east.</p>

<p>Israel said its air force hit "Hezbollah launchers, anti-tank missile posts, weapons storage facilities" and other targets, while on the ground its soldiers "eliminated dozens" of fighters.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) said Israeli forces had "escalated their attacks" on southern Lebanon with "successive air strikes" pounding several border villages.</p>

<p>It later reported that an Israeli strike on Mayfadoun, near Nabatiyeh, in southern Lebanon, had killed five people and wounded one other.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its forces clashed several times with Israeli troops who tried to "infiltrate" villages along the border.</p>

<p>Before the drone strike it had said it launched a salvo of rockets at a "base in southern Haifa".</p>

<p>The group later aired an audio recording of its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah calling on fighters to "defend this holy and blessed land and this honourable people".</p>

<p>Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli air strike in south Beirut on September 27, and several other senior commanders of the movement have also been killed.</p>

<p>Israel's military said about 115 projectiles fired by Hezbollah had crossed into Israeli territory by Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>A Hezbollah fighter was captured emerging from a tunnel in south Lebanon on Sunday, Israel's military said, the first such announcement since the start of the ground offensive.</p>

<p><strong>'Shocking violations'</strong></p>

<p>UN peacekeepers accused Israeli troops of breaking through a gate and entering one of their positions before dawn Sunday in south Lebanon, the latest of several incidents the UNIFIL mission has reported since Thursday.</p>

<p>Five Blue Helmets have so far been injured, provoking international condemnation.</p>

<p>"Two IDF (Israeli military) Merkava tanks destroyed the position's main gate and forcibly entered the position" in the Ramia area, before leaving 45 minutes later, UNIFIL said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military later said a tank "backed several meters into a UNIFIL post" while "under fire" and attempting to evacuate injured soldiers.</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, Netanyahu had called on the UN to move peacekeepers in southern Lebanon out of harm's way, after the mission rejected requests to abandon its positions.</p>

<p>The peacekeepers' presence had "the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields", said Netanyahu.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres on Sunday said "attacks" against peacekeepers "may constitute a war crime".</p>

<p>UNIFIL, with about 9,500 troops, is in southern Lebanon under the longstanding UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which stipulated that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should be deployed in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Three Lebanese soldiers were wounded on Sunday, the country's army said, when Israeli forces fired on military vehicles in the Marjayoun area.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, in a phone call with Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, appealed to Iran to support "a general de-escalation" in Lebanon and Gaza, his office said.</p>

<p><strong>US sending more air-defences</strong></p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli shelling had killed at least 15 people and wounded dozens more Sunday at a school turned shelter for displaced Palestinians in central Gaza's Nuseirat camp.</p>

<p>"The school was bombarded with a large volley of Israeli artillery, resulting in an initial death toll of 15 martyrs, including children, women and entire families, and 50 wounded," said Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the agency.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it was "looking into the reports".</p>

<p>The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said late Sunday that a WHO-Red Cross operation had managed to resupply two hospitals in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>"WHO and partners finally managed to reach Kamal Adwan and Al-Sahaba hospitals yesterday after 9 attempts this past week," he posted on X.</p>

<p>Hamas sparked the war in Gaza with the deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The number includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says more than 42,000 people, the majority civilians, have been killed since Israel's military campaign began there. The UN considers these figures to be reliable.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 1,300 people since September 23, according to an AFP tally of official figures, including for Saturday.</p>

<p>That toll exceeds the entire Lebanese toll of 1,200 -- mostly civilians -- in the last Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006, when 160 people, mostly soldiers, died in Israel.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said it would deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system and its US military crew to Israel to help the ally protect itself from potential Iranian attack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the Nobel economics prize on Monday, with specialists on credit, the role of government, and wealth inequality seen as possible contenders.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Closing the season, the Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the Nobel economics prize on Monday, with specialists on credit, the role of government, and wealth inequality seen as possible contenders.</p>

<p>The winner of the prestigious prize, which last year went to American economist Claudia Goldin, will be announced at 11:45 am (0945 GMT).</p>

<p>Goldin was recognised "for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes" and was ironically one of very few women ever handed the prize.</p>

<p>Of the 93 laureates honoured since 1969, only three have been women -- Goldin in 2023, her compatriot Elinor Ostrom in 2009 and French-American Esther Duflo in 2019.</p>

<p>"The general trend in society to attach greater importance to parity and diversity has broadened the research process," Mikael Carlsson, professor of economics at Uppsala University in Sweden, told AFP.</p>

<p>"However, this is not the criteria taken into account when assessing whether a scientific contribution is worthy of a Nobel Prize," he insisted.</p>

<p>His bet is that Japan's Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and Britain's John H. Moore will win for their work on how small shocks can affect economic cycles, or American Susan Athey for her work on market design.</p>

<p>But what criteria should be used to predict a Nobel winner?</p>

<p>For Magnus Henrekson of the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm, the most obvious place to start is to look at the research interests of the committee that decides which candidates are worthy.</p>

<p>Its chairman specialises in development economics, though Henrekson said it was doubtful the field would be honoured as it was recently awarded a prize.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's likely that the same field will win the prize two years running," Henrekson said.</p>

<p>Poverty or wealth inequality?</p>

<p>Frenchman Philippe Aghion, as well as Americans George Loewenstein, Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart are academics often mentioned as worthy of the prize.</p>

<p>Turkish-American Daron Acemoglu, a professor at MIT in the United States and the author of several best-sellers including "Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty," is considered a top name this year.</p>

<p>Acemoglu could potentially be paired with Russian-American Andrei Shleifer.</p>

<p>Predicting the winner is always tricky, but online statistics platform Statista noted that by looking at past recipients and the state of current research in economics, "we have a decent idea of candidates who are likely to win a Nobel in their career, if not in 2024".</p>

<p>It believes Acemoglu could get the nod for his "work on the long-run development of institutions which facilitate or hinder economic growth".</p>

<p>Other possible candidates include macroeconomists such as Frenchman Olivier Blanchard, and Americans Larry Summers and Gregory Mankiw.</p>

<p>Economists who work on wealth inequality, such as France's Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman as well as French-American Emmanuel Saez have also often been mentioned in recent years.</p>

<p>Canadian-American Janet Currie, a specialist in anti-poverty policies, is a favourite for analytics group Clarivate, which keeps an eye on potential Nobel science laureates based on citations.</p>

<p>It also spotlighted British-Indian Partha Dasgupta as a potential winner for "integrating nature and its resources in the human economy".</p>

<p>'False Nobel'</p>

<p>Paolo Mauro, a former member of the International Monetary Fund, was also put forward for "empirical studies of the effects of corruption on investment and economic growth".</p>

<p>The economics prize is the only Nobel not among the original five created in the will of Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896.</p>

<p>It was instead created through a donation from the Swedish central bank in 1968, leading detractors to dub it "a false Nobel".</p>

<p>However, like for the other Nobel science prizes, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences decides the winner and follows the same selection process.</p>

<p>The economics prize wraps up this year's Nobel season, which honoured achievements in artificial intelligence for the physics and chemistry prizes, while the Peace Prize went to Japanese group Nihon Hidankyo, committed to fighting nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>South Korea's Han Kan won the literature prize -- the only woman laureate so far this year -- while the medicine prize lauded discoveries in understanding gene regulation.</p>

<p>The Nobel Prizes consist of a diploma, a gold medal and a one-million-dollar lump sum.</p>

<p>They will be presented at ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist and prize creator Alfred Nobel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Life has stopped since October 2023," said Milad al-Alam, Mayor of village Rmeish, saying most commercial activity had come to a halt since Hezbollah started launching rockets across the border into Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanese Christian Joseph Jarjour was hoping for a peaceful retirement at home in south Lebanon, but has instead found himself caught in the crossfire of the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>"We're trapped," said the 68-year-old retired teacher in the southern village of Rmeish, around two kilometres (one mile) from the Israeli border.</p>

<p>After almost a year of cross-border fire, Israel began conducting a wave of strikes targeting Hezbollah strongholds and sent ground troops across the border late last month.</p>

<p>Jarjour's hometown is among a handful of Christian villages in south Lebanon that have largely been spared the worst of the violence but remain caught between the two sides.</p>

<p>"When Israel bombards, it flies over our heads. And when Hezbollah fires back, it also whizzes by above," Jarjour told AFP by phone during a rare moment of internet connectivity.</p>

<p>"We're peaceful, we don't have any weapons. We've never liked war," he said.</p>

<p>"We want to stay in our homes and we don't want to choose sides."</p>

<p>The violence since September 23 has killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon and forced a million more from their homes, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Jarjour said roads out of Rmeish were unsafe so it was "very hard" to escape and drive northwards to the capital, Beirut.</p>

<p><strong>'Hostages'</strong></p>

<p>Milad al-Alam, mayor of the village of red-tiled houses surrounded by green hills known for growing tobacco, said most of its 6,000 inhabitants had stayed put.</p>

<p>But today the walls of some of the houses there are cracked from the nearby explosions, and fresh vegetables are no longer delivered from outside.</p>

<p>Ramping up the pressure on the village, hundreds of people, mostly Christians, fleeing nearby areas have sought refuge there.</p>

<p>"Life has stopped since October 2023," said Alam, saying most commercial activity had come to a halt since Hezbollah started launching rockets across the border into Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been foes for decades, exchanging fire since the Iran-backed group opened a front last year in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas after the October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"Anyone who had savings has spent them over the past few months," Alam said.</p>

<p>During the 33-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, most Rmeish villagers had also stayed put.</p>

<p>Alam said he had been able to organise a delivery of humanitarian aid to the village last week with the protection of the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers.</p>

<p>"But we cannot replace the state," he said, in a country paralysed by political deadlock on top of its worst financial crisis in history since 2019.</p>

<p>Christian-majority villages have largely been spared in recent Israeli bombardments, unlike neighbouring Shiite-majority areas that have been ravaged and emptied of their inhabitants.</p>

<p>In January, Maronite Patriarch Beshara al-Rai, the spiritual leader of Lebanon's largest Christian sect, said villagers along the frontier had become "hostages" that were "bearing the brunt" of the conflict.</p>

<p>Lebanon is home to 18 officially recognised religious denominations, and around 30 percent of the population is Christian.</p>

<p><strong>'Bound to our land'</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli military last week told south Lebanon residents to flee their homes after it said it would be carrying out "limited" incursions across the border.</p>

<p>But in the village of Qlayaa, some four kilometres from the frontier, hundreds of families have also remained in their homes despite shortages of fuel and medicine, and the closest hospital being forced to close.</p>

<p>Priest Pierre al-Rai said they had stayed in the village because they were "believers bound to our land".</p>

<p>"We've done our best so there are no military operations... no military installations here," he added.</p>

<p>Israel occupied the village from 1982 to 2000, a period during which some Lebanese Christians sided with their southern neighbour, while others were staunchly opposed.</p>

<p>In the morning in Qlayaa, home to a statue of Saint George, few people leave their homes as the sound of bombardment rings out overhead.</p>

<p>Pauline Matta, a mother of four children aged four to 18, said she cried when she saw the Israeli warning to evacuate.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old said she is constantly terrified.</p>

<p>"I can no longer stand the sound of shelling or Israeli planes breaking the sound barrier. I scream when I hear them," she told AFP.</p>

<p>But she can't imagine leaving either, or being able to survive away from home on her husband's modest army salary.</p>

<p>"They imposed this war on us. We have nothing to do with it. Why would we leave?" she said.</p>

<p>"I am determined to stay put."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man found illegally in possession of a shotgun and a loaded handgun was arrested by sheriff's deputies assigned to protect a Donald Trump rally in Coachella, California, the Riverside County sheriff's office announced Sunday.</p>

<p>The Secret Service said that it was aware of the arrest and that neither Trump nor rally attendees had not been in any danger during the incident, which took place on Saturday.</p>

<p>"While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing," the organization tasked with protecting presidents and presidential candidates said in a joint statement with the FBI and the US Attorney's office.</p>

<p>The sheriff's team said the man, which it identified as 49-year-old Vem Miller of Las Vegas, was later released on bail and faces a court hearing on January 2.</p>

<p>They added that the deputies, manning a checkpoint near the rally, arrested Miller as he drove up in a black SUV.</p>

<p>They later booked him at a local detention center on charges of possessing a loaded firearm and a high-capacity magazine.</p>

<p>The incident comes on the heels of two assassination attempts -- one in Pennsylvania in which a bullet grazed Trump's ear, and a second, aborted attempt at his Florida golf course.</p>

<p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco -- a Trump supporter who also addressed the Republican's rally in Coachella on Saturday -- said that there was "absolutely no way that any of us are going to truly know what was in his head."</p>

<p>"If you're asking me right now, I probably did have deputies that prevented the third assassination attempt," Bianco, a former member of the far-right Oath Keepers group, told a press conference.</p>

<p>Bianco said the man had "multiple" passports and IDs with different names in his vehicle, which was unregistered. He said any further charges would come from federal authorities.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Trump's decision to hold a rally in California surprised political analysts, who note that the state is heavily Democratic, but he drew a large crowd, even in temperatures near 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius).</p>

<p>Coachella is known for its annual music festival.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people were killed in western France late Saturday when a Tesla electric car caught fire for reasons not yet determined, prosecutors said Sunday.</p>

<p>The accident occurred outside the city of Niort, causing the deaths of the driver and three passengers who were employees at a restaurant in nearby Melle, according to a source close to police.</p>

<p>"An inquiry has been opened to determine the causes and circumstances of the deadly accident, a probe during which expertise on the vehicle will be requested," a local judge told AFP.</p>

<p>According to preliminary reports, the vehicle rammed into several road signs at high speed.</p>

<p>The passengers on board were already dead when rescuers arrived at the scene, police said.</p>

<p>Tesla, founded by the billionaire CEO Elon Musk, has frequently faced scrutiny over safety issues.</p>

<p>In April, the carmaker settled with the family of an engineer killed when a Tesla Model X crashed in Silicon Valley in 2018, a move that avoided a trial.</p>

<p>The driver was on a California highway using the Tesla autopilot feature when the car drove into a concrete median, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>In December, Tesla recalled more than two million vehicles in the United States and Canada because of risks associated with the autopilot software and a potentially "increased risk of a collision", according to US national regulators.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanese militant group Hezbollah on Sunday aired an audio recording of its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah just over two weeks after an Israeli air strike killed him in southern Beirut.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanese militant group Hezbollah on Sunday aired an audio recording of its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah just over two weeks after an Israeli air strike killed him in southern Beirut.</p>

<p>"We count on you... to defend your people, your families, your nation, your values and your dignity, and to defend this holy and blessed land and this honourable people," said Nasrallah, who was killed on September 27, in a recording it said was made as he addressed the Iran-backed group's fighters during a military manoeuvre.</p>

<p>Many other senior commanders of the movement have also been killed.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said about 115 projectiles fired by Hezbollah had crossed into Israeli territory by Sunday afternoon.<br />
A Hezbollah fighter was captured emerging from a tunnel in south Lebanon on Sunday, Israel's military said, the first such announcement since the start of the ground offensive.</p>

<p><strong>'Shocking violations'</strong></p>

<p>United Nations peacekeepers on Sunday accused Israeli troops of breaking through a gate and entering one of their positions in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>It is the latest of several incidents the UNIFIL mission has reported since Thursday, leaving five Blue Helmets previously injured.</p>

<p>"At around 4:30 am, while peacekeepers were in shelters, two IDF (Israeli military) Merkava tanks destroyed the position's main gate and forcibly entered the position" in the Ramia area, before leaving 45 minutes later, said the peacekeeping force (UNIFIL).</p>

<p>On Saturday, several kilometres (miles) to the northeast, Israeli "soldiers stopped a critical UNIFIL logistical movement near Mais al-Jabal, denying it passage", it added.</p>

<p>"We have requested an explanation from the IDF for these shocking violations," UNIFIL said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military later said a tank "backed several meters into a UNIFIL post" while "under fire" and attempting to evacuate injured soldiers.</p>

<p>Netanyahu had earlier on Sunday called on the UN chief to remove peacekeepers in southern Lebanon out of harm's way, after the mission rejected requests to abandon their positions.</p>

<p>He said that the peacekeepers' presence had "the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields".</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned Netanyahu's call, saying it "represents a new chapter in the enemy's approach of not complying with international" norms.</p>

<p>UNIFIL, with about 9,500 troops, is in southern Lebanon under the longstanding UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which stipulated that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should be deployed in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday called it "absolutely unacceptable" that UN troops are "deliberately targeted by the Israeli armed forces".</p>

<p><strong>Lebanon calls for ceasefire</strong></p>

<p>Earlier Sunday Israeli warplanes also hit a 100-year-old mosque in the village of Kfar Tibnit near the border, NNA said.</p>

<p>"It was a significant place because families used to gather in the square right next to it (the mosque) on special occasions," Mayor Fuad Yassin told AFP.</p>

<p>Hamas sparked the ongoing war in Gaza with the deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The number includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says 42,227 people, the majority civilians, have been killed since Israel's military campaign began there. The UN acknowledges these figures to be reliable.</p>

<p>In support of Hamas, Hezbollah started firing into northern Israel in October last year, triggering a near-daily exchange of fire until the war escalated in late September.</p>

<p>Netanyahu vowed to fight Hezbollah until Israelis displaced by the violence could return to their homes.</p>

<p>Since then, more than 1,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and a million others have been displaced, according to Lebanese officials.</p>

<p>Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a "full and immediate ceasefire".</p>

<p>In a visit to Baghdad ahead of Israel's expected retaliation for Iran's October 1 missile attack on Israel, Iran's top diplomat Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said Tehran was "fully prepared for a war situation".</p>

<p>He added: "We do not want war."</p>

<p>The Pentagon later said it would deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system and its US military crew to Israel to help the ally protect itself from potential Iranian attack.</p>

<p>In north Gaza, Israeli forces have for days essentially besieged an around Jabalia, with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, saying the fighting was causing more suffering for hundreds of thousands of people trapped there.</p>

<p>"For over a week there has been no hope, no water and no means of life," said local resident Muhammad Abu Halima, 40.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea's artillery units near the border with South Korea have been ordered to be ready to fire amid frictions over drones that Pyongyang says are being flown over the frontier, state media cited the government as saying on Sunday.</p>

<p>Some defectors and activists in South Korea fly aid parcels into the North and drop leaflets criticising leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p>North Korea has blamed the South Korean military for the practice. It has also been floating balloons with trash into the South in reprisal.</p>

<p>North Korean state news agency KCNA quoted the defence ministry's spokesperson as saying Pyongyang sees a high likelihood of more drones flying over the capital, with its military told to prepare for all scenarios including conflict.</p>

<p>On Friday, North Korea accused South Korea of sending drones into Pyongyang at night this week and last, and said the intrusion demanded retaliatory action.</p>

<p>Kim Yo Jong, powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, warned Seoul on Saturday of a "horrible disaster".</p>

<p>She said the blame lies with the South Korean military if it failed to identify drones sent by a non-governmental organization crossing the border.</p>

<p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it could not confirm the North's accusations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pentagon said Sunday it will deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system and its US military crew to Israel to help the ally protect itself from potential Iranian missile attacks.</p>

<p>At the direction of US President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin "authorized the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and associated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1," Pentagon press secretary Pat Ryder said in a statement.</p>

<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned earlier that there would be "no red lines" in defending the country's people and interests, but efforts would continue to "contain an all-out war in our region".<br />
Israel has vowed a response to Iran's October 1 missile attack which Tehran said was in retaliation for the killing of militant leaders in the region and a general in its Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Araghchi arrived in Baghdad on Sunday for talks with Iraqi officials in Iran's latest high-level diplomatic efforts ahead of Israel's anticipated attack.</p>

<p>At a joint news conference with his Iraqi counterpart, Araghchi said Iran was "fully prepared for a war situation ... but we do not want war, we want peace."</p>

<p>He said Iran would continue consultations "to prevent the escalation of tension in the region and to work for peace and ceasefire" in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said Baghdad was against a regional war spreading to Iran.</p>

<p>"The continuation of the war and its expansion towards the Islamic Republic of Iran and (Israel's) exploitation of Iraqi airspace as a corridor is completely unacceptable and rejected," Hussein said.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has vowed that his country's response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".</p>

<p>After Baghdad, Araghchi will head to Oman, the Iranian ISNA news agency reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday in Qatar Araghchi met Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani for talks on the wars in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Doha has been mediating talks aimed at a Gaza ceasefire and has also called for a truce in Lebanon.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Araghchi met Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan.</p>

<p>Tehran had said the talks were aimed at providing "better conditions" for Palestinians and Lebanese under Israeli attacks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, who is the Republican presidential candidate, said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "like two days ago."</p>

<p>Trump was asked when last he spoke to the Israeli leader during a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday.</p>

<p>"Like two days ago and he came to my house in Florida, Mar-a-Lago with his wife who was lovely," he responded.</p>

<p>Trump met with Netanyahu at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, in July. It was their first meeting since the end of Trump's presidency.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden also spoke with Netanyahu last week amid tensions with Iran. Their Wednesday call was the first known conversation between the two leaders since August. It coincided with a sharp escalation of Israel's conflict with Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Trump called the lack of conversation between Biden and Netanyahu in nearly two months "pathetic."</p>

<p>"I can tell you that Bibi has been very strong," Trump said. "He's not listening to Biden."</p>

<p>Relations between Biden and Netanyahu have been tense, strained over the Israeli leader's handling of the war in Gaza and the conflict with Hezbollah. Israel has said it will pursue its military operations until Israelis are safe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations said on Sunday Israeli tanks had burst through the gates of a base of its peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks that have been denounced by Israel's own allies.</p>

<p>The UNIFIL peacekeeping force said two Israeli Merkava tanks destroyed the main gate of a base and forcibly entered before dawn on Sunday morning. After the tanks left, shells exploded 100 metres (yards) away, releasing smoke which blew across the base and sickened UN personnel, causing 15 to require treatment despite wearing gas masks, it said in a statement.</p>

<p>In its version of events, the Israeli military said militants of the Iran-backed group Hezbollah had fired anti-tank missiles at Israeli troops, wounding 25 of them. The attack was very close to a UNIFIL post and a tank that was helping evacuate the casualties under fire then backed into the UNIFIL post.</p>

<p>"It is not storming a base. It is not trying to enter a base. It was a tank under heavy fire, mass casualty event, backing up to get out of harm's way," the military's international spokesperson, Nadav Shoshani, told reporters.</p>

<p>In a statement, the military said it used a smoke screen to provide cover for the evacuation of the wounded soldiers but its actions posed no danger to the UN peackeeping force.</p>

<p>Five peacekeepers have been wounded in a series of strikes in recent days, most blamed by UNIFIL on Israeli forces.</p>

<p>The UN force said any deliberate attack on peacekeepers was "a grave violation of international humanitarian law and Resolution 1701" that established the mission.</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a statement addressed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: "The time has come for you to withdraw UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones."</p>

<p>"The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields."</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which Israel has been battling on the ground in southern Lebanon since it launched an incursion at the start of this month, denies Israel's accusation that it uses the proximity of peacekeepers for protection.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah resumed a year ago when the Iranian-backed group began firing rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war and has sharply escalated in recent weeks.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a drone attack wounded at least 20 people in the northern Israel town of Binyamina, N12 News television said.</p>

<p>'UNACCEPTABLE'</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, typically one of Israel's most vocal supporters among Western European leaders, spoke to Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and denounced the "unacceptable" Israeli attacks, her government said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he told Meloni that he regretted "any harm done to UNIFIL personnel" in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Israel will make every effort to prevent UNIFIL casualties and will do what it takes to win the war," he said on X.</p>

<p>Italy has more than a thousand troops in the 10,000-strong UNIFIL force, making it one of the biggest contributors of personnel. France and Spain, which each have nearly 700 soldiers in the force, have also condemned the Israeli attacks.</p>

<p>The presence of UNIFIL puts peacekeepers from 50 separate countries in harm's way, in a force initially set up in southern Lebanon in 1978.</p>

<p>The area has seen decades of conflict, with Israel invading in 1982, occupying southern Lebanon until 2000 and again fighting a major five-week war against Hezbollah in 2006, which ended with a ceasefire monitored by UNIFIL.</p>

<p>Israel's assault against Hezbollah over the past three weeks has uprooted 1.2 million Lebanese and inflicted an unprecedented blow on the group by killing most of its senior leadership.</p>

<p>Lebanon's government says more than 2,100 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded in over a year of fighting, mainly over the past few weeks. The toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but includes scores of women and children.</p>

<p>Israeli officials say UNIFIL has failed in its mission of upholding UN Resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 war, which calls for the border area of southern Lebanon to be free of weapons or troops other than those of the Lebanese state.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a call with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Saturday, expressed "deep concern" about reports Israeli forces had fired on peacekeeper positions. He urged Israel to ensure their safety and that of the Lebanese military, which is not party to Israel's conflict with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has already told UN peacekeepers to get out of the way, asking them weeks ago to prepare to relocate more than 5 km (3 miles) from the border, according to an excerpt from a message seen by Reuters.</p>

<p>HIGH ALERT</p>

<p>The Middle East meanwhile remains on high alert for Israel to retaliate against Iran for an October 1 barrage of long range missiles launched in response to Israel's assaults on Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iran said on Sunday it has "no red lines" in defending itself. Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi's comments appeared intended to counter suggestions that Iran would absorb an Israeli strike without a response, as it did earlier this year when Israel last struck Iran after a volley of Iranian missiles.</p>

<p>Later, Revolutionary Guards Aerospace Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh said Tehran was ready to respond to any Israeli action, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[British climber Andrew Irvine vanished in 1924 alongside his climbing partner, George Mallory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A documentary team has discovered human remains on Mount Everest that are believed to belong to a climber who went missing 100 years ago while attempting to summit the peak, according to a report by<em> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/sandy-irvine-body-found-everest" rel="nofollow, noindex">National Geographic</a></em>. Due to climate change, melting snow and ice in the Himalayas is increasingly revealing the bodies of climbers who lost their lives in pursuit of scaling the world's highest mountain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British climber Andrew Irvine vanished in 1924 alongside his climbing partner, George Mallory, as they attempted to be the first to reach Everest's summit, standing at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet). Mallory's body was recovered in 1999, but Irvine's fate remained a mystery until the recent discovery by a National Geographic team on Everest's Central Rongbuk Glacier. They found a boot containing a human foot, and a sock with a label that read "A.C. IRVINE" stitched into it.</p>

<p>This discovery could provide significant clues regarding the location of the climbers' personal effects and potentially resolve one of mountaineering's most enduring mysteries: whether Irvine and Mallory reached the summit before they died. If proven, they would have successfully scaled the peak nearly three decades before the first confirmed ascent in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.</p>

<p>"It tells the whole story about what probably happened," said Julie Summers, Irvine's great-niece, in an interview with National Geographic. She added, "I have lived with this story since I was a 7-year-old when my father told us about the mystery of Uncle Sandy on Everest. When Jimmy told me that he saw the name A.C. Irvine on the label of the sock inside the boot, I was moved to tears. It was and will remain an extraordinary and poignant moment."</p>

<p>The first documented ascent of Everest occurred on May 29, 1953, when New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay successfully reached the summit. Ten years later, in 1963, Jim Whittaker became the first American to achieve the feat.</p>

<p>Members of the Irvine family have reportedly offered to provide DNA samples to confirm the identity of the remains.</p>

<p>Irvine, who was only 22 years old when he disappeared, was last seen on the afternoon of June 8, 1924, along with Mallory, as they made their final push toward the summit.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Mallory's last letter to his wife was digitized and published online by Cambridge University. In it, he wrote that their chances of reaching the summit were "50 to 1 against us."</p>

<p>Irvine is believed to have been carrying a small camera at the time, and finding it could potentially rewrite the history of mountaineering.</p>

<p>"This was a monumental and emotional moment for us and our entire team on the ground, and we just hope this can finally bring peace of mind to his relatives and the climbing world at large," said Jimmy Chin, a climb team member and National Geographic explorer. Chin chose not to disclose the exact location of the remains to deter potential trophy hunters, but he remains hopeful that other artefacts, including the camera, might be nearby. "It certainly reduces the search area," he said.</p>

<p>Since the 1920s, over 300 climbers have lost their lives on Mount Everest.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Tahani Yassine was in her third trimester of pregnancy when she chose to return to her hometown of Beirut to deliver her baby.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tahani Yassine was in her third trimester of pregnancy when she chose to return to her hometown of Beirut to deliver her baby.</p>

<p>Living in Equatorial Guinea with her husband and three young children, she had more faith in the Lebanese healthcare system.</p>

<p>But just a few days after her arrival in Beirut, Yassine began to regret her decision. Israel intensified its military campaign in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah strongholds in the south, the Bekaa Valley in the east and the southern suburbs of Beirut, close to her home.</p>

<p>Although her area wasn't directly hit, the strikes were unnervingly close, and the boom of Israeli warplanes breaking the sound barrier overhead filled her with fear.</p>

<p>Anxious for the safety of her unborn child, the 36-year-old moved to an apartment closer to hospital where she was due to deliver.</p>

<p>"My doctors told me that I was too far along in my pregnancy to travel. I had no choice but to stay and deliver here," she told Reuters just hours after giving birth at Trad Hospital in central Beirut on Oct. 10.</p>

<p>Lying in her hospital bed, with her newborn girl nestled next to her in a crib, Yassine expressed her relief that both she and her baby were healthy - a very different experience to many expectant mothers in the escalating conflict in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Nicolas Baaklini, an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Beirut, says he has noticed an increase in premature births and foetal deaths since hostilities began last year.</p>

<p>"What has increased the most, and what was shocking to me, is the number of foetal deaths in in-utero babies who died in their mothers' wombs," said Baaklini, 61, who has a private clinic and also works in several Beirut hospitals.</p>

<p>"There are many malformations, and surprisingly, several colleagues have observed the same. When ... in one year, you have two foetal deaths in-utero, and then suddenly, in two months, you have about 15, it indicates that something is wrong," he added.</p>

<p><strong>MOTHERS FLEE THEIR HOMES</strong></p>

<p>Around 11,600 pregnant women remain in Lebanon, of whom around 4,000 are expected to deliver in the next three months, according to a flash appeal published by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in October.</p>

<p>Many of them are displaced and lack adequate shelter, nutrition and sanitation. Access to safe antenatal, post-natal, and paediatric care is increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>Since the war intensified in late September, the Israeli campaign has forced about 1.2 million people from their homes, according to the Lebanese government.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants erupted a year ago when the Iranian-backed group began launching rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Dressed in white scrubs in the neonatal intensive care unit of Trad Hospital, Baaklini stroked the tiny feet of a baby girl in one of the incubators. The baby and her twin brother had been delivered prematurely by a mother who had to evacuate her home in southern Beirut due to Israeli airstrikes.</p>

<p>He believed that the mother's early contractions were partly caused the stress of the bombardments and having to flee.</p>

<p>He said all the ICU beds were occupied, attributing this to the intensifying bombardments.</p>

<p>"It is not panic that makes you give birth," Baaklini said, as machines monitoring the premature babies beeped in the background. "It is the act of running, falling, and experiencing trauma to the abdomen that triggers contractions, leading to premature delivery."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX successfully "caught" the first-stage booster of its Starship megarocket Sunday as it returned to the launch pad after a test flight, a world first in the company's quest for rapid reusability.</p>

<p>The "super heavy booster" had blasted off attached to the Starship rocket minutes earlier, then made a picture-perfect controlled return to the same pad in Texas, where a pair of huge mechanical "chopsticks" reached out from the launch tower to bring the slowly descending booster to a halt, according to a livestream from Elon Musk's SpaceX company.</p>

<p>"Folks, this is a day for the engineering history books," a SpaceX spokesperson said in a voiceover on the company's livestream, after the booster was safely in the tower's grasp and company staffers had erupted in cheers.</p>

<p>"The tower has caught the rocket!!" SpaceX founder Musk posted on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Booster starts in top right corner. Watch to the end. Sound on <a href="https://t.co/jS70tHLNcr">pic.twitter.com/jS70tHLNcr</a></p>
— ?????? ???? ? (@kimbal) <a href="https://twitter.com/kimbal/status/1845451222750306344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Liftoff occurred at 7:25 am (1225 GMT) in clear weather. While the booster returned to the launchpad, the upper stage of Starship was due to splash down in the Indian Ocean within the hour.</p>

<p>During its last flight in June, SpaceX achieved its first successful splashdown with Starship, a prototype spaceship that Musk hopes will one day carry humans to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA is also keenly awaiting a modified version of Starship to act as a lander vehicle for crewed flights to the Moon under the Artemis program later this decade.</p>

<p>SpaceX said its engineers have "spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success."</p>

<p>Teams were monitoring to ensure "thousands" of criteria were met both on the vehicle and at the tower before any attempt to return the Super Heavy booster.</p>

<p>Had the conditions not been satisfied, the booster would have been redirected for a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, as in previous tests.</p>

<p>Instead, having been given the green light, the returning booster decelerated from supersonic speeds and the powerful "chopstick arms" embraced it.</p>

<p>'Fail fast, learn fast'</p>

<p>The large mechanical arms, called "Mechazilla" by Musk, have generated considerable excitement among space enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>Its Super Heavy booster, which is 233 feet tall, produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" strategy of rapid iterative testing, even when its rockets blow up spectacularly, has ultimately accelerated development and contributed to the company's success.</p>

<p>Founded only in 2002, it quickly leapfrogged aerospace industry giants and is now the world leader in orbital launches, besides providing the only US spaceship currently certified to carry astronauts.</p>

<p>It has also created the world's biggest internet satellite constellation -- invaluable in disaster and war zones.</p>

<p>But its founding vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by Musk's embrace of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his alignment with right-wing politics.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the company has openly sparred with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch licensing and alleged violations, with Musk accusing the agency of overreach and calling for its chief, Michael Whitaker, to resign.</p>

<p>"He's trying to position himself for minimal regulatory interference with SpaceX once Donald Trump becomes president," said Mark Hass, a marketing expert and professor at Arizona State University. "But it's a calculated gamble if things go the other way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When Pisciotta told West she had no memory of that studio session, West allegedly laughed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kanye West's former assistant has filed a lawsuit, accusing him of drugging and sexually assaulting her during a studio session he co-hosted with Sean "Diddy" Combs. Lauren Pisciotta, who was employed by West from 2021 to 2022, claims in an amended complaint obtained by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/lawsuit-accuses-kanye-west-of-drugging-and-sexually-assaulting-ex-assistant-8727602" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>PEOPLE </em></a>that West committed "sexual battery" after giving her a drink that was laced with a substance.</p>

<p>Pisciotta's allegations are an extension of her earlier wrongful termination lawsuit against West, in which she alleged she was subjected to explicit messages, pornographic images, videos, and phone calls from him before she was fired. She began working with West in July 2021 to assist with his Yeezy women's fashion line and collaborate on his 2021 album, Donda.</p>

<p>Previously, a legal representative for West denied Pisciotta's other claims and stated that "Ye will be filing a lawsuit against Ms. Pisciotta."</p>

<p>According to the now-amended complaint filed on Oct. 8 in Los Angeles County Court, Pisciotta alleges that before her employment with West, he invited her to a studio session in Santa Monica, Calif., where "drinks were served to others in attendance, followed by an announcement that everyone had to drink if they wanted to stay."</p>

<p>The lawsuit claims that West and Combs co-hosted the studio session, and Pisciotta attended with a "former artist management client." Although Combs is named in the amended complaint as a co-host, Pisciotta is not accusing him of any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The filing further alleges that the drink served to Pisciotta-allegedly by a studio assistant at West's request- was "laced with an unidentifiable drug," causing her to feel disoriented after just "a few small sips."</p>

<p>"As plaintiff began to slip into an altered and heavily impaired state, she felt less in control of her body and speech, and that is where plaintiff's memories of that night escape her," the complaint reads.</p>

<p>According to the filing, Pisciotta woke up the next day "feeling physically ill and confused" and experienced "immense shame and embarrassment" for not being able to recall what happened after drinking at the studio session.</p>

<p>For years, West's former assistant believed she had been drugged and humiliated herself at a work event. Later on, after West hired Pisciotta as an assistant, Chief of Staff, and A&amp;R representative, he allegedly brought up that night for the first time. During the conversation, West told Pisciotta that they had "kind of hooked up a little one time," referring to the night at the Santa Monica studio where the alleged assault occurred.</p>

<p>When Pisciotta told West she had no memory of that studio session, West allegedly laughed and remarked, "Women love to say they don't remember," according to the complaint.</p>

<p>"Up until that very moment, right before that very conversation, Plaintiff was unaware that she had been subjected to gender violence and sexual battery on that studio night by KANYE WEST a.k.a YE," the document states.</p>

<p>The amended complaint also states that Pisciotta felt "overcome with immense shame, discomfort, and utter disgust."</p>

<p>Additionally, Pisciotta alleges that in July 2021, during an "album workshop" at the St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco, West "aggressively pounded" on her hotel room door at 6 a.m., forced his way into her room, and claimed he needed to use her shower because his was out of order. She further alleges that West later approached her, "dropped his towel," and attempted to "forcefully thrust his naked body onto and penis into Plaintiff's face," ignoring her pleas to stop. According to the complaint, West then "swiftly left" after saying "sorry" and continued his day as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The complaint also claims that Pisciotta, who alleges she received lewd messages from West and was fired from her Chief of Staff position at his companies just a month after her promotion in September 2022, "could not stomach the fact that she worked for the man who had sexually assaulted her while she was drugged, who then successfully lured her back into his orbit through a job opportunity to repeat the assault."</p>

<p>West is also facing a separate lawsuit filed in April 2024 by a former employee who claimed to have suffered "severe discrimination [and] harassment" while working for Yeezy and at his Donda Academy school. Additionally, a former staffer recently filed a lawsuit alleging emotional distress, retaliation, and labour code violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's top diplomat vowed Sunday there would be "no red lines" for the country in defending its people and interests, ahead of Israel's expected retaliation for Iran's recent missile attack.</p>

<p>"While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>Iran fired 200 missiles at Israel on October 1 in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned operator leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has vowed Israel's response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".</p>

<p>Araghchi was in Baghdad to discuss the wars in Gaza and Lebanon with Iraqi officials, according to the ministry.</p>

<p>Ali al-Moussawi, political advisor to the Iraqi prime minister, told AFP Araghchi's visit was part of a diplomatic effort "to silence weapons and violence... to establish security and stability in the region".</p>

<p>After Baghdad, Araghchi will head to Oman, the Iranian ISNA news agency reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Araghchi was in Qatar where he met Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Qatar has been mediating talks aimed at a Gaza ceasefire and has called for a truce in Lebanon.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Araghchi met Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Araghchi said Iran does "not want war" but it was "not afraid of it."</p>

<p>"We will be ready for any scenario," he told Al Jazeera news network.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tim Walz, who once held a top rating from the National Rifle Association during his 12 years in Congress, has since shifted towards supporting stricter gun control measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, Walz held more conservative stances, earning “A” ratings from the National Rifle Association (NRA) while representing a rural Minnesota district from 2007 to 2019. However, after mass shootings like the 2017 Las Vegas tragedy, Walz distanced himself from the NRA, donating his NRA contributions to veterans' charities and advocating for stronger gun control measures.</p>

<p>As Minnesota's governor, he has supported universal background checks, red-flag laws, and an assault weapons ban, prioritising public safety over gun lobby positions. This has earned him criticism from the NRA, which labelled him a “political chameleon” for altering his stance as his political ambitions grew. However, groups like Everytown for Gun Safety praise Walz for balancing responsible gun ownership with common-sense safety laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese premier Li Qiang could inaugurate operations at a Chinese-funded airport in Pakistan's Balochistan province during his visit to the country in the coming week, information minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters on Sunday.</p>

<p>The start of operations at the $200-million Gwadar International Airport has been pushed back for a security review after deadly attacks by separatist militants in August in the area, government and aviation sources said.</p>

<p>Li, along with ministers and government officials will visit Pakistan from Oct. 14 to 17, Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Pakistan is hosting the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which comprises nine full members, including China, India, Iran and Russia, and is scheduled for Oct. 15 and 16 in Islamabad.</p>

<p>The new airport will handle domestic and international flights, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, and will be one of the country's biggest airports.</p>

<p>The initial plan was for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to inaugurate the airport on Aug. 14 alongside Chinese officials, but that was called off after an ethnic Baloch rights group started a sit-in protest, the officials said.</p>

<p>A decades-long insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region to press demands for a share in mineral-rich regional resources.</p>

<p>Two Chinese nationals were killed in an explosion near the international airport of the southern Pakistani city of Karachi last week, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan said.</p>

<p>Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said had targeted Chinese nationals, including engineers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>China said on Thursday it would work with Pakistan to protect the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Besides the separatists, the region is also home to Islamist militants, who have been active again since 2022 after revoking a ceasefire with the government.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Sunday its troops in Lebanon had captured a Hezbollah operator, the first such announcement since it launched a cross-border ground offensive.</p>

<p>"During limited, localised and targeted raids based on precise intelligence... soldiers discovered an underground tunnel shaft," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The troops encircled the building, scanned the tunnel shaft, and discovered an underground compound... where a Hezbollah terrorist was embedded alongside weapons and equipment."</p>

<p>The military did not specify when he was captured, while Hezbollah did not offer an immediate comment.</p>

<p>The army said that the fighter surrendered to its soldiers, who "interrogated him on-site and then transferred him to a detention facility for further questioning within Israel".</p>

<p>In a video clip released with the statement, a group of Israeli soldiers can be seen speaking in Arabic with the Hezbollah fighter as he slowly emerges from the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Come out before your life is over," the Israeli soldiers are heard calling to the Hezbollah fighter.</p>

<p>The fighter then asks the soldiers if they want a cigarette, to which one of the soldiers replies: "Cigarettes, coffee and $5,000."</p>

<p>The Israeli army launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon on September 30, carrying out "targeted raids" in the villages along the border.</p>

<p>The army says it has detected multiple tunnel shafts under homes, including one it said was about 25 meters long and crossed into Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines has confirmed two more mpox virus infections of the milder clade 2 variety, its health ministry said Monday, bringing the number of active cases to three.</p>

<p>"We continue to see local transmission of mpox clade II here in the Philippines, in Metro Manila in particular," Health Minister Teodoro Herbosa said in a statement.</p>

<p>The newly confirmed cases were a 37-year-old male in Metro Manila who had rash on his body last week and was brought to a government hospital, and a 32-year-old male from the capital who had skin lesions on his body.</p>

<p>The Philippines announced last week it had detected a case of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-is-mpox-how-it-spreads-critical-symptoms-and-more-6409144" target="_blank">mpox</a> virus' milder variant in a 33-year-old male who had no travel history outside the Philippines.</p>

<p>The three cases this year means the Philippines has had 12 laboratory-confirmed case since July 2022.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization earlier this month declared mpox a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-declares-mpox-global-health-emergency-for-second-time-in-2-years-6339042" target="_blank">global public health emergency</a>, its highest form of alert, for the second time in two years, because of an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>A new form of the virus has triggered global concern as it seems to spread easily though routine close contact.</p>

<p>The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, with children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 102-year-old woman in Britain opted for a unique birthday celebration this year. On August 25, Manette Baillie, who was once married to a paratrooper and served in the Women's Royal Naval Service during World War II, skydived out of a plane to become the oldest woman to do so.</p>

<p>Ms Baillie jumped with UK Parachuting Services Ltd as part of a charity event, raising money for Benhall's village hall, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, and the East Anglian Air Ambulance, which once saved her son's life on the Isle of Wight after a diving accident in 1969. Her efforts have so far raised over £10,000 of her £30,000&nbsp;target, inspiring others to give back.</p>

<p>Soon after her jump from 7,000 feet above Beccles Airfield in East Anglia, Ms Baillie told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cvg3k02wlemo">BBC</a> radio that she was "breathless".</p>

<p>"It was a bit scary. I must admit I shut my eyes very firmly," she added.</p>

<p>On healthy ageing, she explained, "I just want other people who are getting towards 80 and 90 not to give up anything. Just keep going. I've been so lucky to be fit and well that I've got to do something with it, that's really the back of it," she said. I can't just waste it, other people are crippled with arthritis, and I'm not."</p>

<p>This wasn't the first time the former war veteran had sought an adrenaline rush. For her 100th birthday, she drove around Silverstone in a Ferrari at 130mph, setting another record. Speaking to Radio 4, she affirmed her fearless nature, saying, "I really don't do fear. It's no good. It's 130 miles per hour, to begin with, before they pull the rip cords for the parachute, and then it's gently floating down."</p>

<p>Ms Baillie was motivated to take on a skydiving challenge after a friend's 85-year-old father pulled off something similar. "If an 85-year-old man can do it, so can I," she remarked.</p>

<p>Prince William also commended Ms Baillie for her daring spirit, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/25/manette-baillie-britain-oldest-skydiver-suffolk">The Guardian</a> reported. In a heartfelt note, the Prince wrote, "Catherine and I hear you'll be marking your 102nd birthday with a parachute jump! Given your history of racing a Ferrari at 100, we're not surprised!"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have been in the United States for over four years, but looks like the Duke of Sussex is still struggling to make it his new home. He's said to have turned into "an angry boy" in America and "desperately" misses the United Kingdom, say his friends.</p>

<p>For Prince Harry, who turns 40 on September 15, things haven't "turned out how he wanted," says his close friend, who claimed he was one of the few people still receiving the "the odd WhatsApp" message from him, The <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-sunday-times-magazine/article/prince-harry-age-40-birthday-tqt9d2rdx">Sunday Times</a> reported.</p>

<p>"He's an angry boy. Things haven't turned out how he wanted. I think he misses being over here (in Britain) desperately and wants to be admired more. Anyone who knows him feels he'd rather be top of the pops here with everyone loving him, as they do with (Price) William and Kate," one of Harry's oldest friends told the publication.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan's friend circle began to rapidly shrink after they moved to the US in a bid to start anew.</p>

<p>Since then, the duo has been part of several projects, including their six-part documentary for Netflix, the bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey as well as Harry's memoir <em>Spare.</em></p>

<p>After leaving the UK, they have only returned a few times.</p>

<p>Another close friend of Harry told the news outlet that many were still unable to forgive him over his decision to air the family laundry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I can't believe he'd stoop so low. It's outrageously disloyal. Oprah, Netflix and then the book? Three strikes and you're out," the person said.</p>

<p>A friend of Harry and Meghan said the couple could have left the Royal Family with "dignity and decency and not trashed the institution."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The conclusion is they've made money from trashing his family," the person noted.</p>

<p>More people close to him have claimed that he was at a crossroads. "All he does is spend time looking back. If only he could wrench his neck around and look forward," one of his former advisers said.</p>

<p>In the Netflix series, released in December 2022, the 39-year-old talked in detail about moving to California with his family. "We are exactly where we are supposed to be," he said but added he missed the UK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A person, who has known him since his teenage years, said Harry has "ended up isolated from his family and most of his old mates" and is currently in an environment "where your friendships are not like the ones you forged as a young man."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ballistic missile launchers that North Korea has said it <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-deploys-250-ballistic-missiles-on-southern-border-6265937">plans to deploy</a> on the border with South Korea are believed to have a range of 110 km (68 miles), allowing them to target Chungcheong Province south of Seoul, the Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>North Korean state media reported earlier this month that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the delivery of 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers described as modern tactical weapons personally designed by Kim to be transferred to the border.</p>

<p>Experts have said Pyongyang could use them to attack or threaten Seoul.</p>

<p>South Korean intelligence officials, however, are sceptical over whether North Korea can supply enough missiles for the 250 missile launchers while it also supplies weapons to Russia as part of bilateral military cooperation, Yonhap reported on Monday, citing lawmakers on the intelligence committee.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia have been accused of conducting <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/key-points-of-north-koreas-landmark-strategic-partnership-treaty-with-russia-5930166">arms trade</a> by Seoul and Washington to help replenish Russia's stock of missiles and artillery for its war with Ukraine.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">As the globe faces a rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria – making traditional antibiotics ineffective – specific viruses could offer a solution.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Viruses called bacteriophages, or phages, target bacteria but can't infect humans or other higher organisms. Phages inject their DNA into the bacterial cell, multiply to large numbers using the resources of the host, and then burst out to infect more bacteria in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Essentially, they are a naturally occurring, self-replicating and specific antibiotic. Discovered more than 100 years ago, their use against bacteria was largely sidelined in favour of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Our new research looked at one particular protein used by phages to bypass the natural defences of bacteria. We found this protein has an essential control function by binding to DNA and RNA.</p>

<p>This increased understanding is an important step towards using phages against bacterial pathogens in human health or agriculture.</p>

<h3><strong>Bacterial defence systems</strong></h3>

<p>There are hurdles to using phages to target bacteria. Much like our bodies have immune mechanisms to fight off viruses, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance">bacteria </a>have also evolved defences against phage infections.</p>

<p>One such defence is “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”, or <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr">CRISPR</a>, now better known for its applications in medicine and biotechnology. CRISPR systems in general act as “molecular scissors” by cutting DNA into pieces, be it in a lab-based setting or, in nature, inside a bacterium to destroy a phage.</p>

<p>Imagine wanting to use a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109452/">phage </a>against an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. The only thing standing in the way of that phage killing the bacteria and eradicating the infection might be the bacterium's CRISPR defence which renders the phages useless as an antimicrobial.</p>

<p>That's where knowing as much as possible about phage counter-defences becomes important. We are investigating so-called anti-CRISPRs: proteins or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06612-5">other molecules</a> that phages use to inhibit CRISPR.</p>

<p>A bacterium that has CRISPR might be able to stop a phage from infecting. But if the phage has the right anti-CRISPR, it can neutralise this defence and kill the bacterium regardless.</p>

<h3><strong>The importance of anti-CRISPRs</strong></h3>

<p>Our <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07644-1">recent research</a> focused on how an anti-CRISPR response is controlled.</p>

<p>When faced with a powerful CRISPR defence, phages want to automatically produce large amounts of anti-CRISPR to increase the chance of inhibiting CRISPR immunity. But excessive production of anti-CRISPR prevents the replication of the phage and is ultimately toxic. This is why control is important. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this control, phages have another protein in their toolbox: an anti-CRISPR-associated (or Aca) protein that frequently occurs alongside the anti-CRISPRs themselves.</p>

<p>Aca proteins act as regulators of the phage's counter-defence. They make sure the initial burst of anti-CRISPR production that inactivates CRISPR is then rapidly dampened to low levels. That way, the phage can allocate energy to where it is most needed: its replication and, eventually, release from the cell.</p>

<p>We found this regulation occurs at multiple levels. For any protein to be produced, the gene sequence in the DNA first needs to be transcribed into a messenger–RNA. This is then decoded, or translated, into a protein.</p>

<p>Many regulatory proteins function by inhibiting the first step (transcription into messenger-RNA), some others inhibit the second (translation into protein). Either way, the regulator often acts as a “road block” of sorts, binding to DNA or RNA.</p>

<p>Intriguingly and unexpectedly, the Aca protein we investigated does both – even though its structure would suggest it is merely a transcriptional regulator (a protein that regulates the conversion of DNA to RNA), very similar to ones that have been investigated for decades.</p>

<p>We also examined why this extra-tight control at two levels is necessary. Again, it seems to be all about the dosage of the anti-CRISPRs, especially as the phage replicates its DNA in the bacterial cell. This replication will invariably lead to the production of messenger-RNAs even in the presence of transcriptional control.</p>

<p>Therefore, it appears additional regulation is required to reign in anti-CRISPR production. This comes back to the toxicity of excessive production of this counter-defence protein, to the harm done when there's “too much of a good thing”.</p>

<h3><strong>Fine-tuned control</strong></h3>

<p>What does this research mean in the grand scheme of things? We now know a lot more about how anti-CRISPR deployment occurs. It requires fine-tuned control to enable the phage to be successful in its battle against the host bacterium.</p>

<p>This is important out in nature, but also when it comes to using phages as alternative antimicrobials.</p>

<p>Knowing every detail about something as obscure-sounding as anti-CRISPR-associated proteins might make all the difference between the phage succeeding or succumbing —and between life or death, not just for the phage, but also for a person infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tragedy struck in Manhattan on Saturday when a wrong-way crash claimed the life of Kirk Walker, a 38-year-old groom-to-be, just one day before his wedding. According to the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/25/us-news/kirk-walker-man-killed-in-nyc-wrong-way-crash-killed-the-day-before-his-wedding/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post</a></em>, Mr Walker and his cousin, Rob McLaurin, 40, were celebrating his bachelor party when their car was hit head-on by a pickup truck travelling in the wrong direction. Both men were transported to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital where they were pronounced dead. According to authorities, the driver responsible for the wrong-way crash fled the scene on foot and has not yet been caught. Meanwhile, a passenger in the vehicle was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment of their injuries.</p>

<p>Mr Walker, a father of three, was eagerly anticipating his special day, but his heartbroken bride was instead left to face unimaginable grief on what should have been the happiest day of her life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''I'm supposed to be in my wedding dress right now — not in mourning. I feel like this is a TV show and I'm going to wake up any minute and go back to my real life. Every hour since it happened, I'm having a different emotion take me over'', his fiancee Shauntea Weaver&nbsp;told<em> The Post.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Notably, the couple was set to tie the knot in a huge ceremony at the Royal Manor wedding venue in Garfield, New Jersey.</p>

<p>''Our ceremony was supposed to be at 5:00 p.m. today — in a few hours. He died 24 hours before our wedding. It's devastating, and not just for me. He has three children who loved him immeasurably. They are heartbroken that their father's been taken. He was such a generous, hard-working man. He had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody. Such a hard worker,'' Ms Weaver added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple had built a thriving car rental business together, which had flourished under Mr Walker's dedication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Weaver's focus has now shifted to seeking justice for her fiance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''They told me the driver left his DNA on the airbags. So they have that. Also, the passenger is in the hospital with broken legs and he needs to speak up. Two lives were lost in a reckless car crash,” she continued. They need to pay for killing two innocent people. Nothing will bring him back. But we are seeking justice,'' she said.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Lenovo computer salesman has found himself in a swirl of trouble, fired from his job after he says a bladder condition forced him to relieve himself in a lobby of his Times Square hotel.</p>

<p>Richard Becker, 66, is seeking at least $1.5 million from the American subsidiary of the Chinese computer giant after being dismissed for the wrongful wee, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in New York State Supreme Court and seen by AFP.</p>

<p>He accused the company of "discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of New York State and New York City human rights laws."</p>

<p>According to the suit, Becker was returning to his hotel near New York's Times Square after a work dinner in February when he found himself "overwhelmed" and forced to answer nature's call in a vestibule located on a separate floor from the main lobby.</p>

<p>"A coworker noticed Becker urinating, and -- out of apparent spite and malice -- promptly reported him to HR, even though Becker's conduct caused no harm to anyone whatsoever," the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>Becker said he has been dealing with a chronic bladder condition since 2016 and is under the treatment of a urologist. The court filing said Lenovo colleagues and managers were aware of his condition.</p>

<p>"No sympathy, let alone compliance with the law, would be forthcoming from Lenovo. Instead, within days, Becker was terminated by his employer, following a sham HR 'investigation' in which he was not even interviewed," the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>The Long Island man has been unemployed since.</p>

<p>Lenovo did not immediately respond to an after-hours request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prince Harry has found a new mentor and "father figure" in Canadian music icon David Foster, according to sources close to the pair, The Times reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry has found a new mentor and "father figure" in Canadian music icon David Foster, according to sources close to the pair, The Times reported. The 74-year-old music producer has become a close friend and confidant to the Duke of Sussex during his time in the US, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-sunday-times-magazine/article/prince-harry-age-40-birthday-tqt9d2rdx ">the report</a>.</p>

<p>Foster, who lives near Harry and Meghan Markle in Montecito, California, has apparently filled a void left by Prince Harry's strained relationships with his own family, particularly King Charles. Katharine McPhee, Foster's wife, described the bond between Harry and her husband as "like father and son".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How they became friends</strong></p>

<p>Meghan Markle attended the same Catholic middle school in Los Angeles as Foster's wife, Katharine McPhee. Although they weren't close friends at school, they reconnected in London when McPhee was starring in the musical Waitress on the West End. It was then that David Foster and Prince Harry hit it off.</p>

<p>Foster and McPhee helped the Sussexes find a place to stay in Canada after they left the UK in 2020. The 16-time Grammy winner helped the couple find a $14.1 million rental home in Victoria, British Columbia, while they looked for a permanent residence in California.</p>

<p>Foster told the Daily Mail back in 2020 that he was honoured to help the ex-royal couple, citing his Canadian roots and the commonwealth connection. "I was just happy through my friend to facilitate what I could for them, and it looked like they had a great rest," he said. "They are a young modern family. I'm sure they want to balance their commitment to the crown and be a 2020 family."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since then, Harry and Foster have been close friends. McPhee said, "My husband has a really, really beautiful relationship with Harry. They're so cute."</p>

<p>In October 2020, the Sussexes moved to Santa Barbara, and the two couples have been inseparable ever since. They were spotted <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/inside-harry-meghans-friendship-with-katharine-mcphee-david-foster/">enjoying a double date</a> at Lucky's Steakhouse in Montecito, where Katharine McPhee, then pregnant with her son Rennie, chatted with Meghan Markle about purchasing a home in the area.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least seven explosions rang out on Monday morning over the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, AFP journalists heard, amid a nationwide alert warning against Russian aerial attacks.</p>

<p>As Russia's invasion of Ukraine stretches into its third year, Russia launched another series of attacks on Monday morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The governors of the southern regions of Odesa and Zaporizhzhia, as well as the governor of the northern region of Kharkiv, said on Telegram there had been explosions in their regions and urged people to take shelter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"An apartment building was damaged as a result of an enemy attack in Lutsk," the mayor of the central city Igor Polishchuk also said, adding one person had died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, an attack on an industrial facility in the central region of Poltava wounded five people, governor Filip Pronin said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukraine's energy operator DTEK announced some emergency power outages.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov has founded wildly popular social networks as well as a cryptocurrency, amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune and locked horns with authorities not just in Russia but around the world.</p>

<p>Still a few months shy of his 40th birthday, the man once dubbed the "Russian Zuckerberg" after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg now finds himself under arrest in France after being sensationally detained at a Paris airport this weekend.</p>

<p>While still in his 20s, the Saint Petersburg native shot to fame in Russia after founding the VKontakte (VK) social network which catered to the needs of Russian-language users and outgunned Facebook throughout the former USSR.</p>

<p>After disputes with the Russian authorities and ownership battles, he sold out of VKontakte and founded a new messaging service called Telegram which rapidly gained traction but has also proved controversial with critics condemning an alleged lack of control on extreme content.</p>

<p>As these dramas raged, Durov remained a mercurial and at times mysterious figure, rarely giving interviews and restricting himself to sometimes enigmatic declarations made on Telegram.</p>

<p>A self-avowed libertarian, Durov has championed confidentiality on the Internet and encryption in messaging.</p>

<p>He has defiantly refused to allow the moderation of messages on Telegram, which allows users to post videos, pictures and comments on "channels" that can be followed by anyone.</p>

<p>Durov, 39, was targeted in France by a warrant over offences alleged to have been conducted on Telegram, ranging from fraud to drug trafficking, cyberbullying and organised crime, including promoting terrorism and fraud.</p>

<p>Investigations have been entrusted to the cyber unit of the French gendarmerie and the national anti-fraud office. He was still in police custody on Sunday, according to two sources close to the case.</p>

<h3><strong>'Thanks for all the fish'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In 2006, having just graduated from the University of Saint Petersburg, Durov launched VKontakte (VK), attracting users even while its founder remained a shadowy figure.</p>

<p>In a stunt typical of his unpredictable behaviour, Durov in 2012 showered high-denomination notes on pedestrians from VK's headquarters on top of a historic bookstore on Saint Petersburg's Nevsky Prospekt.</p>

<p>But after running into trouble with the Kremlin for refusing to hand over the personal data of users to the Russian security services (FSB), he sold out of the company and left Russia in 2014.</p>

<p>Durov resigned from VK with a typical flourish, posting a picture of dolphins and the slogan "So Long and Thanks for All the Fish", a title in the famous "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" science fiction series.</p>

<p>He developed the Telegram messaging service with his brother Nikolai while travelling from country to country and launched the service in 2013.</p>

<p>He settled in Dubai and obtained citizenship of the Caribbean island archipelago of Saint Kitts and Nevis, then, in August 2021, won French nationality following a low-profile procedure about which Paris remains highly discreet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Telegram enjoyed stratospheric success, presenting itself as a champion of individual freedoms, refusing "censorship" and protecting the confidentiality of its users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This rankled with authorities, especially in his home country and in 2018, a Moscow court ordered the blocking of the application. But the imposition of the measure was shambolic and three days later, protesters ironically bombarded the FSB headquarters with paper planes, the symbol of Telegram.</p>

<p>Since then, Russia has abandoned its efforts to block Telegram and the messaging service is used by both the Russian government and the opposition, with some channels boasting several hundred thousand subscribers.</p>

<p>Telegram also plays a key role in Russia's war against Ukraine, documented by bloggers from both sides who post their analyses and videos of the fighting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pro-Moscow channels run by so-called "Z-bloggers" who back the war have proved hugely influential and are sometimes critical of Russian military strategy.</p>

<h3><strong>'Love the privacy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Durov eschews traditional media interviews but in April sat down with ultra-conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson for an extensive discussion.</p>

<p>People "love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram," Durov told Carlson.</p>

<p>He is also not shy of posting messages on his own Telegram channel, claiming to lead a solitary life, abstaining from meat, alcohol and even coffee. Always dressed in black, he cultivates a resemblance to the actor Keanu Reeves in the film "Matrix".</p>

<p>In July, he boasted of being the biological father of more than 100 children thanks to his sperm donations in a dozen countries, describing this as a "civic duty" in an attitude to parenting that echoes that of a fellow tech mogul, the X and Tesla chief Elon Musk.</p>

<p>According to Forbes magazine's latest estimate, Durov's fortune is $15.5 billion. But toncoin, the cryptocurrency he created, has plummeted by more than 15 per cent since the announcement of his arrest.</p>

<p>Telegram has long been in the sights of European judicial authorities over allegations it spreads conspiracy theories, shared calls for murder and hosts drug sales platforms. Durov, however, insists that he responds to every request to remove content calling for violence or murder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sound of explosions rang out in central Kyiv on Monday morning during rush hour as Ukraine's military warned of a massive Russian missile and drone attack following waves of drone attacks in the early hours.</p>

<p>The air force told Ukrainians Russia had 11 TU-95 strategic bombers in the air and confirmed the launch of a number of missiles. Outside the Ukrainian capital, Reuters reporters heard the sound of air defences engaging targets.</p>

<p>Local authorities reported explosions in the northwestern city of Lutsk and said that an apartment block had been damaged and that they were verifying possible casualties.</p>

<p>The Operational Command of the Polish armed forces said on X that Polish and allied aircraft had been activated after Russia launched the attack which also targeted regions in Ukraine's west and near the Polish border.</p>

<p>Ukrainians have been expecting a major Russian missile attack for some time. The US embassy issued a warning last week of an elevated risk of attack around Ukrainian Independence Day, which Ukraine marked on Saturday.</p>

<p>Ukraine has itself stepped up its long-range drone attacks on Russia to try hit back at Moscow, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>"The desire to destroy our energy will cost the Russians dearly: their infrastructure," Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff, said on Telegram, apparently vowing retaliation.</p>

<p>Russia launched two waves of drone attacks earlier on Monday, Ukraine's military said, with initial information showing no damage or casualties.</p>

<p>Up to 10 drones were destroyed on their approach to the city in the region around Kyiv at about 0230 GMT, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Russia. Both Russia and Ukraine deny targeting civilians. Each says its attacks are aimed at destroying infrastructure key to the other's war effort.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Bangladeshi diplomats serving in India were dismissed from their duties following an order from the interim government of Bangladesh. Shaban Mahmud, serving as First Secretary (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi was asked to resign before the end of his contract. Similarly, Ranjan Sen, serving in the same capacity at the Bangladeshi consulate in Kolkata, was also dismissed from his duties.</p>

<p>The interim government of Bangladesh, headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, was established amid a volatile political landscape that saw mass protests and violence resulting in the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On August 5, Ms Hasina, aged 76, fled Bangladesh by helicopter to India as protesters overran the streets of Dhaka. Her 15-year rule, marked by allegations of human rights abuses, came to a dramatic end. The weeks leading up to her ousting were bloody, with more than 450 dying during the unrest.</p>

<p>Despite Ms Hasina's escape to India, Mr Yunus has maintained that his government would continue to foster friendly relations with everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will maintain friendly relations with all countries," he said in a televised address yesterday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his message to the international community earlier this month, Mr Yunus called for continued support in rebuilding Bangladesh and transitioning to a fully functional democracy. He assured the diplomats that Bangladesh would maintain its role as a proponent of multilateralism, with the United Nations at the core of its foreign policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunmen shot and killed at least 22 people in southwest Pakistan on Monday, after forcing them out of vehicles and checking their ethnicity, government officials said.</p>

<p>The attack happened early Monday in the district of Musakhail in impoverished Balochistan province, where security forces are battling sectarian, ethnic and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-militancy-in-balochistan-a-shared-iran-pakistan-problem-4886070" target="_blank">separatist violence</a>.</p>

<p>"At least 22 people were killed and 5 injured when operatives stopped several busses, trucks and vans on a highway connecting Punjab with Balochistan," Najibullah Kakar, a senior official in Musakhail, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Vehicles traveling to and from Punjab were inspected, and individuals from Punjab were identified and shot," he added.</p>

<p>He said 19 Punjabis and 3 Baloch were killed, mostly Punjabi labourers.</p>

<p>Hameed Zehri, another senior official in the district, confirmed the death count to AFP.</p>

<p>"It seems that the BLA (Baloch Liberation Army) terrorists are behind the incident," he said.</p>

<p>The Baloch Liberation Army is the most active operatives separatist group in the region.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump said that he would like to keep Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his cabinet if he's elected as President.</p>

<p>In an interview with Shawn Ryan, which is yet to be broadcasted, the host of US-based 'The Shawn Ryan Show', Trump said that he would keep Musk in his cabinet but doubted if Musk could do it with so many things already on his plate.</p>

<p>Ryan asked Trump if keeping Musk in the cabinet would require him to do something with artificial intelligence.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Trump had some great things to say about Elon. Would you like to see <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@elonmusk</a> in Trump's cabinet if he's elected as President?<br />

— Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyan762) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyan762/status/1827719384674038209?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />
"He wants to be involved now. Look, he's running big businesses and all that, so he can't really. I don't think he'd be [able to handle the work of cabinet]. I'd put him in the cabinet, absolutely. But I don't know how he could do that with all the things he's got going," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump said that Musk can consult with the country and produce ideas, especially on AI.</p>

<p>"But he can sort of, as the expression goes, consult with the country and give you some very good ideas, like on AI. There's nobody knows more about it than Elon. It's a big thing," he said.</p>

<p>Trump said that if the US doesn't focus on building AI, somebody else--most likely China--will do it.</p>

<p>"It's very important for the country. If we don't do it, China is going to do it or somebody else. But most likely China. And China is working right now to develop a massive flood of electricity. And we don't, because we have people that are not even thinking about that," he said.</p>

<p>Trump said that Musk is an 'unusual character'. He said that Musk was a genius and we must cherish him.</p>

<p>"We have a great relationship. He's [Musk is] great. He is a totally unusual character. He's great, and he's smart, and we have to cherish our geniuses. You know, we don't have too many of them. He is a brilliant guy, and what he really would like to do is get involved in cutting some of the fat. And he does know how to do it, and he loves the country. You know, it's just an amazing thing."</p>

<p>Trump said that if this election doesn't go the right way, the country will be doomed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Encrypted messaging app Telegram on Monday said that its CEO Pavel Durov — who was arrested in France — has nothing to hide and “it is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.”</p>

<p>In its first reaction after Russian-born Durov was arrested at the Le Bourget airport outside Paris after landing via a private jet for allegedly failing to prevent criminal activities on Telegram, the company said it abides by the EU laws, including the ‘Digital Services Act'.</p>

<p>“Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe. Almost a billion users globally use Telegram as a means of communication and as a source of vital information. We're awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation,” said the platform which has more than 900 million active users.</p>

<p>“Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act — its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving,” the company added.</p>

<p>The platform has been a critical source of information for the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. In a rare interview with US political commentator Tucker Carlson in April, Durov said Telegram's goal is to be a “neutral” platform and resist requests from governments to moderate.</p>

<p>If convicted, Durov faces up to 20 years in prison. According to multiple reports, he was arrested on several charges which involved alleged spread of criminal activity on Telegram which has about 900 million active users.</p>

<p>The billionaire lives in Dubai, where Telegram is based, and holds dual citizenship of France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). An entrepreneur with at least $15.5 billion in his kitty, he left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to ban opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform.</p>

<p>Russia's embassy in France is taking "immediate steps" to clarify the situation. Telegram offers end-to-end encrypted messaging and users can also set up "channels" to disseminate information quickly to followers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has unveiled a new "suicide drone", state media said Monday, with leader Kim Jong Un overseeing a performance test of the weapons, which experts said could have come from Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wearing a cream baker boy hat, Kim was shown beaming as he watched, aided by high-powered binoculars, as the drones blew up targets, images in state media showed.</p>

<p>Kim said that "it is necessary to develop and produce more suicide drones", the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, in addition to "strategic reconnaissance and multi-purpose attack drones".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suicide drones are explosive-carrying unmanned drones designed to be deliberately crashed into enemy targets, effectively acting as guided missiles.</p>

<p>The nuclear-armed North's growing drone fleet will "be used within different striking ranges to attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea", KCNA said.</p>

<p>All the drones North Korea tested on August 24 "correctly identified and destroyed the designated targets after flying along different preset routes", it added.</p>

<p>Kim also said his country would work towards "proactively introducing artificial intelligence technology into the development of drones".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some 60 media and rights organisations on Monday urged the European Union to suspend a cooperation accord with Israel and impose sanctions, accusing it of "massacring journalists" in Gaza.</p>

<p>"In response to the unprecedented number of journalists killed and other repeated press freedom violations by the Israeli authorities since the start of the war with Hamas, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and 59 other organisations are calling on the European Union to suspend its Association Agreement with Israel and to adopt targeted sanctions against those responsible", the groups said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>The call came ahead of a meeting by EU foreign ministers in Brussels on August 29.</p>

<p>The period following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel's devastating retaliatory assault on the Gaza Strip "has been the deadliest for journalists in decades", the letter said.</p>

<p>"More than 130 Palestinian journalists and media professionals have been killed by the Israeli armed forces in Gaza since 7 October. At least 30 of them were killed in the course of their work, three Lebanese journalists and an Israeli journalist have also been (killed) during the same period", it says.</p>

<p>"The targeted or indiscriminate killing of journalists, whether committed deliberately or recklessly, is a war crime", it said.</p>

<p>EU's association agreements with non-member countries are treaties that govern bilateral relations, including trade.</p>

<p>The agreement's Article 2 stipulates "respect for human rights and democratic principles", said Julie Majerczak, the head of RSF's Brussels office.</p>

<p>"The Israeli government is clearly trampling on this article. The EU, which is Israel's leading trade partner, must draw the necessary conclusions from this and must do everything to ensure that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government stops massacring journalists and respects the right to information and press freedom by opening media access to Gaza," she said.</p>

<p>Among the signatories were the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Human Rights Watch (HRW).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violent clashes erupted between students and Ansar members near the Secretariat in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka on Sunday night. The confrontation left several people from both sides injured, the Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>The clash broke out after 9 pm, with both sides engaging in a series of chases. During the turmoil, police intervened in an attempt to restore order.</p>

<p>Earlier, students from various dorms of Dhaka University began gathering at the Raju Memorial Sculpture to march to the Secretariat to confront Ansar members, whom they were calling "agents of autocracy," according to Dhaka Tribune.</p>

<p>This escalation followed reports that a group of Ansar members were detaining Nahid Islam, an adviser in the interim government and coordinator of the Students Against Discrimination movement, along with coordinators Sarjis Alam, Hasnat Abdullah, and others, at the Secretariat.</p>

<p>Student Protest Coordinator Hasnat Abdullah in a Facebook post blamed former director general of Ansar, Maj Gen AKM Aminul Haque, for a continued blockade of the Secretariat, even after the demands of protesting Ansar members were met. Hasnat also urged everyone to gather in front of the Raju Memorial Sculpture at Dhaka University, Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>AKM Aminul Haque is the elder brother of former deputy minister of water resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim.</p>

<p>Hasnat Abdullah on his Facebook wrote, "Everyone, come to Raju. The autocratic forces are trying to make a comeback through the Ansar force. Even after their demands were met, we were kept locked in the Secretariat."</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Ansar members ended their protest after receiving assurances from Lt Gen (Retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, the interim government's adviser for home affairs. The members had been demonstrating for two days, calling for the nationalization of their jobs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli Air Force (IAF) on Sunday conducted a series of precision strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, thwarting what Israeli officials described as a large-scale attack. The strikes, which began at 5 am local time, were part of a military campaign aimed at neutralising Hezbollah's growing threat along Israel's northern border.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a video showcasing the operation, stating, "Our operation in Lebanon targeted the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah planned to use against us, protecting Israeli families and homes."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">WATCH how the IAF acted precisely today to stop a large-scale terrorist attack from Hezbollah.<br />
<br />
Our operation in Lebanon targeted the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah planned to use against us, protecting Israeli families and homes. <a href="https://t.co/2J3sqAnFWB">pic.twitter.com/2J3sqAnFWB</a></p>
— Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1827765497695211850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing his cabinet later that day, warned that the military action was far from over. "We are striking Hezbollah with surprising, crushing blows," Netanyahu said. "This is another step towards changing the situation in the north and safely returning our residents to their homes. And, I repeat, this is not the final word."</p>

<p>Netanyahu highlighted the success of the operation, noting that the military had destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were intended to harm civilians and forces in the Galilee region of Israel. He also confirmed that the IDF had intercepted all the drones that Hezbollah launched at a strategic target in central Israel, which Israeli media reported to be the headquarters of its spy agency Mossad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over 100 Israeli warplanes participated in the preemptive assault, targeting thousands of Hezbollah missile launchers across southern Lebanon. The strikes were based on what Israeli officials described as "precise intelligence" indicating that Hezbollah was on the verge of launching a massive missile barrage at northern Israel, as well as drone attacks on key intelligence centres.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, Israel declared a 48-hour state of emergency and temporarily shut down its main airport, leading to the cancellation of several flights. Despite Hezbollah's retaliation, which involved firing over 300 projectiles into Israel, the damage was minimal. Israeli officials reported that one soldier was killed by falling debris, while three fatalities were reported in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the broader conflict in the region continued. Negotiations in Cairo, aimed at establishing a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, proceeded as planned. However, the talks faced challenges, with Hamas accusing Israel of setting new conditions and prolonging the cease-fire negotiations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More and more Londoners are purchasing homes further away from the capital in a bid to get a better bang for their buck.</p>

<p>The average person moving from the city bought a home a record 39 miles outside the city between January and June, according to a report from broker Hamptons International. That's six miles further than in 2019 and 65% more than the typical first-time buyer.</p>

<p>"Four years on from the pandemic and many city workers have settled into a new normal when it comes to going into the office," said Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons. "In a bid to make their equity stretch further, movers continue to make longer distance moves out of the capital."</p>

<p>UK households are facing a mix of cost pressures triggered by higher interest rates and a cost-of-living squeeze. While home loan rates are steadily declining from the 15-year high they reached in 2023, the number of UK mortgaged properties taken into possession rose 8% in the second quarter of this year.</p>

<p>Over 25% of households trading a London home for one outside the capital moved more than 100 miles away in the first half, significantly higher than the 17% average recorded between 2015 and 2019. On average, London leavers are moving 50% further than they were a decade ago, with high transaction costs reducing the number of shorter, more frequent moves, Hamptons said.</p>

<p>Gedling and North Somerset - two local authorities based in the Midlands and western England, respectively - have seen those looking to leave London more than double in the first half of 2024 compared with the same period last year. London leavers accounted for 48% of people buying a home outside the capital between January and June.</p>

<p>Still, a long-running rise in first-time buyers leaving London was restricted in the first half of the year, as a steady decline in mortgage costs and lower house prices encouraged more prospective homeowners to buy in the capital. First-time buyers purchased a record 48% of homes sold in London between January and June, up from 41% in 2023 and 28% a decade ago, the report said.</p>

<p>What's more, first-time buyers leaving the capital are increasingly seeking out more affordable areas closer to London rather than moving further afar. The share of first-time buyers leaving London for the countryside has halved from its 6% peak in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Lower mortgage payments have pulled the cost of buying back below renting, bringing relief to those looking for their first home in the capital," Hamptons' Beveridge said. "First-time buyers with deeper pockets are looking again at London, choosing Clapham over Crawley and Wembley over Wycombe."<br />

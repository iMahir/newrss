       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a revised indictment of Donald Trump, pressing ahead with bombshell charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 US election after losing to Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The superseding indictment retains the same four charges against Trump as in an earlier version but takes into account a recent Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>The new indictment of the 78-year-old Republican White House candidate is 36 pages long, down from 45 pages previously, and removes material affected by the immunity ruling from the conservative-dominated top court.</p>

<p>It retains the same core, stating that Trump lost in 2020 but "was determined to remain in power" and attempted to subvert the results.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>This threw into doubt the historic prosecution of the ex-president.</p>

<p>Trump referred to the new indictment as an "act of desperation" that was part of a "witch hunt" against him.</p>

<p>"The illegally appointed 'Special Counsel' Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY," he posted on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>The new indictment comes three days before Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and lawyers for the former president had been set to file a schedule for pre-trial proceedings.</p>

<p>Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, had also scheduled a status hearing for September 5 in Washington and it was not immediately clear if that would go ahead now, following the filing of the superseding indictment.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers have been seeking to delay a trial until after November's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Trump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his campaign of false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>He was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but that was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3><strong>'Private capacity'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>It will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.</p>

<p>That and other pre-trial issues are expected to take months, making it unlikely the case will go to trial before the November 5 presidential vote.</p>

<p>The new indictment drops references to Jeffrey Clark, a former senior Justice Department official who was one of six co-conspirators listed in the original indictment allegedly enlisted by Trump to press his false claims of election fraud.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, in its immunity ruling, said a president's communications with members of the Justice Department should be considered official acts.</p>

<p>The remaining co-conspirators, who include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, "were acting in a private capacity," the indictment said, "to assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power."</p>

<p>Regarding the ruling on Trump's immunity, Supreme Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said that she was "concerned" about the July verdict, according to an interview released by CBS News on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jackson was among three justices who dissented from the court's ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>Sentencing has been scheduled for September 18, but Trump's lawyers have asked for his conviction to be tossed, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling, and sentencing to be delayed.</p>

<p>Trump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Trump was also charged in Florida with mishandling top-secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>The judge presiding over the documents case, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the charges on the grounds that Smith, the special counsel, was unlawfully appointed.</p>

<p>Smith has appealed Cannon's ruling.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Kentucky man who was the first rioter to enter the US Capitol during the January 6, 2021, attack on Congress by Donald Trump supporters was sentenced to 53 months in prison on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Michael Sparks, 46, a factory supervisor, was convicted in March of civil disorder and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building.</p>

<p>Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 57 months while Sparks's defense attorneys asked that he be given 12 months of home detention.</p>

<p>District Judge Timothy Kelly sentenced Sparks to 53 months in prison and a $2,000 fine.</p>

<p>In their sentencing memorandum, prosecutors said Sparks was "the very first rioter to enter the United States Capitol building" and "helped light the fire that day."</p>

<p>Sparks jumped through a broken window, they said, "ignoring the warnings of the rioters behind him and the pepper spray (from US Capitol police) that hit him squarely in the face."</p>

<p>Capitol police sergeant Victor Nichols, testifying at Sparks's trial in Washington, said he "acted like a green light for everybody behind him, and everyone followed right behind him."</p>

<p>Nearly 1,500 people have been charged for their roles in the storming of Congress by supporters of former Republican president Trump.</p>

<p>David Dempsey, 37, of Santa Ana, California, described by prosecutors as one of the "most violent" members of the mob, was sentenced to 20 years in prison this month.</p>

<p>The sentence was the second longest handed down so far.</p>

<p>Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 22 years in prison.</p>

<p>The assault on the Capitol left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.</p>

<p>It followed a fiery speech by Trump to supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Trump faces four federal felony charges in Washington related to efforts to overturn the election results, but the case is unlikely to reach trial before the November presidential vote, in which he is once again the Republican candidate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday an agreement has been reached to have closed microphones at the Sept. 10 U.S. presidential debate with Democratic rival Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for confirmation about the ABC-hosted debate.</p>

<p>The candidates campaigns clashed on Monday over the previously agreed-upon debate, with the vice president's team seeking a return to open microphones while Trump threatened to pull out entirely after suggesting the network was biased.</p>

<p>In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said the rules for next month's debate will be the same as they were for the June CNN debate he had with President Joe Biden, whose poor performance led him to drop out of the 2024 race.</p>

<p>"The Debate will be 'stand up,' and Candidates cannot bring notes, or 'cheat sheets.' We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a 'fair and equitable' Debate, and that neither side will be given the questions in advance," Trump wrote.</p>

<p>The CNN debate did not have a live audience. Trump's post did not mention that.</p>

<p>Harris' campaign had said it wanted the broadcaster to keep the candidates' microphones on throughout the event, not muted when their opponent was speaking as in the last presidential debate. So-called "hot mics" can help or hurt political candidates, catching offhand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public.</p>

<p>While Trump's team said it had already agreed to have closed microphones, Trump later told reporters that he preferred to have his microphone kept on.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has floated an additional debate on Sept. 4 on Fox News network but the Harris team rejected that.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian troops have seized 100 settlements in Russia since they broke into bordering Russia's Kursk region on August 6, Oleksandr Syrsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said.</p>

<p>"We continue to advance forward, inflicting significant losses on the Russian troops in manpower and equipment," Syrsky was cited as saying by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to Syrsky, Russia has redeployed about 30,000 troops from other areas to the Kursk region and is now trying to form "a defensive ring" around the Ukrainian forces, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russia's Defence Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that its Akhmat special forces had carried out a reconnaissance operation, securing a commanding height in the Sudzha district in the Kursk region, previously held by Ukraine.</p>

<p>The height was located 400-500 metres away from Ukrainian forward positions.</p>

<p>The Russian troops can now monitor Ukrainian military movements, TASS reported citing a source at the scene.</p>

<p>Syrsky said that Ukraine launched an operation in Kursk with the aim of creating a buffer zone to prevent shelling in Ukraine's adjacent Sumy region, adding that his troops continue to advance and have captured 594 Russian servicemen.</p>

<p>According to Syrskyi, Russia is trying to oppose Ukraine by withdrawing troops from other fronts.</p>

<p>He said that Russia is not withdrawing forces from the Pokrovsk front in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, where he said the situation remained "difficult".</p>

<p>The Kursk region has been the site of an offensive since the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered the region near the town of Sudzha, about 10 km (6.2 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kyiv of carrying out a "large-scale provocation" and "indiscriminate shooting," defining the incursion as a "terrorist attack".</p>

<p>Days later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted it was an "operation" by Ukraine's troops, specifying that the goal is to create a "buffer zone" against Russian attacks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ahead of the presidential elections in the United States, former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump accepted the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, outlining specific conditions and rules for the face-off.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the presidential elections in the United States, former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump accepted the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, outlining specific conditions and rules for the face-off.</p>

<p>Sharing a post on the social media platform Truth, Trump said, "I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a debate with Comrade Kamala Harris. It will be broadcast live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>This comes after Trump suggested over the weekend he might cancel the debate amid a feud between the campaigns over the rules.</p>

<p>Trump said on Truth Social he and Harris had reached an agreement to follow the same set of rules he and President Joe Biden did during the June 27 CNN debate, including no live audience and muted microphones when the candidates aren't speaking.</p>

<p>"The rules will be the same as the last CNN debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden. The debate will be "stand up," and candidates cannot bring notes, or "cheat sheets." We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a "fair and equitable" debate and that neither side will be given the questions in advance (No Donna Brazile!)."</p>

<p>The Republican presidential candidate further stated that a third debate has not been agreed upon by the Radical Left. The post said, "Harris would not agree to the FoxNews debate on September 4th, but that date will be held open in case she changes her mind or, Flip Flops, as she has done on every single one of her long-held and cherished policy beliefs. A possible third debate, which would go to NBC FAKE NEWS, has not been agreed to by the Radical Left. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"</p>

<p>Notably, Biden's halting and disjointed performance in his June debate with Trump at CNN ultimately led him to drop out of the presidential race.</p>

<p>Harris entered the fray for the presidential ticket after US President Joe Biden announced in July that he was withdrawing from the election bid.</p>

<p>If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that droplets were a "minor" route of transmission for mpox compared to physical contact, saying that more research is required to understand how the virus spreads.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that droplets were a "minor" route of transmission for mpox compared to physical contact, adding that more research is required to understand how the virus spreads.</p>

<p>The UN health agency declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 amid a surge of cases across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Mainly, two distinct clades of the virus, Ia and Ib, are causing significant concern in the DRC. A third variant, Clade II, originated in Nigeria and has been responsible for the global outbreak that began in 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Mpox?</strong></h3>

<p>The mpox virus is an orthopoxvirus that causes mpox (monkeypox), a disease with symptoms similar to smallpox, although less severe, according to the WHO website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are the symptoms of Mpox?</p>

<ol>
	<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Extensive characteristic rash&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Back pain and muscle ache</li>
	<li>Lack of energy</li>
</ol>

<p>The incubation period of mpox can range from 5 to 21 days. The febrile stage of illness (when fever persists) usually lasts 1 to 3 days, according to WHO. This is followed by the skin eruption stage, which can last for 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>How does Mpox spread?</strong></h3>

<p>WHO has said that mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact with someone who has the virus. "Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing)," it said.</p>

<p>However, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said today that if a person with the virus had lesions, "if you're talking closely to someone, breathing on them, physically close, face-to-face, there is a possibility" of viral spread, "but this is a minor source".</p>

<p>"When you're talking to somebody, you're spitting out droplets," but "it's not a very major form of transmission -- and it's not a... through-the-air, long-distance sort of transmission," she added.</p>

<p>The WHO recommends the use of facemasks for those with mpox, their close contacts and health workers treating them.</p>

<h3><strong>Does mpox have a vaccine?</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, there are vaccines recommended by WHO for use against mpox. However, only people who are at risk should get the vaccine. WHO has not recommended mass vaccination against mpox.</p>

<h3><strong>How has India prepared for a possible mpox outbreak?</strong></h3>

<p>India currently has no active mpox cases. The government had ordered the authorities in airports, ports and borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan to remain alert about incoming international passengers who show mpox symptoms.</p>

<p>The All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had issued protocols for handling suspected mpox cases in India. Various government hospitals were directed to set up isolation rooms for suspected and confirmed cases of mpox.</p>

<p>The institute has recommended setting up a screening process in the triage area wherein, upon arrival, patients with fever, rash, or a history of contact with confirmed mpox cases should be flagged for immediate assessment.</p>

<p>According to an assessment, the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is low, officials had said.<br />

<p>The three-day poll, conducted Aug. 23-25, showed Republican former President Trump's approach to the economy and employment was preferred by 43% of registered voters compared to 40% who preferred Harris's approach. The 3 percentage point difference was too small to be significant given the poll's 4 percentage point margin of error. A prior Reuters/Ipsos poll in late July showed Trump with an 11-point advantage on the economy.</p>

<p>On crime and corruption, Harris and Trump were tied with 40% support for each, showing more movement toward Harris, who trailed Trump by 5 points in the July poll.</p>

<p>Recent national polls have shown Harris building a small lead over Trump since she entered the race on July 21 following President Joe Biden's decision to fold his campaign. The Reuters/Ipsos poll from late July showed Harris up by 1 point, 43% to 42%.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the race will be affected by independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr's decision on Friday to suspend his campaign. Kennedy, who had attracted the support of about 8% of voters in a July poll, subsequently endorsed Trump.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign speeches frequently criticize the Biden administration's management of the economy as households continue to feel the sting of several years of high inflation. Harris has pledged to get prices under control through efforts like cracking down on "price gouging" by grocers.</p>

<p>The new poll showed the economy was the biggest issue for 26% of registered voters, compared to 22% who picked political extremism and threats to democracy and 13% who picked immigration.</p>

<p>Voters picked Harris over Trump on the issue of extremism by 42% to 36%. Trump had an advantage on immigration policy, picked by 45% of voters compared to Harris' 37%.</p>

<p>Neither of the two candidates is broadly liked, with 59% of voters saying they have an unfavorable view of Trump and 52% saying the same of Harris. Harris was viewed favorably by 47% of voters, compared to 39% for Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The poll gathered responses online from 1,028 adults nationwide, including 902 registered voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ukrainian presidency on Tuesday said it wanted the next peace summit aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine to be held in a country of the Global South.</p>

<p>Leaders and top officials from more than 90 states gathered in Switzerland in June for a first summit organised by Ukraine, held without Russia or China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We would like for the second summit to be held in one of the countries of the Global South," Andriy Yermak said at a forum in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The Global South refers to several countries and blocs outside Europe and North America, whose foreign policy interests are not fully aligned with either Kyiv or Moscow.</p>

<p>Russia had been excluded from the first summit but Ukraine said it hoped Moscow could be involved in a second round of talks.</p>

<p>"If Russian representatives want to attend the second summit, they will attend," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Any diplomatic breakthrough however looks elusive as the Kremlin said it "will not talk" to Ukraine since its counter-assault in Russia's Kursk region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even before the incursion, the Kremlin insisted any peace deal would need to force Kyiv to surrender territory that Moscow claims as its own -- an unacceptable condition for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kyiv's announcement comes a few days after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kyiv, where he advocated for peace.</p>

<p>Mr Modi "made it absolutely clear that India will never support any plan, any proposal that includes any compromise with the territorial integrity of Ukraine," Mr Yermak said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However neither side showed any signs of breakthrough in Kyiv -- and India firmly believes Moscow should be involved in diplomatic efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Modi spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin and "emphasised his interest to contribute to a possible political and diplomatic settlement of the situation around Ukraine," the Kremlin said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Besides Modi, Zelensky has met with several leaders of countries in the Global South including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>

<p>He is yet to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has become Moscow's key political and economic partner since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>"The only thing that remains is for our president to meet with the leader of China. But I am confident that this will happen," Mr Yermak said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite efforts by an off-duty doctor and ambulance staff, the man was pronounced dead at the scene.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A motorcycle rider was tragically killed in a collision with a car on the British highway A4112 near Kinnersley, Herefordshire, on Sunday. The fatal crash occurred around Monday, leaving one person dead. The video of the tragic accident has gone viral on social media.</p>

<p>The viral video shows a motorcyclist travelling at dangerously high speed crashing into a car that was making a slow right turn. Despite the motorcyclist's attempt to brake sharply upon realising the imminent collision, he lost control, causing the bike to flip. The impact triggered a devastating fire that engulfed both the rider and the motorcycle.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://wmas.nhs.uk/2024/08/27/motorcyclist-dies-in-hereford-collision/">release by the National Health Service of the UK</a>, West Midlands Ambulance Service received calls from police and fire colleagues reporting a road traffic collision involving a motorcycle and a car on the A4112 in Kinnersley, Hereford, at 11.05am yesterday (26th August 2024). Two ambulances and a paramedic officer responded to the scene.</p>

<p>A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: "On arrival, ambulance staff found a motorcyclist, a man, who was in a critical condition being cared for by an off-duty doctor. Sadly, nothing could be done to save the man, and he was confirmed dead on scene. No one else was injured in the collision."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia has announced that it will be limiting its international student intake to 2.7 lakh in 2025 in a bid to tackle record levels of migration that has led to skyrocketing house rental prices.</p>

<p>The limit includes higher education courses as well as vocational education and training courses, Australia's Education Minister Jason Clare said today.</p>

<p>The move is set to impact Indian students hoping to go abroad for higher education, especially those from Punjab which accounts for a large number of such students.</p>

<p>"In June 2022, Australia capped the foreign student intake at 5.10 lakh. This number was reduced to 3.75 lakh in 2023. Now they have reduced the annual planning levels further. These levels are accorded to individual universities for all international students and not just for Indian students. The universities will distribute the quotas country wise then state wise," &nbsp;Sunil Jaggi, a member of Migration Agents Registration Authority of Australia, said.</p>

<p>"The students who were preparing to take admission for the February intake will get affected by this announcement. Students from Punjab will be worst affected," he further said.</p>

<p>"This will affect my career. My family is taking loans for my education as the cost of studying in Australia is quite high," a student from Haryana, who wishes to study nursing in Australia, said.</p>

<p>"The Indian government must put forward students' point of view to the Australian government," another student said.</p>

<p>Notably, the Australian Education Minister on a visit to India last year had signed an agreement to expand in-country access to Australian higher education institutions for Indian students.</p>

<p>According to India's Ministry of External Affairs, around 1.22 lakh students from the country study in Australia. India's Quad partner is the fourth most popular destination for Indian students studying abroad, after Canada, the US and the UK.</p>

<p>Australia also increased its non-refundable visa fee for foreign students from AUD 710 to AUD 1,600, another measure that seemingly aims to reduce migration levels.</p>

<p>Canada has also announced new restrictions on its temporary foreign workers' programme. Starting September 26, businesses will only be allowed to fill up to 10 per cent of their workforce with low-wage foreign workers, down from the previous 20 per cent. The decision to limit the number of low-wage foreign workers comes in response to rising unemployment rates in Canada. The overall unemployment rate has climbed to 6.4 per cent, with the rate for younger workers reaching 14.2 per cent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Ohio woman and her boyfriend have been arrested following a shocking incident in which her 6-year-old son was handcuffed as a form of "corporal punishment" before being attacked by a pit bull, according to police. Angelina Williams, 27, of Cleveland, and her boyfriend, Taylor Marvin-Brown, now face charges of endangering children and obstructing justice.</p>

<p>In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ashlandcountysheriff.org/news-releases/2024/8/20/savannah"><em>release,</em></a> the Ashland County Police said, "On Saturday, August 17, 2024, at 5:06 pm the cops received a 911 call for a squad to be sent to 23 Chapel Street, Savannah, Ohio. Dispatchers were told that a Pitbull had bitten a 6-year-old child on the neck and ear. When the squad members and deputies arrived, the child was in serious condition, and Life Flight was called. Deputies identified the mother as Angelina Williams of Cleveland, Ohio, who was living with a family member of Robert Michalski, who was the owner of the house and dog. Robert had left the house with Pitbull prior to deputies arriving."</p>

<p>Detectives and deputies learnt through an investigation that the 6-year-old child had been restrained with handcuffs on his hands and feet when the Pitbull attacked him.</p>

<p>A search warrant was executed at the house where deputies recovered evidence to support the investigation. Also, they found Robert and the Pitbull hiding in a cubbyhole upstairs at the residence. The Pitbull was taken into custody to be housed as a vicious dog.</p>

<p>Angelina Williams and Robert Michalski were taken into custody and taken to jail. Angelina's boyfriend, Taylor Desiree Marvin-Brown, was at the house and assisted with the restraining of the 6-year-old child. She was taken into custody along with Williams and Michalski.</p>

<p>The investigation will continue, and the case will be forwarded to the Ashland County Prosecutor's Office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes US government pressure on his social media platforms to take down certain Covid-19 content in 2021 was "wrong", according to a letter submitted to a US congressional committee.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes US government pressure on his social media platforms to take down certain Covid-19 content in 2021 was "wrong," and said he would resist similar attempts in the future, according to a letter submitted to a US congressional committee.</p>

<p>In the letter, addressed to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and released by Republicans on the committee, Mr Zuckerberg addressed a number of controversies centered on content moderation on his platforms.</p>

<p>He also asserted that he did not plan on repeating funding efforts for US election infrastructure ahead of the country's presidential poll this year, donations that had drawn sharp criticism from Republicans.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg's submission to the committee on Monday comes just over two months out from a tightly contested US presidential election race, with the spotlight on widespread online misinformation about the candidates.</p>

<p>Regarding the pandemic, the Facebook founder said President Joe Biden's administration had in 2021 "repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire."</p>

<p>"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it," Mr Zuckerberg wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration in either direction -- and we're ready to push back if something like this happens again."</p>

<p>Republicans took the letter as a victory, with the Republicans' House Judiciary Committee account on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, labeling it a "big win for free speech."</p>

<p>The White House defended its actions during the pandemic, which killed more than a million people in the United States amid bitter political battles over vaccines and attempts to limit the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>"When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety," a White House spokesman said Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said he would not be repeating his Covid-era push to fund non-profits working to support US electoral infrastructure due to such donations being seen by Republicans as being partisan.</p>

<p>"My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another -- or to even appear to be playing a role," he wrote.</p>

<p>The letter also touched on controversy regarding Facebook's handling of a story regarding US President Joe Biden's son Hunter that was published by the New York Post in 2020.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said the story, which purported to expose corrupt dealings by the Biden family, was "temporarily demoted" while Facebook fact-checkers probed the possibility of it being "a potential Russian disinformation operation."</p>

<p>The Meta CEO said the story was ultimately found not to be part of such an operation and that the platform has changed its policy such that posts in the United States are no longer demoted while fact checkers investigate them.</p>

<p>Republicans in Congress have been targeting social media and tech companies in recent months, alleging that they are suppressing or censoring conservative views.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, who is seeking a return to power in November after losing his reelection fight to Biden in 2020, claimed that Zuckerberg's statement offered support for his conspiracy theory that the election was stolen.</p>

<p>"This is what everyone's been waiting for -- THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS RIGGED!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Iraqi criminal court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for a businessman and a former government official wanted over their alleged involvement in stealing $2.5 billion of public funds.</p>

<p>The scandal dubbed the "heist of the century", sparked widespread anger in Iraq, which is ravaged by rampant corruption, unemployment and decaying infrastructure after decades of conflict.</p>

<p>The criminal court issued the warrants for businessman Nour Zuhair and Haitham al-Juburi, a former adviser to then prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, state news agency INA reported.</p>

<p>The two suspects are among several facing a trial which opened in mid-August, but are on the run and failed to appear in court.</p>

<p>According to the tax authorities, the defendants allegedly expropriated the $2.5 billion between September 2021 and August 2022 through 247 cheques cashed by five companies.</p>

<p>The money was subsequently withdrawn -- in cash -- from the firms' accounts.</p>

<p>The owners of those accounts -- most of whom are also on the run -- have also been subject to arrest warrants.</p>

<p>Around 30 suspects are facing trial, INA reported, including six already behind bars or awaiting extradition to Iraq, the national anti-fraud agency has said.</p>

<p>In October 2022, Zuhair was arrested at Baghdad airport as he was trying to leave the country.</p>

<p>A month later he was released on bail after giving back more than $125 million and pledging to return the rest in instalments.</p>

<p>Juburi also returned $2.6 million of the allegedly embezzled funds before disappearing, a judicial source told AFP.</p>

<p>The current whereabouts of both men is unknown.</p>

<p>However, wealthy businessman Zuhair was back in the news over the few days after he reportedly had a car crash in Lebanon, following an interview he gave to an Iraqi news channel.</p>

<p>"The Nour Zuhair affair is a scandal... that concerns the entire political system," Iraqi journalist and commentator Hamed al-Sayyed told AFP.</p>

<p>He blamed the authorities for releasing him on bail two years ago, allowing him "to flee".</p>

<p>"His release from jail, at a time when he was being investigated, shows that the political system, at the highest echelons, is complicit," Sayyed added.</p>

<p>Corruption is endemic in Iraqi state institutions, with the top echelons of power often evading accountability.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Singapore soon to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two nations. The specific dates for the prime minister's official visit are not known yet, but it will happen shortly, a top official said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Singapore was mentioned by Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan after senior ministers of India and Singapore concluded a high-level meeting to further their strategic ties.</p>

<p>A four-member Indian delegation comprising Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, and Railway &amp; IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw participated in the second India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) in Singapore.</p>

<p>Calling the meeting "productive", Mr Balakrishnan said, "We will, very shortly, be announcing an official visit by Prime Minister Modi to Singapore. I cannot give you the specific date, but it will occur shortly".</p>

<p>During the multi-ministerial meeting, the two countries discussed ways to boost bilateral cooperation in the digital arena, skill development, sustainability, healthcare, connectivity and manufacturing.</p>

<p>Mr Balakrishnan further said that advanced manufacturing and semiconductors, as well as aviation and maritime connectivity are the new areas that Singapore and India have added to their bilateral talks.</p>

<p>"A country with more than 1.4 billion people is now embarking on a major upgrade of its aviation sector. This is a once in a two, three-decade opportunity, and it's good that we are, in a sense, in the front seat and have a chance (to collaborate)," he said.</p>

<p>At the meeting, Singapore was represented by Deputy Prime Minister and Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, Digital Development and Information Minister Josephine Teo, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng and Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat.</p>

<p>"During the meeting, the ministers reaffirmed the close and long-standing relationship between the two nations, underpinned by strong economic and people-to-people ties," Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a joint release.</p>

<p>Besides a link-up between Singapore's PayNow and India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in February 2023, which lets financial institutions from both sides transfer funds in real time, the two countries have also facilitated investments in renewable energy, such as green ammonia.</p>

<p>"I am confident that the discussions we had today and those in the future will pave the way to foster greater collaboration between Singapore and India," Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>An official announcement by the Ministry of External Affairs regarding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit is awaited.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said the West was playing with fire by considering allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with Western missiles and cautioned the United States on Tuesday that World War Three would not be confined to Europe.</p>

<p>Ukraine attacked Russia's western Kursk region on Aug. 6 and has carved out a slice of territory in the biggest foreign attack on Russia since World War Two. President Vladimir Putin said there would be a worthy response from Russia to the attack.</p>

<p>Sergei Lavrov, who has served as Putin's foreign minister for more than 20 years, said that the West was seeking to escalate the Ukraine war and was "asking for trouble" by considering Ukrainian requests to loosen curbs on using foreign-supplied weapons.</p>

<p>Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly warned of the risk of a much broader war involving the world's biggest nuclear powers, though he has said Russia does not want a conflict with the U.S.-led NATO alliance.</p>

<p>"We are now confirming once again that playing with fire - and they are like small children playing with matches - is a very dangerous thing for grown-up uncles and aunts who are entrusted with nuclear weapons in one or another Western country," Lavrov told reporters in Moscow.</p>

<p>"Americans unequivocally associate conversations about the Third World War as something that, God forbid, if it happens, will affect Europe exclusively," Lavrov said.</p>

<p>Lavrov added that Russia was "clarifying" its nuclear doctrine.</p>

<p>Russia's 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out when its president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons "when the very existence of the state is put under threat".</p>

<p><strong>RUSSIA'S RESPONSE</strong></p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier this month that the assault on Russia's Kursk region showed that Kremlin threats of retaliation were a bluff.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy said Ukraine, because of the restrictions imposed by allies, could not use the weapons at its disposal to hit some Russian military targets. He urged allies to be bolder in their decisions about how to help Kyiv in the war.</p>

<p>Russia has said that Western weaponry, including British tanks and U.S. rocket systems, have been used by Ukraine in Kursk. Kyiv has confirmed using U.S. HIMARS missiles to take out bridges in Kursk.</p>

<p>Washington says it was not informed about Ukraine's plans ahead of the surprise incursion into Kursk. The United States has also said it did not take any part in the operation.</p>

<p>Putin's foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, said on Tuesday that Moscow did not believe Western assertions that it had nothing to do with the Kursk attack. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the involvement of the United States was "an obvious fact".</p>

<p>The New York Times reported that the United States and Britain provided Ukraine with satellite imagery and other information about the Kursk region in the days after the Ukrainian attack.</p>

<p>The Times said that the intelligence was aimed at helping Ukraine keep better track of Russian reinforcements.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five more murder cases have been filed against Bangladesh's ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina taking the total number of cases filed against the Awami League leader to 71, a media report said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Four of the new cases were filed in Dhaka and one in Rajshahi against the 76-year-old deposed former prime minister, several former ministers and police officials, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>In the first case, Hasina and 48 others were booked for the death of one Dulal alias Selim in the city's Jatrabari area on August 3 during mass protests.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Mostafa Kamal filed the case against the Awami League president and others with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Saddam Hossain.</p>

<p>Former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader, former Awami League lawmakers Shamim Osman and Ramesh Chandra are among the accused, The Daily Star said.</p>

<p>In the second case, Sheikh Hasina along with 21 others was booked on the charge of killing one Mansur Miah, a machine operator of Buriganga Filling Station at Basila of Mohammadpur on July 19.</p>

<p>In the third case, Sheikh Hasina and 91 others were sued for the death of one Miraz Hossain at Sanarpar in the city's Demra area on August 5.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Khorshed Alam filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Belal Hossain.</p>

<p>The fourth case was filed against Sheikh Hasina and 40 others for the death of 21-year-old Nahidul Islam at Mirpur-10 on July 19.</p>

<p>The victim's brother Md Sabuj filed the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mehedi Hasan.</p>

<p>Quader, Asaduzzaman, Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana, son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Harun Or Rashid and former DMP commissioner are among the accused.</p>

<p>In Rajshahi, SM Salahuddin Ahmmed Shamim Sarkar, a member of Bagha upazila Chhatra Dal in Rajshahi, filed a case against Hasina, former state minister for foreign affairs Shahriar Alam and 52 others, said Bagha police station's officer-in-charge Abu Siddque.</p>

<p>The number of cases filed against Hasina has risen to 71 with four new cases filed in Dhaka, the report said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India on August 5 after unprecedented anti-government student-led protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs.</p>

<p>The Hasina-led government was replaced by an interim government, and 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was named its Chief Adviser.</p>

<p>Over 230 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government, taking the death count to more than 600 since the massive protest by students against a controversial quota system in government jobs first started in mid-July.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops have recovered an Israeli hostage in "a complex rescue operation" in the southern Gaza Strip, the military said on Tuesday, more than 10 months after he was abducted by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7.</p>

<p>It said 52-year-old Qaid Farhan Alkadi, a member of the Bedouin community in southern Israel, had been transferred to a hospital and his medical condition was normal.</p>

<p>The operation, following the rescue of four Israeli hostages in June, comes as talks have continued to try to agree a halt to the fighting in Gaza and the return of more than 100 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>"We are doing everything to save the hostages," the head of the military Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israeli television stations showed a military helicopter landing at a hospital as medical staff stood by.</p>

<p>Alkadi was taken hostage in Kibbutz Magen, one of a string of communities around the Gaza Strip that were attacked by Hamas-led fighters on Oct. 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 39-year-old woman died on the first day of Burning Man, the popular counterculture festival held annually in the Nevada desert, according to the New York Post. Kendra Frazer was found unresponsive at the festival around 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, and despite efforts to revive her, she was pronounced dead, Burning Man organizers said in a statement.</p>

<p>Pershing County Sheriff Jerry Allen stated that the cause of death is under investigation, pending autopsy and toxicology results, in a statement shared on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=904349431727786&amp;set=a.329297399232995" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Facebook</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Kendra's family and friends," Allen added.</p>

<p>Authorities noted that the death occurred before the official start of the event, which festival organizers confirmed began at 6 p.m. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/us-news/woman-dies-at-opening-day-at-burning-man-festival/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The New York Post</em></a> also reported that participants were not permitted to enter the festival until midnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>"It is with heavy hearts that Burning Man Project confirms the death of a participant in Black Rock City in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family and friends affected by this loss. The participant has been identified by the Pershing County Sheriff's Office as 39-year-old Kendra Frazer," Burning Man organisers said in a statement.</p>

<p>"On Sunday, August 25, 2024, at 11:29 am, Burning Man's emergency services personnel responded to a report of an unresponsive individual. Once on scene, life-saving measures were immediately attempted but were unsuccessful," they added.</p>

<p>Burning Man is a nine-day festival centred around community and art, culminating in the symbolic burning of a large wooden effigy.</p>

<p>The event takes place in Black Rock City, a temporary city constructed in the Black Rock Desert of northwestern Nevada.</p>

<p>According to the <em>Guardian</em>, the festival began early Sunday after the gates were closed for 12 hours due to severe weather.</p>

<p>About 20,000 people were already on the Playa - a silt-alkaline salt flat - before the gates reopened, and organizers anticipate more than 70,000 attendees throughout the nine-day event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A museum in southern French city Marseille is inviting visitors to discover Europe's relationship to the naturist lifestyle by wandering its halls in the nude.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A museum in southern French city Marseille is inviti naturist lifestyle by wandering its halls in the nude.</p>

<p>"It's not every day you get to walk around a museum naked," said Julie Guegnolle, 38, who was celebrating her birthday at the "Naturist Paradises" exhibition in the Museum of Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean (Mucem).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once a month, visitors to Mucem can explore the history of naturism in Europe in only their shoes -- a precaution not for modesty's sake but simply to "avoid getting splinters," the head of France's FFN naturist organisation Eric Stefanut told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walking around the displays clad in a sarong, Guegnolle told AFP she wanted to "do something different" for her birthday.</p>

<p>She and her husband, Matthieu -- also in his birthday suit -- were among 80 visitors in various states of undress strolling around the 600 photos, paintings, sculptures, and other works one Tuesday in August.</p>

<p>"When we arrived, we felt a bit lost, but it's not so strange," Guegnolle said.</p>

<h3><strong>Not really accepted</strong></h3>

<p>Some visitors suffered more culture shock than others, with one couple from southwest England marvelling at the liberated attitudes towards nudity on display.</p>

<p>Kieren Parker-Hall and Xander Parry told AFP they enjoyed the "fantastic" photography, including a nude black-and-white portrait of Christiane Lecocq -- a female pioneer of French naturism who died at the age of 103.</p>

<p>Discovering the history of naturism while in the nude was a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" for the two Brits, especially since they said the practice is not widely accepted in their home country.</p>

<p>"There's not a lot of naturist stuff in England," said web developer Parker-Hall, 28, adding the practice is "not really accepted".</p>

<p>Xander Parry, a 30-year-old stained glass maker, agreed.</p>

<p>Being naked in England is seen as "weird... you should be a bit ashamed of being naked," Parry said.</p>

<h3><strong>Stronghold of naturism</strong></h3>

<p>Though there is no official ranking, Mucem describes France as "the world's leading tourist destination" for those who enjoy going nude outdoors.</p>

<p>The naturist movement sprang up in Switzerland and Germany in the 19th century, Bruno Saurez, head of the local naturist association and co-host of the visit told AFP.</p>

<p>France's first naturist group emerged in the southeastern Provence region in 1930 before spreading throughout the country.</p>

<p>The southern port city of Marseille, long considered a "stronghold of naturism" boasts several dedicated centres due, in part, to the region's mild climate, Saurez added.</p>

<p>"We're right on Spain's heels for the number of visitors to vacation resorts" dedicated to naturists, he said.</p>

<p>But for Christelle Bouyoud, 53, naturism goes further than tourist numbers or the freedom to bare it all - the decision to go nude can be a unifying force for society.</p>

<p>"When you're naked, it's very complicated to face someone on the battlefield," Bouyard, a naturist of a decade's standing, told AFP.</p>

<p>For the fully clothed and the naked alike, the exposition featuring loans from the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Louvre, and the Swiss National Library in Bern is open until December 9.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

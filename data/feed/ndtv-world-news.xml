       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Auto Workers Union said on Tuesday it has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board against Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk over attempts to threaten and intimidate workers.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the NLRB would take action against Trump for his comments on Monday during a two-hour conversation with Musk that was broadcast on social media platform X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/47H3HLczZL">pic.twitter.com/47H3HLczZL</a></p>
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823430600872878321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The UAW seized upon Trump's remarks as the union rallies behind Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris and encourages its nearly 400,000 workers to vote for her over Trump. The issue is especially pertinent in battleground states like Michigan which could determine who wins the White House in November. The UAW endorsed Harris at the end of July.</p>

<p>"You're the greatest cutter," Trump said to Musk during Monday's conversation, complimenting the CEO's ability to cut costs by saying he would not tolerate workers going on strike. "I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: 'You want to quit?' They go on strike - I won't mention the name of the company - but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's okay, you're all gone.'"</p>

<p>Musk chuckled but did not respond to Trump's comments, making it harder for the NLRB to find him liable for making illegal threats to workers at his companies, said Wilma Liebman, chair of the NLRB under former President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labor Relations Act, the UAW said in a statement.</p>

<p>After the union's action on Tuesday, Musk criticised UAW President Shawn Fain in a social media post, alluding to two past union presidents who went to prison for bribery and corruption. "Based on recent news, it looks like this guy will join them!" Musk said.</p>

<p>A court-appointed monitor of the UAW is investigating several union executives, including allegations that Fain retaliated against a member of his board when the person did not take actions that would have benefitted Fain's domestic partner and her sister. The UAW could not immediately be reached to comment on Musk's response.</p>

<p>Trump campaign officials said his pledged 100% tariff on Chinese imports would strengthen the industry, while Harris' EV policies are hurting American manufacturing.</p>

<p>"This frivolous lawsuit is a shameless political stunt intended to erode President Trump's overwhelming support among America's workers," Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment after the UAW's action.</p>

<p>Fain and Trump have exchanged barbs in the past.</p>

<p>"Both Trump and Musk want working-class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly. It's disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns," Fain said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump has called for the union leader to be fired, saying he is responsible for US auto manufacturing becoming weaker.</p>

<p>UAW members in Michigan tend to side with Democrats, but pro-Trump workers have organised their own rallies in recent weeks.</p>

<p>In the 2020 presidential race, 62% of Michigan households with a union member voted for President Joe Biden, helping him win the state, according to Edison Research. By contrast, union households split 53% to 40% for Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she narrowly lost the state and the national race.</p>

<p>Sean O'Brien, president of the Teamsters, another key labour group, said of Trump's comments, "Firing workers for organising, striking, and exercising their rights as Americans is economic terrorism."</p>

<p>The Teamsters have traditionally endorsed a candidate after party conventions. O'Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July.</p>

<p>The union had also requested a speaking opportunity at the upcoming Democratic National Convention but it had not heard back, spokesperson Kara Deniz said. It had also invited Harris to a roundtable but had not heard back.</p>

<h3><strong>Sending a message</strong></h3>

<p>The NLRB has limited power to punish unlawful labor practices and the process often lasts years. In cases involving illegal threats, the board can order employers to cease and desist from such conduct and to post notices in the workplace informing workers of their rights. Unions can also use favourable rulings from the NLRB to engage workers they are trying to organise.</p>

<p>"Everyone knows the NLRB remedies are toothless to start with, but it's not so much for the remedy as for sending both a political message and an organising message," former NLRB head Liebman said, referring to the UAW's action on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Fain filed separate complaints with the NLRB against the Trump campaign and Tesla citing Trump and Musk as the employers' representatives, claiming both men had made statements suggesting they "would fire employees engaged in protected concerted activity, including striking." The complaints did not provide further detail.</p>

<p>The NLRB has jurisdiction over the Trump campaign as an employer, but not Trump himself.</p>

<p>The UAW led a six-week strike against Detroit's Big Three automakers last autumn, before winning record contracts.</p>

<h3><strong>Musk and the NLRB</strong></h3>

<p>Musk, who has endorsed Trump for president, has had numerous run-ins with the labour board. His rocket company SpaceX is currently challenging the entire structure of the agency in a pair of pending lawsuits. Those cases stemmed from NLRB complaints accusing SpaceX of firing engineers who were critical of Musk and forcing employees to sign severance agreements with unlawful terms.</p>

<p>In March, a US appeals court upheld an NLRB decision that said Musk illegally threatened Tesla employees by tweeting in 2018: "Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union ... But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing?"</p>

<p>Tesla is separately facing allegations from the board that it illegally discouraged unionising at a Buffalo, New York, plant.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks on Tuesday replaced its Indian-origin CEO <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2024/starbucks-names-brian-niccol-as-chairman-and-chief-executive-officer/" target="_blank">Laxman Narasimhan with Brian Niccol</a>, chief executive at Chipotle. Narasimhan steps down as chief executive and as a member of the Starbucks board "with immediate effect," the coffee giant said in an official statement.</p>

<p>A veteran of PepsiCo and other consumer brands, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/starbucks-indian-origin-ceo-laxman-narasimhan-to-work-as-barista-in-stores-every-month-3889617" target="_blank">Laxman Narasimhan</a> took over the top spot in March 2023 after a period of working with longtime Starbucks CEO and interim boss Howard Schultz.</p>

<p>Last month, Narasimhan spoke about the importance of work-life balance in an interview with Fortune magazine, and declared that he "almost never" worked past 6 pm.</p>

<p>Narasimhan said he finished his work by 6 pm, adding that if anyone got a minute of his time after 6 pm, they "better be sure that it's important".</p>

<p>"I am very disciplined about balance. If there's anything after 6 pm and I am in town, it's got to be a pretty high bar to keep me away from the family. Anybody who gets a minute of time after that better be sure that it's important... Because if not it will just wait for another day," the 57-year-old had said.</p>

<p>This quote from his July 7 interview has now gone viral on social media with several users claiming that he was "fired".</p>

<h3><strong>Starbucks Praises Laxman Narasimhan</strong></h3>

<p>In its statement, Starbucks praised <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-starbucks-fired-laxman-narasimhan-a-year-after-his-appointment-as-ceo-6333478" target="_blank">Laxman Narasimhan</a>, saying he drove innovation in the brand's supply chains and boosted its store operations during his tenure.</p>

<p>"In the face of some challenging headwinds, Laxman has been laser focused on improving the business to meet the needs of our customers and partners. We all wish him the very best and know he will do great things in the future," Mellody Hobson, Starbucks board chair, said. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>"On behalf of the board, I want to sincerely thank Laxman for his contributions to Starbucks, and his dedication to our people and brand," Hobson added.</p>

<p>The leadership shifts at Starbucks come at a time when the American multinational chain of coffeehouses is pushing to turn around its business while contending with broad-based sales declines in its most recent financial results.</p>

<p>Starbucks has cited weakening consumer sentiment and difficult market conditions in China as factors in its troubles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks said Tuesday that Brian Niccol, chief executive at Chipotle, would be the coffee chain's new CEO -- just over a year after current boss Laxman Narasimhan took over the role.</p>

<p>Narasimhan steps down as chief executive and as a member of the Starbucks board "with immediate effect," said the company in a statement.</p>

<p>Starbucks shares were around 21 percent higher in early afternoon trading, while Chipotle Mexican Grill shares fell by about eight percent.</p>

<p>The leadership shifts come as Starbucks pushes to turn around its business, while contending with broad-based sales declines in its most recent financial results.</p>

<p>The company also saw a bruising April earnings report, battering its shares and prompting Narasimhan to promise a reset.</p>

<p>Starbucks previously cited weakening consumer sentiment and tough market conditions in China as factors in its troubles.</p>

<p>The company has also been contending with pressure from activist fund Elliott Investment Management, which took a stake in the chain and had been seeking ways to boost the share price.</p>

<p>The coffee giant is working meanwhile to finalize contracts with unionized stores.</p>

<p>Lynne Fox, president of the Workers United union, said in a statement Tuesday: "We look forward to continuing to work with Starbucks to resolve massive outstanding litigation and reach fair collective bargaining agreements in the coming months."</p>

<p>"The replacement of Laxman Narasimhan as Starbucks CEO is the result of growing dissatisfaction, particularly from activist investors, over the way the chain has been run," said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, in a statement.</p>

<p>"While some of the slowdown can be attributed to a more sluggish consumer cutting back, much is also the result of a worsening store experience and a lack of innovation in areas like food," he added.</p>

<p>Investors could be hoping for improvements in day-to-day operations by bringing Niccol on board.</p>

<p>"Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth," said Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson in a statement as the company announced the leadership changes.</p>

<p>Niccol has served as Chipotle's CEO since 2018.</p>

<p>In naming him Starbucks' new CEO, the company noted that his work at Chipotle had "driven significant growth and value creation," citing revenue that has nearly doubled and higher profit.</p>

<p>Narasimhan, a veteran of PepsiCo and other consumer brands, had taken over the top spot in 2023 after a period working with longtime Starbucks CEO and interim boss Howard Schultz.</p>

<p>The statement noted that Narasimhan, during his tenure, drove innovation in the brand's supply chains and boosted its store operations.</p>

<p>Niccol will start in his new role on September 9, with Starbucks chief financial officer Rachel Ruggeri serving as interim CEO until then.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite three years of improved security following the end of the Taliban's insurgency, Afghanistan's economy remains stagnant and its population is in the grips of a worsening humanitarian crisis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite three years of improved security following the end of the Taliban's insurgency, Afghanistan's economy remains stagnant and its population is in the grips of a worsening humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>A third of Afghanistan's roughly 40 million people live on bread and tea, according to the United Nations, there is massive unemployment, and the World Bank warns of zero growth over the next three years.</p>

<p>But there have been some positive changes since the Taliban takeover in 2021 -- even if their government remains unrecognised by any other country.</p>

<p>The currency has been resilient, corruption is no longer ubiquitous, and tax collection has improved.</p>

<p>Authorities have also built "economic, commercial, transit and investment" ties in the region, according to Ahmad Zahid, deputy commerce and industry minister.</p>

<p>Afghanistan has great mineral and agricultural potential, which the Taliban government is attempting to exploit, but they are impeded by poor infrastructure and a lack of domestic and foreign expertise and capital.</p>

<p>Though Afghans welcome the improved security in their lives, many are just trying to make ends meet.</p>

<p>AFP spoke to four people from different parts of the country ahead of the anniversary of the fall of Kabul this week:</p>

<h3><strong>The optimistic businessman&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For 54-year-old Azizullah Rehmati, business is booming -- his saffron company in the western province of Herat is set to double production this year.</p>

<p>Until 2021, his "Red Gold Saffron Company" hired armed guards to escort the valuable spice from the factory to the airport, but the improved security climate has done away with the need for such overt protection.</p>

<p>"Now there is no problem," said Rehmati, who exports to 27 countries.</p>

<p>At his processing facility, women sort the red stigmas of the precious saffron spice with tongs.</p>

<p>Taliban government restrictions on women have slashed their participation in the workforce, but Rehmati's company is among the 50 per cent of Afghan employers who still hire women.</p>

<p>Still, a key challenge for Rehmati -- and Afghanistan as a whole -- is the crippled banking sector.</p>

<p>"It is so important that we have the banking channels reopened," said Sulaiman Bin Shah, deputy trade minister under the previous government.</p>

<p>The sector has been blocked by international sanctions and the freezing of central bank assets.</p>

<p>Rehmati's bank can't send money abroad -- or receive transfers -- meaning he has to resort to more expensive private money changers in Dubai.</p>

<p>Getting visas for foreign trips is also a major problem.</p>

<p>Many foreign nations shuttered their embassies in the wake of the Taliban takeover and Afghan passports are rated the worst in the world by the Henley Index, which tracks global ease of travel.</p>

<p>"We will fall back from the world market," Rehmati said.</p>

<h3><strong>The out-of-work musician&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Wahid Nekzai Logari played in Afghanistan's national orchestra and performed concerts on the sarinda, a traditional stringed instrument, as well as the harmonium.</p>

<p>"I supported my whole family. We had a good life," said the 46-year-old in his modest home in a Kabul suburb.</p>

<p>But the Taliban government has prohibited public performances of music, deeming it un-Islamic, leaving thousands involved in the industry destitute.</p>

<p>"Now I'm unemployed," Logari said.</p>

<p>To feed his family of seven he sometimes drives a cab -- earning just 5,000 afghanis a month ($70), a fifth of what he used to earn from his concerts.</p>

<p>"Nobody told us, 'You can't play music anymore, but we'll find you a way to feed your family'," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>The insurgent-turned-bureaucrat&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Abdul Wali Shaheen wanted to "die a martyr's death" in the Taliban ranks, but after their victory, he swapped his rocket launcher for a computer at the Department of Information and Culture in Ghazni province.</p>

<p>"I wasn't as stressed (then) as I am today," the 31-year-old said wryly.</p>

<p>"All we did was wage jihad, now it's harder. I have more responsibilities in regards to the people."</p>

<p>Still, Shaheen's monthly salary of 10,000 Afghanis is enough to feed his family of five, and he is happy with the direction the country is going.</p>

<p>"I give the Emirate a 10/10 for these three years," he said.</p>

<p>"Everything is going well and we have hope for the future."</p>

<h3><strong>The Hidden Beautician&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The order to close beauty salons last year "broke her heart", but Sayeda -- not her real name -- reopened in secret four months ago elsewhere in Kabul.</p>

<p>"We found this place to rent, with the condition that customers come very discreetly and that some of our employees sleep here so that neighbours think a family lives here," said the 21-year-old manager.</p>

<p>"Before, we had 30 to 40 customers a day, now it's six or seven," said Sayeda, who has nevertheless kept her 25 employees so that "everyone has an income".</p>

<p>Sayeda's salary has dropped from 25,000 afghanis per month to between 8,000 and 12,000.</p>

<p>"We're working in hiding and we don't know for how much longer," she said, noting the risk of being shut down by the police.</p>

<p>When they've "found some (underground) salons, they broke the equipment, mistreated the staff" and imposed fines, she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[WhatsApp users are being warned about a new scam targeting the group messaging feature, with cybercriminals infiltrating chats and tricking victims into sharing personal information.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online scam experts have issued a warning for WhatsApp users to be on guard after a spate of reports of a new scam tricking people using the group messaging feature. With more than two billion monthly active users, WhatsApp is now a happy hunting ground for cybercriminals looking for personal information.</p>

<p>The British national cybercrime centre, Action Fraud, has warned that there have been more than 630 cases reported this year where fraudsters infiltrate group chats by pretending to be legitimate members and incite users into giving out sensitive information.</p>

<p>Experts are warning WhatsApp users to be vigilant over messages sent in group chats that are unsolicited or suspicious. If a user is getting this kind of message, it could mean that someone is running a scam. Hence, it is important to be alert every second and take matters to the concerned authority so that leakage of data can be averted.</p>

<p><strong>How Fraudsters Scam The Users</strong></p>

<p>According to a<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/news/whatsapp-group-chats"> release by Action Fraud</a></em>, the scam often begins when a member of the group receives a WhatsApp audio call from the fraudster, pretending or claiming to be another member of the group. Then the fraudster will tell the victim they are sending them a one-time passcode, which will allow them to join an upcoming video call for group members. In reality, the criminal is asking for a registration code to register the victim's WhatsApp account on a new device so they can take over their account.</p>

<p>Once the fraudster has access to the victim's WhatsApp account, they will enable two-step verification, which makes it impossible for the victim to regain access to their account. Other members of the group, or friends and family in the victim's contacts, will then be messaged, asking them to transfer money urgently as they are in desperate need of help.</p>

<p>"With more than 630 reports already this year, we are urging users, and in particular those in big group chats on WhatsApp, to be on their guard and monitor who joins the chats," Detective Superintendent Gary Miles, Head of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau at the City of London Police, said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the reports of the scam a WhatsApp spokesperson said: "All personal messages sent on WhatsApp are protected by end-to-end encryption, but we can all play a role in keeping our accounts safe."</p>

<p>"We recommend that all users set up two-step verification for added security and advise people never to share their six-digit PIN code with others, not even with friends or family."</p>

<p>"If you receive a suspicious message (even if you think you know who it's from), calling or requesting a voice note is the fastest and simplest way to check that someone is who they say they are."</p>

<p>As of July 2023, WhatsApp had around 2.78 billion active users worldwide. The messaging app reached 2 billion users in 2020 and is expected to reach 3.14 billion by 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A storm erupted at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/vinesh-phogat-disqualification-to-imane-khelif-gender-row-five-biggest-controversies-of-paris-olympics-2024-6320003" target="_blank">Paris Olympics 2024</a> over the participation of Khelif after her Italian opponent, Angela Carini. pulled out of their bout less than a minute into the fight after taking a barrage of punches. Carini was seen sobbing and also refused to shake hands with Khelif.</p>

<p>Khelif, who was disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility testing, was then trolled online.</p>

<p>The legal complaint against Musk and Rowling has been filed&nbsp;for online harassment, the American magazine Variety reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"JK Rowling and Elon Musk are named in the lawsuit, among others," Nabil Boudi, the Paris-based attorney of Khelif, told Variety.</p>

<p>He also said that former US president Donald Trump would be part of the investigation.</p>

<p>"Trump tweeted, so whether or not he is named in our lawsuit, he will inevitably be looked into as part of the prosecution," Boudi said.</p>

<h3><strong>What Elon Musk, JK Rowling, Donald Trump Said</strong></h3>

<p>Elon Musk had retweeted an X post by American swimmer Riley Gaines who wrote, "Men don't belong in women's sports #IStandWithAngelaCarini."</p>

<p>"Absolutely," he wrote in a retweet of Gaines' initial message.</p>

<p>Harry Potter creator JK Rowling had referred to the Algerian boxer as a man.</p>

<p>"Watch this (whole thread), then explain why you're OK with a man beating a woman in public for your entertainment. This isn't sport. From the bullying cheat in red all the way up to the organisers who allowed this to happen, this is men revelling in their power over women," she posted on X after the Carini-Khelif fight.</p>

<p>In another post, Rowling shared a photograph of Carini crying and Khelif looking at her.</p>

<p>"The boxer Imane Khelif has decided to begin a new fight, a fight for justice, dignity and honour," Boudi said in a statement, saying Khelif had filed the complaint for "aggravated online harassment... to Paris prosecutors".</p>

<p>"The investigation will determine who was behind this misogynist, racist and sexist campaign, but will also have to concern itself with those who fed the online lynching,"&nbsp;he added.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pineapple sweets dished out by a New Zealand charity have tested positive for potentially lethal amounts of methamphetamine, police said Wednesday, sparking an urgent race to remove them from the streets.</p>

<p>Anti-poverty charity the Auckland City Mission raised the alarm after discovering a batch of the sweets was contaminated with the highly addictive and illegal narcotic, police said.</p>

<p>"An investigation is underway and police are treating the matter as a priority given the risk to the public."</p>

<p>The New Zealand Drug Foundation said a test sample of an innocuous-looking piece of white candy in a bright yellow wrapper indicated it contained methamphetamine.</p>

<p>Foundation spokeswoman Sarah Helm said the tested sweet contained approximately three grams of meth -- hundreds of times greater than the common dose taken by users.</p>

<p>"Swallowing that much methamphetamine is extremely dangerous and could result in death."</p>

<p>Helm urged people who had received confectionaries from the Auckland charity not to consume them.</p>

<p>"We don't know how widespread it is."</p>

<p>The candy was donated anonymously by a member of the public, the charity said, in a sealed branded package. The sweets were then distributed into food parcels.</p>

<p>"There is a potential for New Zealand that there is a lethal substance dressed up as a lolly (sweet)," Helen Robinson from Auckland City Mission told reporters.</p>

<p>"We have to work on the assumption that this was a kind of batch."</p>

<p>The charity believes up to 400 people could have received the affected sweets in a food package.</p>

<p>Robinson said so far eight separate families had been affected, but no one had yet been hospitalised.</p>

<p>She knew of an instance where a parent gave one of the candies to her child, who immediately spat it out.</p>

<p>Robinson said she had been told the potent contaminated sweets tasted "acrid and revolting".</p>

<p>"You could have only a very small touch or lick of the substance and still be deeply affected," she warned.</p>

<p>A contaminated sweet was taken for testing when a person felt strange after starting to eat it and noticed a bitter taste.</p>

<p>Methamphetamine can cause chest pain, racing heart, seizures, delirium and loss of consciousness, the drug foundation warned.</p>

<p>Helm told Radio New Zealand it is common for drug smugglers to hide illegal narcotics in food form.</p>

<p>"We suspect somebody hasn't intentionally sought to poison children. It will be up to police to determine," she added in the interview.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nate Bryne, a weather presenter from Australia, recently suffered a panic attack on air and was forced to halt his morning broadcast. The ABC News Breakfast reporter abruptly stopped speaking in the middle of reading Queensland's weather report around 6:30 am local time on Tuesday. The incident was captured on camera.</p>

<p>"I'm going to need to stop for a second," the meteorologist told viewers as he struggled to speak. "Some of you may know that I occasionally get affected by some panic attacks, and actually that's happening right now," he added.</p>

<p>Further, Lisa Millar, Mr Bryne's co-host, took over the show right away. Later, he returned and apologised to anyone who had been alarmed by his abrupt departure. "Thank you all so much for helping me out. Sorry if I gave anybody a bit of a scare," he said.</p>

<p>In 2022, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-24/nate-byrne-news-breakfast-panic-attack-anxiety/100848904">Mr Bryne talked about his first panic attack</a>, describing it as "terrifying" and how it altered his perspective on mental health. "As I stood there under the studio lights, talking to people having their morning coffee and wiping sleep from their eyes, my heart was racing, I was gasping for breath and sweat was pouring out of every pore as my brain screamed 'RUN!'" the weather presenter wrote.</p>

<p>He recalled the situation and added that he "had just jogged the 40 metres" from his desk to his position at ABC News Breakfast's weather wall. "I had left it a little too late and the show's control room was worried I wouldn't make it in time. I did, and it was barely an exertion. But it was enough to trigger an anxiety problem I still deal with to this day," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, a panic attack is characterised by intense physical reactions to common, non-threatening events as well as quick, transient sensations of anxiety. You can feel like your heart is pounding, sweat a lot, and have trouble breathing when you're having a panic attack. You can have what seems like a heart attack, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p>

<p>These attacks are unpleasant and can be frightening. They usually last five to 20 minutes. Symptoms often peak within 10 minutes of onset and then fade quickly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nearly half a billion children are facing twice as many days of extreme heat each year -- or more -- than their grandparents did, the UN said Tuesday, warning of deadly consequences.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly half a billion children are facing twice as many days of extreme heat each year -- or more -- than their grandparents did, the UN said Tuesday, warning of deadly consequences.</p>

<p>As climate change continues to push up temperatures globally, one in five children -- some 466 million kids -- live in areas that are registering "at least double the number of extremely hot days every year" compared to 60 years ago, the UN children's agency UNICEF said.</p>

<p>"The bodies of young children are not like little adults, they have much more vulnerability to extreme heat," UNICEF advocacy chief Lily Caprani told AFP, also warning of dangers for pregnant women.</p>

<p>Additionally, children lose out on education when schools are forced to close due to high temperatures -- which has affected at least 80 million children in 2024 so far.</p>

<p>UNICEF used days reaching 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) as its benchmark, comparing average temperatures in the 2020-2024 period to the 1960s.</p>

<p>Such hot days -- as well as the means to cope with high temperatures, such as air conditioning -- affect the entire world, it noted.</p>

<p>Children in West and Central Africa are the most exposed, with 123 million children -- 39 per cent of the kids in the region -- facing a third of each year with 95-degree days or higher.</p>

<p>At the higher end, in Mali, for example, air conditioning is out of reach for millions, and blackouts can leave fans idled. More than 200 days a year can reach 95 degrees or higher.</p>

<p>In Latin America, meanwhile, 48 million children are facing double the number of 95-degree or higher days than 60 years ago.</p>

<p>Worldwide, the "trajectory is getting worse and worse for these children," Caprani said.</p>

<p>Children "are fragile and they breathe very quickly. They can't even sweat like an adult does. They are much more vulnerable to heat stress and it can be literally deadly," she added.</p>

<p>High temperatures can contribute to child malnutrition and leave kids more vulnerable to disease, especially malaria and dengue, which spread in warm climates, UNICEF warned.</p>

<p>Excessive heat can also negatively impact neurodevelopment and mental health.</p>

<p>UNICEF is calling for increased education for parents to know the signs of heat stroke, better training for medical personnel, and investing in air conditioning in schools -- where, even when classes aren't cancelled, learning can be made difficult by hot conditions.</p>

<p>Yet the bigger push remains in reining in climate change, caused by humanity's use of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"As governments are currently drafting their national climate action plans, they can do so with the ambition and knowledge that today's children and future generations will have to live in the world they leave behind," UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Queen Elizabeth II would drink a martini before meeting guests mid-air and sleep on her pillows from home on the plane, a flight attendant who once served the longest-reigning monarch has revealed in her notes.</p>

<p>The Queen "tends to like a martini before her guests arrive," Elizabeth Evans, who worked with the British Airways for 28 years, said in her notes, which are set to be auctioned on Thursday.</p>

<p>In 1989, during a British Airways Royal Flight, Evans' VIP guests were Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during a tour of Singapore and Malaysia.</p>

<p>Evans, who died at age 70 in 2017, was also awarded a certificate to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<p>In her notes, she also revealed that Queen Elizabeth II, the monarch who reigned from February 1952 until her death in September 2022, would request a bowl of Velamints to have on hand before takeoff and in her dressing room.</p>

<p>The queen's dresser made up her bed and no one was to wake her if she was asleep when the plane arrived, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://hansonsauctioneers.co.uk/queens-mints-for-take-off-air-hostesss-concorde-and-ba-memorabilia-reveals-royal-etiquette-and-star-studded-passenger-lists/" target="_blank">Hansons Auctioneers</a>, which is auctioning off late flight attendant's collection, said citing Evans.</p>

<p>"If Her Majesty was asleep prior to landing cabin crew were instructed not to disturb her. She should be left in her bed," the auction house said.</p>

<p>Evans had also served several celebrities during her time with British Airways aboard the Concorde, the world's first commercial supersonic airliner.</p>

<p>Her memorabilia is set to go to auction with an estimated value of roughly $500 to $760.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The governor of the Kursk region, where Ukraine is mounting a week-long incursion, previously said Monday that Ukraine controls 28 settlements.</p>

<p>"There are 74 settlements under the control of Ukraine," Zelensky said in his evening address.</p>

<p>The president said that "despite difficult, intense fighting, the advance of our forces in the Kursk region continues."</p>

<p>He posted footage showing him holding a video call with military chief Oleksandr Syrsky.</p>

<p>Syrsky tells him: "As of today, our troops have advanced in some areas by 1 to 3 kilometres."</p>

<p>In the last day, Ukraine has taken "over 40 square kilometres of territory", Syrsky adds, after saying Monday that the troops hold around 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police have arrested over 1,000 people in connection with riots which took place over the last two weeks in England, officials said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Forces across the country have now made more than 1,000 arrests in connection with the recent violent disorder," the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said on X.</p>

<p>At least 575 people have been charged, as courts continued to deal with those involved in the disorder, which took place across dozens of towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland following the death of three girls in a stabbing on July 29.</p>

<p>Far-right riots took place after misinformation spread about the identity of the alleged perpetrator of the knife attack, with multiple people being jailed for spreading hate online in recent days.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom's judiciary is swiftly moving through court cases and handing down lengthy sentences after disorder calmed down ahead of the weekend and the government vowed to crackdown on those involved.</p>

<p>Among those appearing in court Tuesday was a 13-year-old girl who admitted to threatening unlawful violence outside an asylum seeker accommodation in Aldershot in the south.</p>

<p>One man, John Honey, pleaded guilty after being accused of helping attack a car with three Romanian men in it and attacking police during riots in Hull, northeast England.</p>

<p>Honey also admitted to three charges of burglary after he took part in looting several stores.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to "defeat Hamas" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.</p>

<p>The compound is Islam's third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity, but it is also Judaism's holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.</p>

<p>While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.</p>

<p>The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israel-Hamas war, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for threatened attacks from Iran and its proxies.</p>

<p>Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ben Gvir showed "blatant disregard" for the status quo at the site and urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent such actions.</p>

<p>"These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a (Gaza) ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability," he said.</p>

<p>Days earlier the White House used strong language to call out another far-right member of Netanyahu's cabinet, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who criticized President Joe Biden's push for a Gaza ceasefire.</p>

<p>In recent years, the restrictions at the compound have been increasingly flouted by hardline religious nationalists like Ben Gvir, prompting sometimes violent reactions from Palestinians.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, he and some 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns, under the protection of Israeli police, an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is custodian of the site, told AFP.</p>

<p>Israeli police also "imposed restrictions" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said, adding that more than 700 Jews also prayed there in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque, is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa Mosque," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.</p>

<p>- 'Unduly provocative' -<br />
Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the "storming" of the mosque, calling it a "flagrant violation of international law".</p>

<p>"The continual violations of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities require a clear and firm international position that condemns these violations," ministry spokesperson Sufyan al-Qudah said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group of Muslim-majority states, "strongly condemned" the incident and said it was a "provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world".</p>

<p>Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was "against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This sort of behaviour is unhelpful and it is unduly provocative," he added.</p>

<p>European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on X that the bloc "strongly condemns the provocations" by Ben Gvir.</p>

<p>France's foreign ministry said in a statement: "This new provocation is unacceptable."</p>

<p>Images posted on social media networks showed Ben Gvir inside the compound while several Israelis lay on the ground performing Talmudic rituals.</p>

<p>Ben Gvir released a video statement on X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, renewing his opposition to any truce in the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo," he said, referring to the US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza set to resume on Thursday.</p>

<p>"We can defeat Hamas... we must bring them down to their knees," Ben Gvir said.</p>

<p>Tuesday's entry into the Al-Aqsa compound comes on the Jewish mourning day of Tisha Be'Av that commemorates the destruction of the ancient temple.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's campaign said Tuesday it had been targeted by foreign hackers, days after rival Donald Trump's campaign suggested that it had been hacked by Iran.</p>

<p>"In July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation," a Harris campaign official told AFP.</p>

<p>"We have robust cybersecurity measures in place, and are not aware of any security breaches of our systems resulting from those efforts."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The campaign did not give any indication of which foreign power was believed to be behind the attempt but said it remained in contact with law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>The US State Department warned Iran on Monday of consequences over election interference following the Trump campaign's announcement that it had been hacked.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign suggested on Saturday that Iran was behind the breach in which documents including research they used to vet running mate J.D. Vance were sent to reporters.</p>

<p>It warned media outlets against reprinting the documents, saying that such action would be "doing the bidding of America's enemies."</p>

<p>The tone was different to 2016, when Trump said at a news conference that he hoped Russia would "find" Hillary Clinton's emails, remarks widely viewed as encouraging further hacks of his election opponent.</p>

<p>US intelligence concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to support Trump, who has rejected the findings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's administration on Tuesday approved more than $20 billion in new weapons sales to Israel, brushing aside pressure from rights activists to stop arms deliveries over the humanitarian toll in Gaza.</p>

<p>The sale comes as Biden presses Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire after 10 months of bloodshed, although the weapons would take years to reach Israel.</p>

<p>In a notification to Congress, the State Department said it had approved a sale of 50 F-15 fighter-jets to Israel for $18.82 billion.</p>

<p>Israel will also buy nearly 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 explosive mortar cartridges and new military cargo vehicles.</p>

<p>The F-15 aircraft, which will begin to be delivered in 2029, will upgrade Israel's current fleet and include radars and secure communications equipment.</p>

<p>"The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability," the State Department said in its notice on the F-15s, which are made by Boeing.</p>

<p>On the tank cartridges, the United States said the sale "will improve Israel's capability to meet current and future enemy threats, strengthen its homeland defense and serve as a deterrent to regional threats."</p>

<p>Congress can still block weapons sales, but such a process is difficult.</p>

<p>Human rights groups and some left-leaning members of Biden's Democratic Party have urged the administration to curb or stop weapons sales to Israel as they voice revulsion at civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>On Saturday, rescuers in the Hamas-run territory said that 93 people were killed in an Israeli air strike at a school housing displaced Palestinians.</p>

<p>Israel said it was targeting militants operating out of the school. Biden administration officials voiced concern over civilian deaths and declined comment on whether US weapons were used.</p>

<p>In May, Biden froze a shipment to Israel that included 2,000-pound bombs as he warned against a mass-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where vast numbers of displaced Palestinians were living.</p>

<p>But the administration said it has not stopped other weapons and dismissed complaints in June by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the United States was slowing down deliveries.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,929 people, according to a toll from the territory's health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police registered a blasphemy case against a private school owner and her maid in Rai Kalan village in the Kasur district of Punjab after accusations emerged that they had desecrated pages of the Quran, Dawn News reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The incident, which occurred on Friday, was captured in a video that quickly went viral on social media the following day.</p>

<p>As a result, large crowds from neighbouring villages gathered outside the school and police arrived in a substantial number.</p>

<p>According to the FIR, the school's driver and gardener recorded the video of the burned pages and reported it to the complainant. The allegations suggest that the maid burned the pages under the direction of the school owner. The police have stated that the situation is under control and that arrests will be made soon.</p>

<p>Blasphemy is a highly sensitive and contentious issue in Pakistan, where allegations of insulting religion or religious texts can result in severe legal repercussions and societal backlash.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, false allegations of blasphemy have led to severe consequences for many individuals, often driven by personal grievances or social tensions.</p>

<p>One prominent case is that of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who was falsely accused of blasphemy in 2009. Despite her eventual acquittal by the Supreme Court in 2018, her case drew significant international attention and highlighted the dangers of false accusations, as Dawn News reported.</p>

<p>Similarly, Mashal Khan, a university student, was brutally lynched in 2017 after being wrongfully accused of blasphemy, a situation exacerbated by personal vendettas.</p>

<p>The case of Sawan Masih, a Christian man accused in 2013, resulted in violent attacks on Christian communities and was criticized for its lack of credible evidence.</p>

<p>Additionally, Rimsha Masih, a young Christian girl with learning disabilities, faced accusations in 2012 that were later shown to be fabricated, underscoring the vulnerability of those targeted by false claims. These cases illustrate the severe impact and risks associated with false blasphemy allegations in Pakistan, reported Dawn News.</p>

<p>The blasphemy laws in Pakistan have been criticized for being frequently misused to settle personal scores, target minority communities, or incite violence. False accusations can lead to severe social and legal repercussions, including mob violence and extrajudicial killing.</p>

<p>The enforcement of blasphemy laws has faced criticism for lack of due process, with many cases resulting in lengthy legal battles and significant social unrest.</p>

<p>Moreover, the judicial process is often influenced by public opinion and pressure from extremist groups. Human rights organizations and international bodies have condemned the blasphemy laws for their potential to infringe on fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

<p>Critics argue that the laws violate principles of free speech and are used to persecute religious minorities and dissenters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX is aiming to break new barriers in polar exploration with the first manned space mission over the Earth's poles -- a private flight commanded by a crypto entrepreneur later this year, the company said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The mission, dubbed "Fram2" after a 19th century polar expedition schooner, is due to last between three to five days, and was purchased by Chun Wang, a wealthy bitcoin pioneer who founded f2pool and stakefish, for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p>He will be joined by three polar experts: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge, and Australian polar adventurer Eric Philips.</p>

<p>It is the latest foray by the aerospace industry into private space tourism, growing fast in the United States in recent years.</p>

<p>"From mission proposal, planning, trajectory design, to crew selection, everything has been done by the customer," Mr Wang, reportedly born and raised in China but now a Maltese citizen, said in a post on X.</p>

<p>"A new chapter in space exploration is unfolding before our eyes," he said.</p>

<p>Satellites have flown over the poles, but due to the Earth's rotation, reaching them can take more power, while radiation can also be an issue, astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told AFP.</p>

<p>"To date, the highest inclination achieved by human spaceflight has been the Soviet Vostok 6 mission, at 65 degrees," according to the mission website.</p>

<p>The poles are not visible from the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>The mission will use a SpaceX Dragon capsule equipped with an observation dome. The craft will fly at an altitude of between 265 and 280 miles (425 and 450 kilometers), according to SpaceX, owned by mercurial billionaire Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The crew plans to conduct research including taking the first X-ray images in space and studying an aurora-like light phenomenon, according to SpaceX.</p>

<p>SpaceX has flown 13 manned missions in the last four years. It carries Nasa astronauts to the ISS, but has also carried out several space tourism missions, including the first in 2021, named Inspiration4, financed by American billionaire Jared Isaacman.</p>

<p>"Until 2021, space missions were solely the privilege of governments," Mr Wang wrote, adding: "Then @inspiration4x came along and changed everything."</p>

<p>SpaceX is set to launch another private mission, Polaris Dawn on August 26, carrying four crew members including Isaacman.</p>

<p>It is scheduled to include the first private spacewalk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former premier on Tuesday termed the arrest of former ISI chief Faiz Hameed as an "internal issue" of the military and said that the army's action against the former general has nothing to do with his party.</p>

<p>Mr Hameed served as the director general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, when Mr Khan was prime minister and was accused of meddling in political affairs at his behest.</p>

<p>"Imran Khan sahib said just this that 'it is the army's internal matter' and that whatever action the army has taken has nothing to do with the PTI or Khan sahib," Mr Khan's legal representative Intezar Panjutha said.</p>

<p>Mr Panjutha made these remarks following a meeting of Mr Khan with his senior lawyers at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.</p>

<p>Mr Panjutha quoted Mr Khan as saying it was purely a military matter, with no links to PTI. He further clarified that there had been no political connection between Mr Khan and Gen Faiz.</p>

<p>Mr Khan also claimed that former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had replaced Gen Faiz after making a deal with Nawaz Sharif, according to the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr Khan also suggested that if General Faiz's arrest was related to the events of May 9, it would be an opportune moment to form a judicial commission and bring the CCTV footage of the day to light, Panjutha noted.</p>

<p>He also stated that the former premier urged his followers to peacefully protest tonight for the sake of freedom, stressing the importance of taking to the streets for the country.</p>

<p>Mr Panjutha also highlighted Mr Khan's concerns over the mounting pressure on the Supreme Court, the disillusionment among the youth, and the deteriorating conditions in Pakistan, comparing them with those in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>He stated that Mr Khan believed it was time for Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to step back, highlighting that PTI's three seats were allegedly taken away the previous day.</p>

<p>Earlier, in an unprecedented move, Mr Hameed was detained by military authorities and court martial proceedings were initiated against him on charges of corruption, misuse of authority and violating the Pakistan Army Act.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British authorities have now arrested more than 1,000 people following days of rioting involving violence, arson and looting as well as racist attacks targeting Muslims and migrants, a national policing body said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The riots, which followed the killings of three young girls in the northern English town of Southport, began after the July 29 attack was wrongly blamed on an Islamist migrant based on online misinformation.</p>

<p>Violence broke out in cities across England and also in Northern Ireland, but there have been fewer instances of unrest since last week after efforts to identify those involved were ramped up.</p>

<p>Many have been swiftly jailed, with some receiving long sentences</p>

<p>The National Police Chiefs' Council said in its latest update that 1,024 had been arrested and 575 charged across the UK.</p>

<p>Those arrested include a 69-year-old accused of vandalism in Liverpool and a 11-year-old boy in Belfast.</p>

<p>A 13-year-old girl pleaded guilty to violent disorder at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court, prosecutors said, having been seen on July 31 punching and kicking the entrance to a hotel for asylum seekers.</p>

<p>"This alarming incident will have caused genuine fear amongst people who were being targeted by these thugs - and it is particularly distressing to learn that such a young girl participated in this violent disorder," prosecutor Thomas Power said.</p>

<p>The last time Britain witnessed widespread rioting was in 2011, when the fatal shooting of a Black man by police triggered several days of street violence.</p>

<p>Fast and tough judicial action was viewed as helping quell the unrest in 2011, when around 4,000 people were arrested over several weeks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump was greeted by chanting fans as he attended the Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight bout at New York's Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Trump entered the arena shortly before the start of the main card accompanied by UFC chief executive Dana White, who was a prominent backer during his election campaign.</p>

<p>Several political allies of Trump were also in attendance for the mixed-martial arts fights, including entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been asked by Trump to lead efforts to cut government inefficiency.</p>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr., who Trump has nominated to be health secretary, was also at the fight and a photo posted on X showed the pair flying to the event together on Trump's private plane.</p>

<p>The night had the feel of a post-election night out for the Republicans.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman tapped for the role of director of national intelligence, was also in the crowd along with Trump's sons Eric and Don Jr and musician Kid Rock -- a regular at Trump rallies.</p>

<p>After waving to the chanting crowd, Trump warmly greeted UFC broadcast analyst Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host who also endorsed Trump after he appeared as a guest on his show.</p>

<p>The venue's "jumbotron" giant screen above the cage where fighters did battle then showed a video featuring highlights of the election campaign with soundbites from Trump.</p>

<p>The film ended with the numbers 45 and 47 on the screen, representing the Republican's previous and upcoming presidency.</p>

<p>Fans chanted "USA, USA," a refrain frequently heard at Trump rallies, including one he held at Madison Square Garden last month.</p>

<p>Trump watched the fights alongside Musk from front-row seats next to the caged octagon.</p>

<p>After Jon Jones defended his heavyweight title with a third-round technical knockout against fellow American Stipe Miocic in the main event, the fighter celebrated with Trump's trademark 'YMCA' dance.</p>

<p>"I want to say a big thank you to President Donald Trump for being here tonight," said Jones, receiving a huge roar of approval from the crowd.</p>

<p>After leading the crowd in another round of "USA, USA" chant, Jones then passed his heavyweight championship belt to Trump and spent some time in conversation with the President-elect.</p>

<p>Trump frequently attends UFC events and attended three fights during his campaign for the White House.</p>

<p>His ties to the fight world run deep. He featured retired WrestleMania star Hulk Hogan at the Republican convention in August and hosted UFC bouts at his casinos in the early days, when the series struggled to gain traction and well before it became today's multi-billion success.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blasts rang out across Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities early on Sunday, as Russia staged its biggest missile attack since August and targeted power facilities with the winter setting in, officials said.</p>

<p>Ukrainians have been bracing for a major attack on the hobbled power system for weeks, fearing crippling damage to the grid that would cause long blackouts and build psychological pressure at a critical moment in the war Russia launched in February 2022.</p>

<p>"Another massive attack on the power system is under way. The enemy is attacking electricity generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine," Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>Air defences could be heard engaging drones over the capital in the night, and a series of powerful blasts rang out across the city centre as the missile attack was underway in the morning.</p>

<p>The scale of the damage was not immediately clear. Officials cut power supply to numerous city districts, including in Kyiv, the surrounding region and Dnipropetrovsk region, in what they said was a precaution to prevent a surge in case of damage.</p>

<p>Authorities in the Volyn region in northwestern Ukraine said energy infrastructure had sustained damage but did not elaborate. Officials often withhold information on the state of the power system because of the war.</p>

<p>In Mykolaiv in the south, two people were killed in the overnight drone attack, the regional governor said. Blasts shook the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and the Black Sea port of Odesa, Reuters witnesses said. More blasts were reported in the regions of Kryvyi Rih in the south and Rivne in the west.</p>

<p>"Russia launched one of the largest air attacks: drones and missiles against peaceful cities, sleeping civilians, critical infrastructure," said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.</p>

<p>He described the strike as Moscow's "true response" to leaders who had interacted with President Vladimir Putin, an apparent swipe at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who placed a phone call to the Russian leader on Friday for the first time since late 2022.</p>

<h2><strong>Poland Scrambles Air Force</strong></h2>

<p>NATO member Poland, which borders Ukraine to the west, said it had scrambled its air force within its airspace as a security precaution due to the Russian attack, which it said used cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and drones.</p>

<p>Poland "activated all available forces and resources at his disposal, the on-duty fighter pairs were scrambled, and the ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems reached the highest state of readiness," the operational command of its armed forces posted on X.</p>

<p>Ukraine's air force urged residents to take cover, providing regular updates on the progress of Russian cruise, ballistic and hypersonic missiles it said were hurtling through Ukrainian air space.</p>

<p>In Kyiv, the roof of a residential building caught fire due to falling debris and at least two people were hurt, city officials said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>"Emergency services were dispatched to the scene," Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.</p>

<p>Russia last conducted a major missile strike on Kyiv on Aug. 26, when officials said it fired a salvo of more than 200 drones and missiles across the country in an attack that attack killed seven people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In Pakistan, accessing blocked content via virtual private networks (VPNs) is prohibited under Shariah, or Islamic law, the country's top religious body has declared.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Pakistan, accessing blocked content via virtual private networks (VPNs) is prohibited under Shariah, or Islamic law, the country's top religious body has declared. The announcement comes in line with the government's efforts to implement a nationwide firewall and require VPN registration through the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).</p>

<p>The government aims to enhance cybersecurity and fight terrorism, according to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-religious-body-declares-using-vpn-is-against-islamic-law-/7865991.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">VOA News</a>. However, critics argue that these measures lead to increased online surveillance, restrict freedom of expression, and negatively impact e-commerce.</p>

<p>VPNs allow users to conceal their identity and location, offering privacy and security while enabling access to content that might be restricted within a country. In Pakistan, many use VPNs to bypass restrictions on social media platforms and access content that is otherwise blocked.</p>

<p>The religious council said that VPNs were being used to view prohibited content, including "immoral and porn websites or websites that spread anarchy through disinformation." It added that "using VPNs to access blocked or illegal content is against Islamic and social norms, therefore, their use is not acceptable under Islamic law. It falls under ‘abetting in sin,'" quoting the council's chairman, Raghib Naeemi.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior responded by sending a letter to the PTA requesting the blocking of "illegal" VPNs, citing concerns that terrorists were exploiting the technology for violent activities and financial transactions. "VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan," the letter read.</p>

<p>The ministry also expressed concern over the use of VPNs to access pornography, noting that Pakistan ranks high in terms of visits to adult sites via VPNs. "These trends warrant prohibition of unauthorized VPNs to address the critical threats," the letter added.</p>

<p>Alongside their use for business and entertainment, many Pakistanis rely on VPNs to access social media platforms like X, which has been largely inaccessible since the controversial February general elections. The government has defended its move to suspend the platform, citing national security and public order concerns.</p>

<p>Opponents of the restrictions argue that they are primarily aimed at stifling political criticism, especially amid growing backlash against the Pakistani military's influence in politics, following the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. The military has consistently referred to online criticism as "digital terrorism."</p>

<p>This week, the PTA introduced a system for registering VPNs, asking users to sign up on a new online platform. This follows widespread VPN disruptions, which sources say were part of a government trial to block VPNs using a new firewall. Although officials deny throttling the internet, experts believe the system, purchased from China, gives the government more power to monitor online activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To register, users must provide personal details like their national identity number and internet service provider's ID, raising concerns about privacy and potential data breaches. The Interior Ministry has given users until the end of the month to comply.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chris-wright-climate-change-skeptic-to-be-trumps-energy-secretary-7037504 ">selected Chris Wright</a>, a campaign donor and fossil fuel advocate, as the next Secretary of Energy. Announced on Saturday, the nomination positions Mr Wright, a known climate change sceptic, at the helm of the Department of Energy as the administration sets its sights on “cutting red tape” to boost the nation's energy output.</p>

<p>Donald Trump praised Mr Wright's expertise, saying, “As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace.”</p>

<p><strong>Here are some facts on Chris Wright:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Chris Wright is the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-wright-b8370a17b/" rel="nofollow,noindex">founder, CEO and Chairman of Liberty Energy</a>, a major energy service provider, focusing on technology and the energy sector, based in Denver.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">He grew up in Colorado and has had a long career in the energy industry. He holds an undergraduate degree from MIT and completed graduate work in electrical engineering at UC Berkeley and MIT.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Mr Wright is a strong proponent of oil and gas development, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which he views as central to achieving US "energy dominance."</li>
	<li aria-level="1">He has publicly said that there is no "climate crisis" and has criticised policies aimed at transitioning away from fossil fuels. He argues that such policies harm economic opportunities and global prosperity. He has also argued that the global climate movement is "collapsing under its own weight," as per the Washington Post.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Chris Wright founded Pinnacle Technologies in 1992, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through fracking. He also served as chairman of Stroud Energy before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">He is closely tied to the Republican Party and has been a major donor to pro-Trump super PACs and the Republican National Committee. He also co-hosted a fundraising event for Donald Trump at a resort in Montana.</li>
</ul>

<p>Donald&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;has made a flurry of picks for his&nbsp;cabinet&nbsp;and other high-ranking administration positions following his election victory. The 78-year-old leader will take office in January next year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three suspects were arrested, Israeli police said Sunday morning, after two flares landed near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in the central town of Caesarea.</p>

<p>"Three suspects were arrested overnight for their involvement in the incident" that took place Saturday evening, the police said in a statement, adding that the suspects would be interrogated jointly with the Shin Bet internal security agency.</p>

<p>The statement added that a court ordered a gag on publishing any details of the investigation or the suspects' identities for 30 days.</p>

<p>Two flares had landed near Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea on Saturday evening in what Shin Bet described as a "serious incident", though the premier was not present there at the time.</p>

<p>The speaker of Israel's parliament, Amir Ohana, accused anti-government protesters of being behind the incident.</p>

<p>"The writing was on the walls, on the streets, in incendiary messages and in demonstrations," he said, referring to regular anti-government protests that erupted in early 2023.</p>

<p>In the nine months leading up to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, Israel saw mass protests over a divisive judicial overhaul introduced by Netanyahu's far-right government that opponents called a threat to Israeli democracy.</p>

<p>Though the reforms were suspended when the war broke out, protests against Netanyahu and his government have continued, alongside demonstrations calling for a deal to release hostages held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog condemned Saturday's incident and warned "against an increase in violence in the public sphere.</p>

<p>"I have now spoken with the head of the Shin Bet and expressed the urgent need to investigate and deal with those responsible for the incident as soon as possible," Herzog said in a post on X.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world tuned in to Netflix for the highly anticipated Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson fight on Saturday, the internet's focus momentarily shifted to a different kind of “fight” – one that was just as entertaining, if not more, than any professional bout: the Battle of Baghpat.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated showdown between <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/boxing/was-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-fixed-leaked-script-on-social-media-suggests-7038546 ">YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul and boxing legend Mike Tyson</a>, saw the former win by unanimous decision in a professional bout held in the US state of Texas. Some viewers speculated that the fight might have been scripted.</p>

<p>During the event, Netflix experienced a widespread outage, affecting thousands of viewers who struggled to access the livestream of the fight -- marketed as the biggest boxing match ever to be streamed live.</p>

<p>While Netflix viewers were grappling with technical issues, social media users quickly found an unexpected source of entertainment in the form of the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/on-second-anniversary-of-baghpat-fight-twitter-posts-hilarious-memes-3805989 ">Battle of Baghpat</a>, a viral video from 2021. In this bizarre and chaotic brawl, two chaat vendors in Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat clashed over who could attract more customers to their stalls. What started as a minor dispute spiraled into a 20-minute showdown, leading to eight arrests in the district.</p>

<p>The video, which was possibly recorded by a bystander, soon became an internet sensation, flooding social media and meme pages. The bizarre, yet entertaining, nature of the fight had viewers hooked, and the video became one of those rare viral moments that remained relevant long after the actual event. Even three years later, the internet still can't get enough of it. Amid the excitement over the Paul-Tyson fight, Battle of Baghpat made its way back into the social media spotlight.</p>

<p>As the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight gained global attention, the internet began drawing comparisons between the two events.</p>

<p>An X user posted, “No script, nothing—just pure entertainment. My fav fight #PaulTyson #NetflixFight.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disturbing details have come to light in the&nbsp;trial of UK's Dylan Thomas, accused of killing his childhood friend and roommate, William Bush, on Christmas Eve 2023. Thomas, 24, heir to Peter's Food Services, a Rs 2,500 crore&nbsp;food industry giant in the UK, allegedly stabbed Mr Bush 37 times before killing him. Prosecutors revealed Thomas searched online for the "anatomy of the neck" before the attack, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/world-news/heir-to-292m-pie-fortune-made-chilling-online-search-before-alleged-frenzied-stabbing-of-roommate-court/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>On the night of the murder, Thomas invited Mr Bush to his room under the pretence of meeting before the holidays. What followed was nothing short of horrifying.&nbsp;The victim was stabbed a total of 37 times, with 13 of those wounds concentrated on his neck. Mr Bush's desperate attempt to flee left a trail of blood through the house. The final blow came on the patio, where Thomas severed an artery in Mr Bush's neck, ending his life. Neighbours reported hearing "screams of horror" during the assault.</p>

<p>Police body cam footage later showed Thomas covered in blood, falsely claiming that he had disarmed an attacker. A significant part of the case also involved testimony from Mr Bush's girlfriend, Ella Jeffries, who revealed the deteriorating dynamics between the two friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thomas allegedly threatened Mr Bush, “I thought and wondered about killing you. I just wanted to see what would happen if I do certain things,” the court was told, as per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz944vz36o " rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Ms Jeffries also described how her boyfriend had started barricading his bedroom door at night out of fear.</p>

<p>Thomas was diagnosed with schizophrenia following his arrest. He had been previously detained for attempting to climb the fence at Buckingham Palace just weeks before the murder. However, psychiatrists have presented conflicting views on his mental state at the time of the crime. While Thomas pleaded guilty to manslaughter, he denies murder. "Everywhere on him, I kept going and stabbed him. I didn't stop,” Thomas said, as per the BBC, adding, “he stabbed me on my hands, my hands to get the knife.”</p>

<p>The prosecution has painted a disturbing picture of the crime's premeditated nature. Gregory Bull KC, prosecuting, said, "This was a planned attack. He deliberately armed himself with knives and attacked him from behind." Thomas, appearing via video link from Ashworth High Secure Hospital in Merseyside, remains under treatment for his schizophrenia as the court deliberates on the shocking details of the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden on Sunday will be the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon -- the vast tropical rainforest that nearly killed a predecessor, Teddy Roosevelt, after he left office. The trip is part of Biden's final swing through South America before he hands the keys of the White House to Donald Trump, who becomes the United States' 47th president in two months.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, will touch down in the biggest city in the Amazon, Manaus, on his way to Rio de Janeiro, where a two-day G20 summit is to be held.</p>

<p>The Amazon jungle was not a fortunate destination for the 26th US president, Roosevelt. He had a near-death experience in it when he went on a canoe expedition there in 1914, four years after his 1901-1909 stint in office.</p>

<p>Roosevelt, a Republican known for his adventurous spirit, had teamed up with a Brazilian explorer, Candido Rondon, to chart the Rio da Duvida (the River of Doubt), a tributary in the wild center-west of Brazil, in the Amazon.</p>

<p>The river, 760 kilometers (470 miles) long, proved a formidable foe. Several members of Roosevelt's expedition died and the ex-president, aged 55 at the time, caught malaria and a leg infection, which incapacitated him in the final arduous stretch.</p>

<p>"T. R. (Teddy Roosevelt) was out of his mind toward the end; Rondon gave him up for dead several times," his great-grandson Tweed Roosevelt said in remarks noted by The New York Times in 1992.</p>

<p>Roosevelt himself, when he was warned of the dangers by friends at the American Museum of Natural History before embarking on his trip, told them he had already lived a full life and was ready for the risk. "I have had my full share, and if it is necessary for me to leave my bones in South America, I am quite ready to do so," he said, according to the Smithsonian Magazine.</p>

<p>In the end, the Roosevelt-Rondon expedition was saved from disaster when they came across Brazilian rubber-tappers in the jungle, who helped them enough so they could make it to cargo boats, and from there back to the safety of the outside world.</p>

<p>Roosevelt never fully recovered his health from his ordeal, though he and Rondon received acclaim for mapping the River of Doubt. The former president died in 1919 at home of a blood clot in his lungs, aged 60. In his honor, the river he navigated was renamed the Roosevelt River.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Xi cautioned that a stable China-US relationship was critical not only to the two nations but also the "future and destiny of humanity".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's leader Xi Jinping met for the last time with US President Joe Biden on Saturday but was already looking ahead to President-elect Donald Trump and his "America first" policies, saying Beijing "is ready to work with a new US administration".</p>

<p>During their talks on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Xi cautioned that a stable China-US relationship was critical not only to the two nations but also the "future and destiny of humanity".</p>

<p>"Make the wise choice," he cautioned. "Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other."</p>

<p>Without mentioning Trump's name, Xi appeared to signal his concern that the incoming president's protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail could send the US-China relationship into another valley.</p>

<p>"China is ready to work with a new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-US relationship for the benefit of the two peoples," Xi said through an interpreter.</p>

<p>Xi, who is firmly entrenched atop China's political hierarchy, spoke forcefully in his brief remarks before reporters. Biden, who is winding down more than 50 years of public service, talked in broader brushstrokes about where the relationship between the two countries has gone. He reflected not just on the past four years but the decades the two have known each other.</p>

<p>"We haven't always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We've never kidded one another," Biden said. "These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict."</p>

<p>Biden urged Xi to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia's war on Ukraine. The leaders, with top aides surrounding them, gathered around a long rectangle of tables in an expansive conference room at Lima's Defines Hotel and Conference Center.</p>

<p>China "hosted" the meeting this year, after Xi and Biden met a year ago on the APEC sidelines in northern California, a gathering hosted by the US. They had much to discuss, including China's indirect support for Russia, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. On artificial intelligence, the two agreed on the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>There's much uncertainty about what lies ahead in the US-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to levy 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

<p>Already, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45 per cent next year.</p>

<p>In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory over Vice-President Kamala Harris, Xi called for the US and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era. In front of the cameras Saturday, Xi spoke to Biden -- but it was unmistakable that his message was directed at Trump.</p>

<p>"In a major flourishing sci-tech revolution, neither decoupling nor supply chain disruption is a solution," Xi said. "Only mutual, beneficial cooperation can lead to common development. Small yard, high fence is not what a major country should pursue."</p>

<p>Biden administration officials would advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Sullivan said Biden had reinforced to Xi "that these next two months are a time of transition", and the president would like to pass it off "in stable terms" to the new administration.</p>

<p>Biden has viewed his relationship with Xi as among the most consequential on the international stage and put much effort into cultivating it. The two first got to know each other on travels across the US and China when both were vice-presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression.</p>

<p>But the last four years have presented a steady stream of difficult moments.</p>

<p>The FBI this week offered new details of a federal investigation into Chinese government efforts to hack into US telecommunications networks. The initial findings have revealed a "broad and significant" cyberespionage campaign aimed at stealing information from Americans who work in government and politics.</p>

<p>US intelligence officials also have assessed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Biden is looking for Xi to step up Chinese engagement to prevent an already dangerous moment with North Korea from further escalating.</p>

<p>Biden, South Korean President Yoon Seok Yul and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday condemned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's decision to send thousands of troops to help Moscow repel Ukrainian forces who have seized territory in Russia's Kursk border region.</p>

<p>Biden called it "dangerous and destabilising cooperation".</p>

<p>White House officials have expressed frustration with Beijing, which accounts for the vast majority of North Korea's trade, for not doing more to rein in Pyongyang.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Kenneth Kimes and his mother, Sante, infamously known as the Dragon Lady, were convicted of killing New York socialite Irene Silverman in 1998. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Notorious criminal Sante Kimes' son Kenneth, now 49, has opened up about his tumultuous childhood and years as an accomplice to his mother's crimes. "If I could only have an hour with my younger self, I would say, 'buddy … you have to file for emancipation from your parents,'" Kimes told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/16/us/kenneth-kimes-sante-murders-cec/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> from prison. "You have to save yourself."</p>

<p>Kimes and his mother, infamously known as the Dragon Lady, were convicted of killing New York socialite Irene Silverman in 1998.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pair's crimes stretched beyond New York. At the time of Ms Silverman's disappearance, they were wanted for arson, insurance fraud, and a shooting in California, along with a suspected murder in the Bahamas. Their arrests revealed an even darker past. They were linked to a series of crimes involving kidnapping and enslaving domestic workers, including a notorious case in the mid-1980s where Sante Kimes was sentenced to prison for running a human trafficking operation across several states.</p>

<p>When the police arrested them in New York, they discovered incriminating evidence in their car, including weapons, wigs, and personal items belonging to Ms Silverman, including a forged deed to her property. Despite this, the Kimes denied any involvement in Ms Silverman's disappearance.</p>

<p>Sante Kimes called their arrest a "witch hunt" and denied all charges, claiming they were victims of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>In 2000, a jury convicted the Kimes of Ms Silverman's murder, sentencing them to 120 years to life in prison. However, four years later, Kenneth Kimes made a stunning revelation. He confessed to killing the elderly socialite, implicating his mother in the crime in exchange for a plea deal. "I want to make it clear that I did not confess because I wanted to rat my mom out. I confessed because I was afraid of the death penalty for me or her," Kimes said.</p>

<p>Kimes described how he tackled Ms Silverman in her bedroom while his mother turned on the television to mask the noise. He then strangled her, stuffed her body in a car, and dumped it at a construction site in northern New Jersey. Her body was never found. The last time he saw his mother was during his confession in 2004. “When I started confessing, she started crying,” Kimes recalled.</p>

<p>His mother died in 2014 while serving her prison sentence.</p>

<p>Kimes described his childhood as marked by lies, uncertainty, and FBI raids. His mother's 1985 prison sentence for kidnapping and enslaving maids was a significant moment. "It had a huge, damaging effect on my perspective," he said. He also recalled his mother's charisma and manipulative nature, saying, "My mom could make every man in the room feel like the most important person in the planet."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kimes also remembered a brief period of stability with his father after his mother was imprisoned in the 1980s. "It was the most stable period of my young life," he said. However, when his father died suddenly, his mother manipulated him, hiding the news of his death for months.</p>

<p>Now serving time in the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, Kimes has spent years reflecting on his past and the consequences of his upbringing. He often thinks about the lack of intervention during his childhood, and what might have happened if someone had taken him away from his parents. “Maybe I wouldn't have been a high-profile murderer,” he said. “My whole life and criminality is a study on the outcome of lack of prevention. There are many kids like me who are on the road to destruction.”</p>

<p>Kimes has turned to religion and believes he will meet his late partner in heaven. He also regretted his actions and offered an apology to the families of his victims: "To anyone I've harmed, I know it's worthless, but I'm sorry.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Democrats have come under intense scrutiny after the election loss to President-elect Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris' campaign spent over $24,000 on food delivery and ice cream during the 2024 presidential election, a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/16/harris-campaign-spent-24k-uber-eats-ice-cream/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Telegraph </em></a>has claimed, as the Democrats wasted away $1.5 billion in funding received from the donors. From July onwards, Democrats spent $14,974 on food deliveries using Uber Eats and DoorDash, as per the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidates/president/presidential-map/" rel="noindex, nofollow">Federal Election Commission</a></em> data. $8,929 was spent on ice cream pints and parlours such as Sweet Lucy's Ice Cream and Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams. Additionally, a $6,000-"site fee" was paid to the Arizona board game cafe Snakes and Lattes for a Tim Walz visit.</p>

<p>The Democrats have come under intense scrutiny after the election loss to President-elect Donald Trump who spent considerably less than the incumbent party. It is believed that the Harris campaign is currently in $20 million debt.</p>

<p>During the final days of the canvassing trail, Democrats spent $2.6 million on private jet travel, much to the dismay of even hardcore Democrat voters. Between October 1 and October 17, her campaign owed nearly $2.2 million to South Florida-based firm Private Jet Services Group and a further $430,000 to Advanced Aviation Team in Virginia.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-2024-us-presidential-campaign-the-stumbles-and-setbacks-6962561" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Kamala Harris' 2024 US Presidential Campaign: The Stumbles And Setback</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Trump offers to pay Harris campaign</strong></h3>

<p>Days after the election result, Trump took a swipe at the Harris campaign by offering to bail it out of the debt. "I am very surprised that the Democrats, who fought a hard and valiant fight in the 2020 Presidential Election, raising a record amount of money, didn't have lots of $'s left over," Mr Trump posted on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>"Now they are being squeezed by vendors and others. Whatever we can do to help them during this difficult period, I would strongly recommend we, as a Party and for the sake of desperately needed UNITY, do. We have a lot of money left over in that our biggest asset in the campaign was "Earned Media," and that doesn't cost very much," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ro Khanna, a California Congressman did not mince his words in criticising the Harris campaign for its extravagant spending.</p>

<p>"We didn't emphasise the economy. Instead, we spent a billion dollars having concerts all over America. I mean, it was ridiculous," Khanna told the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Despite raising over a billion dollars, the Harris campaign is still pushing donors for more money after the election, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/2024/11/16/kamala-harris-fundraising-1-billion-presidential-election-loss-donald-trump/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Fortune</em></a>. Persistent appeals are being sent to Democrat donors, asking them to chip in with the money to plug the deficit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States has confirmed its first known case of clade 1 mpox, a more severe strain of the virus, in California.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has confirmed its first known case of clade 1 mpox, a more severe strain of the virus, in California, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/s1116-california-first-clade.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CDC</a>). The case, reported on Saturday, has raised concerns, though the CDC stressed that the risk to the public remains low.</p>

<p>The patient recently travelled from Eastern Africa, where an ongoing outbreak is driven by clade 1. Upon arrival in the US, the person sought medical treatment at a local facility and was later released. The CDC confirmed that the patient has been isolating at home and their symptoms are improving. Authorities are working closely with the state and local health departments to trace potential contacts.</p>

<p>Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a viral disease related to smallpox. The virus can spread through close contact, including touching, kissing, or sexual activity, as well as through contaminated materials such as sheets, clothing, and needles. Early symptoms typically include fever, chills, headache, muscle weakness, and exhaustion, followed by a painful or itchy rash that develops into raised lesions which eventually scab over and resolve over several weeks.</p>

<p>The clade 1 strain is associated with more severe illness compared to the more commonly circulated clade II strain, which has been active in the US since the large outbreaks of 2022 and 2023. While the US has mainly been dealing with clade II cases, the more recent outbreaks in Africa have been caused by clade I, known for its higher severity.</p>

<p>The subvariant of clade 1, called clade 1b, has also been causing concern. Travel-related cases of clade Ib have been reported in countries including Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom. Although some of these countries have experienced locally transmitted cases, the CDC noted that no deaths have been reported in these cases so far.</p>

<p>“The recent travel-associated clade 1 mpox cases outside of Africa have all been attributed to subclade Ib; there have been no deaths associated with these cases and available data for a subset has detailed relatively mild disease courses,” the CDC said.</p>

<p>Historically, clade 1 mpox has caused more severe illness and higher mortality rates compared to clade II. However, the CDC pointed out that recent data shows a shift in the pattern of the disease. "While outbreaks of clade 1 mpox used to have death rates around 3 per cent-11 per cent, more recent outbreaks have had death rates as low as approximately 1 per cent when patients received good medical oversight and supportive clinical care," the agency explained. "Death rates are expected to be much lower in countries with stronger healthcare systems and treatment options, including the United States."</p>

<p>In Africa, mpox cases have been rising, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and Uganda. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is monitoring the situation closely and will convene an emergency committee meeting on November 22 to assess whether the current outbreak still qualifies as a public health emergency of international concern.</p>

<p>The CDC advises people to protect themselves by avoiding contact with individuals showing symptoms and contaminated materials like clothing, bedding, and sex toys. Vaccination is recommended for eligible individuals, who should receive two doses of the mpox vaccine to reduce the risk of infection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astrophysicist Adam Frank weighed in on recent US congressional testimony about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/more-than-700-ufo-reports-received-but-no-proof-of-alien-activity-7024724">alleged alien life</a>, dismissing the claims as just “stories”.</p>

<p>Congressional leaders have been exploring the idea that unexplained objects are violating US airspace and that the military may have been secretly recovering these crafts to enhance its technology.</p>

<p>During a Wednesday hearing by the House Oversight Committee, witnesses discussed the evidence surrounding UAPs. One witness said, “What the American people need to know is that the US military and intelligence community are seeing a huge amount of visual and other information, still photos, video photos.” When asked about alien bodies, the witness confirmed, “Yes,” but gave no further details. They also mentioned, “Strong evidence that they are non-human, higher intelligence,” when discussing the nature of UAPs.</p>

<p>In response to these claims, Adam Frank, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Rochester, expressed his scepticism in an interview with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/14/science/video/congress-uaps-alien-life-form-astrophysicist-adam-frank-digvid-contd " rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>. He said, “As you heard one of the speakers saying, well, anecdotally, these are always stories about military or intelligence people who have heard from somebody else, who's heard from somebody else.”</p>

<p>Frank, whose work focuses on the search for life beyond Earth, added, “And I got to tell you, as an astronomer, whose job is all about finding life in the universe, it's very frustrating because these are spectacular claims. And listen, I kind of hope they're true because the most important question for me is, is there life in the universe, but there's never any actual data that a scientist could work with.”</p>

<p>He went on, “And it's been decades now that we've been hearing these stories, and there still is no actual data. So I still have the exact same scepticism. You know, show me the spaceship. Until then, it's a lot of stories.”</p>

<p>The astrophysicist continued to emphasise the need for solid evidence, saying, “My colleagues and I hope that soon we'll have data where we can make a claim that we found alien life. And we expect that, you know, our colleagues are going to come at us hard. If you make a claim that is extraordinary, you need to have pretty strong evidence because, you know, human beings are very easy at fooling themselves, especially about things they want to be true.”</p>

<p>Mr Frank stressed the role of scientific rigour in understanding the unknown. “And we invented science, so we'd have a way to know what was really true. And I am bothered by people making these incredible claims as if, well, that's enough, now we know, and we don't know. You know, this is just believing. I don't want to believe. I want to know. I'm a scientist.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facing questions about an alleged sexual assault and medieval-themed tattoos linked to extremist groups, Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/search?searchtext=pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> would struggle to be confirmed for the job under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>But these are not normal times in Washington.</p>

<p>Hegseth, a Fox News host, was picked by Trump on Tuesday in one of several nominations that wrong-footed even some in his remodeled Republican Party and threw down a challenge to the Senate.</p>

<p>To take up the position as head of the Pentagon and oversee 3.4 million employees, Hegseth will require confirmation from the upper house -- and Trump is publicly pressuring lawmakers to show loyalty to his agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-who-is-pete-hegseth-donald-trumps-pentagon-pick-for-secretary-of-defense-7010987">Who Is Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's Pentagon Pick For Secretary Of Defense</a></p>

<p>Revelations in recent days about the 44-year-old have made his path to power more difficult, including that the thrice-married former soldier was investigated for sexual assault in California in 2017.</p>

<p>No charges were filed over an encounter in a Monterey hotel that saw an unnamed accuser lodge a police report, but the claim has led to questions about the vetting process for the former soldier.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, Hegseth paid an undisclosed sum to the woman several years later as part of a nondisclosure agreement, though he maintained that their encounter was consensual.</p>

<h2><strong>Medieval</strong></h2>

<p>His tattoos have also raised questions, leading to him being stood down by his Army National Guard unit when it was called up for the inauguration of President Joe Biden in 2020.</p>

<p>Speaking on a podcast with fellow veteran Shawn Ryan earlier this month, he revealed that one of his fellow soldiers had flagged him as a possible white nationalist because of his body art.</p>

<p>He claimed it was because of the medieval Jerusalem Cross on his chest, but he also has the words "Deus Vult" on his bicep -- a phrase meaning "God wills it" that was used by anti-Muslim crusaders in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>European medieval imagery and slogans have been widely adopted by white supremacists and neo-Nazis in recent years, but Hegseth says his tattoos simply reflect his faith.</p>

<p>"It's a Christian symbol," the author of a 2020 book entitled "American Crusade" said of the Jerusalem Cross.</p>

<p>His handling of medieval weaponry has gone viral in recent days after a video re-emerged of him taking part in a televised axe-throwing contest which saw him miss the target and strike a bystander, who narrowly escaped serious injury.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump favourite</strong></h2>

<p>His CV includes combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq and he rose to the rank of major in the National Guard -- a lowly status compared to the generals and admirals he would oversee at the Pentagon. Hegseth boasts degrees from elite US universities, including an undergraduate from Princeton and a master's from Harvard.</p>

<p>Square-jawed and outspoken, he came to Trump's attention on the "Fox &amp; Friends Weekend" show that he co-hosts.</p>

<p>"You know the military better than anyone," Trump told him during an appearance in early June, adding that he often thought about putting him in charge of the Pentagon.</p>

<p>A former Republican operative who vetted Hegseth when Trump was considering him for the more junior veterans affairs secretary in 2016 wrote this week that he remained unqualified and an "empty vessel."</p>

<p>Lacking major experience in foreign affairs or congressional politics, Hegseth's only civilian management credential was being CEO of a small non-profit, the former operative Justin Higgins wrote for MSNBC.</p>

<p>"It's not hard to imagine that he would do and say whatever Trump wants," he added.</p>

<p>Hegseth's main policy focus in his books and media appearances is tackling what he calls "woke shit" in the armed forces -- and he has expressed support for purging the top brass.</p>

<p>He told Ryan on his podcast that his experiences taught him that "the bigotry we saw on the outside (of the army) should not be tolerated inside the military" but that progressive efforts to tackle racism and sexism had gone too far.</p>

<p>"The army that I enlisted in, that I swore an oath to in 2001 and was commissioned in 2003 looks a lot different than the army of today because we're focused on a lot of the wrong things," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has begun blasting eerie, unsettling sounds across the border into South Korea, tormenting villagers and disrupting daily life. Residents of Dangsan, a small village near the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), say the relentless noise – from gong-like crashes to ghostly screams – has made life unbearable, with some calling it “noise bombing.”</p>

<p>“It is driving us crazy,” a resident told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/world/asia/north-korea-noise-weapon.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Times</a>. “You can't sleep at night. It's bombing without shells,” she said, describing the unending torment.</p>

<p>Since July, North Korea's loudspeakers have been active for up to 24 hours a day, replacing their traditional propaganda broadcasts with nerve-racking noises. These sounds, described as metallic grinding, howling wolves, or even artillery fire, are taking a psychological toll on villagers, causing insomnia, headaches, and stress.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional propaganda broadcasts, which included music and human voices, these noises have no discernible message. “At least the old broadcasts were human sounds we could bear,” said another resident, reflecting on past tensions.</p>

<p>This auditory assault is part of escalating tensions between the two Koreas. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has abandoned dialogue with South Korea and the US, while South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has intensified military drills with allies and resumed propaganda broadcasts targeting the North.</p>

<p>In May, North Korea retaliated against anti-Kim leaflets sent by defectors in the South by releasing its own balloons filled with trash. Shortly after, the South resumed broadcasting K-pop and news through loudspeakers, which led to the North's eerie counterattack.</p>

<p>“North Korea knows its propaganda no longer works on South Koreans,” said Kang Dong-wan, a North Korea expert. “The goal of its loudspeakers has changed from spreading propaganda to forcing South Korea to stop its own broadcasts and leaflets.”</p>

<p>For Dangsan residents, the psychological toll is immense. Once proud of their quiet rural lifestyle, villagers now seal their windows with Styrofoam and avoid outdoor activities. “The government has abandoned us because we are small in number and mostly old people,” said a 75-year-old resident.</p>

<p>Despite parliamentary visits and emotional pleas for relief, officials have offered little beyond temporary measures like double-pane windows and livestock medication. Villagers fear that they are pawns in a relentless political standoff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The two Koreas must recommit to their old agreements not to slander each other," said Koh Yu-hwan, a former head of the Korea Institute for National Unification. Yet, North Korea recently demolished key transport links and disrupted GPS signals near the border, signalling its intent to escalate further.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gold pocket watch, given to the captain of a steamship that rescued over 700 Titanic passengers, has been sold for a record-breaking $1.96 million -- the highest amount ever paid for memorabilia belonging to the unfortunate ship that sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912 in the Atlantic, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://bid.henryaldridge.com/auctions/9089/henry-10059" rel="Noindex, nofollow">auctioneers </a>Henry Aldridge &amp; Son of Devizes, Wiltshire. The 18-carat Tiffany &amp; Co gold watch was given to Captain Arthur Rostron by Madeleine Astor and two other widows of John Jacob Astor - a wealthy businessman, believed to be the richest man aboard the Titanic when he alongside 1,500 others lost their lives.</p>

<p>Mr Rostron was the skipper of the RMS Carpathia, a passenger steamship that rescued 705 survivors from the Titanic's lifeboats. Carpathia was on its way to Europe from New York when the ship's wireless operator picked up the distress call, "We've struck ice, come at once". The captain changed the course of the ship and headed towards the wreckage of the Titanic with lifeboats floating around.</p>

<p>According to auctioneer Andrew Aldridge, the watch was "presented principally in gratitude for Rostron's bravery in saving those lives, because without Mr Rostron, those 700 people wouldn't have made it". He added that the sale demonstrated the “enduring fascination” with the story of the Titanic.</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Rostron received the watch from Mrs Astor at a lunch at the family's mansion in New York which carried the inscription: "Presented to Captain Rostron with the heartfelt gratitude and appreciation of three survivors of the Titanic April 15th 1912 Mrs John B Thayer, Mrs John Jacob Astor and Mrs George D Widener."</p>

<h3><strong>Previous record</strong></h3>

<p>The previous record for the highest amount ever paid for Titanic memorabilia was set in April, earlier this year when another gold pocket watch, recovered from John Jacob Astor's body was sold for $1.46 million. The watch, engraved with the initials JJA was recovered a week after the disaster when Astor's body was pulled out.</p>

<p>The violin that was played as the Titanic plunged into the icy waters, held the record for the highest amount paid for a Titanic item for 11 years, having been sold for $1.38 million in 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs, facing serious sex trafficking and abuse charges, is trying to contact potential witnesses and sway public opinion from jail to influence the jurors, prosecutors have claimed. Combs, who is in Brooklyn jail, recently proposed a $50 million bail package. He has been denied bail thrice earlier with several judges citing a risk that he could tamper with evidence.</p>

<p>Opposing Combs' multi-million-dollar bail proposal in a Manhattan court filing on Friday, the prosecutors said a review of his recorded calls from jail has revealed that he asked his family members to reach out to witnesses and influence their narratives.</p>

<p>Over the call, he also discussed marketing strategies to shape public opinion, according to the prosecutors.</p>

<p>The matter will be heard this week.</p>

<p>"The defendant has shown repeatedly - even while in custody - that he will repeatedly flout rules in order to improperly impact the outcome of his case," the prosecutors said. "The defendant has shown that he cannot be trusted to abide by rules or conditions."</p>

<p>Stating that he has been violating rules since his arrival at the prison in September, the prosecutors alleged Combs' behaviour indicates that he wants to blackmail the victims and witnesses into silence or change their testimonies in his favour.</p>

<p>Combs also encouraged his children to post a birthday tribute video on social media, which the rapper believed would impact the jurors, said prosecutors. Together, all these actions demonstrate a pattern of manipulation and witness intimidation, they argued.</p>

<p>Combs, 55, is accused of sexually abusing dozens of women after coercing them into his drug-fuelled parties and silencing victims with threats and violence. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

<p>His trial is set to begin on May 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"I have now spoken with the head of the Shin Bet and expressed the urgent need to investigate and deal with those responsible for the incident as soon as possible," Herzog said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The incident comes after a drone attack targeting the same residence on October 19, which was later claimed by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-claims-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-says-some-of-its-fighters-captured-6848518">Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah</a>.</p>

<p>Netanyahu at the time accused Hezbollah of attempting to assassinate him and his wife.</p>

<p>Since September 23, Israel has escalated its bombing of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops after almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire begun by Hezbollah militants over the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Caesarea is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of the Haifa city area, which Hezbollah has regularly targeted.</p>

<p>Two people were injured when a synagogue was hit in Haifa by a "heavy rocket barrage" from Hezbollah earlier Saturday, the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>Separately, the army said it had intercepted some of the "approximately 10 projectiles" that crossed from Lebanon into Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah claimed several rocket attacks on northern Israel, saying it targeted military sites including a naval base in the Haifa area.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated fracking magnate and climate change skeptic Chris Wright as energy secretary on Saturday, tasking him with "cutting red tape" which the new administration hopes will drive investment in fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'" Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Wright is a founder of Liberty Energy, which serves the energy companies that have massively increased US fossil fuel production in recent years by extracting oil and gas from shale fields in a process known as "fracking."</p>

<p>"My dedication to bettering human lives remains steadfast, with a focus on making American energy more affordable, reliable, and secure," Wright said on X after Trump's announcement.</p>

<p>"Energy is the lifeblood that makes everything in life possible... I am looking forward to getting to work."</p>

<p>In a previous LinkedIn post, Wright had denied there is a "climate crisis."</p>

<p>"There is no climate crisis and we are not in the midst of an energy transition either," he said, adding that "the term carbon pollution is outrageous" because all life depended on carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as clean energy or dirty energy, all energy sources have impacts on the world both positive and negative," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>Drilling</strong></h2>

<p>During his election campaign, Trump -- who calls climate change a hoax -- promised to boost the domestic fossil fuel industry in order to bring down energy prices that have driven inflation.</p>

<p>He also pledged to tear up environmental regulations and the United States' commitments to combat climate change under the landmark 2015 Paris accords.</p>

<p>Wright will devise policy alongside North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, head of the newly created National Energy Council.</p>

<p>"We will DRILL BABY DRILL, expand ALL forms of Energy production to grow our Economy, and create good-paying jobs," Trump said Friday as he announced Burgum's appointment.</p>

<p>Wright has repeatedly criticized efforts by outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden to encourage America's transition to a low-carbon energy model and has downplayed the importance of solar.</p>

<p>His views put him notably at odds with Trump's key backer and informal advisor Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, who started the electric car company and invested heavily in solar out of fear of the impact of climate change.</p>

<h2><strong>Controversial picks</strong></h2>

<p>Trump, 78, began shaping his new administration this week with a series of relatively mainstream Republican choices, including conservative Florida senator and foreign policy hawk Marco Rubio for secretary of state.</p>

<p>But then came nominations for leaders of sprawling federal departments in his new government who have little or no relevant experience -- but a history of loyalty to the incoming president.</p>

<p>Among the most controversial were attorney general pick Matt Gaetz, a former congressman once investigated for alleged sex trafficking, as well as Fox News host and national guard veteran Pete Hegseth, who was nominated to lead the Pentagon despite a thin CV.</p>

<p>Like Wright, they will require approval by the Republican-dominated Senate where Trump has warned lawmakers not to stand in his way or to even skip the oversight process all together.</p>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist, has been nominated to be the new health secretary, while former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who has regularly echoed Kremlin talking points, was offered the job of director of national intelligence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

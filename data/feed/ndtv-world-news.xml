       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A riot has broken out in UK's Leeds after police were called to attend an incident involving some agency workers and children, officials said on Thursday night.</p>

<p>According to West Yorkshire Police, they were called to an ongoing incident at Luxor Street, Harehills, at 5 p.m. on Thursday. On arrival, officers "found an ongoing disturbance which involved some agency workers and some children."</p>

<p>Soon, a crowd started to gather at the location after which officers decided to remove the agency workers and the children to a safe place. However, tensions grew and "pockets of disorder" broke out in the area.</p>

<p>Purported footage shared on social media showed a large crowd of people in the street and a police car being flipped onto its side while a bus was being set on fire.</p>

<p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper took to social media platform X to condemn the violence.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From flights to supermarkets to banking operations, the global Microsoft outage is disrupting multiple sectors and threatens to lead to massive issues if it is not resolved soon.&nbsp;In India, three air carriers -- IndiGo,&nbsp;SpiceJet and Akasa Air -- are facing technical issues that are affecting booking, check-in and flight updates. The airlines are now checking in passengers manually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Akasa Air said some of their online services are currently unavailable.

<p>Among the countries worst affected is Australia.&nbsp;According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/australia-news-live-cfmeu-fallout-continues-energy-ministers-to-discuss-cost-of-living-20240719-p5juwi.html">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>, the outage has hit ABC News 24 that struggled to play news packages. The crisis then hit Woolworths supermarkets where checkout systems crashed due to the outage. Several customers also complained that their cards are not working. Police systems went down too.</p>

<p>Melbourne airport said in a statement that check-in process of several airlines are affected due to a global technology issue. Virgin Australia has said the outage is preventing all planes from coming and going at Sydney Airport. "The airline has put a stop on in-and-out flights, so it's a complete ground stop; there's no flights coming in and there's no flights going out," a staff member said at the Virgin Australia lounge, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>The London Stock Exchange, reports said, has been affected by the outage. The US' Federal Aviation Administration has said all&nbsp;flights from several major US airlines – including Delta, United and American Airlines – were grounded Friday morning due to a communication issue.&nbsp;911 emergency services in several states of the US have been hit too. British news channel Sky News is off the air.</p>

<p>As for Europe, technical issues are causing check-in delays in Amsterdam. At&nbsp;Berlin Brandenburg airport in Germany, flight operations had to cancelled due to the "technical problem", a spokeswoman told AFP. She said she cannot say when flight movement would resume.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Millions of Windows users worldwide are experiencing the Blue Screen of Death that is causing computers to shut down or restart. In some cases, computers are restarting repeatedly, affecting services as users lose unsaved data and critical time.</p>

<p>As the systems shut down, a message on the screen says, "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you."</p>

<p>Blue Screen errors, also known as black screen errors or STOP code errors, can occur when a critical issue forces Windows to unexpectedly shut down or restart.</p>

<p>Microsoft 365 has said in a statement that they are investigating the issue.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft Inc. said the error is due to a recent CrowdStrike update.</p>

<p>According to Microsoft's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://status.cloud.microsoft/" target="_blank">Service Health Status</a> updates, the preliminary root cause is "a configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads (that has) caused interruption between storage and compute resources, and which (has) resulted in connectivity failures..."</p>

<p>These failures, the company said, had affected "downstream (and dependent) Microsoft 365 services".</p>

<p>CrowdStrike Engineering - a cybersecurity services firm that works with Microsoft - has identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes.</p>

<p>The company has posted steps for resolution for affected Windows users.</p>

<h3><strong>Workaround</strong></h3>

<div class="sp_only-ul-ol sp_only-ul-ol-2">
<ol>
	<li>Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment.</li>
	<li>Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory.</li>
	<li>Locate the file matching C-00000291*.sys and delete it.</li>
	<li>Boot the host normally.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3><strong>What Microsoft Said</strong></h3>

<p>In a detailed thread on X, the software services giant said it is "investigating an issue impacting users ability to access various Microsoft 365 apps and services".</p>

<p>Blue Screen errors, also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors, can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly.</p>

<h3><strong>What Caused Microsoft Windows Error</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft said the preliminary root cause was a "configuration change" in a portion of its Azure backend workloads.</p>

<p>It caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections, the US-based company said.</p>

<h3><strong>Microsoft Services That Are Hit</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft said the impacted services include:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- PowerBI: Users may notice that their service is in read-only mode while we address impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Fabric: Users may notice that their service is in read-only mode while we address impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Teams: Users may be unable to leverage Microsoft Teams functions including presence, group chats, and user registration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft 365 admin center: Admins may be intermittently unable to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and any action may be delayed if accessible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Purview: Users will see a delay in events being processed in Microsoft Purview.</p>

<p>- Viva Engage: Users may be unable to access Viva Engage.</p>

<h3><strong>Microsoft Services That Have Been Recovered</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft said its "internal telemetry and customer signals" indicate that the following services have recovered:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Defender: Users may be intermittently unable to access the Microsoft Defender portal. Additionally, users may notice delays of up to two hours when raising new detections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: Admins and users may notice API requests failing and errors when opening Alerts in the Alerts page. &nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Intune: Users may experience failures with device check-in, syncing and device enrollment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft OneNote: Users may be unable to sync content, have delays syncing notebooks, or may be unable to open notebooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- OneDrive for Business: Users may be unable to access OneDrive for Business content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- SharePoint Online: Users may be unable to access SharePoint Online sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Windows 365: Admins may be unable to manage existing Cloud PCs or provision new Cloud PCs. End users in the impacted region may not be able to access their Cloud PC.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Microsoft Outage Hits Flight Ops In India</strong></h3>

<p>In India, airlines Spicejet and Akasa Air said they were facing technical issues that affected their booking, check-in, and flight updates.</p>

<p>"We're currently facing a technical issue in providing updates on flight disruptions. Our team is actively working to resolve this issue. We regret for any inconvenience caused and will update you once the issue is resolved. Thank you for your patience and co-operation," Spicejet said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Akasa Air said some of their online services, including bookings and check-ins were temporarily unavailable due to "infrastructure issues" with their service provider.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 39 people have been killed and over 2,500 have sustained injuries in Bangladesh after clashes between students, government supporters and armed police following protests against service job quotas.</p>

<p>The demonstrations began last month after the High Court reinstated a quota system, reserving 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of freedom fighters and veterans from the 1971 War of Independence.</p>

<p>However, the Supreme Court has since suspended the High Court's order and is set to hear the government's challenge on August 7.</p>

<p>In 2018, the quota system was scrapped by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government following similar student-led protests.</p>

<h3><strong>What do Bangladesh protestors demand?</strong></h3>

<p>The protesters are demanding the government scrap the quota system, which they claim benefits only the ruling Awami League party led by Sheikh Hasina. Prime Minister Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been accused of using the quota system to reward her party's loyalists. Protestors allege the system is unfair and limits their job opportunities.</p>

<p>However, Prime Minister Hasina, refusing to accept any demands, has referred to the protesters as "razakar", an offensive term used to describe those who betrayed the country by collaborating with the Pakistani army in 1971.</p>

<h3><strong>What is quota system in Bangladesh?</strong></h3>

<p>The quota system in Bangladesh was introduced in 1972 and has undergone several changes since then. Before it was abolished in 2018, the system reserved 56 per cent of government jobs for various groups, but the majority of these quotas benefited freedom fighters' families.</p>

<p>Here's how the quotas were allocated:</p>

<p>Women: 10 per cent<br />
Underdeveloped districts: 10 per cent<br />
Indigenous communities: 5 per cent<br />
Disabled people: 1 per cent<br />
The system has now been reinstated again.</p>

<h3><strong>Situation in Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Violence erupted across Bangladesh as police and protesters clashed in various parts of the country, including the capital, Dhaka. The protests, although going on for weeks, took a dark turn on Wednesday when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on TV to address the escalating clashes. However, her appearance on a national broadcasting channel seemed to have the opposite effect, as the demonstrators set fire to the country's state broadcaster building on Thursday.</p>

<p>The unrest also led to widespread disruption of communication services on Friday, with internet and mobile services cut off in many areas. The protesters, comprising students, were armed with sticks and rocks, and attempted to shut down transportation services nationwide. Police cracked down on protesters, firing rubber bullets, sound grenades and tear gas to disperse them, reported Reuters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Major US carriers including American Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines issued ground stops on Friday morning citing communication issues. US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said the department was monitoring the flight cancellation and delay issues at Frontier, adding that the agency will hold the company and all other airlines "to their responsibilities to meet the needs of passengers".</p>

<p>Microsoft, in a statement, said it was taking "mitigation actions" after service issues. "Our services are still seeing continuous improvements while we continue to take mitigation actions," the company said in a post on X.</p>

<p>"We remain committed in treating this event with the highest priority and urgency while we continue to address the lingering impact for the Microsoft 365 apps that are in a degraded state," the company added.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Blue Screen of Death</strong></h2>

<p>Blue Screen errors, also known as black screen errors or STOP code errors, can occur when a critical issue forces Windows to unexpectedly shut down or restart. You may encounter a message stating, "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer" or a similar notification.</p>

<p>These errors can stem from hardware or software problems. If you recently installed new hardware and encountered a Blue Screen error, try shutting down your PC, removing the new hardware, and attempting to restart. If restarting poses difficulty, you can initiate your PC in safe mode. For detailed steps, refer to the instructions on starting your PC in safe mode in Windows.</p>

<p>Additionally, consider updating Windows with the latest patches through Windows Update, seeking assistance from other sources, or restoring Windows to a previous restore point.</p>

<h3>How to Fix Windows Blue Screen Error</h3>

<p>If none of these measures resolve the Blue Screen error, utilize the Blue Screen Troubleshooter available in the Get Help app:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Open the Get Help app in Windows.</li>
	<li>Type "Troubleshoot BSOD error" in the search bar of the Get Help app.</li>
	<li>Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the Get Help app.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump: Before Thomas Matthew Crooks aimed his AR-15 gun at Former US President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, his father contacted the police, concerned about his son's location.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Thomas Matthew Crooks aimed his AR-15 gun at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/too-painful-wont-narrate-again-donald-trump-recounts-being-shot-at-6137658">former US President Donald Trump</a> during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, his father contacted the police, concerned about his son's location when a gun, one of the many he owned, was missing from their home.</p>

<p>The call, another red flag in a series of warnings to law enforcement before the attack, came from Crooks' father Matthew Crooks after his son disappeared without any notice, a report by BBC said.</p>

<p>While some reports suggest the call happened before the shootingm others suggest Matthew Crooks called police after the shooting.</p>

<p>The gun, used by Crooks in the unsuccessful assassination bid, was identified as his father's 5.56 caliber AR-style rifle which he purchased in 2013, police said. Police sources told NBC that Crooks purchased 50 rounds of ammunition hours before the shooting.</p>

<p>When police searched Crooks' home in Bethel Park, some 85 km from the Trump rally, over a dozen firearms were found inside. As per Pennsylvania law, gun owners do not have to store their firearms in a lock box or other locked storage, but they are encouraged to do so.</p>

<p>Police also found that ahead of the attack, the 20-year-old made several online searches related to Trump as well as his rival US President Biden. He also searched "major depressive disorder" as well as the Democratic National Convention to be held for August.</p>

<p>Reports said police found that he had images of Trump, Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Chris Wray and a member of the British Royal Family.</p>

<p>The FBI also found a metal box of explosives in the car which Crooks drove to the rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crooks' motive in the shooting remains unclear but the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have launched investigations. Currently, the FBI are were sifting through Crooks' phone and other electronic devices.</p>

<p>While the motive behind the attack is still unclear, preliminary investigation found that he climbed onto the roof of a nearby building outside the rally, some 300 metres away from where Trump was on stage.</p>

<p>The bullet missed Trump by a few inches but grazed the top of his right ear. Amid chaos and screams, Trump was ushered off stage by Secret Service agents with blood smeared on his face.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Torrential rains causing historic flooding in southern Brazil have revealed a "very well-preserved" dinosaur fossil dating back some 200 million years, according to the research team who discovered it.</p>

<p>The fossil was first identified in May near the city of Sao Joao do Polesine, some 280 kilometres (170 miles) west of Porto Alegre, in a part of the Brazilian pampas dubbed the country's 'El Dorado' of paleontology.</p>

<p>A team of paleontologists from the Federal University of Santa Maria spent four days excavating the fossil to remove the block of rock containing a "near complete" dinosaur fossil to take back to their research centre for the study.</p>

<p>Initial findings have determined the fossil was a specimen of the Herrerasauridae family, which were bipedal carnivores with long tails found in the area of modern-day Brazil and Argentina.</p>

<p>The fossil dates to the Triassic period, between 250 to 200 million years ago.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Temp Muller, who's leading the research effort, told AFP that the fossil is possibly the second most complete fossil of a Herrerasauridae specimen to date.</p>

<p>The most complete was found in the same part of Brazil in 2014, leading to the identification of a new species with hooked claws, dubbed gnathovorax cabreirai.</p>

<p>The fossil will undergo several rounds of analysis before researchers can determine whether the specimen is a member of the same species.</p>

<p>"We have to be very careful with this work, it's very meticulous, almost surgical," Muller said, adding the process could take "several months."</p>

<p>"Every little part that we might damage will be a bit of information that we might not be able to recover."</p>

<p>Once the analysis is done, Muller's team will publish the results in a scientific journal.</p>

<h3><strong>Erosion acceleration&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The heavy rains that affected the pampas in May killed more than 180 people in Brazil and caused major damage to infrastructure.</p>

<p>The floods revealed the fossil much earlier by "accelerating erosion," a silver lining to researchers, who would not have discovered it until much later, according to Muller.</p>

<p>The downpour is not without its drawbacks, however, as heavy rainfall "also destroys a lot of the material" from the fossils, especially small fragments.</p>

<p>Paleontologists maintain a close watch on the fossil deposit as a result, especially any fragments that may be exposed, and focus their efforts during excavations to recover these fossils in the best possible condition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Republican nominee appeared at the RNC just days after an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally. On July 13, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks opened fire on the former US President. The bullet whizzed past Trump's ear.</p>

<p>The Secret Service quickly came to his rescue and pulled him down behind the dais before Trump rose and pumped his fist in the air, shouting "fight! fight! fight!". Agents rushed to his side and escorted him to safety.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the close shave, Trump attended the convention and even announced his running mate, JD Vance, earlier this week. The pair are set to lock horns with Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>"I'm not supposed to be here tonight," Donald Trump said in his first speech since he was injured by a 20-year-old gunman at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.</li>
	<li>He said he heard a "loud whizzing sound" and "felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear". "I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet,'" he said.</li>
	<li>Trump said he moved his hand to his ear and brought it down, and it "was covered with blood, just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack."</li>
	<li>He also recalled how Secret Service agents rushed to the stage as bullets flew, pouncing on top of him to keep him safe.</li>
	<li>"The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together," he said.</li>
	<li>He also praised his supporters at the rally, saying they turned to look for the sniper instead of breaking into a stampede. "They knew I was in trouble. They didn't want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. Incredible people," Trump said.</li>
	<li>"I wanted to do something to let him know I was okay. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting, and started shouting, 'Fight, fight, fight!," he said.</li>
	<li>"For the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening," he said.</li>
	<li>Trump insisted he would never recount the moment when he nearly lost his life again.</li>
	<li>"So many people have asked me, 'What happened? Tell us what happened, please," he said. But "you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's actually too painful to tell."</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump, 78, began his keynote address at the 2024 GOP convention by describing how he narrowly survived an attempt on his life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, who survived an assassination attempt last weekend, said that our planet is on the "edge of World War III." He then claimed he could end "every single international crisis," including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>At the Republican National Convention (RNC) 2024, which came to a close on Thursday night, Trump formally accepted the party's nomination.</p>

<p>"Our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III... this will be a war like no other," Trump said while addressing his supporters at the event.</p>

<p>"I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created - including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president, and the war caused by the attack on Israel, which never would have happened if I were president," he added.</p>

<p>He also said he wanted Americans held abroad to be released -- or else.</p>

<p>"The entire world, I tell you this: we want our hostages back and they better be back before I assume office or you will be paying a very big price," said Trump -- again failing to give any specifics.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old started his keynote address at the 2024 GOP convention, describing how he narrowly survived an attempt on his life, noting he could only be there "by the grace of Almighty God."</p>

<p>He asserted that this was the only time he would recount the July 13 incident because it was too painful to recall.</p>

<p>Remembering the incident, he explained that he heard a "loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear".</p>

<p>"I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet'," he added.</p>

<p>While Trump was speaking, a few photographs of the former president from the July 13 incident were displayed on screens behind him.</p>

<p>During his speech, he even lauded the Secret Service agents, who rushed to his side, and then paid tribute to the volunteer firefighter, Corey Comperatore, who was killed, reports said.</p>

<p>Trump also stressed that he was "running to be president for all of America, not half of America because there is no victory in winning for half of America".</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Trump came just months ahead of the high-on-stakes US presidential elections slated for November 5, 2024.</p>

<p>The Democratic National Convention is expected to take place next month in Chicago, with US President Joe Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 a few days ago, still the frontrunner to retain the nomination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The protest caused significant traffic delays and accidents, with costs exceeding 1.8 million pounds.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five environmental activists-including Roger Hallam and Daniel Shaw-have been convicted for their roles in the November 2022 M25 motorway disruption, according to <em>the BBC</em>. The protest, coordinated by Just Stop Oil, was intended to block the road and resulted in major traffic jams, accidents, and delays that lasted for almost four days. The financial costs of the event were estimated to be over 1.8 million pounds (Rs 19,47,28,935).</p>

<p>Hallam was sentenced to five years in prison, the other three to four years each. The protestors' "intricate planning and the level of sophistication involved" on climate change activism were highlighted by the court. With regard to the new rules intended to quell disruptive protests, this is the longest punishment.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880xjx54mpo"><em>news outlet</em></a>, in the M25 protest case, Whittaker De Abreu and Gethin were arrested near the motorway dressed for climbing, while Lancaster rented a safe house and bought climbing gear for the activists.</p>

<p>Lancaster defended her actions as necessary due to the perceived failure of democratic methods, calling the climate crisis a critical issue.</p>

<p>Gethin stated the disruption was intended to be minimal and blamed those in power for failing to address climate change seriously. Hallam, who had previously rejected direct action for conventional campaigning, was disruptive in court, leading to three arrests and encouraging supporters to protest outside the court.</p>

<p>This resulted in the arrest of 11 protesters for contempt, but charges were later dropped. Hallam claimed the judiciary was corrupt and manipulated, framing his actions as necessary for climate justice.</p>

<p>The new law under which the activists were sentenced, introduced in 2022, criminalises direct action causing serious public harm. The judge emphasised the law's intent to treat such actions severely, with sentences up to 10 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An explosion in Tel Aviv early Friday left one person dead, an Israeli emergency services spokesperson told AFP, with the army saying a falling "aerial target" caused the blast.</p>

<p>Emergency services said the explosion took place around 03:15 am (0015 GMT) in a building in the centre of the city. Two people were lightly injured, Zaki Heller of the Magen David Adom medical service said.</p>

<p>An earlier police report had said seven people were injured, but they were mainly in a state of shock, Heller added.</p>

<p>The army said an initial inquiry showed that the explosion was "caused by the falling of an aerial target".</p>

<p>"No sirens were activated," it said in a statement, adding that the air force had "increased its air patrols in order to protect Israeli airspace".</p>

<p>A resident of central Tel Aviv told AFP he had been woken by a loud explosion.</p>

<p>"Everything shook," he said.</p>

<p>Police found a body bearing injuries caused by shrapnel in the building, which is located on the corner of Ben-Yehuda Avenue and Shalom-Aleichem Street, not far from an annexe of the US Embassy in Israel, spokesperson Dean Elsdunne said.</p>

<p>"It may have been an aerial explosion... We were very lucky," said Peretz Amar, a Tel Aviv police commander at the scene, adding an investigation was "ongoing".</p>

<p>"The police, along with emergency and rescue forces, discovered a man in his 50s in a nearby building who was found dead in his apartment, with shrapnel wounds on his body," a police statement said.</p>

<p>Another 10 people with minor injuries were taken for medical treatment, it said.</p>

<p>Police and bomb disposal units were deployed to the scene and conducted searches for suspicious objects and additional threats, the statement added.</p>

<p>Residents were urged to "respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives", it said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This statement came during the 78-year-old's speech at the Republican National Convention, his first public appearance since the assassination attempt.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has publicly appreciated the Secret Service agent who killed Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old man behind the assassination attempt on the former US President at a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump praised the agent, stating the sniper "took him out with one shot."</p>

<p>His word of appreciation came during the 78-year-old's <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/rnc-republican-national-convention-07-18-24/index.html">speech at the Republican National Convention</a> on Thursday night, his first public appearance since the assassination attempt. In the speech, Trump vowed to deliver "the four greatest years in the history of our country" and called for unity, stating "I'm running to be president for all of America." Trump also shared details about the recent attempt on his life, saying he was grateful for the "outpouring of love and support" from Americans.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee was shot at on July 13 by Thomas Crooks, who allegedly used a ladder to climb a nearby building before targeting Trump with an AR-style rifle from approximately 130 yards away. The attack occurred at 6:12 pm, resulting in chaos. Trump's ear was nicked, one rally attendee was killed, and two others were injured. The Secret Service immediately reacted, shooting and killing Crooks within 26 seconds.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-explains-why-he-asked-about-his-shoes-amid-shooting-chaos-6117844">earlier interview</a>, Donald Trump revealed that a slight turn of his head to read a chart likely saved him from the fatal bullet wound fired by Crooks, which just grazed his ear.</p>

<p>Trump vividly described the following moments, during which Secret Service agents sprang into action, yelling "Get down" and tackling him to the ground with force. He showed off a bruise on his arm he got when the agents grabbed him.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee was rushed to the hospital, where medical professionals told him that he was "supposed to be dead." The doctor described his survival as a "miracle," stating that he had never seen anyone survive an AR-15 rifle wound.</p>

<p>Trump praised the Secret Service for quickly taking down the shooter, describing his actions as "fantastic". He even pointed to his nose, indicating where the agents hit the shooter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Google will be named the official search AI partner of Team USA, marking the first time a tech company has partnered with a sports nonprofit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet's Google will infuse artificial intelligence into the U.S. broadcast of the Paris Olympics, allowing sports commentators to use AI to explain competitions, the tech company said on Thursday alongside NBCUniversal and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.</p>

<p>Google will be named the official search AI partner of Team USA, marking the first time a tech company has partnered with the sports nonprofit, the three organizations said in a statement.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as NBCUniversal, which broadcasts the Games in the U.S., is modernizing its coverage to attract audiences who do not watch live television and young viewers who have grown up accustomed to watching clips online.</p>

<p>The Comcast-owned media company previously said it would launch personalized AI-generated daily recaps of the competition that will be narrated by AI versions of people such as sports commentator Al Michaels.</p>

<p>During daytime and primetime coverage of the Olympics, NBCUniversal's anchors will use Google Search's AI overviews to answer questions about some sports, such as the importance of pool-lane assignments in swimming competitions.</p>

<p>Google's AI overviews provide written responses to search queries without the need to click a website link.</p>

<p>Comedian Leslie Jones, who will serve as a commentator in Paris, will use Google's Gemini AI model to learn new sports and entertain viewers, the companies said.</p>

<p>The Paris Olympics begin July 26.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump predicted an "incredible victory" Thursday in accepting the Republican presidential nomination from a party euphoric over his escape from assassination and buoyed by the apparent implosion of Joe Biden's reelection campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump predicted an "incredible victory" Thursday in accepting the Republican presidential nomination from a party euphoric over his escape from assassination and buoyed by the apparent implosion of Joe Biden's reelection campaign.</p>

<p>"We will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country," Trump, 78, said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>It was his first speech since a 20-year-old man shot at him, causing a wound to one ear and killing a bystander during a rally last weekend.</p>

<p>In an emotional retelling of the shooting, where Trump said he had "God on my side," the ex-president asked for a moment of silence to honour the victim, firefighter Corey Comperatore. Before a hushed crowd, he kissed the late firefighter's helmet on the stage.</p>

<p>Trump took the stage to chants of "USA" from a crowd which has spent the week talking of him in near-divine terms.</p>

<p>Warm-up acts included shirt-ripping 1980s wrestling icon Hulk Hogan and conspiracy theorist and far-right media guru Tucker Carlson, who described Trump's survival as a historic moment.</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt, Trump became the "leader of a nation," Carlson said.</p>

<p>But while the speech had been touted as the launch of a less abrasive, more unity-seeking Trump, he soon reverted to his familiar painting of America as an apocalyptic ruin that needs saving.</p>

<p>Promising to complete a wall on the US-Mexican border, he said an "invasion" of immigrants had brought "destruction" and "misery" to a "nation in decline."</p>

<p>He vowed to end Biden's massive spending on fighting climate change, calling it a "scam."</p>

<p>He again made his false claim that Democrats cheated in his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election. And, despite aides promising that Trump would not even say Biden's name in the speech, Trump did refer to his opponent and "the damage" he has done.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump flips script&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Despite a torrent of scandals, impeachment for his unprecedented attempt to overturn the 2020 election, and 34 felony convictions in May at a New York criminal trial, Trump is on the rise in polls ahead of November.</p>

<p>Now, with Republicans more in step behind him than ever, he is bullish about a shock return to power.</p>

<p>Attempting to flip the script on accusations that he intends to rule as an authoritarian leader, Trump insisted that he is "the one saving democracy" and referred to his criminal investigations as "witch hunts."</p>

<p>"We must not criminalize dissent," he said.</p>

<p>Trump's love-fest in Milwaukee contrasted with the crisis engulfing Biden, 81.</p>

<p>The Democratic president looked close late Thursday to being forced by his own party to withdraw and make way for Vice President Kamala Harris or another candidate, as fears spiral that his faltering physical health will lead to a loss in November.</p>

<p>Senior Trump advisor Jason Miller told AFP that "nothing fundamentally changes" for Trump if Biden drops out.</p>

<p>Trump's family was in attendance, with son Eric rousing the crowd into a chant of "fight, fight, fight!"</p>

<p>Trump's wife Melania, who has been mostly absent throughout the campaign, arrived to applause but did not speak -- a remarkable break with US political convention at such events.</p>

<h3><strong>Martial arts CEO, preacher&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Supporters have been lining up all week to applaud the former president for his bravery since the weekend attack by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>Others addressing the convention included Trump's longtime friend Dana White, chief executive of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Trump has attended multiple UFC bouts as he seeks to lock in younger male voters.</p>

<p>Striking a different tone, evangelist preacher Franklin Graham -- whose father was a spiritual adviser to multiple US presidents -- led a lengthy prayer for Trump.</p>

<p>With Biden still reeling from the aftermath of his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month, polls show a gap gradually opening in the long-close race.</p>

<p>The Republican campaign has even been talking up Trump's chances in Democratic strongholds like Minnesota and Virginia.</p>

<p>This week also saw Trump name right-wing Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old author of "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling memoir about growing up poor in working-class America, is a former Trump critic who has become one of his staunchest backers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden is expected to make a major announcement on his re-election bid, with several senior Democratic leaders suggesting that he leave the race following his disastrous debate performance, a failed assassination attempt on his rival Donald Trump, his poor health, and falling poll numbers, according to media reports.</p>

<p>“Several people close to President Biden said on Thursday that they believe he has begun to accept the idea that he may not be able to win in November and may have to drop out of the race, bowing to the growing demands of many anxious members of his party,” The New York Times reported.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, is spending time at his Delaware residence in isolation after he was tested positive for COVID-19. Media reports said that top leaders of the Democratic party, including former president Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have asked him to leave the presidential race, in the absence of which the party risks losing the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>“People close to top Democrats said Thursday that it now appeared it was a matter of when—not if—Biden bows out of the presidential race. In the past day or so, former President Barack Obama has told friends who have called him that Biden's path to victory is narrow, according to people familiar with the calls,” The NYT report said.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported Thursday night that Pelosi has stepped up her behind-the-scenes role in working to persuade the president to bow out of campaign. Obama has said that he has a very slight chance of winning the race.</p>

<p>According to The Hill, Vice President Kamala Harris has started looking for options for her running mate. The three being talked about right now are Senator Mark Kelly, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.</p>

<p>Most of the media reports said that Biden's announcement on his re-election bid might come after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>“One of the people close to him warned that the president had not yet made up his mind to leave the race after three weeks of insisting that almost nothing would drive him out. But another said that 'reality is setting in', and that it would not be a surprise if Mr Biden made an announcement soon endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement,” The NYT reported.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, in his acceptance speech today after presidential nomination at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, paid tribute to the man who lost his life during the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania last week.</p>

<p>In his first public address since surviving an assassination attempt, Trump honoured Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was killed by the shooter. He solemnly presented the man's helmet and uniform, kissing them in homage before a hushed crowd. Trump hailed Corey as a "highly respected former fire chief" and recounted how he "lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect others". He asked for a moment of silence to honour the firefighter.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey Comperatore, and seriously wounded two other great warriors, David Dutch and James Copenhaver.<br />

<p>Trump also paid his respects to those injured in the attack, referring to them as "dedicated Trumpsters".</p>

<p>Last week, during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the former US President was struck near the ear in an assassination attempt by a 20-year-old man.</p>

<p>Agents from the Secret Service, the law enforcement agency responsible for protecting US political leaders, swiftly intervened, rushing to the stage and escorting him quickly to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>The gunman and a bystander were killed, and two spectators were critically injured. The man was a 50-year-old firefighter Corey Comperatore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck northern Chile on Thursday, the United States Geological Survey said.</p>

<p>The epicenter of the tremor was located 164 miles (265 kilometers) east of the coastal city of Antofagasta, at a depth of 78.5 miles (126 kilometers).</p>

<p>"So far there are no reports of injuries or major damage, but teams are gathering information," Chilean President Gabriel Boric wrote on X.</p>

<p>Chile is situated along the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.</p>

<p>In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude quake unleashed a tsunami that swept away entire villages in the south and center of the country, leaving about 520 people dead.</p>

<p>Bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Andes mountain range to the east, Chile is also one of the most seismically active countries in the world.</p>

<p>The epicenter of Thursday's earthquake was located about 50 miles from Chile's border with Argentina, and less than 20 miles from its border with Bolivia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

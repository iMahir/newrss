       <description><![CDATA[Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police claimed that "agents of the Government of India" use criminals - referring specifically to the Bishnoi gang - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an explosive allegation Monday, Canada's Royal Canadian&nbsp;Mounted Police claimed that "agents of the Government of India" use criminals - referring specifically to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/bishnoi-gang" target="_blank">Bishnoi gang</a> - to "target (the) South Asian community... specifically pro-Khalistani elements" in that country.</p>

<p>The charge - by RCMP Commissioner Mike Duhene and his deputy, Brigitte Gauvin - follows a sharp escalation in a row that has been festering since Ottawa last year accused "agents" of Delhi of involvement in the killing of Canadian citizen and Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Nijjar.</p>

<p>"It (the Indian government) is targeting the South Asian community... but they are specifically targeting pro-Khalistani elements in Canada. What we have seen, from an RCMP perspective, is that they use organised crime elements," Assistant Commissioner Gauvin told reporters.</p>

<p>"It has been publicly attributed and claimed by one organised crime group in particular - the Bishnoi gang. We believe the group is connected to agents of the Government of India."</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>When asked specifically if "agents of Indian government" were being accused of "homicide, extortion, intimidation, and coercion", Mr Duheme replied with a categorical "yes".</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Indian government has strongly rejected what it calls "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38417" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>", including those by Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing New Delhi of "supporting criminal activity against Canadians" and "coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians".</p>

<p>A statement from the External Affairs Ministry also rejected claims by Ottawa that Sanjay Kumar Verma, posted as the Indian High Commissioner, and five of his staff, are 'persons of interest'.</p>

<p>They have been linked to claims some Indian diplomatic staff work with organised crime elements in Canada to "collect - through questionable and illegal means - information on Canadian citizens... (that is fed to criminal organisations) that would then take violent actions from extortion to murder".</p>

<p>Hours after the RCMP officers' press conference Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters and doubled down on charges against the Indian government.</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil. Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," he said.</p>

<p>The allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity ratings; last week he survived a second parliamentary confidence vote in as many weeks ahead of the 2025 election.</p>

<p>India and Canada have exchanged a second round of tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats, although Delhi later said it was withdrawing its six officials over security concerns. Delhi has ejected Canada's acting High Commissioner, Stewart Wheeler, and his deputy.</p>

<p>On the expulsion of its diplomats, Delhi said, "Sanjay Verma is India's senior-most serving diplomat with a distinguished career spanning 36 years", and called the allegations, old and new, a "strategy of smearing India for political gains".</p>

<p>The Bishnoi gang - led by Lawrence Bishnoi from his prison cell in Gujarat's Sabarmati Jail - has rapidly become of the country's most feared criminal organisations, and even has a base in Canada, where gangster Goldy Brar is based.</p>

<p>With its vast network the Bishnoi gang has, so far, murdered with impunity; the most recent killing was ex-Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique.</p>

<p>Within India the gang is known to be involved in murder and arms trafficking, and extortion of money from high-profile targets like Punjabi singers, the liquor mafia, other prominent businessmen. Its activities are enforced by an army of around 700 hitmen, reports have said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The filmmaker claimed that insiders from the Breakthrough Listen project tipped him off that concrete evidence may be revealed within a month, possibly coinciding with the US election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renowned NASA filmmaker Simon Holland has claimed that Earth-based telescopes have detected signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life, with a potential announcement coming next month. Mr Holland, who has collaborated with the BBC and NASA-funded initiatives, asserted that an Oxford University-backed program dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial signals has made the groundbreaking discovery, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/nasa-filmmaker-claims-evidence-of-alien-life-could-be-revealed-within-the-next-month/">New York Post</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>The filmmaker claimed that insiders from Mark Zuckerberg's Breakthrough Listen project&nbsp;tipped him off that concrete evidence may be revealed within a month, possibly coinciding with the US election.&nbsp;This evidence might be linked to alien signals intercepted by the Parkes telescope in Australia, courtesy of researchers from the Oxford-based Breakthrough Listen initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They found the evidence of a non-human technological signature a few years ago, using the Parkes telescope in Australia," claimed Mr Holland.</p>

<p>The extraordinary claims have sparked a flurry of activity, with astronomers scrambling to gather evidence to substantiate the discovery. However, Simon Holland warns that a rival effort may be underway, suggesting that Chinese researchers might attempt to preempt the announcement.</p>

<p>''This is breaking news, as of yesterday, but the Chinese might be pipping them to the post, with their, FAST [Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope] program. It's the largest telescope in the world since Arecibo,'' Mr Holland told <em>The Mirror.</em></p>

<p>Mr Holland further claimed that Chinese researchers are racing to publish findings on BLC-1 (Breakthrough Listen candidate 1), a promising signal detected by the Parkes Telescope in April 2019. BLC-1, emanating from Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light-years from Earth, is considered significant due to its single-point source origin, narrow band electromagnetic frequency (982 MHz) and Doppler&nbsp;shift, indicating a rotating planet.</p>

<p>Mr Holland believes this signal is unlikely to be human interference, as its characteristics are inconsistent with known natural phenomena. Breakthrough Listen has invested $100 million in telescope time to investigate five potential candidates, including BLC-1.</p>

<p>Dr Andrew Siemion from Berkeley's Breakthrough Listen Science Program confirmed that researchers are still analysing BLC-1. If sufficient data confirms the signal's technological origins, they will publish their findings. The Chinese are allegedly aware of BLC-1's coordinates and may attempt to scoop the announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this news is exciting, it's essential to note that there's currently no conclusive proof of extraterrestrial life. Astrobiologists have been studying the possibility of life beyond Earth, exploring extreme environments and chemically harsh ecosystems that could support life. The search for extraterrestrial life has been ongoing since the mid-20th century, with scientists using various methods to detect signs of life, including telescope data analysis and radio communications.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 26-year-old British man died on Sunday after falling from Spain's tallest bridge, which he had climbed to create social media content, authorities reported on Monday. Accompanied by a 24-year-old fellow Briton, the unidentified victim fell while climbing the cable-stayed bridge in Talavera de la Reina, approximately 70 miles southwest of Madrid, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/british-man-dies-fall-spanish-bridge-online-content">Guardian</a></em> reported.&nbsp;The man reportedly attempted his climb without any safety equipment.&nbsp;Local authorities also cited heavy rainfall in Talavera before the accident, which may have made the bridge's surface slippery, according to Spanish media reports.</p>

<p>"As far as we have been able to learn, they had come to Talavera to climb the bridge and create content for social networks, which has resulted in this disastrous and sad outcome," Talavera city councillor for public security Macarena Munoz said.</p>

<p>She added, ''We have been able to find out, they had come to Talavera to climb the bridge and create content for social networks, which has resulted in this unfortunate and sad outcome.''</p>

<p>According to city officials, climbing the bridge is strictly prohibited, with repeated warnings emphasising that it's not allowed under any circumstances. Despite these warnings, thrill-seeking tourists continue to risk their lives for social media content, resulting in tragic incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have reiterated on many occasions that it cannot be done under any circumstances," said Ms Munoz.</p>

<p>The city council said the man's body has been removed from the scene and taken to a nearby funeral home by a coroner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: ''We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Spain, and are in contact with the local authorities.''</p>

<p>Notably, the Castilla-La Mancha Bridge, towering at 630 feet, is Spain's tallest bridge and one of Europe's most impressive structures. Its striking design features a unique 152-wire rope system, forming a triangular fan-like shape that dominates the Spanish skyline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan Elections: Key issues include price rises, regional security, and disquiet over scandals in Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Campaigning kicked off Tuesday in Japan for an October 27 election in which new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is seeking to retain his long-ruling party's majority.</p>

<p>Loudspeaker trucks began circulating and candidates handed out fliers ahead of the vote. Key issues include price rises, regional security, and disquiet over scandals in Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The LDP has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades, albeit with frequent leadership changes.</p>

<p>Low voter turnout and a divided opposition mean the party and its coalition partner are highly likely to win.</p>

<p>A weekend Kyodo News poll showed that Ishiba's LDP remains the most popular party at 26.4 percent, versus 12.4 percent who intend to vote for the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP).</p>

<p>Former defence minister and self-confessed security policy "geek" Ishiba, 67, won a ruling party leadership election in September and was approved as premier soon afterwards.</p>

<p>He has called a snap election to shore up his mandate for policies that include plans to "re-create" ageing Japan by revitalising depopulated rural areas.</p>

<p>On the diplomatic front, Ishiba has called for revising the Japan-US security treaty to make it better reflect his country's sovereignty.</p>

<p>He also backs the creation of a regional military alliance along the lines of NATO to counter China, although he has cautioned it would "not happen overnight".</p>

<p>Ishiba says his "victory line" for the election would be for the LDP and its junior partner Komeito to maintain a simple majority in parliament's lower house.</p>

<p>But the LDP will need to convince voters jaded by a slush fund scandal that has swept the party along with questions over its lawmakers' ties to the Unification Church.</p>

<p>Ishiba has pledged to "ensure Japan's economy emerges from deflation" and wants to boost incomes through a new stimulus package as well as support for low-income households.</p>

<p>Another thorny issue is the question of whether to allow women to retain their maiden names after marriage, an issue where opposition parties hope to gain liberal support.</p>

<p>The justice ministry says that to the best of its knowledge, Japan is the only nation that requires married couples to choose one of their surnames -- almost always the husbands'.</p>

<p>While the CDP supports allowing married couples to maintain separate surnames, the conservative LDP has been more cautious, citing "traditional family values".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has assured the White House that a planned retaliatory attack on Iran won't target nuclear or oil facilities, US media reported Monday.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to counterattack after Iran fired ballistic missiles at the country on October 1, launched in response to Israel's killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region, along with a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Citing unnamed US officials, the Washington Post said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had reassured the White House that a counterstrike it is contemplating would target only military sites.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, also citing US officials speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pledge came in a call between US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu last week, as well as in conversations in recent days between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant.</p>

<p>The plan "was met with relief in Washington," the Washington Post reported.</p>

<p>Biden has warned Israel against striking Iran's nuclear or oil facilities in order to avoid a further expansion of regional war and amid worries of a spike in global energy prices.</p>

<p>The attack was Iran's second direct attack on Israel after missile and drone fire in April, carried out in response to an air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that is attributed to Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan detected a record 153 Chinese military aircraft around the self-ruled island, official data showed Tuesday, after China held a day of large-scale drills.</p>

<p>The aircraft were spotted in the 25 hours to 6:00 am on Tuesday (2200 GMT Monday), the defence ministry said in a statement -- the most for a single day.</p>

<p>Beijing deployed fighter jets, drones, warships and coast guard boats to encircle Taiwan on Monday, with Taiwan responding by dispatching "appropriate forces" and placing its outlying islands on heightened alert.</p>

<p>Taiwan condemned China's actions as "irrational and provocative", and the US called them "unwarranted".</p>

<p>Japan said Tuesday it had expressed its "concerns" to China over the drills, and scrambled fighter jets near its southern island of Yonaguni.</p>

<p>"The government is closely monitoring the related activities with great interest, and has conveyed Japan's concerns to the Chinese side," deputy chief cabinet secretary Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters.</p>

<p>China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and insisted Monday it will never renounce the use of force to bring the island under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing has ramped up military pressure on Taipei in recent years to accept its claims of sovereignty over the island, and Monday represented the fourth round of large-scale drills in just over two years.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry also recorded 14 Chinese navy ships in the latest 25-hour period, slightly fewer than the 17 announced Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Of the aircraft spotted, 111 crossed the median line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait that separates mainland China and Taiwan, the figures showed.</p>

<p><strong>'Unwarranted'</strong></p>

<p>The United States said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinas-military-encircles-taiwan-us-calls-it-unwarranted-6785647">China's actions on Monday were "unwarranted"</a> and risked "escalation" as it called on Beijing to act with restraint.</p>

<p>China said the drills, dubbed Joint Sword 2024B, were held in areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Beijing declared them over by around 6:00 pm on Monday, about 13 hours after they started.</p>

<p>China said the exercises served as a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-launches-military-drills-around-taiwan-sends-a-stern-warning-to-separatist-forces-6783700">"stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces"</a>.</p>

<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing, which calls him a "separatist".</p>

<p>In his National Day speech on Thursday, Lai vowed to "resist annexation" and insisted that Beijing and Taipei were "not subordinate to each other".</p>

<p>Lai pledged Monday to "protect democratic Taiwan and safeguard national security".</p>

<p>In late May, three days after Lai's inauguration, China launched Joint Sword-2024A, an apparent precursor to the latest drills.</p>

<p>The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to the island in 1949.</p>

<p>China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since then.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lone catamaran named "Silky" patrols waters around the remote island of Malpelo, a refuge that is protected yet full of peril for endangered marine species in the Colombian Pacific.</p>

<p>Its crew of environmentalists is the terror of boats illegally fishing for sharks inside the reserve some 500 kilometers (310 miles) off mainland Colombia -- one of the richest countries in terms of marine fauna.</p>

<p>Without weapons or backup, the activists shoo away intruder vessels, threaten to report them to the authorities, even dive under water to cut loose sharks caught in nets or on lines.</p>

<p>Active round-the-clock since 2018, the team of shark-lovers claims to be turning the tide in the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, a mecca for divers and the largest no-fishing zone in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.</p>

<p>"The success of the project can be seen in the fact that they (the illegal fishers) do not return," said Colombian diver Erika Lopez, who created the foundation Biodiversity Conservation Colombia with the help of an Australian philanthropist.</p>

<p>The project was born from what the activists view as a lack of official shark protection, with the navy arresting illegal fishers only if they happen to come across them on routine patrols against drug traffickers and other territorial intruders.</p>

<p>Due to play host of the UN COP16 biodiversity conference starting next Monday, Colombia's vast Pacific coastline is on a key migratory route for hammerhead sharks, whale sharks and other species, many of them endangered.</p>

<p>But the bountiful waters of the sanctuary attract vessels from far and wide, many from neighboring Ecuador, others from Panama and Costa Rica in the Caribbean or even China, where shark fin is a delicacy.</p>

<p>Lopez's foundation claims the crew of the Silky -- the name of a type of shark -- has rescued 508 animals alive since 2018, scared away 302 boats and confiscated more than 70,000 meters of fishing line.</p>

<p>Since last December, the foundation reports it has not spotted any fishing boats near Malpelo island in the reserve of more than 850,000 hectares recognized as a UNESCO heritage site.</p>

<p>"We try as much as possible to take the equipment away from them, to free the species that are trapped, that's the main mission," 53-year-old Dario Ortiz, an artisanal fisherman-turned-environmentalist, told AFP on board the "Silky."</p>

<p>But it is a full-time effort.</p>

<p>"This boat has to be basically 24/7, 365 days a year containing this threat," said Lopez, 51, who dreams of upscaling the project to a flotilla of vessels dedicated to conservation and science in the Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>Rich and desirable</strong></p>

<p>On the high seas, far from Malpelo island, a Colombian navy warship also patrols an area teeming with hammerhead sharks, marlin and other endangered creatures.</p>

<p>On a recent mission with AFP on board, it arrested three Ecuadoran fishermen found with a highly valuable haul of silky, hammerhead and blacktip sharks, sailfish and four blue marlins -- all still alive.</p>

<p>"The Colombian Pacific is very rich and it is desirable," said Admiral Rafael Aranguren.</p>

<p>With "our ships we can reach this part of the territory and exercise controls so that they do not illegally exploit these riches, so that they do not harm the environment."</p>

<p>In 2020, the government of former president Ivan Duque banned shark fishing, both on an industrial and small-scale, to try to protect marine stocks.</p>

<p>But faced with an outcry from Afro-Caribbean fishing communities on the Pacific coast which rely on shark catches for meat to eat and sell, incumbent President Gustavo Petro in January partly repealed the ban.</p>

<p>The government decreed that small-scale fishermen may keep and consume sharks accidentally caught in nets meant for other, unrestricted, fish species.</p>

<p>The decision caused outrage among conservationists who view it as a license to kill.</p>

<p>The Navy estimates it has arrested 30 people so far this year for illegal fishing in Colombian waters.</p>

<p>Between 2012 and 2022, authorities seized more than 334 tons of fish meat illegally harvested, according to the Ministry of Environment.</p>

<p>The country does not keep a record of sharks that fall victim to illegal fishing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau doubled down on accusations of India "supporting criminal activity against Canadians", as the two countries expel six diplomats each in the row over the killing of terrorist Hardeep Singh NIjjar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/justin-trudeau" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a> late Monday doubled down on accusations of India "supporting criminal activity against Canadians" and "coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians".</p>

<p>The two countries this week exchanged a second round of&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-expels-6-canadian-diplomats-amid-spiraling-tension-6789267#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll" target="_blank">tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats</a>, amid a deepening row over claims linking "agents of the Indian government" with the killing of Khalistani terrorist <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/hardeep-singh-nijjar" target="_blank">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Canadian citizen, in June last year.</p>

<p>India - which has yet to respond to these latest comments - has set up a high-level committee to investigate the allegation. However New Delhi has repeatedly shot down "absurd" and "motivated" the claim it was linked to the murder, pointing out <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-s-jaishankar-asks-canada-to-provide-evidence-4577831" target="_blank">no evidence has been provided</a>&nbsp;to back up the charges.</p>

<p>On Monday, Delhi also said that since the allegations were first made, the Trudeau administration "has not shared a shred of evidence with the Government of India, despite many requests..."</p>

<p>In comments after India ejected six Canadian diplomats - including acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler and his deputy - Mr Trudeau said he had shared information about the accusations with Five Eyes partners, particularly the United States.</p>

<p>These latest charges, though, represent an escalation as they allege a wider campaign of the Indian government - of working, Mr Trudeau said, with organised crime elements in Canada to "collect - through questionable and illegal means - information on Canadian citizens... (that is fed to criminal organisations) that would then take violent actions from extortion to murder".</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil. Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," Mr Trudeau <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2024/10/14/statement-prime-minister-ongoing-investigation-violent-criminal-activity-linked" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau also said, "We shared our concerns with the Government of India and asked them to work with us...". However, he claimed that these requests had been "repeatedly refused".</p>

<p>"That is why... this weekend... Canadian officials took an extraordinary step. They met with Indian officials to share RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) evidence, which concluded six agents of the Government of India are 'persons of interest' in criminal activities. And despite repeated requests to the Government of India, they have decided not to co-operate..."</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau's allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity ratings; last week he <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-survive-second-parliamentary-confidence-vote-6696632" target="_blank">survived a second parliamentary confidence vote</a> in as many weeks ahead of an election in 2025.</p>

<p>The comments came after a RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme and Assistant Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-india-expel-1.7351837" target="_blank">warned Canadians of a public safety threat but offered few details</a>. They would only say the RCMP has evidence pertaining to "connections" between a certain number of individuals arrested and charged for murder (eight people) and extortion (at least 22) and the Government of India.</p>

<p>Pressed on the current "public safety threat to Canadians", Mr Duheme called on Canadian citizens to come forward if faced with "intimidation, harassment, coercion, or extortion, in any way or form, (to) obtain information for the Government of India".</p>

<p>The current row spiked after Canada Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, acting on RCMP information, issued six Indian diplomats a deportation notice. "They must leave Canada..." Mr Trudeau said, "Let me be clear... the evidence brought to light by the RCMP cannot be ignored..."</p>

<p>India later issued a statement saying it was withdrawing the six officials over security concerns.</p>

<p>From its side, Delhi has ramped up criticism of the Trudeau government, saying accusations against its envoy, Sanjay Kumar Verma, are "ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt".</p>

<p>Delhi also said that Mr Trudeau's "hostility to India has long been in evidence".</p>

<p>"Sanjay Verma is India's senior-most serving diplomat with a distinguished career spanning 36 years. He has been an Ambassador in Japan and Sudan, while also serving in Italy, Turkiye, Vietnam and China," the foreign ministry said, calling the allegations a "strategy of smearing India for political gains".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pollution, habitat degradation, climate change and over-use of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe, with only a third of its surface water in good health, the European Environment Agency warned on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The health of Europe's waters is not good. Our waters face an unprecedented set of challenges that threatens Europe's water security," EEA executive director Leena Yla-Mononen said in a statement.</p>

<p>Only 37 percent of Europe's surface water bodies achieved "good" or "high" ecological status, a measure of aquatic ecosystem health, the EEA report said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, only 29 percent of surface waters achieved "good" chemical status over the 2015-2021 period, according to data reported by EU member states.</p>

<p>Europe's groundwaters -- the source of most drinking water in the continent -- fared better, with 77 percent enjoying "good" chemical status.</p>

<p>Good chemical status means the water is free of excessive pollution from chemical nutrients and toxic substances like PFAS and microplastics.</p>

<p>Surface water is threatened by air pollution -- such as coal burning and car emissions -- as well as the agriculture industry, whose dumped waste contaminates the soil.</p>

<p>"European agriculture needs to increase its use of more sustainable organic and agroecological practices, accompanied by incentives and a change in our food and dietary habits," the report said.</p>

<p>The European agency analysed 120,000 surface water bodies and 3.8 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles) of groundwater body areas in 19 EU countries and Norway.</p>

<p>It called on EEA member states to halve their use of pesticides by 2030.</p>

<p>"We need to redouble our efforts to restore the health of our valued rivers, lakes, coastal waters and other water bodies, and to make sure this vital resource is resilient and secure for generations to come," Yla-Mononen said.</p>

<p>Climate change effects, including extreme droughts and flooding, and the over-use of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe's lakes, rivers, coastal waters and groundwaters "like never before", the EEA said.</p>

<p>Governments must prioritise reducing water consumption and restoring ecosystems, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state.</p>

<p>Amazon.com Inc and other firms agreed last month to buy carbon credits valued at $180 million through the LEAF Coalition conservation initiative, which it helped set up in 2021 with a group of companies and governments, including the United States and United Kingdom.</p>

<p>At the time, Para Governor Helder Barbalho said the deal had the participation of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday, 38 Indigenous and community organizations from Para signed a public letter denouncing his failure to consult them.</p>

<p>"It is unacceptable for the government of Para to take decisions without consulting traditional communities, who are the greatest protectors of the forests while also being the most impacted by the lack of effective climate adaptation policies," they said in the letter.</p>

<p>"Forest peoples must be heard and consulted. Our territories are not for sale," they said.</p>

<p>Alessandra Korap Munduruku, a tribal leader who was the letter's principal author, said the role of U.S.-based companies like Amazon and the Walmart Foundation, Walmart's philanthropic organization, in the carbon credit purchase was worrying.</p>

<p>"Our priority is the eviction of invaders on our reservation lands that are threatened by miners and a grain railway," she told Reuters by telephone. "Our leaders were never consulted on the carbon credits. We are being sold like goods."</p>

<p>The governor's office did not reply to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Korap Munduruku is an Indigenous&nbsp;teacher turned community leader who won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2023 for her efforts to convince mining companies leave Munduruku lands.</p>

<p>The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb.</p>

<p>The deal foresees the purchase of up to 12 million tons of carbon credits generated by reducing deforestation in Para between 2023 and 2026. It was announced on Sept. 24 during New York Climate Week.</p>

<p>Each of the credits represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions and they are jurisdictional, so Para gets paid for reducing deforestation across the state, including on public lands like reservations.</p>

<p>Governor Barbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples and traditional communities as well as family farms.</p>

<p>Para will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy following a deadly drone strike on a military base in Israel, and retaliation would extend to targets in Beirut.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy, a day after the Iran-backed group's deadliest strike on Israel since the start of the war in late September.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's drone attack on an Israeli base killed four soldiers on Sunday, while another 60 people were injured, according to the Israeli volunteer rescue service United Hatzalah.</p>

<p>"We will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon -- including Beirut," Netanyahu said as he visited the base near Binyamina, south of Haifa.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it launched the "squadron of attack drones" in response to Israeli attacks, including one last week that Lebanon's health ministry said killed at least 22 people in central Beirut.</p>

<p>Since Israel on September 23 escalated its bombing against targets in Lebanon the war has killed at least 1,315 people, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely to be higher.</p>

<p>Prior to Netanyahu's comments a string of new air strikes had already occurred against targets around Lebanon, including one in a northern Christian-majority village which killed at least 21 people, according to the health ministry.</p>

<p>Yousef, the manager of a restaurant near the Binyamina base, told AFP he heard "a huge boom" before many ambulances arrived.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said on Monday around midday that it had launched rockets at a naval base near Haifa before a further "big rocket salvo" in the early evening at the northern Israeli town of Safed.</p>

<p>Its fighters were also "engaged in violent clashes" in the Lebanese frontier village of Aita al-Shaab, and were fighting elsewhere as well, it said.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens sounded across central Israel in the early evening, including in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, the military said, after it earlier reported the interception of two drones approaching from Syria.</p>

<p><strong>'Never-ending' strikes</strong></p>

<p>After almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges between Hezbollah and Israeli forces over the Lebanon border, Israel intensified its strikes against targets in Lebanon late last month before sending ground troops across the frontier.</p>

<p>Israel wants to push back Hezbollah in order to secure its northern boundary and allow tens of thousands of people displaced by rocket fire over the last year to return home safely.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says its strikes are in solidarity with its Palestinian ally, Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7 last year, triggering the ongoing Gaza war with Israel.</p>

<p>The International Organization for Migration said last week it had verified 690,000 displaced people in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel's deadly air strike on the village of Aito in northern Lebanon on Monday marked a departure from the usual pattern, being located far from the main combat area and in a mostly Christian area.</p>

<p>Israel has focused its firepower mostly on Hezbollah strongholds in Shiite Muslim-majority areas in the south and in the suburbs of Beirut.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer in Aito said the missile levelled a residential building. Body parts were scattered in the rubble.</p>

<p>In the southern border town of Marjayoun, civil defence chief Anis Abla told AFP his rescue teams were exhausted.</p>

<p>"Our rescue missions are becoming more and more difficult, because the strikes are never-ending and target us," he said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry condemned Israel's "continued targeting of medical, relief and paramedics teams."</p>

<p>Israel also continues to face criticism over injuries and damage sustained by the UN peacekeeping force which has been deployed in Lebanon since 1978.</p>

<p>Five peacekeepers were injured in a series of incidents last week, with the UN force on Sunday accusing Israeli troops of breaking through a gate with two tanks and entering one of their positions.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said a tank "backed several meters into a UNIFIL post" while "under fire" and attempting to evacuate injured soldiers.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-missile defence</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Simon Harris of Ireland, which has troops in the UNIFIL mission, on Monday told Israeli President Isaac Herzog in a phone call that UNIFIL has "a clear mandate from the Security Council, and that it must be allowed to carry out its functions unimpeded," Harris's office said.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on Israel last year which triggered war in Gaza resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The number includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, 42,289 people, the majority civilians. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p>With the war there, and in Lebanon, showing no sign of abating, fears of even wider regional conflict have seen Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, engage in diplomatic efforts with allies and other powers.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a senior official from Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi movement in Oman, the latest stop in a regional diplomatic tour.</p>

<p>Jordan's King Abdullah II warned of "a regional war that will be costly for everyone," during a meeting with Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday.</p>

<p>Just before Sunday's attack on the Israeli army base, the Pentagon said it would deploy a high-altitude anti-missile system known as THAAD to Israel to further boost its ally's defences against a potential Iranian attack.</p>

<p>Israel is still weighing its response to an October 1 missile attack by Iran, the latest of two it has carried out against Israel this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extreme temperatures and humidity driven by climate change could reduce the Amazon rainforest's capacity to absorb the greenhouse gas methane by 70 per cent, a study has found. Researchers said that under a warmer climate, the extreme rainfall and droughts projected for South America's Amazon could impact its net greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Often referred to as the 'lungs of the planet', the tropical rainforest lies majorly in Brazil, with parts in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, among others, and is known to be a crucial 'greenhouse gas sink' that absorbs these gases from the air.</p>

<p>However, 20 per cent of the Amazon region, which remains flooded for nearly half a year, releases methane, countering its ability to absorb other greenhouse gases, the researchers at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil said. Their study is published in the journal Environmental Microbiome.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that the flooded areas of Amazon contribute up to almost 30 per cent of methane emissions from wetlands globally.</p>

<p>"Although it's already been shown that factors such as air temperature and seasonal flooding can influence the composition of microbial communities affecting the flow of methane in these environments. But what should we expect in the context of climate change and the projected extreme weather?" Lead author Julia Gontijo, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, US, said.</p>

<p>For this study, researchers took soil samples from two flooded regions of the Amazon and one from elevated forests known to absorb methane. These samples were subjected to extreme temperatures -- 27 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius -- and humidity.</p>

<p>They found that in the soil sample from the elevated forest methane absorbtion dropped by 70 per cent in hot and dry conditions, while methane production surged in heavy rainfall, as the soil was not used to dealing with extreme humidity.</p>

<p>"Within this (elevated) forest soil, an average decrease of 70 per cent in (methane) consumption potential was observed with temperature increase in dry conditions," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>It means that the floodplain microbiome can adapt to climate change but the upland forest microbiome is sensitive to its effects, which could cause a shift in the balance of greenhouse gas emissions in the Amazon in future, Gontijo said.</p>

<p>"In view of the Amazon Rainforest biome's importance in proportion to global levels, this could represent a very serious problem," she said.</p>

<p>She further said that in both (the) floodplains, although there were no observation of significant changes in methane emission patterns, the number of methane-producing microorganisms increased that can be a future problem.</p>

<p>The results could be used in framing public policies, the author added</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army on Monday said air raid sirens were activated across central Israel, including the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, as projectiles were fired across the border from Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Sirens sounded in a number of areas in central Israel due to projectiles fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>The police said they had deployed officers to locate and secure any potential impact sites "to ensure public safety".</p>

<p>In a later statement, the military said that "several interception attempts were made toward a number of projectiles that crossed from Lebanon".</p>

<p>It did not specify whether any of the projectiles had breached the country's air defences.</p>

<p>The barrage comes just a day after a Hezbollah drone attack killed four soldiers in the deadliest attack on Israel since the war in Lebanon began.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been at war since Israel intensified its strikes on Lebanon on September 23 and sent ground troops across the border a week later.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to secure its northern border to allow tens of thousands of people displaced by nearly a year of Hezbollah rocket fire. Hezbollah says the rocket fire is in solidarity with its Palestinian ally, Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel's air defences, including the Iron Dome system, have so far intercepted most of the projectiles, with a few casualties caused by strikes or falling debris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA launched a spacecraft from Florida on Monday on a mission to examine whether Jupiter's moon Europa has conditions suitable to support life, with a focus on the large subsurface ocean believed to be lurking beneath its thick outer shell of ice.</p>

<p>The US space agency's Europa Clipper spacecraft blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket under sunny skies. The robotic solar-powered probe is due to enter orbit around Jupiter in 2030 after journeying about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km) in 5-1/2 years. The launch had been planned for last week but was put off because of Hurricane Milton.</p>

<p>It is the largest spacecraft NASA has built for a planetary mission, at about 100 feet (30.5 meters) long and about 58 feet (17.6 meters) wide with its antennas and solar arrays fully deployed - bigger than a basketball court - while weighing approximately 13,000 pounds (6,000 kg).</p>

<p>Even though Europa, the fourth-largest of Jupiter's 95 officially recognized moons, is just a quarter of Earth's diameter, its vast global ocean of salty liquid water may contain twice the water in Earth's oceans. Earth's oceans are thought to have been the birthplace of life on our planet.</p>

<p>Europa, whose diameter of roughly 1,940 miles (3,100 km) is approximately 90% that of our moon, has been viewed as a potential habitat for life beyond Earth in our solar system. Its icy shell is believed to be 10-15 miles (15-25 km) thick, sitting atop an ocean 40-100 miles (60-150 km) deep.</p>

<p>NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free told a prelaunch briefing on Sunday that Europa boasts one of the most promising environments for potential habitability in our solar system, beyond Earth, though he noted that this mission will not be a search for any actual living organisms.</p>

<p>"What we discover on Europa," Free said, "will have profound implications for the study of astrobiology and how we view our place in the universe."</p>

<p>"Scientists believe Europa has suitable conditions below its icy surface to support life. Its conditions are water, energy, chemistry and stability," said Sandra Connelly, deputy associate administrator of NASA's science mission directorate.</p>

<p>Among the mission, objectives are measuring the internal ocean and the layer of ice above it, mapping the moon's surface composition, and hunting for plumes of water vapour that may be venting from Europa's icy crust. The plan is for Europa Clipper starting in 2031 to conduct 49 close flybys of Europa over three years, coming as close as 16 miles (25 kilometers) to the moon's surface.</p>

<p>Europa Clipper will be operating in an intense radiation environment around Jupiter, our solar system's biggest planet.</p>

<p>Jupiter is enveloped by a magnetic field about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field spins, capturing and accelerating charged particles and creating radiation that could harm spacecraft. NASA fashioned a vault made of titanium and aluminium inside the Europa Clipper to protect its sensitive electronics from this radiation.</p>

<p>"One of the Europa Clipper mission's main challenges is delivering a spacecraft hardy enough to withstand the pummeling of radiation from Jupiter but also sensitive enough to gather the measurements needed to investigate Europa's environment," Connelly said.</p>

<p>NASA said Europa Clipper is loaded with more than 6,060 pounds (2,750 kg) of propellant to get it to Jupiter. For the launch, the spacecraft was placed inside the protective nose cone atop the rocket.</p>

<p>The spacecraft will not take a straight path to Jupiter. Instead, it is due to fly by Mars, then back by Earth, using the gravity of each planet to increase its momentum like a slingshot. Its expansive solar arrays, which were folded up for the launch, will gather sunlight for powering the spacecraft's nine scientific instruments as well as its electronics and other subsystems.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia, which chairs the BRICS group this year, has called on its partners to create an alternative to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to counter political pressure from Western nations ahead of the BRICS summit later this month.</p>

<p>BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Top BRICS finance and central bank officials are meeting in Moscow this week.</p>

<p>Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who is hosting the meeting, said the global financial system is controlled by Western countries and that the group, which represents 37% of the global economy, needs to create an alternative.</p>

<p>"The IMF and the World Bank are not performing their roles. They are not working in the interests of BRICS countries," Siluanov said at an event on the first day of the meeting.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to form new conditions or even new institutions, similar to the Bretton Woods institutions, but within the framework of our community, within the framework of BRICS," Siluanov added.</p>

<p>Russia had its forex reserves in dollars and euros frozen and its financial system heavily hit by sanctions by the West after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The country is cut off from international capital markets.</p>

<p>Russia has recently also experienced delays in international transactions with its trading partners, including BRICS member countries, as banks in these countries fear punitive actions from Western regulators.</p>

<p>Russia's central bank Governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has previously talked about a BRICS Bridge payments system, which would link member countries' financial systems, but progress has been slow.</p>

<p>The only financial institution the BRICS countries have established so far is the New Development Bank, created in 2015 to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS members and other emerging economies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel expanded its targets in its war with the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 18 people in its first strike on the Christian-majority town of Aitou in the north, the Lebanese Red Cross said.</p>

<p>So far the main focus of Israel's military operations in Lebanon has been in the south, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the suburbs of Beirut.</p>

<p>The strike in the northern region hit a house that had been rented to displaced families, Aitou Mayor Joseph Trad told Reuters. In addition to the deaths, four people were injured, the Red Cross said.</p>

<p>Israel on Monday ordered residents of 25 villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River, which flows through southern Lebanon, as it intensifies its attacks in the region.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike killed Muhammad Kamel Naim, the commander of the anti-tank missile unit of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon, the military said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has not immediately commented.</p>

<p>The operations come amidst high tensions between Israel and the UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL in south Lebanon, with Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen on Monday repeating a call by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the UN troops to leave.</p>

<p>Israel and the United Nations have been trading accusations over the peacekeepers in south Lebanon, as Israel keeps pushing its forces through the area in an attempt to wipe out Iran-backed Hezbollah and its military infrastructure while it battles Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN said Israeli tanks had burst into its base on Sunday, the latest allegations of Israeli violations against peacekeeping forces, that have been condemned by Hezbollah and by Israel's allies.</p>

<p>Israel disputed the UN account and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the peacekeepers to withdraw, saying they were providing "human shields" for Hezbollah during an upsurge in hostilities.</p>

<p>Hezbollah denies it uses the proximity of peacekeepers for protection.</p>

<p>The Middle East, meanwhile, remains on high alert for Israel to retaliate against Iran for an October 1 barrage of long-range missiles launched in response to Israel's assaults on Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said on Sunday it would send US troops to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, as Israel weighs its expected retaliation against Iran.</p>

<p>The Israeli military took foreign journalists into southern Lebanon on Sunday and showed them a Hezbollah tunnel shaft that was less than 200 metres away (650 feet) from a UNIFIL position, as well as weapon stashes that the troops found.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Yiftach Norkin said the tunnels were built a few years ago.</p>

<p>"We are actually standing in a military base of Hezbollah very close to the UN," Norkin said, pointing to the shaft's trap door in an area covered by undergrowth and overlooked by a UN observation post.</p>

<p>Since announcing its ground operation near the border, the Israeli military says that it has destroyed dozens of Hezbollah tunnel shafts, rocket launchers and command posts.</p>

<p>"We found several days ago a huge quantity of weapons originally coming from Iran and Russia. Brand new," said Colonel Olivier Rafowicz. "They were prepared for attacking us and (launching) a large invasion into the north of Israel," Rafowicz said, showing the journalists crates of weapons.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately verify these claims.</p>

<p><strong>EXTENSIVE TUNNEL NETWORK</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah possesses an extensive tunnel network in southern Lebanon, both the group and Israel say. Israel estimates they extend for hundreds of kilometres. A Hezbollah field commander told Reuters last week that the tunnels "are the foundation of the battle." Hezbollah has not immediately commented.</p>

<p>UNIFIL has said previous Israeli attacks on a watchtower, cameras, communications equipment and lighting had limited its monitoring abilities. UN sources say they fear any violations of international law in the conflict will be impossible to monitor.</p>

<p>The European Union's member states have taken too long to condemn Israel's attacks on UNIFIL soldiers in Lebanon, the European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday, describing the attacks as "completely unacceptable".</p>

<p>EU countries, led by Italy, France and Spain, have thousands of troops in the 10,000-strong peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has said it has repeatedly come under attack from Israeli forces in recent days</p>

<p>On Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged European Union members to respond to a request by Madrid and Ireland to suspend the bloc's free trade agreement with Israel over its attacks in Lebanon and Gaza.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah resumed a year ago when the operator group began firing rockets at Israeli positions in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war and has sharply escalated in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Israel says its operations in Lebanon are aimed at securing the return of tens of thousands of its residents displaced from their homes in northern Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The decapitated bodies of five men were discovered on a road in central Mexico, in a region controlled by the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Police were alerted to the scene near the town of Ojuelos, in Jalisco state, on Sunday morning, after drivers reported seeing plastic bags containing human remains, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c148yy7yxyno" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A report was received indicating that, on the asphalt strip of the road (...) there were several bags that looked like human silhouettes," the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fiscalia.jalisco.gob.mx/comunicacion-social/boletines-de-prensa/boletin-2542-20241013" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>state prosecutor's office</em></a> said.&nbsp;Officials said forensic teams are working to identify the victims.</p>

<p>The gruesome nature of the murders and the public disposal of the bodies strongly suggest cartel involvement.&nbsp;National Guard troops also arrived at the scene, where they found the remains wrapped in black plastic bags, according to a statement from the Jalisco state prosecutor's office.</p>

<p>The victims' ages have not yet been determined, and an investigation is underway, the statement added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Jalisco, official statistics show that 1,415 people were murdered between January and September this year.</p>

<p>More than 30,000 people are killed annually in Mexico, which has one of the highest murder rates in the world.</p>

<p>Last week, the mayor of a Mexican city plagued by drug violence was assassinated just days after taking office.</p>

<p>Alejandro Arcos was murdered in Chilpancingo, a city of about 280,000 people in the southwestern state of Guerrero.</p>

<p>President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last week, has ruled out a return to the previous administration's war on drugs.</p>

<p>She stated that her security strategy would focus on gathering intelligence on cartels and addressing the root causes of violence- a policy known as "hugs not bullets," introduced by her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.</p>

<p>However, the opposition is pushing for a tougher stance against the cartels.</p>

<p>Since the government began deploying the Mexican military against the drug cartels in 2006, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and tens of thousands more have gone missing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran said Monday it currently sees "no grounds" for its indirect talks with the United States via intermediary Oman, citing the crisis in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Iran said in June that it had held indirect talks with the United States via Oman, despite having no diplomatic relations with its foe.</p>

<p>"Currently we don't see any ground for these talks, until we can get past the current crisis," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters in Oman's capital Muscat.</p>

<p>The process, he said, had been halted "due to the specific conditions of the region".</p>

<p>Iran fired 200 missiles at Israel on October 1 in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned operator leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to respond.</p>

<p>The Gulf sultanate of Oman has long mediated between Iran and the United States, which cut ties after the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's close ally and top provider of military assistance, while Iran backs the Palestinian operator group Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah which are fighting Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior Indian military sources who have analysed satellite imagery of a new Chinese base on the North bank of the Pangong Lake say that the site ''is unlike any other site'' that lies on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual control.</p>

<p>The site in question, images of which have been published in this report, lies 36 kilometres East of the LAC on territory China holds. It is approximately 15 km East of a new bridge that China has constructed across the high-altitude Pangong Lake in Ladakh and marks Beijing's latest effort at stepping up pressure in areas near the Line of Actual Control which were previously unoccupied. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Military sources say the site, which features upwards of 70 permanent structures, ''has been dispersed over a wide area. &nbsp;This has been done to reduce the potential impact of missile attacks.'' The site appears to have two primary functions - to accommodate soldiers and porters who are involved in China's construction activity in the area. &nbsp;And to store logistics for potential transfer to locations along the LAC with India. &nbsp;''Each structure can accommodate 6-8 soldiers or up to 10 tonnes of logistics,'' say military experts. This can include ammunition, including artillery shells. &nbsp;</p>

''The settlement is witnessing the development of multiple double-storey buildings alongside village administrative offices and emerging town centres. Electrification efforts are progressing as power lines are drawn from the southern highway. Furthermore, to secure the water supply, a potential pumping station is being constructed to the north, drawing fresh water from an adjacent riverbed. Thanks to these preparations, the village, once established, is likely to be well-shielded from the area's extreme and unforgiving climate.''</p>

<p>Lt. General DS Hooda (retired), the former Northern Army Commander who speared India's surgical strikes on Pakistani territory, says the site under construction has dual uses. ''It enables China to say that they are only improving facilities for the civilian population, but this is clearly dual-use infrastructure that would be utilised by the military in a conflict.''&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The construction of this site also changes facts on the ground. &nbsp;''Article VII of the 2005 agreement between India and China on the political parameters and guiding principles for the settlement of the boundary question states that 'in reaching a boundary settlement, the two sides shall safeguard due interests of the settled population in border areas.' &nbsp;However, by creating these villages in areas claimed by India, where there was no settled population, China is attempting to strengthen its claims and weaken our bargaining position,'' says Lt. General Hooda. ''This is a long game.''</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/heavy-military-fortifications-near-chinas-now-complete-pangong-lake-bridge-6226235">An NDTV report published</a> in July showed Chinese vehicles crossing its Pangong Lake bridge, 15 km from the new site.</p>

<p>The report also identified fortified sites to the North of the bridge, including a likely air defence site which could house a surface-to-air missile battery. This site would likely protect this new Chinese base from aerial attacks.</p>

<p>"The issue of concern is the size and scale of construction and infrastructure so close to the LAC in conjunction with the bridge across Pangong Tso which connects the North and South banks," says Lt. General Satish Dua (retired), a former Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff. "The bridge allows lateral switching of forces and this dual-use village could be used as a logistic hub. We will have to keep a close watch over their activities in the region, which should give us an advance warning of any malafide activities."</p>

<p>Damien Symon, perhaps the closest international observer of fresh developments along the India-China frontier says that construction activity at the new site appears to replicate similar activity in Chinese-held areas on the South bank of the Pangong Lake. "Similar construction activity has recently also been noted near Spanggur Lake's eastern region where another sizeable settlement is under construction approximately 18 kilometres from Rezang La, where Indian forces outmanoeuvred the Chinese during the 2020 border standoff."</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs, which was forwarded these images by NDTV last week, has chosen not to respond specifically to the new Chinese construction activity. However, India has dramatically ramped up infrastructure development along the China frontier. This includes the construction of roads, tunnels, and other military facilities to ensure that Indian forces are well-prepared and can swiftly respond to any challenges posed by Chinese actions along the LAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India's Vibrant Villages programme, for which Rs 4,800 crore has been allocated from 2022-'23 to 2025-'26, is aimed at the comprehensive development of villages along the Northern border. The project, which promotes infrastructure development, livelihood opportunities and cultural and heritage promotion targets 2,967 villages in total. The project has a broader strategic goal of maintaining an Indian presence along the border which is seen as a deterrent against territorial encroachments.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese scientists, employing cutting-edge radar, have detected simultaneous plasma bubbles above the Egyptian pyramids and Midway Islands, sparking fascination. The radar, known as the Low Latitude Long Range Ionospheric Radar (LARID),&nbsp;was developed by the Institute of Geology and Geophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was installed last year, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3277286/chinas-super-radar-detects-plasma-bubble-over-pyramids-giza">South China Morning Post </a></em>reported. The LARID radar can detect plasma bubbles, an unusual weather phenomenon that disrupts satellite communications and GPS by interfering with the ionosphere's charged particles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On August 27, China's Institute of Geology and Geophysics announced the largest radar detection of plasma bubbles to date, triggered by a solar storm last November. The radar signals, detectable from North Africa to the central Pacific, allowed scientists to observe the formation and movement of plasma bubbles in unprecedented detail.</p>

<p>The LARID radar, located on Hainan Island, has a 9,600km range, covering Hawaii to Libya. Unlike conventional radars, LARID uses high-power electromagnetic waves that bounce between the ionosphere and ground, detecting targets beyond the horizon. Its radar system, operating at 8-22MHz, uses 48 transceiver antennas to detect plasma bubbles, while its fully digital phased array system enables real-time adjustments.</p>

<p>Initially, LARID's detection range was 3,000km.&nbsp;The radar's detection range has tripled to 9,600km in less than half a year, thanks to operational experience and advancements like novel signal coding and geophysical simulation models.</p>

<p>The development of such radars is important to detect plasma bubbles as they pose a significant threat to modern warfare. However, the scarcity of large-scale, long-term observation facilities over oceans has hindered our understanding and early warning capabilities. To address this, Chinese scientists have proposed establishing a network of three to four LARID-like over-the-horizon radars in low-latitude regions worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China's military has also deployed over-the-horizon radars similar to LARID, which have detected targets like F-22 stealth fighters, suggesting more advanced variants with higher resolution for military use.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple Inc.'s most important event of the year takes place Monday, when the company will roll out its latest iPhones and set the stage for a new artificial intelligence platform.</p>

<p>The event kicks off from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. local time. Apple doesn't typically hold this event on a Monday, but the earlier timing lets the company get out ahead of an eventful Tuesday: There's a US presidential debate that day, and the European Commission is slated to announce a decision on whether Apple has to pay $14 billion in taxes stemming from a longstanding agreement with Ireland.</p>

<p>The most significant product announcement will be the iPhone 16 line, but the company is also preparing major updates to both the Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Intelligence - a new suite of AI tools that includes an updated Siri digital assistant - also will feature prominently. The theme of the event, "It's Glowtime," is a reference to Siri's new interface.</p>

<p>The stakes are high for Apple, which looks to prove to both consumers and Wall Street that it's now a major player in generative artificial intelligence. But the company's AI technology is still a work in progress. Apple Intelligence has faced numerous delays, and many key features won't arrive until next year. For now, the technology is focused on summarizing messages and notifications, rather than matching the dazzling interactivity of rival systems.</p>

<p>Even so, Monday's updates will breathe new life into products that sit at the heart of the Apple device lineup and generate roughly 60% of the company's annual revenue. They also drive consumer spending on services, an increasingly vital source of sales. Apple's finances could use the boost. The company has only just begun to emerge from its longest sales slump in decades.</p>

<p><strong>Here's everything that's expected to be announced at Monday's presentation:</strong></p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Apple's iPhone 15 Pro.(Photographer: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/9eb18i6o_apple-iphone-bloomberg_625x300_06_September_24.jpg" title="Apple's iPhone 15 Pro.(Photographer: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)" /></div>

<p><strong>iPHONE</strong></p>

<p>In line with the past several years, Apple will introduce four new iPhone models: the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.</p>

<p>Like in 2023, the changes to the non-Pro iPhones will be minor. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will look like last year's versions, including 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen sizes and aluminum cases. They'll gain faster processors and include a total of 8 gigabytes of memory (up from 6). That memory will help support Apple Intelligence and other features.</p>

<p>Those lower-end phones will get the same Action button currently featured on the Pro models, as well as vertically stacked rear cameras that support spatial video recording - the 3D clips that can be viewed with Apple's Vision Pro headsets.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, meanwhile, will retain the iPhone 15 Pro line design save for one noticeable change: the displays. The screen sizes are increasing to 6.3 inches on the smaller model (up from from 6.1 inches) and going to 6.9 inches from 6.7 inches on the Max version. While the changes represent an increase of less than 5% on both models, the shift will come with bezels that are now about a third slimmer. That should make for a sleeker overall look.</p>

<p>Like the iPhone 15 Pro line, the 16 Pro models will support Apple Intelligence with the inclusion of 8 gigabytes of memory. They'll also get speedier chips with an enhanced neural engine that Apple will say is optimized for AI.</p>

<p>Both of the iPhone 16 Pro models will get camera upgrades as well, including a move to a 48-megapixel lens from a 12-megapixel one for the ultrawide-angle camera. That will match the megapixels of the standard, wide-angle camera on last year's model. The smaller iPhone 16 Pro will also gain 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, up from 3x, to match the Max version.</p>

<p>The most significant camera enhancement coming to both models: a dedicated, touch-sensitive button on the right side of the phone for taking photos and video. This button will be the biggest selling point for the new iPhones, other than AI. It will work similarly to a shutter button on a DSLR camera, allowing a user to lightly press it to focus on a subject and then press harder to take a picture. It will also be capacitive, allowing a user to swipe across it to move between still and video modes and zoom in and out.</p>

<p>While the phones will all look mostly the same as last year, Apple is shaking up its color palette. The Pro models will now come in a gold titanium to replace blue titanium, while the black, white and natural options will still be available. The non-Pro versions will trade in yellow for white and get new shades of green, pink and blue.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>AIRPODS</strong></p>

<p>Apple is preparing two new AirPods models to replace the entry-level, second-generation earbuds and mid-tier, third-generation model. Both new versions will look similar to the AirPods Pro and include a new case, USB-C charging and improved audio quality.</p>

<p>Apple will distinguish the two models by giving the new mid-tier version a higher-end case with a speaker - making it easier to locate with Apple's Find My feature - as well as noise cancellation to match the AirPods Pro.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Apple discovered a bug in the upcoming AirPods that made the earbuds quickly drain battery life. This issue was determined to be software-related and resolved prior to factories shipping out the products.</p>

<p>One major new feature is a bigger push into hearing health. Apple has been working to turn the AirPods into a replacement for hearing aids as well as a device for conducting hearing tests. The company is preparing to announce the enhancements - codenamed Yodel - but they've suffered some delays and may not be available until later.</p>

<p>A new version of the AirPods Pro remains in the works, including an upgraded design and improved noise cancellation. It's due as early as next year.</p>

<p>And Apple has been working on updated AirPods Max headphones that will come in new colors and switch the Lightning connector to USB-C to comply with the latest laws from the European Union. But there's still plenty of current AirPods Max inventory on hand, suggesting that the update could be coming later.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2.

(Photographer: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg)" /></div>

</div>

<p><strong>APPLE WATCH</strong></p>

<p>For the first time in two years, the company is preparing to update all of its Apple Watch models at once. There will be a new low-end Apple Watch SE, a mid-level Series 10 model and an Ultra 3.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch Ultra will only get minor tweaks, focusing on internal upgrades rather than outside changes.</p>

<p>The biggest upgrade to the Apple Watch line will be with the Series 10 model, which marks the decade anniversary of the product's introduction in 2014. For the first time since the Series 7, the flagship Apple Watch model will get an updated look.</p>

<p>The overall design will be similar to the Apple Watch Series 9, but the company will now offer slightly larger screen-size options and the watch case itself will be noticeably thinner.</p>

<p>Though new AI features are coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac, don't expect the watches to get major Apple Intelligence capabilities. Any AI technology will probably be tied specifically to a future health coach service.</p>

<p>At the start of the year, Apple was forced to remove blood-oxygen sensing from new watches due to a lawsuit with Masimo Corp. over patents. There's been no evidence that the feature is returning in time for the latest models, and that may affect whether users want to upgrade their existing watches to versions that won't have the function.</p>

<p>A major new health feature is coming, though: sleep apnea detection, which will build on the existing sleep tracking. This feature will attempt to determine if a wearer has sleep apnea and then suggest further testing with a medical professional. While Apple has been preparing to announce it, the enhancement may not be available on day one of the new model going on sale.</p>

<p>On the other hand, while Apple aimed to bring hypertension - or high blood pressure - detection to the Apple Watch this year, signs point to that feature being delayed and no longer in the cards for an immediate release.</p>

<p><strong>OTHER PRODUCTS</strong></p>

<p>Apple is working on transitioning its entire Mac line to M4 chips, starting with the MacBook Pro, Mac mini and iMac. But any Mac upgrades are likely to come at a follow-up launch - no earlier than October - rather than at the September event.</p>

<p>While the company has been working on an update to the Apple TV set-top box for as early as this year, no new model has come to fruition and stable inventory of the device suggests a new version isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>

<p>A new iPhone SE with an OLED display, edge-to-edge screen and no home button is in advanced testing, but a release isn't planned until next year. A fresh AirTag is also in development, though Apple isn't planning a release until next year either.</p>

<p>There are also new iPads in the works, including an upgraded mini version. They're on deck for Apple's October event alongside the M4 Macs.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have discovered an antibody that could counter all known variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and also distantly related ones that infect other animals.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19, uses its spike protein to invade and infect another individual, or the host. Antibodies, produced by the host in response, bind to the spike protein to block its action and prevent infection.</p>

<p>The researchers, led by those at The University of Texas in Austin, US, isolated the antibody 'SC27' from the plasma donated by four patients. These patients had breakthrough infections, which occur when a vaccinated individual gets infected.</p>

<p>The research has been published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine.</p>

<p>Over the more than four years since the first case of COVID-19 emerged, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to acquire certain characteristics which make the virus resistant to vaccines and treatments.</p>

<p>The authors said the 'SC27' antibody recognised all these various characteristics of the spike proteins across COVID-19 variants.</p>

<p>"One goal of this research, and vaccinology in general, is to work toward a universal vaccine that can generate antibodies and create an immune response with broad protection to a rapidly mutating virus," said one of the lead authors William Voss, a PhD graduate in cell and molecular biology at The University of Texas.</p>

<p>However, the authors also acknowledged that "the small number of individuals analysed may limit the interpretation of the data and leave it unclear how common the SC27-like antibody might be in human populations." The researchers used the technology IgG proteomics, or 'Ig-Seq', to study hybrid immunity, which is one's antibody response to both infection and vaccination.</p>

<p>"The discovery of SC27, and other antibodies like it in the future, will help us better protect the population against current and future COVID-19 variants," study author Jason Lavinder from The University of Texas.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that hybrid immunity offered an increased protection against the disease, compared with infection or vaccination alone.</p>

<p>Giani Singh (name changed), 45, drives a yellow taxi in New York. David Brooks, 63, a New Yorker at heart, is among the most cerebral columnists of <em>The New York Times</em>. They may find little in common should they meet currently but will find themselves agreeing on the most vexatious question in the US today: who will win the Presidential election in November.</p>

<p>Gianni wants Trump to win. Originally from Ludhiana, he came to the US as a teenager and did all he needed to survive, including two local marriages. He finally landed a US citizenship three years ago. Today, he owns six taxis, drives one himself for a bare six hours a day, and owns a house in Queens.</p>

<h2><strong>"Immigrants Commit Crimes"</strong></h2>

<p>He voted Trump in 2020 and will do so again. Trump, he says, kept prices down. "Today, with 8% interest, I don't know how people live," he told us last week. Trump will be hard on immigration (he threatens to deport an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants). "I know I am one and I have my own stories but, Sirjee, these immigrants commit lots of crimes. We see it daily in New York. " And, finally, "Trump will be good for India".</p>

<p>Brooks, a Republican, does not want Trump to win. But in a recent column, he clinically listed the "five turbines of Trumpism" which told his head differently. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One, Americans favour dynamism over compassion. The fastest growing US states - Texas, Florida, Montana - are ruled by Republicans; the slowest and the stagnant by Democrats. "The red model gives you low housing costs, lower taxes and business vitality. The blue model gives you high housing costs, high taxes and high inequality." Democrats want to expand the welfare state like in Europe. But voters tell pollsters that the economy and immigration are their top concerns and Republicans score better on handling those.</p>

<h2><strong>Democrats, The 'Elite' Clique</strong></h2>

<p>Two, in a reversal from recent history, Democrats have become the party of the college graduate elite and Republicans of the working class. "The biggest divide in the US today is the diploma divide," Brooks has often written. One of his most perceptive recent columns was on how the educated elite in the US unwittingly conveys its contempt for the majority not with a college degree ("Deplorables," Hillary Clinton infamously described Trump supporters in 2016). And the "deplorable" deeply resent that the Democrats are the party of the ruling class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three, the less educated are in a funk because of growing social and moral immorality. As Brooks wrote: "The things that derail their lives are broken relationships, infidelity, out-of-wedlock births, addictions, family conflict and crime. When Republicans talk about immigration, crime, faith, family and the flag, they are talking about ways to preserve the social and moral order. Democrats are great at talking about economic solidarity, but not moral and cultural solidarity."</p>

<p>Four, the general mood in the US is of distrust and dissatisfaction. According to Gallup and other pollsters, only 25% Americans are satisfied with the direction of the country; 60% feel the country is in decline and the "system is broken"; 69% agree that the "political and economic elite don't care about hard-working people", and 63% agree that "experts in this country don't understand the lives of people like me".</p>

<h2><strong>Trump Knows How To Harness Unhappiness</strong></h2>

<p>In this mood, people are disinclined to believe the Kamala Harris promise of a better life based on a more caring state. They believe that irrespective of the promises the elite make, in the end, it only adds to their growing power. And Trump knows better than any other populist how to harness this general dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Five, Harris has been unlike Clinton and Obama, both of whom won two terms by sticking rigidly to the centrist median on major issues. They made sure they were never seen as a representative of the progressives in the Democratic party. Kamala Harris let her progressive side lean on the critical decision of the choice of the Vice-Presidential candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is likely to be the most critical swing state in this election. Harris could have chosen its popular governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her election mate, but Shapiro was seen as a moderate and Harris showed "over-confidence", says Brooks, in choosing a governor (Tim Walz) of a state she was winning anyway, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is, of course, prime time for election punditry in the US, and one of the reigning gurus in this field is Nate Silver, poker player extraordinaire, baseball-statistician-turned-poll-predictor best known for predicting Obama's scale of victory in 2012 (332 electoral college votes out of 538) when it was widely seen as a close race and for naming the victor in all 50 US states. Silver too is leaning towards a Trump victory at this time, because of the electoral college advantage of the Republicans, which effectively gives the smaller of the seven swing states (like Wisconsin) disproportionate weightage in shaping the final verdict, even negating the popular vote.</p>

<h2><strong>What Harris Will Really Need</strong></h2>

<p>Hillary Clinton polled 65 million votes to Trump's 62 million in 2016 but lost the electoral college vote by 227-304. This November too, it is not unlikely that the same fate visits Harris. According to Silver's latest prediction, Harris would need to lead Trump in the popular vote by more than 3% to have a statistical chance of getting 270 electoral college votes. Harris had a dream five-week run between Biden opting out on July 21 and the Democratic National Convention but the bounce has slowed down. According to the latest Real Clear Politics Nationwide Polling Average, Harris is only 1.8% ahead of Trump in the popular vote. More importantly, she has only a 0.8 lead over Trump in the seven swing states.</p>

<p>Repeated polling has shown that the two most important issues for the electorate are the economy and immigration and Trump continues to lead Harris on those issues, despite ground realities. Bipartisan economists have proved that Trump's plan to erect tariff walls on imports, with steep ones for Chinese imports, will raise prices and harm the poor. Trump stonewalled a bipartisan tough immigration in the Congress because it would have impaired his election rhetoric of deporting illegal immigrants, a plan that is logistically impossible and would wreck the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>'Unserious' Trump</strong></h2>

<p>Trump is, as Harris famously labelled him, "unserious"; labelling him a narcissist is doing disservice to that word; he is a misogynist who has little support among young women;, everybody knows he does not have any values and beliefs except the most convenient ones, and the media knows he plays them because he craves publicity, positive or negative. And yet, because he is who he is, he can affirm contradictory beliefs and yet not lose any support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abortion is one issue on which Harris has him on the run. The Supreme Court that overturned the constitutional right to abortion was put together by Trump. He has often crowed about the verdict, which has led to anti-abortion statutes in 22 states. One out of seven voters rate abortion as the third most important electoral issue. Seeing Harris' growing lead on the issue which looms larger each day he has flip-flopped. One day he weighed against a Florida initiative to dramatically shorten the period for a legal abortion but seeing the pro-lifers' blowback, promptly affirmed support for the initiative the next day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Media in the US has been replete recently with revelations that should have made MAGA followers wince. &nbsp;A writer in <em>The Atlantic </em>profiled a key associate of Trump's presidency, Kashyap (Kash) Patel, who jeopardised the life of US Seals on a rescue mission in Nigeria by faking a go-ahead by Nigerian authorities for USAF planes to enter Nigerian air space. When exposed, Patel shrugged off his breathtaking lie with "Nobody got injured so how does it matter?" Trump acknowledges Kash is somewhat crazy, but says, "You need crazies".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Nothing Matters For Trump Loyalists</strong></h2>

<p>The <em>NYT </em>carried a column on how the Federal Election Commission has little oversight on how the hundreds of millions of dollars ostensibly raised for Trump's election campaign are actually used. The monies are sat over by Trump's family, and it is a reasonable inference from the money trails that significant sums are diverted toward fighting his many legal cases. But for Trump <em>bhakts</em>, nothing matters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allan Lichtman is a historian who has correctly called all recent elections, including 2016 and 2020, on a proprietary 13-point scale, weighted towards serious issues (like how the economy has done in the period between the two elections and how the US is perceived internationally), in which the character of the candidate matters only for two of the points. On that template, which also totally ignores election polls and surveys, Harris wins by scoring seven points.</p>

<h2><strong>'Prosecutor' Harris vs 'Bully' Trump</strong></h2>

<p>It would be fair to say that with less than 60 days to go, the election is too close to call. Much will depend on the debate on Tuesday evening (Wednesday morning in India). This may sound unbelievable, but Trump and Harris have never formally met. Never. Ever. Their first face-to-face promises to be gladiatorial. Will Prosecutor Harris put Convicted Felon and Bully Trump in the dock?&nbsp;</p>

<p>White men, 40% of the electorate, favour Trump overwhelmingly. Should Harris stand up to Trump, or dominate him, she could give the lie to Trump's taunt that Putin and the like will chew up Harris. That could nudge the critical white male vote in not only Wisconsin (10 electoral college votes) but, perhaps, more importantly in Pennsylvania with 20 electoral college votes.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is set to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup today, focusing on how its flagship device's features have been infused with artificial intelligence, rather than its usual emphasis on hardware upgrades.</p>

<p>The event at the tech giant's Apple Park headquarters at 10 a.m. PDT (1700 GMT) follows its developer conference in June during which the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, its take on generative AI that can conjure text, images and other content on command.</p>

<p>It had also showed off an improved version of voice assistant Siri, featuring an integration with ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.</p>

<p>The refresh comes as iPhones face stiff competition from Huawei in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them. Huawei itself has scheduled its own product announcement mere hours after Apple's event.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence must be approved by Beijing in order to be released in the Chinese market. In July, OpenAI blocked access to ChatGPT in China, a move that could impact the chatbot's integration into Siri.</p>

<p>"The Chinese market is hungrier for AI features than the U.S. market," said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. "It will be very difficult to bring it to China immediately, so they'll be going off the merits of the hardware."</p>

<p>IPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's $383 billion sales last year, and the new devices are an important update for the Cupertino, California-based company that is betting the AI feature will drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in iPhone sales.</p>

<p>In China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, prompted by government restrictions and increased domestic competition.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 lineup will be the first Apple smartphones designed around these AI features, though those will also be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the top-end versions of the previous-generation devices. New versions of the Apple Watch and AirPods are also expected.</p>

<p>"The software side, and how Apple frames it, is the biggest question," said Bajarin. "Investors will look for if it's compelling enough to have a larger than normal upgrade cycle."</p>

<p>Rivals including Alphabet's Google are also showcasing AI features to try to upend Apple's dominance in the high-end smartphone market.</p>

<p>Google, developer of the Android operating system which competes with Apple's iOS, traditionally announced its Pixel smartphones in the autumn. This year, it pushed the event to August ahead of Apple's announcement.</p>

<p>Google focused on AI features including Gemini Live, which allows users to hold live voice conversations with a digital assistant. Many of the AI features Google announced were also rolled out to the Android-based devices made by manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola.</p>

<p>"The question is who is going to be the first to combine a truly personal AI assistant with knowledge and information that is accurate and personalized," said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst for TECHnalysis Research.</p>

<p>Apple has so far shared a timeline for the release of Apple Intelligence only in the United States, where it is slated to launch on compatible devices in the autumn.</p>

<p>In June, one week after its developer conference, Apple said it would delay the release in Europe due to European Union tech rules.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A thrilling encounter between an eagle and a crocodile where they are both fighting for the same prey at South Africa's Kruger National Park has left wildlife enthusiasts stunned. Gavin Ellard, a visitor to the park, captured the intense moment on camera, which has since been shared on YouTube by 'Latest Sightings'.</p>

<p>Mr Ellard and his family were spending a long weekend in August at the Pafuri Border Rest Camp, relaxing by the pool when they were drawn to splashes in the nearby Luvuvhu River. Armed with his camera, Mr Ellard began recording what turned out to be an intense standoff between a crocodile and an eagle.</p>

<p>The crocodile had just secured its meal when the eagle swooped in, snatching the food right from the reptile's jaws. However, the bird's triumph was short-lived, as the catch proved too heavy to lift. Struggling to fly, the eagle dragged the food into the water, as the crocodile gave chase.</p>

<p>In a narrow escape, the eagle reached the riverbank, seemingly out of danger. But just as the bird was about to celebrate, a piece of the meal got lodged in the sand. Sensing an opportunity, the crocodile lunged with open jaws, forcing the eagle to abandon its prize and flee.</p>

<p>"The eagle was very lucky to be alive. It could have become the Croc's next meal," a user commented under the video.</p>

<p>Another wrote, "Eagle living on the edge. better be wiser."</p>

<p>"Incredible footage!! So rare to see thus, let alone capture it," a comment read.</p>

<p>Someone wrote, "World's dumbest criminals animal edition. first rule of the nest don't get your wings wet."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French retail giant Carrefour announced Monday that it will return to India by June 2025 in a franchise partnership with Dubai firm Apparel Group, a decade after leaving the country.</p>

<p>Carrefour pulled out of the Indian market in 2014, closing five wholesale stores after only a four-year presence in the country.</p>

<p>The supermarket group did not say how many stores may open in India.</p>

<p>With its population of more than 1.4 billion, "India is a strategic market pulled by economic growth, urbanisation and the growing purchasing power of consumers", Carrefour said in a statement.</p>

<p>Patrick Lasfargues, Carrefour's executive director of international partnerships, said the move was an "an important step in our strategy of expanding our franchise in more than 10 new countries by 2026".</p>

<p>Carrefour has more than 14,000 stores in more than 40 countries.</p>

<p>Apparel Group, a fashion and lifestyle retail company, already has a presence in India where it employs 24,000 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukraine's Ambassador to India, Oleksandr Polishchuk, said on Monday that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may visit India by the end of the year following an invitation extended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's Ambassador to India, Oleksandr Polishchuk, said on Monday that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may visit India by the end of the year following an invitation extended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but the dates of the visit will be decided according to mutual convenience.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Modi kindly invited my president to visit India, and I'm hopeful it will happen. Maybe by the end of this year, we will be happy to see President Zelenskyy here, as it would mark another step forward in our bilateral relationship. It would also provide a great opportunity for the two leaders to spend more time discussing the peace-building process around the world," Oleksandr Polishchuk told ANI.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian envoy mentioned that Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine was relatively short due to security concerns. However, in India, both leaders would have more time for discussions, he said.</p>

<p>"I know for certain that President Zelenskyy is very keen to visit India. He has never been here," he said, adding that "visit would take place at a time convenient for both sides".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Ukraine on August 23 this year at the invitation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. This marked the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established between the two countries in 1992.</p>

<p>In a joint statement issued at the end of the visit, Prime Minister Modi and President Zelenskyy reiterated their readiness for further cooperation in upholding principles of international law, including the UN Charter, such as respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of states. They agreed on the desirability of closer bilateral dialogue in this regard.</p>

<p>The Indian side reiterated its principled position and focus on peaceful resolution of Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, as a part of which, India has attended the Summit on Peace in Ukraine, held in Burgenstock, Switzerland, in June 2024.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian side welcomed such participation by India and highlighted the importance of high-level Indian participation in the next Peace Summit.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian side conveyed that the Joint Communique on a Peace Framework, adopted at the Summit on Peace in Ukraine, could serve as a basis for further efforts to promote just peace based on dialogue, diplomacy, and international law.</p>

<p>The Leaders appreciated various efforts to ensure global food security, including Ukrainian humanitarian grain initiative. The importance of uninterrupted and unhindered supply of agricultural products to global markets, especially in Asia and Africa, was emphasized.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi reiterated the need for sincere and practical engagement between all stakeholders to develop innovative solutions that will have broad acceptability and contribute towards early restoration of peace. He reiterated India's willingness to contribute in all possible ways to facilitate an early return of peace.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Modi thanked President Zelenskyy for the warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation during the visit and invited him to visit India at a mutually convenient opportunity," the joint statement said.</p>

<p>Zelenskyy had expressed his gratitude over PM Modi's visit to Ukraine.</p>

<p>"A very good meeting. This is a historic one... I am very thankful to the PM for coming. It's a good beginning with some practical steps," he said at a press conference later.</p>

<p>"I am happy that PM Modi came to visit us and I believe this is very important...This is the first visit of the Prime Minister of India to Ukraine. We are ready on our part to do the respective steps. We've heard messages from the Indian side that they would be happy to welcome our team to India," he added.</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who met Zelenskyy last week, said India and China can play a role in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>"China and India have a role to play in resolving this conflict. The only thing that cannot happen is to believe the conflict can be solved by abandoning Ukraine," Giorgia Meloni said according to Italian Government TV, cited by Reuters.</p>

<p>Giorgia Meloni's remarks follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's statement that India, China and Brazil could mediate in potential peace talks over Ukraine. Addressing the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF), the Russian leader stated that leaders of India, Brazil, and China are making a sincere effort to contribute to resolving the situation in Ukraine.</p>

<p>PM Modi had visited Russia in July this year. Putin was cited by Russian state media TASS as saying that he is in constant touch with India, China, and Brazil over the Ukraine conflict, as these countries are sincerely seeking to resolve all issues surrounding the conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time on Tuesday, each seeking an edge in what has become a neck-and-neck race for the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time on Tuesday, each seeking an edge in what has become a neck-and-neck race for the White House.</p>

<p>After weeks of back-and-forth on the where, when and how of the debate, US broadcaster ABC -- which is hosting the event -- announced the final rules of the contest, as agreed to by the two campaigns, this week.</p>

<p>Here are the major takeaways.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;When and where?</strong></p>

<p>The debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:00 pm local time Tuesday (0100 GMT Wednesday,) and will be aired live. There will be no audience present in the room.</p>

<p>The event will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, and will run for 90 minutes of debate time, with two commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Muted mics?</strong></p>

<p>The issue of whether microphones would be muted -- as they were during a previous debate between US President Joe Biden and Trump -- was a contentious one, with each side accusing the other of cowardice over the question.</p>

<p>ABC has announced that each candidate's microphone will only be live for when it is their turn to speak, and muted when the time belongs to the other candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only moderators will be allowed to ask questions, and no topics or questions will be shared in advance with the candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Who speaks when?</strong></p>

<p>Candidates will not offer opening statements. They will be allotted two minutes to answer each question, with two minutes granted to their opponent for a rebuttal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be an additional minute for "a follow-up, clarification, or response," according to the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the debate, each candidate will offer a two-minute closing statement, with Trump to go last, as per the results of a virtual coin toss.</p>

<p><strong>No props</strong></p>

<p>Candidates will stand behind podiums through the entire length of the debate, with no props or pre-written notes allowed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump and Harris will each be given a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water.</p>

<p>Campaign staff will not be allowed to speak or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed is the son of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the current president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-holds-talks-with-abu-dhabi-crown-prince-6523616 ">extensive discussions with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince</a> Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, focusing on improving the overall strategic partnership between India and the United Arab Emirates. The Crown Prince arrived in India on Sunday, and PM Modi received him at the Hyderabad House. The talks covered various aspects of bilateral relations and explored future areas of cooperation.<br />
<br />
The visit follows the significant elevation of bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership after PM Modi's landmark visit to the UAE in August 2015.<br />
<br />
<strong>About Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan</strong><br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed is the son of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the current president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi. He is the grandson of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder and first president of the UAE.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Education</strong><br />
<br />
Born on January 8, 1982, Prince Khalid received his education at the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom. During his time at Sandhurst, he acquired training in military and strategic skills.<br />
<br />
<strong>Career</strong><br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled has been groomed for leadership from an early age. In 2016, Sheikh Khaled was appointed head of national security, followed by his appointment as deputy national security adviser in 2017. In March 2023, Sheikh Khaled was appointed the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council. Shortly after, he approved a massive AED 85.4 billion plan to build 76,000 homes for citizens over five years.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Net worth</strong><br />
<br />
The Al Nahyan family, including Sheikh Khaled, holds significant wealth. The UAE royal family is among the wealthiest in the world, with assets spanning various sectors, including oil, real estate and investments. The net worth of the whole family combined is estimated to be $305 billion, which can be attributed to their control of 97.8 billion barrels of oil reserves. The crown prince also manages one of the largest sovereign wealth funds, with assets totalling billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Residence</strong><br />
<br />
The Al Nahyan family lives in their Rs 4,078 crore presidential palace and an extensive fleet of private jets, as per a GQ report. There lives Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and his remarkable family, which includes 18 brothers, 11 sisters, nine children, and 18 grandchildren. Their grand residence, Qasr Al-Watan, is spread over 94 acres, featuring a chandelier with 3,50,000 crystals and housing priceless historical artefacts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Investments and holdings</strong><br />
<br />
The Al Nahyan family's influence extends far beyond their oil reserves, which account for approximately six per cent of the world's total. Their investments span a range of industries, from Rihanna's Fenty beauty brand to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Their chief investment company, under Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, has surged in value by nearly 28,000 per cent over the past five years, reaching $235 billion and diversifying into agriculture, energy, entertainment and maritime sectors.<br />
<br />
The family owns prestigious properties in Paris and London. They also hold a significant stake in Manchester City, having acquired the football club in 2008 for Rs 2,122 crore. This acquisition extends to the City Football Group, which oversees football operations for clubs including Mumbai City and Melbourne City.<br />
<br />
The family's private jet fleet, led by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, includes eight aircraft, such as an Airbus A320-200 and three Boeing 787-9s. Sheikh Mohammed's personal jets include a Boeing 747 worth $478 million and a Boeing 787 valued at $176 million, featuring luxurious amenities like multiple cabins, meeting rooms, and a spa.<br />
<br />
In maritime luxury, the Al Nahyan family owns three of the world's top ten largest yachts. The Azzam, the largest yacht globally, measures 180 metres and includes a golf practice room and pearl inlays. Their second yacht, Blue, is the fourth largest and boasts features such as a dance floor, beach club, and a beauty salon.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Al Nahyan family's commitment to culture is exemplified by the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi, the largest museum in the Arabian Peninsula.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Personal life</strong><br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled has been married to Sheikha Fatima bint Suroor Al Nahyan since 2008. They have three children together – Shamma, Mohammed and Salama.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Positions</strong><br />
<br />
Currently, Sheikh Khaled serves on Abu Dhabi's Supreme Council for Financial and Economic Affairs and is a board member of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. He is also the chairman of the Emirates Genome Council, launched in 2023. He also initiated the AED 1.9 billion RizeUp scholarship program in 2022, offering 6,000 Emirati students opportunities to study in the US and Canada by 2028.<br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled's business partners include Singaporean businessman Ong Beng Seng. The crown prince has also launched several initiatives, including the Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi project, a clean energy partnership between ADNOC and Emirates Water and Electricity Company, and the Abu Dhabi Industrial Strategy, aiming to grow the emirate's industrial sector to AED 172 billion.<br />
<br />
Sheikh Khaled supports Masdar's Youth 4 Sustainability program and has launched the Abu Dhabi Mangrove project, aiming to make Abu Dhabi a global centre for research and innovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">In July 2023, rising US basketball star Bronny James collapsed on the court during practice and was sent to hospital. The 18-year-old athlete, son of famous LA Lakers' veteran LeBron James, had experienced a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bronny-james-cardiac-arrest-3953eee8789e83f3cccfb6dd798bc54e">cardiac arrest</a>.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Many media outlets incorrectly referred to the event as a “<a href="https://en.as.com/nba/lebron-james-son-bronny-plays-for-the-usc-trojans-for-the-first-time-since-suffering-a-heart-attack-n/">heart attack</a>” or used the terms interchangeably.</p>

<p>A cardiac arrest and a heart attack are distinct yet overlapping concepts associated with the heart.</p>

<p>With some background in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKrgEv7-rVM&amp;t=16s">how the heart works</a>, we can see how they differ and how they're related.</p>

<h2><strong>Understanding the heart</strong></h2>

<p>The heart is a muscle that contracts to work as a pump. When it contracts it pushes blood – containing oxygen and nutrients – to all the tissues of our body.</p>

<p>For the heart muscle to work effectively as a pump, it needs to be fed its own blood supply, delivered by the coronary arteries. If these arteries are blocked, the heart muscle doesn't get the blood it needs.</p>

<p>This can cause the heart muscle to become injured or die, and results in the heart not pumping properly.</p>

<h2><strong>Heart attack or cardiac arrest?</strong></h2>

<p>Simply put, a heart attack, technically known as a myocardial infarction, describes injury to, or death of, the heart muscle.</p>

<p>A cardiac arrest, sometimes called a sudden cardiac arrest, is when the heart stops beating, or put another way, stops working as an effective pump.</p>

<p>In other words, both relate to the heart not working as it should, but for different reasons. As we'll see later, one can lead to the other.</p>

<h2><strong>Why do they happen? Who's at risk?</strong></h2>

<p>Heart attacks typically result from blockages in the coronary arteries. Sometimes this is called coronary artery disease, but in Australia, we tend to refer to it as ischaemic heart disease.</p>

<p>The underlying cause in about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507799/#:%7E:text=It%20has%20been%20reported%20that,increases%20beyond%20age%2050%20years.">75% of people</a> is a process called <a href="https://youtu.be/jwL4lkSlvSA?si=H2as7dQkhbIqWWkU">atherosclerosis</a>. This is where fatty and fibrous tissue build up in the walls of the coronary arteries, forming a plaque. The plaque can block the blood vessel or, in some instances, lead to the formation of a blood clot.</p>

<p>Atherosclerosis is a long-term, stealthy process, with a number of risk factors that can sneak up on anyone. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, diet, diabetes, stress, and your genes have all been implicated in this plaque-building process.</p>

<p>Other causes of heart attacks include spasms of the coronary arteries (causing them to constrict), chest trauma, or anything else that reduces blood flow to the heart muscle.</p>

<p>Regardless of the cause, blocking or reducing the flow of blood through these pipes can result in the heart muscle not receiving enough oxygen and nutrients. So cells in the heart muscle can be injured or die.</p>

<p>But a cardiac arrest is the result of heartbeat irregularities, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively around the body. These heartbeat irregularities are generally due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_soKG-Tzh0&amp;t=903s">electrical malfunctions</a> in the heart. There are four distinct types:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>ventricular tachycardia:</strong> a rapid and abnormal heart rhythm in which the heartbeat is more than <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10541285/">100 beats per minute</a> (normal adult, resting heart rate is generally 60-90 beats per minute). This fast heart rate prevents the heart from filling with blood and thus pumping adequately</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>ventricular fibrillation:</strong> instead of regular beats, the heart quivers or “fibrillates”, resembling a bag of worms, resulting in an irregular heartbeat greater than 300 beats per minute</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>pulseless electrical activity:</strong> arises when the heart muscle fails to generate sufficient pumping force after electrical stimulation, resulting in no pulse</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>asystole:</strong> the classic flat-line heart rhythm you see in movies, indicating no electrical activity in the heart.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cardiac arrest can arise from numerous underlying conditions, both heart-related and not, such as drowning, trauma, asphyxia, electrical shock and drug overdose. James' cardiac arrest was attributed to a <a href="https://www.espn.com.au/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/38260006/bronny-james-cardiac-arrest-caused-congenital-heart-defect">congenital heart defect</a>, a heart condition he was born with.</p>

<p>But among the many causes of a cardiac arrest, ischaemic heart disease, such as a heart attack, stands out as the most common cause, accounting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11898927/">for 70%</a> of all cases.</p>

<p>So how can a heart attack cause a cardiac arrest? You'll remember that during a heart attack, heart muscle can be damaged or parts of it may die. This damaged or dead tissue can disrupt the heart's ability to conduct electrical signals, increasing the risk of developing arrhythmias, possibly causing a cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>So while a heart attack is a common cause of cardiac arrest, a cardiac arrest generally does not cause a heart attack.</p>

<h2><strong>What do they look like?</strong></h2>

<p>Because a cardiac arrest results in the sudden loss of effective heart pumping, the most common signs and symptoms are a sudden loss of consciousness, absence of pulse or heartbeat, stopping of breathing, and pale or blue-tinged skin.</p>

<p>But the common signs and symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain or discomfort, which can show up in other regions of the body such as the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach. Also frequent are shortness of breath, nausea, light-headedness, looking pale, and sweating.</p>

<h2><strong>What's the take-home message?</strong></h2>

<p>While both heart attack and cardiac arrest are disorders related to the heart, they differ in their mechanisms and outcomes.</p>

<p>A heart attack is like a blockage in the plumbing supplying water to a house. But a cardiac arrest is like an electrical malfunction in the house's wiring.</p>

<p>Despite their different nature both conditions can have severe consequences and require immediate medical attention.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>Police director Mauricio Arriaza was escorting former cooperative manager Manuel Coto back to El Salvador.</p>

<p>Coto, who was is accused of embezzling $35 million, had been arrested earlier on Sunday in Honduras after attempting to flee to the United States. He was subsequently handed over to Salvadoran police.</p>

<p>According to the Salvadoran Armed Forces, the helicopter crashed in the Pasaquina district, in the southeast of the country near the border with Honduras. The total number of people in the helicopter when it crashed remains unknown.</p>

<p>President Nayib Bukele said on X: "What happened cannot remain a simple 'accident'. It must be investigated thoroughly and to the last consequences."</p>

<p>He praised Arriaza for his significant contribution to national security and his roles in various police operations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late on Sunday in the southern Philippines, police arrested Apollo Quiboloy, a self-proclaimed "Appointed Son of God" and pastor of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) church, after an extensive manhunt spanning more than two weeks. The manhunt for Quiboloy - an evangelist with global reach, close ties to former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and millions of followers across the world -culminated in his surrender to local police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 74-year-old Quiboloy now faces charges of child sex trafficking, sexual abuse, and human trafficking that stem from a US indictment in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Quiboloy's Rise to Power</strong></h2>

<p>Born in the southern Philippines, Apollo Carreon Quiboloy is no ordinary preacher. He founded KOJC in 1985, a fringe religious organisation that grew exponentially, drawing millions of adherents across the Philippines and more than 200 countries. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/world/asia/philippines-pastor-kingdom-trafficking.html">New York Times</a>, KOJC, which blends elements of Pentecostal Christianity with Quiboloy's self-declared divine status, quickly became a dominant force in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Known as a "spiritual adviser" to former President Rodrigo Duterte, Quiboloy wielded immense influence over local and national politicians. His ability to deliver large voting blocs earned him a reputation as a spiritual kingmaker. Many saw his support as essential for winning elections, especially in Davao City, where he maintained a sprawling 75-acre compound called "New Jerusalem."</p>

<p>However, Quiboloy's spiritual kingdom hid a much darker reality, according to US and Philippine law enforcement agencies. His influence wasn't just political but allegedly included the systematic abuse and exploitation of vulnerable women and children, who were coerced into lives of servitude under the guise of faith.</p>

<h2><strong>Allegations Of Abuse And Exploitation</strong></h2>

<p>In 2021, Quiboloy was indicted by the US on charges of sex trafficking, sexual abuse, conspiracy, and forced labour. Quiboloy's alleged victims, some as young as 12, were recruited as "pastoral" -personal assistants who were expected to provide for his every need, including sexual favours. Referred to as "night duty," these sexual encounters were coerced under threat of spiritual and eternal damnation, according to US prosecutors. The indictment claimed that young women were forced to write "commitment letters" in which they devoted their lives and bodies to Quiboloy.</p>

<p>According to testimonies from some of the victims, those who were deemed to have "sinned" by resisting him were sent to "Prayer Mountain," a remote property on the outskirts of Davao City. There, punishments included head shaving, physical beatings, and other degrading forms of discipline, the New York Times reported.</p>

<h2><strong>Human Trafficking</strong></h2>

<p>Quiboloy's alleged abuses did not remain confined to the Philippines. His church had an international footprint, and American prosecutors revealed that his operations involved the trafficking of women and children across borders. According to the FBI, church members were sent to the United States on fraudulently obtained visas. There, they were forced to solicit donations for a purported children's charity called the "Children's Joy Foundation." However, those donations never made it to underprivileged children. Instead, the funds supported the lavish lifestyles of Quiboloy and other church leaders, including private jets, luxury properties, and other extravagances.</p>

<p>Quiboloy's workers, many of whom were part of the Philippines' large overseas labour force, were forced to solicit donations in countries like the United States, Singapore, and the UAE. In some cases, church members were made to endure near-enslavement conditions, sleeping in cars and being denied food if they failed to meet financial quotas.</p>

<h2><strong>The Fall Of The 'Appointed Son Of God'</strong></h2>

<p>In the Philippines, Quiboloy continued to preach from his Davao City headquarters and exerted influence over local government officials. Despite being placed on the FBI's Most Wanted list in 2021, he remained largely untouchable, protected by his powerful political allies, including Duterte.</p>

<p>This invincibility was tested when, on August 24 Philippine authorities, in coordination with the military, launched a massive raid on KOJC's Davao City compound. Nearly 2,000 heavily armed police officers surrounded the church's headquarters, searching for the fugitive pastor. The operation resulted in a weeklong standoff between law enforcement and church members, many of whom saw Quiboloy as a divine figure being unfairly persecuted.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi today have signed multiple pacts in the fields of nuclear energy, oil and food parks development.</p>

<p>The two leaders signed an agreement in the field of Barakah Nuclear Power Plant Operations and Maintenance between Emirates Nuclear Energy Company (ENEC) and Nuclear Power Cooperation of India Limited (NPCIL).</p>

<p>Another agreement was signed for long-term LNG supply between Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited. An MoU was signed between ADNOC and India Strategic Petroleum Reserve Limited (ISPRL).</p>

<p>A product concession agreement for Abu Dhabi Onshore Block 1 was signed between Urja Bharat and ADNOC.</p>

<p>Lastly, an MoU was signed between Government of Gujarat and Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company PJSC (ADQ) on food parks development in India.</p>

<p>After the meeting, the Crown Prince paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. "His teachings continue to inspire us as we strengthen our friendship with UAE," the Ministry of External Affairs wrote on X.</p>

<p>PM Modi received Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>This is the first time India has officially engaged with the next generation of royalty and government from the UAE, highlighting the importance India gives to its ties with the UAE.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince will also call on President Droupadi Murmu.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to visit Mumbai tomorrow, where he will participate in a Business Forum in which top business leaders from both countries will participate.</p>

<p>Since the landmark visit by PM Modi to UAE in August 2015, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 34 years, bilateral relations between the two countries have elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>India is the UAE's second-largest trading partner, while the UAE is India's largest trading partner in the Arab world. Total trade between India and the UAE is projected to reach USD 100 billion by the end of the decade. The bilateral trade between the two countries in 2022-23 was about USD 85 billion, according to official data.</p>

<p>The UAE is also among the top four investors in India in terms of Foreign Direct Investments or FDI in 2022-23.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to hostile exchanges between prosecutor and felon, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are old hands.</p>

<p>But Tuesday's high-stakes debate will be new territory for the Democratic vice president and her Republican rival, due to meet for the first time in front of a prime-time television audience of millions.</p>

<p>"The striking thing about this debate is, it's the first time in history where we'll see a prosecutor and convicted felon facing off against each other," Andrew Koneschusky, a PR expert and former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That's an incredible contrast. I wouldn't expect a lot of intricate policy discussion. I expect we'll see more style than substance."</p>

<p>Students of debating technique identify Trump, who is 78, as an avid proponent of the "Gish Gallop," named for Duane Gish.</p>

<p>Gish, who defended as literally true the Biblical account of the world's creation in six days, would overwhelm opponents with a dizzying torrent of rapid-fire falsehoods, distortions and distractions.</p>

<p>Trump -- who is not known to have a granular grasp of policy -- owes much of his success to this kind of filibustering, as he packs conspiracy theory, anecdote and aside into an arcane, rebuttal-proof word salad.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to debate someone who is quickly changing topics and not fully or truthfully answering the questions," said Flavio Hickel, a politics professor at Maryland liberal arts school Washington College.</p>

<p>But while the "Gish Gallop" may be good at putting opponents on the back foot, it is a risky strategy for someone trying to look presidential, analysts warn.</p>

<h2><strong>'Certainty and strength'</strong></h2>

<p>"As a debater, Trump brings energy, conveys certainty and strength, and never admits error, which translates for many people into presidential qualities," said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and professor at Binghamton University in New York state.</p>

<p>"Of course, they are likely to be coupled with transparent lies, wild exaggerations, unseemly ad hominem attacks and loopy digressions that have the opposite effect, especially on the few undecided voters."</p>

<p>Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket after 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dismal debate performance against Trump led to him dropping out of the race amid questions around his advanced years.</p>

<p>Analysts expect the 59-year-old Californian -- "Kamala the Cop" to her admirers -- to lean into her experience as a district attorney and press Trump on his role in the deadly 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, as well as his multiple criminal cases.</p>

<p>"Harris is a sharp prosecutor," said Keith Gaddie, a politics professor at Texas Christian University.</p>

<p>"She showed her chops debating Biden and others in 2020, and will likely lean into a combination of tricks used by prosecutors to control witnesses, while also cultivating 'jury sympathy.'"</p>

<p>Since Harris's ascension, Democrats' messaging has evolved from presenting Trump as a powerful and existential threat to democracy to minimizing him as "weird" and small.</p>

<p>Koneschusky expects to see more of this in the debate, but warned that Harris faces a balancing act between going after her opponent and using her precious airtime to make her own pitch for the Oval Office.</p>

<h2><strong>Former prosecutor</strong></h2>

<p>"On the one hand, this is a chance for Harris to define herself, and she needs to fully capitalize on that opportunity," he said.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, it's also important that Harris prosecutes the case against Trump in this debate, and she's well-equipped to do so as a former prosecutor. This is something Biden failed to do in the last debate."</p>

<p>One of Harris's standout debate moments came against Biden, ironically, in the 2019-20 Democratic presidential nominating contest, when she took her then-rival to task for his opposition to using federal funds to desegregate schools through busing.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me," Harris said, in a moment that immediately went viral.</p>

<p>But her short-lived 2020 bid for the White House also illustrated weaknesses, as when she allowed herself to be rattled by former Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who savaged Harris over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard has switched sides and Trump has been using her in his debate prep.</p>

<p>The use of muted microphones during the Trump debate may meanwhile deprive Harris of another strength -- her ability to shut down rivals when they try to interrupt.</p>

<p>Harris deployed this to full effect when Mike Pence tried to cut her off during their 2020 vice-presidential debate and she stopped him dead with an ice-cold, "Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Telegram channel with more than 220,000 participants was reportedly being used to create and share these artificial intelligence-generated pornographic images, serving as a global reminder of the darker consequences from the widespread rush of AI.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea has been rocked by a wave of sexually explicit deepfake images being created and shared online, indiscriminately targeting women and girls using their school photos, social media selfies and even military headshots. A Telegram channel with more than 220,000 participants was reportedly being used to create and share these artificial intelligence-generated pornographic images, serving as a global reminder of the darker consequences from the widespread rush for this technology.</p>

<p>Users could upload photos and in a matter of seconds create explicit content with the faces of their friends, classmates or romantic partners. The initial reporting from local news outlets prompted more women to come forward as victims and more Telegram channels being exposed, revealing the true scale of the issue. Many of the victims involved are minors. Protesters wearing white masks over their eyes gathered in Seoul calling for justice late last month.</p>

<p>As outrage mounted, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called on his government to crack down on the digital abuse, and authorities said they would form a task force to tackle the issue. While police investigated, another disturbing trend emerged. Preliminary data indicate a vast majority of the suspected perpetrators from the recent wave of cases were in their teens.</p>

<p>"Some may dismiss it as a mere prank, but it is clearly a criminal act that exploits technology under the shield of anonymity," Yoon said during a cabinet meeting late last month, acknowledging that many of both the victims and perpetrators were minors.</p>

<p>Yoon is right. This isn't just a prank, and the impact of this type of digital sexual violence can be devastating for victims. A lot of the blame is rightly being placed on Telegram, especially as the scandal is coming to a head at the same time as the platform's Chief Executive Officer Pavel Durov has been arrested and charged in France for alleged complicity in crimes, including the sharing of child pornography, committed on his app. Korean authorities said Telegram is cooperating with the investigation and requests to remove content.</p>

<p>But Yoon's words will ring hollow for some, given he came to power in 2022 courting young male voters with proposals to scrap the gender equality ministry, which he accused of treating men like "potential sex criminals." He also claimed that systemic gender discrimination does not exist in South Korea, and implied feminism was to blame for the country's low birth rate. Meanwhile, women earn some 30% less than their male counterparts, marking the highest gender wage gap in the developed world. Even in dual-income households, women bear the brunt of housework and childcare responsibilities.</p>

<p>And before the recent crop of AI tools made generating deepfake explicit images much easier, advocacy groups had been drawing attention to a rash of digital sex crimes, usually involving non-consensual intimate images or hidden cameras.</p>

<p>There is a host of reasons that South Korean women, like their counterparts across the developed world, are choosing not to have children, including rising participation in the labor force and the uneven toll of raising children. Rather than blame feminism, it might be more useful to look at this mountain of deeply troubling data. Ironically, one of the main Telegram groups spreading these images reportedly had some 227,000 members - that's roughly on par with the number of babies born last year.</p>

<p>South Korean women are boldly bringing this issue to light with protests and activism, the first step in enacting change for a crisis that is impacting people around the globe. Compared to other jurisdictions, the nation is also ahead of the curve when it comes to regulating deepfake porn. It actually has laws in place, including punishments of up to five years in prison and fines for people convicted of creating images with the intent to distribute. In the US, federal legislation has garnered bipartisan support among lawmakers but is still making its way at a snail's pace through Congress.</p>

<p>Regulation is important, but the cases in Korea also expose how difficult enforcement can be for such a widespread problem, as well as how easy it is for this content to be created and shared in the first place. Expanding laws to make it illegal to possess such material could help. But this still puts a lot of responsibility on victims to digitally trace back who created the content that upended their lives.</p>

<p>The Telegram CEO's recent arrest shows there's increased global momentum to hold tech companies accountable for their role in harms taking place on their platforms. This is a step in the right direction; as more regulators shift responsibility to these powerful companies, more industry-led solutions would be welcome. Universities and research centers are developing some promising tools to protect images from AI manipulation. But not enough resources are being devoted to ensuring the responsible rollout of AI from the industry creating it.</p>

<p>More onus must be put on tech companies to come up with proactive solutions. Many tech giants have pulled back on ethical and responsible AI teams in recent years amid broader cost-cutting. But the dignity of women and girls isn't something that should be sacrificed in favor of profit.</p>

<p>South Korea is the current epicenter of this crisis. But it is a global issue that can impact anyone from celebrities like Taylor Swift to middle school girls from Seoul to New Jersey. The tech sector cannot keep skirting responsibility much longer.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two British women have accused controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate of "rape" and "strangulation", the BBC reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two British women have accused controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate of “rape” and “strangulation”, the BBC reported. Andrew Tate and his brother, Tristan, are facing charges of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in Romania. If convicted, the brothers could face jail for over 10 years. Both of them deny the charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrew Tate, currently under house arrest in Romania, is already under investigation for multiple charges, including sex with a minor and human trafficking of underage individuals. New allegations, including testimonies from British women who claim they were attacked by the Tate brothers in the UK before the Romania case began, have also emerged.</p>

<p>“Anna,” not her real name, says she dated Andrew Tate in 2013. She recalls him threatening her before raping and strangling her. “He just looked at me and said, ‘I'm debating whether I should rape you or not,'” she told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyje823er4o ">BBC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tate later sent her disturbing messages about enjoying the violence he inflicted. “The more you didn't like it, the more I enjoyed it,” he said in a voice note to the victim. He also wrote in a text message, “I love raping you.”</p>

<p>Another woman, “Sienna,” says she met Tate in 2014 and was strangled to unconsciousness during sex. “I was absolutely terrified,” she told BBC. “I just remember gasping for air... It was rape.” He kept raping her even after she regained consciousness, she said.</p>

<p>She woke up with a bloodshot eye the next day, a common symptom of strangulation in domestic abuse cases. A friend of Sienna's corroborated her account, stating she told him about the incident at the time and he saw her eye injury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two women's allegations follow a series of other similar claims. Many women say Tate used manipulation and control to trap them in abusive situations.</p>

<p>The Tate brothers have faced growing legal challenges, including trafficking and exploitation charges in Romania, where prosecutors say women were transported from the UK for sexual exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite numerous accusations, Andrew Tate denies ever hurting anyone, claiming in a 2023 BBC interview that he never engaged in non-consensual acts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Night owls -- a person who is habitually active or wakeful at night -- tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI), larger waists, and more hidden body fat and thus are almost 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Night owls -- a person who is habitually active or wakeful at night -- tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI), larger waists, and more hidden body fat and thus are almost 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) than those who go to bed earlier, shows new research on Monday.</p>

<p>Previous studies have indicated that late chronotype -- people who prefer to go to bed late and wake up late -- live an unhealthy lifestyle, and are at higher risk of obesity and metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>The new study showed that a late chronotype had a 46 per cent higher risk of developing diabetes, which suggests that the increased risk of T2D can't be explained by lifestyle alone.</p>

<p>"We believe that other mechanisms are also at play," said lead researcher Dr. Jeroen van der Velde, from Leiden University Medical Centre, in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>"A likely explanation is that the circadian rhythm or body clock in late chronotypes is out of sync with the work and social schedules followed by society. This can lead to circadian misalignment, which we know can lead to metabolic disturbances and ultimately type 2 diabetes," van der Velde added.</p>

<p>To explore, the team studied the association between sleep timing, diabetes, and body fat distribution in more than 5,000 individuals who were divided into three groups: early chronotype (20 per cent), late chronotype (20 per cent), and intermediate chronotype (60 per cent).</p>

<p>The team measured all participants' BMI and waist circumference, while visceral fat and liver fat were measured in 1,526 participants, using MRI scans and MR spectroscopy, respectively.</p>

<p>About 225 were diagnosed with diabetes after a follow-up of 6.6 years.</p>

<p>Late chronotypes were found to be at higher risk of developing diabetes, had a 0.7 kg/m2 higher BMI, 1.9 cm larger waist circumference, 7 cm2 more visceral fat, and 14 per cent higher liver fat content, compared with those with an intermediate chronotype.</p>

<p>More visceral fat and liver fat were responsible for making people with a late chronotype to be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, van der Velde said.</p>

<p>The findings will be presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Madrid, Spain (September 9-13).</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

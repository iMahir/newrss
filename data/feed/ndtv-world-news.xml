       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN experts on Tuesday accused Iran of denying jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi proper healthcare, saying she reportedly suffered physical violence earlier this month.</p>

<p>Human rights activist Mohammadi, who won the 2023 Nobel for her campaigning, was hurt along with other female inmates in clashes that erupted at Tehran's Evin prison, her family said earlier in August.</p>

<p>Mohammadi "was reportedly subjected to physical violence" in Evin on August 6, during which she "allegedly lost consciousness, and sustained injuries to her ribcage and other parts of her body", the experts said.</p>

<p>Iranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation took place but blamed Mohammadi for "provocation" and denied any prisoners had been beaten.</p>

<p>Mohammadi, 52, has been jailed since November 2021 and has spent much of the past decade in and out of prison.</p>

<p>"Our deep concerns about the physical and mental integrity of Narges Mohammadi have been communicated to the Iranian government," the UN experts said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>"Once again we call on Iranian authorities to release her immediately and ensure her access to full medical care without delay, along with other detainees."</p>

<p>They said that over the past eight months, Mohammadi had been suffering from acute back and knee pain, including a herniated spinal disc, according to medical specialists and scan examinations.</p>

<p>"The denial of medical care appears to be used to punish and silence Mohammadi inside prison. These reports raise serious concerns regarding her right to health and physical well-being," the experts said.</p>

<p>The special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the UN Human Rights Council who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.</p>

<p>They said there was a pattern of ill-treatment of detainees in Iran.</p>

<p>"Such deprivations may amount to torture and inhuman treatment," they said.</p>

<p>The panel reiterated its "calls for the immediate release of human rights defenders and all other individuals in Iranian detention facilities who are currently being held arbitrarily".</p>

<p>Mohammadi has kept campaigning behind bars and strongly supported the protests that erupted across Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's strict dress rules for women.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said on Tuesday that US President Joe Biden's comment that the Palestinian group was backing away from a Gaza ceasefire agreement with Israel was "misleading".</p>

<p>Biden, responding to questions on a ceasefire deal, said: "Israel says they can work it out, they're prepared. But I was told Hamas is now backing off."</p>

<p>While boarding a plane after giving a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, he added: "It remains to be seen. We're going to keep pushing."</p>

<p>Hamas said Biden's statements do not reflect the true position of the movement, which says it has been keen to reach a cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>"The proposal recently presented to us goes against what the parties had agreed on July 2, this is considered an American response and acquiescence to the terrorist Netanyahu's new conditions and his criminal plans towards the Gaza Strip", Hamas added, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on his ninth trip to the region since the war began, expressed optimism after meeting Israeli officials on Monday.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Blinken was in Cairo pushing for areas of possible progress on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in talks planned for later this week, with major areas of dispute still unresolved.</p>

<p>The US had put forward bridging proposals that the mediating countries - Qatar, the United States and Egypt - believe would close gaps between Israel and Hamas and end the hostilities that have destabilized the entire region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Super Blue Moon is a rare astronomical event that was seen in the night sky on August 19 after almost a year.&nbsp;A supermoon happens when the full Moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as perigee. When the Moon is at or near this closest point, it appears slightly larger and brighter in the sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Super Moon sets behind the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Despite its name, the Moon does not appear blue unless specific atmospheric conditions are in place, such as smoke or dust scattering light in a way that makes the Moon take on a bluish hue.&nbsp;While supermoons happen several times a year, blue moons are less frequent. The combination of a supermoon and a blue moon is rare, with occurrences spaced about ten years apart on average. The next super blue moon won't occur until 2037, making this a special opportunity for skywatchers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A superyacht which belonged to the family of UK businessman Mike Lynch sank off Italian island Sicily yesterday. Six people including Mike Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter, Morgan Stanley International chairman Jonathan Bloomer, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo, and their wives, have been missing since the yacht sank.</p>

<p>Mike Lynch was hosting his friends and family on the 56-metre luxury yacht called "Bayesian" to celebrate his win in a big US fraud case when the tragedy happened, according to news agency AFP. A total of 22 people were aboard the boat. Mike Lynch's wife Angela Bacares is among the fifteen people who were rescued before the yacht sank.</p>

<p><strong>Here are 5 facts about UK tycoon Mike Lynch:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mike Lynch was born in 1965 and was raised in Chelmsford town near London. His mother was a nurse and father was a fireman.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mike Lynch went to Cambridge University where he studied physics, mathematics and biochemistry. He then went on to research signal processing for his PhD. His thesis is considered to be ground-breaking and is reportedly widely consulted in the university's library.</li>
	<li>Mike Lynch founded UK's largest software firm, Autonomy, in 1996, which searched and organised data using patented algorithms. He was called Britain's Bill Gates.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fifteen years later, in 2001, Mike Lynch sold Autonomy to HP for $11 billion. Later, HP accused Lynch of fraud which lead to a decade-long trial. In June this year, after 12 year-long trial, Lynch was acquitted of all charges by a jury in San Francisco.</li>
	<li>After selling Autonomy, Mike Lynch set up venture capital firm Invoke, which backed big companies such as cyber security company Darktrace, software firm Featurespace and more.</li>
</ul>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In war-ravaged Gaza, every drop of water counts, making Inas al-Ghul's makeshift sun-powered water filter a vital asset for parched Palestinians surviving endless bombardment under the territory's scorching heat.</p>

<p>Using wood from the few pallets of aid that make it into Gaza, and window panes salvaged from buildings that have largely been abandoned in 10 months of war, the 50-year-old agricultural engineer built a glass-covered trough.</p>

<p>She lets saltwater evaporate from the trough, heated by the greenhouse effect created by the glass panes, allowing the water to distil and leaving behind the salt.</p>

<p>From there, a long black hose carries the evaporated water to other containers filled with activated charcoal to further filter out impurities.</p>

<p>"It is a very simple device, it's very simple to use and to build," Ghul told AFP after taking a long gulp from a glass of filtered water in her house in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip.</p>

<h3><strong>Abundant energy</strong></h3>

<p>Ghul's device "doesn't require electricity, filters, or solar panels, it operates solely on solar energy", which Gaza has in abundance, with 14 hours of sunshine per day in the summer, and eight hours in the winter.</p>

<p>This has proven particularly useful at a time when Gaza's only power plant is down and electricity supplies from Israel have been cut for months.</p>

<p>With fuel also in short supply, Gaza's desalination plants that haven't been damaged in the fighting have been working at a drastically reduced capacity.</p>

<p>Mohammad Abu Daoud, a displaced Gazan sweating in the midday sun, said Ghul's invention "comes exactly at the right time".</p>

<p>"For about two months, we have relied on it entirely," he told AFPTV.</p>

<p>This brings crucial help to those who benefit from it, as the available water for Gazans currently averages 4.74 litres per day, "under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies", Oxfam reported in July.</p>

<p>This represents "less than a single toilet flush", the aid group warned in a report, which estimates that available water per person per day in the Gaza Strip plummeted by 94 percent since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>Water was already scarce before the conflict erupted, and most of it was undrinkable. The 2.4 million population relies primarily on an increasingly polluted and depleted aquifer, humanitarian agencies say.</p>

<h3><strong>'Water as a weapon of war'</strong></h3>

<p>The war broke out with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 40,173 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>In the school-turned-shelter where Abu Daoud lives, close to Ghul's house, other displaced families have come to rely on the water filtration system to fill up their bottles.</p>

<p>The 250-litre tank that stores the clean water quickly empties.</p>

<p>Oxfam accuses Israel of using "water as a weapon of war", and has warned of "a deadly health catastrophe" for Gazans, almost all of whom have been displaced at least once.</p>

<p>The aid group calculated that "Israeli military attacks have damaged or destroyed five water and sanitation infrastructure sites every three days since the start of the war".</p>

<p>The lack of clean water has had drastic effects on the population, with "26 percent of Gaza's population falling severely ill from easily preventable diseases", it said.</p>

<p>Conscious of the pressing need for her device and of the ubiquitous danger of air strikes, Ghul regularly climbs up to her terrace to watch over her creation, and to open or close her precious taps.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An intense storm sank a luxury yacht off Sicily's coast on Monday, killing one man and leaving six missing, including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter. Fifteen people escaped before the yacht sank.</p>

<p>Here are details about the missing passengers.</p>

<h3><strong>MIKE LYNCH AND DAUGHTER HANNAH</strong></h3>

<p>Tech entrepreneur Lynch built Britain's biggest software company, Autonomy. Often dubbed Britain's Bill Gates, the 59-year-old was lauded by shareholders, scientists and politicians when he sold it to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion in 2011.</p>

<p>But in late 2012, HP said it had found a massive accounting scandal at the business, and wrote off $8.8 billion of its value. Lynch spent the next 12 years trying to clear his name and was acquitted on all criminal charges just weeks ago in the United States.</p>

<p>After the sale of Autonomy, Lynch founded Invoke Capital, a technology venture capital fund.</p>

<p>Lynch's daughter Hannah, 18, is also missing. A Sunday Times profile of Lynch last month said Hannah was preparing to study English literature at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>His wife, Angela Bacares, who owns the vessel, was also aboard it but was rescued.</p>

<h3><strong>JONATHAN BLOOMER AND WIFE JUDY BLOOMER</strong></h3>

<p>Jonathan Bloomer appeared as a character witness in Lynch's legal case earlier this year. Bloomer has been non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International since 2016, and is the chair of international specialist insurer, Hiscox.</p>

<p>He was also chief executive of insurance and investment company Prudential from 2000 to 2005.</p>

<p>He studied physics at London's Imperial College in the 1970s, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>One of Bloomer's former employees wrote on LinkedIn he was "always a friendly, approachable and engaging man".</p>

<p>Hiscox Chief Executive Aki Hussain said in a statement on Tuesday they were deeply shocked and saddened and their thoughts were with all those affected, in particular Bloomer and his wife Judy, who was also aboard the yacht.</p>

<p>Judy, who studied English language and literature at Homerton College in Cambridge, has worked as a psychotherapist for nearly 30 years, specialising in anxiety and stress. She started her career as a teacher.</p>

<h3><strong>CHRISTOPHER MORVILLO AND WIFE NEDA MORVILLO</strong></h3>

<p>American Christopher Morvillo, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in New York City, was part of Lynch's defence team, fighting a long legal battle to acquit his client. His first ever post on LinkedIn was around two months ago to celebrate the court victory.</p>

<p>"None of this would have been possible without your love and support," Morvillo wrote to his family in the post, including his wife, Neda Morvillo.</p>

<p>Before joining Clifford Chance in November 2011, Morvillo worked as a principal at Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason &amp; Anello PC, providing advice on white collar criminal defence and regulatory matters.</p>

<p>Morvillo, who studied law at Fordham University, also worked as an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York between 1999 and 2005, assisting in the criminal investigation arising out of the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>

<p>David Oscar Markus, a criminal defence lawyer and podcast host, interviewed Morvillo last week. He wrote a blog describing him as a "superstar lawyer".</p>

<p>"Chris dedicated over a decade of his career to obtaining justice for Mike Lynch," Markus wrote. "He got it and then for this to happen.... it's tough to find the right words."</p>

<p>Morvillo's wife, Neda, is the owner of a luxury jewellery line under her maiden name, Neda Nassiri. According to the company's website, she has been designing and hand-crafting jewellery in New York for over two decades.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 10 months after Hamas operatives attacked Israel and took 251 people hostage, 71 people believed to be alive are still being held in Gaza, according to an AFP database.</p>

<p>A further 34 the Israeli military says are dead also remain in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The hostages are key bargaining chips for Hamas, the Palestinian group which rules the Gaza Strip, as it negotiates a truce with Israel.</p>

<p>After the death of hostage Avraham Munder, 79, in captivity in the Gaza Strip was announced by his kibbutz and the Israeli army repatriated his body and five other bodies, AFP takes stock of the situation.</p>

<p><strong>57 men, 12 women, two children</strong></p>

<p>Of the original 251 hostages taken on October 7, 116, mainly women and children, have been released, mostly during a week-long truce in November when they were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>While 71 are still held hostage and believed to be alive, the Israeli army says 34 others are confirmed to be dead.</p>

<p>The military has also repatriated the bodies of 30 hostages who died either in Gaza or were killed on October 7 and whose bodies were taken to the territory.</p>

<p>Of the 71 who may still be alive, 64 are Israelis (some of whom have more than one nationality), six are Thai nationals and one is a Nepalese national.</p>

<p>They comprise 57 men, 12 women, and two children. Eleven are military personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Death after death</strong></p>

<p>Since the end of the truce on December 1, 2023, only six hostages have been freed alive, all during operations by the Israeli army.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty as to the fates of the 71 hostages who are not confirmed dead.</p>

<p>The armed wing of Hamas said on August 12 that its fighters had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, "in two separate incidents" in Gaza.</p>

<p>Before that Hamas had announced on several occasions the death of hostages which have not been confirmed by Israel.</p>

<p>They include the youngest hostage Kfir, who was eight and a half months old when he was kidnapped from Nir Oz kibbutz. He was taken alongside his mother Shiri Bibas, 32, and his then four-year-old brother Ariel.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said on August 20 it had retrieved the bodies of six hostages from Gaza's southern area of Khan Yunis, including Munder. The others, all previously announced as dead, were Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Yoram Metzger, Nadav Popplewell, and Chaim Perry.</p>

<p><strong>Bodies taken to Gaza&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>More than half of the dead hostages, 35 out of 64, were already dead when they were taken by Hamas operatives to Gaza on October 7. They include 10 Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p>The 29 other hostages died in the territory. Three of them were killed by mistake by the Israeli army on December 15, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>Festival, kibbutz survivors</strong></p>

<p>Most of the surviving hostages in Gaza were taken during the Hamas attack on the Nova music festival and the Nir Oz kibbutz.</p>

<p>At least 22 people abducted from the festival are thought to be alive and still being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Only nine of the 43 hostages taken from Nova have been released while 12 have died.</p>

<p>At Nir Oz kibbutz, of the at least 74 hostages who were taken on October 7, more than half (38) have been released alive while 20 are still in Gaza and believed to be alive. The remaining 16 are dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan police launched a major manhunt on Tuesday after a man they claim has confessed to murdering and dismembering 42 women escaped from a Nairobi police cell, along with a dozen other detainees.</p>

<p>Collins Jumaisi, 33, described by police as a "vampire, a psychopath", was arrested last month after the horrific discovery of mutilated bodies in a garbage dump in a slum in the Kenyan capital.</p>

<p>"Investigations have been launched and a major security operation is under way to get the 13 suspects," Kenya police spokeswoman Resila Onyango told AFP.</p>

<p>Police said in a separate statement that they discovered the breakout when officers made a routine visit to the police station cells at around 5 am to serve the prisoners breakfast.</p>

<p>"On opening the cell door, they discovered that 13 prisoners had escaped by cutting the wire mesh in the basking bay," it said, referring to an area in the station where detainees could get access to fresh air.</p>

<p>Those who fled were Jumaisi and 12 other people that police said were of Eritrean origin and were in custody for being "illegally present immigrants".</p>

<p>The police station is located in the upmarket Nairobi district of Gigiri, home to the regional headquarters of the United Nations and numerous embassies.</p>

<p>It is the second time in barely six months that a suspect in a high-profile case has escaped from custody.</p>

<p>Kenyan national Kevin Kangethe, who is accused of murdering his girlfriend in the United States last year and leaving her body in an airport car park, fled a police station in February before being caught about a week later.</p>

<p><strong>Police under spotlight</strong></p>

<p>Jumaisi had appeared in a court in the Kenyan capital on Friday, when the magistrate ordered him to be held for a further 30 days to enable police to complete their investigations.</p>

<p>Ten butchered female bodies trussed up in plastic bags were found in the dumpsite in an abandoned quarry in the Nairobi slum of Mukuru, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said last month.</p>

<p>The grisly find shocked Kenyans, already reeling from the so-called Shakahola forest massacre after the discovery of more than 400 bodies in mass graves near the Indian Ocean coast.</p>

<p>A Kenyan cult leader is accused of inciting his followers to starve themselves to death in order to prepare for the end of the world and "meet Jesus". He faces numerous charges including terrorism, murder and child cruelty along with dozens of co-defendants.</p>

<p>Jumaisi was detained in the early hours of July 15 near a Nairobi bar where he had been watching the Euro 2024 football final.</p>

<p>The head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Mohamed Amin, said after his arrest that Jumaisi had confessed to murdering 42 women over a two-year period from 2022, and that his wife had been his first victim.</p>

<p>"We are dealing with a vampire, a psychopath," Amin said at the time.</p>

<p>The dumped bodies threw a fresh spotlight on Kenya's police force as they were found just 100 metres (yards) from a police station.</p>

<p>The state-funded KNCHR said in July it was carrying out its own investigations into the Mukuru case because "there is a need to rule out any possibility of extrajudicial killings".</p>

<p>Kenya's police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority, had also said it was looking into whether there was any police involvement or a "failure to act to prevent" the killings.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of carrying out unlawful killings or running hit squads, but few have faced justice.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rocket engine exploded during a test launch at Britain's new spaceport in northern Scotland, officials said Tuesday, in a setback for the UK's fledgling space sector.</p>

<p>No one was injured in Monday evening's incident at SaxaVord Spaceport on the remote island of Unst, said the operator, German rocket manufacturer Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA).</p>

<p>The company hopes to launch the UK's first vertical rocket into orbit from there later this year. Monday's failed test was one of the trials in the run-up to the launch.</p>

<p>It comes three months after RFA held its first engine test at the site, which was declared a success.</p>

<p>"On Monday evening, RFA conducted a hot fire of its first stage at their launch site at SaxaVord Spaceport," said a spokesperson for the German company.</p>

<p>"This resulted in an anomaly that led to the loss of the stage. No-one was injured in the process.</p>

<p>"The launch pad has been saved and is secured, the situation is under control and any immediate danger has been mitigated."</p>

<p>A spokesperson for SaxaVord said it "will work with RFA to understand and learn from the causes and support them as they move forward to the next phase of their preparations".</p>

<p>SaxaVord is the first fully licensed vertical launch spaceport in Europe.</p>

<p>It is one of several space centres sprouting up around the continent amid a surge in popularity of small rockets and the commercialisation of space.</p>

<p>SaxaVord received permission from UK aviation regulators in December 2023 to begin orbital launches this year. It is allowed up to 30 annually to take satellites and other payload.</p>

<p>The first attempt to launch satellites from UK soil failed in January last year when a rocket failed to enter orbit after discharging from a Virgin Orbit Boeing 747.</p>

<p>The attempt took place at Cornwall Spaceport in southwest England, where rockets are carried by aircraft and launch horizontally.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Taliban's morality ministry has dismissed more than 280 members of the security force for failure to grow a beard and have detained more than 13,000 people in Afghanistan for "immoral acts" in the past year, officials said on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Taliban's morality ministry has dismissed more than 280 members of the security force for failure to grow a beard and have detained more than 13,000 people in Afghanistan for "immoral acts" in the past year, officials said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Propagation of Virtue said in its annual operations update that around half of those detained had been let go after 24 hours. It did not break down the type of the alleged offences or gender of the detainees.</p>

<p>Mohibullah Mokhlis, Director of Planning and Legislation at the ministry, told a press conference officials had destroyed 21,328 musical instruments in the past year and prevented thousands of computer operators from selling "immoral and unethical" films in markets.</p>

<p>It had identified 281 security force members for not having a beard and they had been dismissed, he said, in line with their interpretation of Islamic law.</p>

<p>The morality ministry, which took over the disbanded women's ministry premises in Kabul after the Taliban took over in 2021, has been criticised by human rights organisations and the United Nations for restrictions on women and inhibiting freedom of expression.</p>

<p>The United Nations' mission to Afghanistan has reported cases of morality ministry officials stopping and detaining women, at times for a few hours, for not meeting their interpretation of Islamic dress.</p>

<p>The Taliban has called the allegations of detentions "baseless" and say the rules apply their interpretation of Islamic law and Afghan customs.</p>

<p>The morality ministry did not provide figures in relation to policing of women's attire or their travel without a male guardian, which authorities have also barred for longer distances. It said that a new plan was being worked on to ensure its Islamic dress rules were followed, overseen by the supreme spiritual leader who is based in the southern city of Kandahar.</p>

<p>"Based on the guidance of the Supreme Leader, the draft plan for observing women's hijab (Islamic dress) has been formulated and approved," Mokhlis said.</p>

<p>The morality ministry has previously said that women should cover their faces or wear an all-enveloping burqa and that enforcement would involve "encouragement" with women's male family members being targeted rather than women directly.</p>

<p>Most Afghan women covered their hair in public in the conservative country even before the Taliban takeover, but some, especially in Kabul, did not usually cover their faces or wear a burqa.</p>

<p>Mokhlis said they had prevented just over 200 cases of the sale of women and over 2,600 cases of violence against women.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fresh complaint was filed on Tuesday with Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal accusing deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 23 others of committing crimes against humanity and genocide during a rally by an Islamist group in May 2013.</p>

<p>Supreme Court lawyer Gazi MH Tamim filed the complaint on behalf of Mufti Harun Ijahar Chowdhury, joint secretary general (education and law) of Hefajat-e-Islam, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>"We registered the complaint, and thus the investigation has started from today," Ataur Rahman, deputy director (admin) of the investigation agency, was quoted as saying by the newspaper.</p>

<p>"Once we complete the preliminary investigation and visit the place of occurrence and the tribunal is reconstituted, we, through the prosecution, will seek arrest warrants against the accused," he said.</p>

<p>The complaint accused Hasina and 23 others of committing crimes against humanity and genocide during a Hefajat-e-Islam rally at Motijheel's Shapla Chattar on May 5, 2013.</p>

<p>This is the fourth complaint filed with the International Crimes Tribunal accusing the 76-year-old former premier, who resigned and fled to India on August 5 following massive protests against her government over a controversial quota system in government jobs.</p>

<p>Of the four, three cases are connected to the recent violence centring on the quota reform movement.</p>

<p>The other accused includes Awami League general secretary and former road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader, former minister Reshed Khan Menon, former mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, ex-advisor to prime minister Salman F Rahman, former security advisor to the prime minister Tarique Ahmed Siddique, former inspector general of police AKM Shahidul Haque, editor of ABnews24.com Subhash Singha Roy and former army chief Aziz Ahmed.</p>

<p>Besides them, some unnamed ministers, state ministers and lawmakers, unnamed individuals from law enforcement agencies and the then policymakers of some electronic and print media were accused.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Nationalist Party's Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Tuesday asked India to extradite Hasina to face trial as he accused her of plotting to thwart the country's revolution.</p>

<p>Over 230 people were killed in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina-led Awami League government, taking the toll to more than 600 since the massive protest by students first started in mid-July.</p>

<p>An interim government was formed after the fall of the Hasina-led government, and 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was named its Chief Adviser.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Divers scoured the wreck of a luxury yacht off Sicily's coast on Tuesday to find six missing people, including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and a Morgan Stanley executive, following an intense storm that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/luxury-superyacht-sank-off-sicily-search-on-for-tech-tycoon-827797" target="_blank">sank the vessel</a> on Monday.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people and anchored off the port of Porticello when it was hit by the fierce, pre-dawn storm.</p>

<p>Fifteen people escaped before it capsized and the body of one person who died was swiftly recovered. That left six passengers unaccounted for - Lynch<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-tech-tycoon-missing-after-superyacht-sinks-off-sicily-in-italy-6371906" target="_blank"> </a>and his 18-year-old daughter, Morgan Stanley International chairman Jonathan Bloomer, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo, and their two wives.</p>

<p>"The fear is that the bodies got trapped inside the vessel," which was lying 49 metres (160 feet) deep, Salvatore Cocina, head of civil protection in Sicily, told Reuters. This meant time beneath the waves was a limiting factor for the divers.</p>

<p>"The biggest difficulty we have is due to the depth, which does not allow long times of intervention," fire department diver Marco Tilotta told reporters. "We plan ... to search centimetre by centimetre."</p>

<p>Tilotta said the vessel appeared to be intact and was lying on its right side. Divers had not ascertained whether the 72-metre-long mast had snapped somewhere along its length.</p>

<h3><strong>TRIAL</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-tech-tycoon-missing-after-superyacht-sinks-off-sicily-in-italy-6371906" target="_blank">Lynch</a>, 59, is one of the UK's best-known tech entrepreneurs. He built the country's largest software firm, Autonomy, from his ground-breaking research at Cambridge University and became known as Britain's Bill Gates.</p>

<p>He sold the firm to HP for $11 billion in 2011, after which the deal spectacularly unravelled with the U.S. tech giant accusing him of fraud, resulting in a lengthy trial. Lynch was eventually acquitted by a jury in San Francisco in June.</p>

<p>Morvillo represented Lynch in the case, while Bloomer had appeared as a character witness on his behalf.</p>

<p>In an apparent extraordinary coincidence, Stephen Chamberlain, Mike Lynch's co-defendant in the trial, died after a road accident in Britain over the weekend, his lawyer said on Monday.</p>

<p>The Bayesian was owned by Lynch's wife, who survived the disaster, and other guests on the yacht included Lynch's colleagues. The only body so far retrieved was that of the onboard chef Ricardo Thomas, an Antiguan citizen.</p>

<p>The British government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said it sent four of its inspectors to Sicily to conduct a "preliminary assessment."</p>

<h3><strong>DIDN'T SEE IT COMING</strong></h3>

<p>One expert at the scene of the disaster who declined to be named said an early focus of the official investigation would be whether the yacht's crew had closed access hatches into the vessel before the storm struck.</p>

<p>Investigators would look at whether appropriate measures had been taken, given the forecasts for bad weather overnight.</p>

<p>"We didn't see it coming," the captain of the yacht, James Catfield, said of the storm, according to la Repubblica news website on Monday.</p>

<p>Storms and heavy rains have ravaged Italy in recent days, after weeks of scorching heat warmed the sea temperature to record highs, raising the risk of extreme weather conditions, experts said.</p>

<p>"The sea surface temperature around Sicily was around 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), which is almost 3 degrees more than normal," said meteorologist Luca Mercalli.</p>

<p>"We can't say that this is all due to global warming but we can say that it has an amplifying effect," he told Reuters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian forces said Tuesday they had captured the key hub of New York in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow -- under pressure by a Kyiv counterattack on its territory -- presses on with its offensive.</p>

<p>The defence ministry said its troops had captured "one of the largest settlements of the Toretsk agglomeration and the strategically important logistics hub (of) Novgorodskoye", referring to the town in Ukraine's Donetsk region by its former name.</p>

<p>The capture of the town, which had a population of around 10,000 before Moscow launched its offensive, is the latest in a string of Russian advances in the region.</p>

<p>On Monday, Russia said it had captured the town of Zalizne, close to New York.</p>

<p>Donetsk was one of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow claimed to have annexed in 2022, despite not having full control over any of them.</p>

<p>The region has seen the most intense combat of the two-and-a-half-year conflict.</p>

<p>Kyiv has struggled to hold the front line there, facing manpower and ammunition shortages after months of attritional fighting.</p>

<p>Ukraine launched a border incursion into Russia's western Kursk region two weeks ago, a move it hoped could relieve pressure in other parts of the battlefield.</p>

<p>But the Russian advance in Donetsk has continued.</p>

<p>New York first found itself on the front line in 2014, when Moscow-backed separatists in the east tried to break away from Kyiv, triggering an armed conflict.</p>

<p>The origin of the town's name is a mystery, with theories including possible American connections among its founders.</p>

<p>It was renamed "Novgorodskoye" -- New City -- by Soviet authorities in 1951 for ideological reasons, before Ukrainian lawmakers voted to switch it back to New York in 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton spoke Monday at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and made a scathing attack on former US President Donald Trump, saying that the Democrats now have 'him on the run', as she appreciated Kamala Harris' leadership.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton took centerstage and praised Harris' leadership. "Kamala cares, cares about kids and families, cares about America. Donald only cares about himself," Ms Clinton said.</p>

<p>"On her first day in court, Kamala said five words that still guide her: 'Kamala Harris, for the people.' That is something that Donald Trump will never understand. So it is no surprise, is it, that he is lying about Kamala's record. He's mocking her name and her laugh -- it sounds familiar. But we have him on the run now," Ms Clinton said.</p>

<p>The crowd at the convention began chanting "Lock him up!" as former Secretary of State Clinton began describing Donald Trump's legal travails.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump fell asleep at his own trial, and when he woke up, he made his own kind of history -- the first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions!" she said. The democrats then began chanting "Lock him up!" harkening back to chants made by Trump's fans about Clinton during their 2016 face-off.</p>

<p>"So no matter what the polls say, we can't let up. We can't get driven down in crazy conspiracy rabbit holes. We have to fight for the truth. We have to fight for Kamala as she will fight for us," she added.</p>

<p>Together, we put a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling," Hillary Clinton said in her DNC speech.</p>

<p>"On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris raising her hand and taking the oath of office as our 47th president of the United States."</p>

<p>"Together, we put a lot of cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling. And tonight, tonight, [we are] so close to breaking through once and for all," Ms Clinton said.</p>

<p>She also urged her party not to give up the goal of shattering one of America's last glass ceilings: the election of a woman to the presidency. She hopes Kamala Harris would do what she couldn't -- become the first female president.</p>

<p>"The future is here!" Ms Clinton said, adding "I wish my mother and Kamala's mother could see it. They would say: 'Keep going'."</p>

<p>The Democratic National Convention (DNC) kicked off in Chicago on Monday.</p>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama is scheduled to speak on Tuesday, which will focus on the theme "A Bold Vision for the Future."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, under the theme "A Fight for Freedom," former President Bill Clinton and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi of California will address the convention, according to a source familiar with the schedule.</p>

<p>Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are also expected to speak this week, DNC officials said.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz, Kamala Harris's running mate, is expected to take the stage on Wednesday to officially accept the vice-presidential nomination. Harris will formally accept the presidential nomination during her speech on Thursday, a night dedicated to the theme "For the Future."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The German Federal Court upheld a 99-year-old woman's conviction for accessory to murder over her role as a typist at a Nazi concentration camp in the last two years of World War Two.</p>

<p>In 2022, Irmgard Furchner was handed a two-year suspended sentence for aiding and abetting the murder of 10,505 people during her time as an 18- and 19-year-old secretary at Stutthof concentration camp.</p>

<p>The Federal Court rejected her lawyer's argument that her involvement did not go beyond carrying out "everyday" activities as a typist. Its ruling upholding the lower court's decision is final and cannot be appealed.</p>

<p>"The principle that typical, neutral professional activities of an 'everyday nature' are not criminal does not apply here, since the defendant knew what the main perpetrators were doing and supported them in doing it," judges at the Leipzig court wrote.</p>

<p>Some 65,000 people died of starvation and disease or in the gas chamber at the camp in Stutthof, near Gdansk, at that time still the German city of Danzig. They included prisoners of war and Jews caught up in the Nazis' extermination campaign.</p>

<p>Many were transported from there to be gassed at Auschwitz.</p>

<p>Furchner's failure to appear for the opening of her trial in 2021 made her, at 96, one of the world's oldest fugitives, leading judges to issue an arrest warrant for her.</p>

<p>She is the latest in a series of nonagenarians to have been charged with Holocaust crimes in what is seen as a rush by prosecutors to seize the final opportunity to enact justice for the victims of some of the worst mass killings in history.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barack Obama will hail Kamala Harris as the future of the Democratic Party on Tuesday as she is formally crowned its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-bets-america-is-ready-to-have-its-1st-black-female-president-6361719" target="_blank">presidential nominee</a> after a roller-coaster ride in US campaign politics.</p>

<p>Former president Obama, still hugely popular and an influential figure in the party, will tell delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago that Harris is the right person to lead the country into an "ambitious future."</p>

<p>Obama's comments will draw a line under President Joe Biden's tenure following his stunning departure from his party's ticket last month.</p>

<p>"It's good to be home in Chicago," Obama posted on X ahead of his marquee appearance at the home of the Chicago Bulls basketball team to drum up excitement for Harris's campaign to deny Donald Trump a second term in the White House.</p>

<p>"Looking forward to being at the Democratic Convention, and joining so many inspiring people to share what's at stake in this election."</p>

<p>Convention delegate Ted Hiserodt, 56, said he was "very excited -- (Obama) is one of the greatest orators of my lifetime."</p>

<p>"He's just very good at getting the energy level high and firing up the volunteers," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Hiserodt and roughly 4,700 fellow delegates will anoint Harris their candidate for the November 5 poll in a ceremonial vote, repeating an online count undertaken in early August devoid of customary pomp and celebration.</p>

<p>One by one, members of 57 delegations will announce their picks for the party's ticket in what organizers promise "will be a celebration," including of the accomplishments of the last four years.</p>

<p>In an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-joe-biden-wins-huge-ovation-at-democratic-convention-farewell-6375158" target="_blank">emotional speech</a> late Monday, Biden chronicled the highlights of his time in the White House, heaping praise on Harris in an appearance designed to show unity.</p>

<p>"It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president. I love the job, but I love my country more," said the 81-year-old after a rapturous standing ovation.</p>

<p>"I made a lot of mistakes in my career, but I gave my best to you. For 50 years, like many of you, I gave my heart and soul to our nation," he said before embracing Harris on stage.</p>

<p>Biden also said it was "not true" that he was angry at people who said he should step aside -- amid reports that he was frustrated with Obama for not being more vocal in his support.</p>

<p>Biden was however effectively the warm-up act for Harris, who will give her keynote speech on Thursday in a slot that just a few weeks ago would have been his.</p>

<p>Harris paid tribute to Biden in a surprise appearance at the opening of the convention, saying she was "forever grateful" to her boss and mentor.</p>

<h3><strong>Going to do this</strong></h3>

<p>Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, said Biden "brought back decency" to the White House.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump fell asleep at his trial. And when he woke up, he made his own kind of history. The first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions," she said to chants of "lock him up" reverberating around the arena.</p>

<p>The Republican former president will hold an election campaign rally on Tuesday in Michigan, a must-win swing state.</p>

<p>Harris will meanwhile be campaigning in Milwaukee, which hosted the Republican National Convention last month.</p>

<p>Harris has managed to turn the White House race on its head since Biden stepped aside, reaching out to young, female and Black voters who had switched off from a battle between two elderly men.</p>

<p>Trump, meanwhile, has been left reeling by what he calls a "coup" by Democrats to replace Biden.</p>

<p>He has struggled to recalibrate his campaign to deal with Harris, falling back instead on personal insults and rambling speeches despite appeals from top Republicans to focus.</p>

<p>Protesters are expected to once again take to the streets of Chicago Tuesday after a handful of pro-Palestinian demonstrators briefly breached an outer perimeter fence on Monday at the convention venue.</p>

<p>Despite the noisy demonstrators, morale was high among the thousands of party faithful on day one of the convention.</p>

<p>Franklin Delano Williams, 78, who was attending his 12th convention, said there was "no question" Obama's appearance at the convention would boost Harris's chances.</p>

<p>"You've seen these rallies, right? The crowds? We are turning out. We're going to do this," Williams said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel retrieved the bodies of six hostages from the Khan Younis area in southern Gaza, the military said on Tuesday, as negotiations continued in an effort to bring back more than 100 who remain in the besieged enclave.</p>

<p>The return of the six bodies leaves 109 hostages still believed to be in Gaza, around a third of whom are thought to be dead, with the fate of the others unknown.</p>

<p>The return of the bodies came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to meet officials in Egypt as he continues a visit to the region aimed at bridging differences between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas over a deal to end the fighting in Gaza and return the hostages.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the bodies of Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Abraham Munder, Yoram Metzger, Nadav Popplewell and Chaim Peri were recovered from tunnels under Khan Younis in southern Gaza after a "complex operation".</p>

<p>"We will continue working to achieve the goals of this war - returning the hostages to Israel and dismantling Hamas," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Hostages Families Forum, an organisation that represents most hostage families, welcomed the news but renewed its call on the government to conclude a hostage release deal with Hamas.</p>

<p>"The immediate return of the remaining 109 hostages can only be achieved through a negotiated deal. The Israeli government, with the assistance of mediators, must do everything in its power to finalise the deal currently on the table," it said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has faced heavy criticism from many of the hostage families for failing to secure a deal, said the government would keep working to bring back the hostages still left in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The state of Israel will continue to make every effort to return all our hostages - the living and the dead," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>Most of the hostages in Gaza were seized by Hamas gunmen as they rampaged through communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and abducting around 250 as hostages. In addition, Hamas was already holding two Israeli citizens who entered Gaza around a decade ago as well as the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.</p>

<p>Since Oct. 7, Israel's military has levelled swathes of the Palestinian enclave, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes and killing at least 40,000, according to Palestinian health authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter killed at least 12 people on Tuesday, while the Israeli military said it struck a Hamas command centre.</p>

<p>"Our crews retrieved 12 martyrs from the Mustafa Hafiz school, which was bombed by the Israeli occupation west of Gaza City," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>Thousands of displaced Palestinians had sought refuge in the school, he said, amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the school was targeted because it housed a command-and-control centre.</p>

<p>"Hamas terrorists used the command-and-control centre to plan and execute attacks against IDF (Israeli army) troops and the State of Israel," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>It said it carried out a "precise strike on terrorists who were operating" inside the school.</p>

<p>Bassal had earlier given a count of seven dead and 15 wounded in the strike, which he said had hit the second floor of the school building.</p>

<p>The latest death count figure could not be independently verified.</p>

<p>AFP photos showed the school reduced to rubble, with scores of Palestinian men and women, many holding children, fleeing the site after the strike.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the Israeli military has struck several schools across Gaza, primarily in Gaza City, accusing them of housing Hamas command centres, which the Islamist group denies.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the military had struck the Al-Tabieen School in Gaza City, which according to the civil defence agency killed 93 Palestinians, while the military said 31 militants died.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of displaced people have taken refuge in schools since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7 after Palestinian militants attacked southern Israel.</p>

<p>That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 people, 105 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive against Hamas has killed at least 40,173 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Most of the dead in Gaza are women and children, according to the UN human rights office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi his brother, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is on a State visit to India, that there are many areas Malaysia and India are required to explore further.</p>

<p>Describing India as an important nation, the Malaysian PM said that both countries discuss as true brothers on all issues, sensitive or unlike wise, because this is the true meaning of friendship.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is my brother. Even when I was not the PM he was very kind...We have agreed to enhance the further comprehensive strategic partnership..." the Malaysian PM said in a joint press statement with PM Modi today.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India and Malaysia have elevated the ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>"We will reinvigorate this working relations in all fields...We discuss as true brothers on all issues, sensitive or unlike wise, because this is the true meaning of friendship. We have established an understanding of a number of issues, and the Prime Minister kindly mentioned some of them. But I have said, as we have said in the meetings, we will extend this," Malaysian PM Ibrahim said.</p>

<p>"I personally believe, and I have said this to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that there are so many areas that we need to explore further, and it's unfortunate, in the last many years, there has not been that truly forthcoming. India is an important and great nation with a great history and great culture and civilization..." he added.</p>

<p>He further stated that Malaysia has initiated a lot of new programs, and added that he extends invitation to Indian companies for collaboration in Malaysia.</p>

<p>Mr Ibrahim said, "We would hope that Indian companies with Malaysian companies collaborate further in all fields, including the new challenging areas like energy transition, digitalization, and also food security. We did emphasize the need to use both our experience and expertise in the semiconductor area, which we are fortunate to be considered a hub in Southeast Asia..."</p>

<p>Mr Ibrahim had arrived in the national capital today for a state visit, his first visit to India as the Malaysian premier. He was warmly received by Union Minister of State, V Somanna at the airport.</p>

<p>He also paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi, laying a wreath at Delhi's Rajghat following his meeting with PM Modi. Ibrahim also signed the visitor's book at the Rajghat.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

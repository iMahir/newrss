       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-interviews-donald-trump-on-x-6323844">recalled the moment</a> he was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania last month and narrated the events that followed, during a live conversation with X owner Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Trump, who survived the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-live-updates-x-owner-to-interview-republican-2024-us-elections-presidential-candidate-6324927">assassination bid</a> but was left with a bloodied ear, said he's "more of a believer" now.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that it was a bullet. I knew immediately that it was at the ear...," he said as over a million listeners joined to listen to the 78-year-old former president.</p>

<p>"For those people that don't believe in God, I think we all have to start thinking about that," he added.</p>

<p>He also pointed out that he turned his head at the "perfect angle", which saved his life.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm a believer. Now I'm more of a believer, I think. And a lot of people have said that to me. A lot of great people have said that to me, actually. But it was, it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle," the Republican presidential candidate said.</p>

<p>The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, wounded two rally-goers and killed another before he was shot dead by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's much-trailed interview with Donald Trump got off to a rocky start this morning after what the tech entrepreneur said was a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-is-ddos-attack-flagged-by-elon-musk-that-hit-donald-trump-interview-6324982">cyberattack</a> on his microblogging platform.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down," Musk, the world's richest man, wrote earlier on the platform, formerly known as Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump today praised Russia, China and North Korea heads saying that they are at the top of their game and the US needs a strong president to tackle them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(Vladimir) Putin, Xi (Jinping), Kim Jong Un are at the top of their game," Trump said during an interview with Elon Musk being streamed on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>Referring to Biden as "sleepy Joe", Trump also claimed Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if it hadn't been for Biden.</p>

<p>"I got along with Putin very well, and he respected me. We would talk about Ukraine. It was the apple of his eye. But I told him don't do it," he claimed.</p>

<p>The interview began more than 40 minutes after the scheduled start time due to tech glitches. Musk blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, a type of cyber attack in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was not confirmed.</p>

<p>The conversation is intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign, which has flagged since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump amplified a wave of false social media claims that his opponent Kamala Harris used artificial intelligence to fabricate a picture of her supporters at a Michigan rally last week -- an allegation disproved by photos and videos.</p>

<p>"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN'T EXIST!" the Republican presidential nominee wrote in the first of a series of posts Sunday on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>"There was nobody there!" he added in a second post.</p>

<p>Live footage and photos from numerous media outlets, including AFP, showed the crowd of supporters, who packed an airfield hangar and spilled onto the tarmac to see Harris and her freshly announced running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>The photo appeared to have been first posted by a Harris campaign official who received it from another staffer.</p>

<p>"This is an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan," the campaign's official rapid response page wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>The campaign shared an original copy of the image -- which appears dimmer than the high-exposure version available online and highlighted by Trump -- with the BBC, telling the British broadcaster that it was "not modified by AI in any way."</p>

<p>Drexel University digital forensic expert Matthew Stamm analyzed the image for AFP and said his specialized software "did not find any evidence that the image was generated by AI."</p>

<p>The University of California-Berkeley's Hany Farid also told AFP two models designed to identify traces of AI uncovered no evidence the technology was used in the image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The false claim circulated on right-wing and conspiratorial social media circles before reaching Trump, who shared a post from conservative commentator Chuck Callesto focusing on the lack of a reflection of the crowd on the side of the plane.</p>

<p>Experts said the crowd was likely not directly mirrored because of the distance between the aircraft and the audience and the angle of the reflection.</p>

<p>"The reflection on the hull of the plane and the engine will show the ground immediately in front of the plane," Stamm told AFP.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk said Monday his much-trailed interview with Donald Trump had been derailed by a cyber attack on his social media platform.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down," the world's richest man wrote on the platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>

<p>Trump was banned from Twitter after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, but Musk reinstated him when he took the platform over and renamed it.</p>

<p>The two men's conversation on Monday was intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign, which has flagged since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>Its apparent failure will be an embarrassment to both men.</p>

<p>"We tested the system with 8 million concurrent listeners earlier today," Musk wrote, pledging to host the live conversation with a limited number of listeners and post "the unedited audio" later.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has flagged a "massive DDOS attack" on X that disrupted the airing of his interview with former Donald Trump. Musk was set to interview Trump this morning, marking his return to the microblogging platform ahead of the US Presidential elections due in November.</p>

<p>In the worst case, the Tesla chief said, the platform would allow only a small number of live listeners and later post the conversation online.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later," the Tesla chief said in a post as the interview missed its scheduled timing.</p>

<p>What is DDOS attack?</p>

<p>DDOS attack stands for "Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack" that is disrupts a targeted server or network's normal traffic by flooding the target or its surrounding infrastructure with internet traffic.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity firm Fortinet has termed it a cybercrime.</p>

<p>"DDoS Attack means 'Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack' and it is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites," according to the firm.</p>

<p>DDoS attacks use multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic and the exploited machines could include computers and other networked resources, reads an explainer by IT service management firm Cloudfare.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 47,000 people died in Europe due to scorching temperatures in 2023, with countries in the region's south hit the hardest, according to a report by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) published on Monday.</p>

<p>Last year was the world's hottest on record. As climate change continues to increase temperatures, Europeans live in the world's fastest-warming continent, facing growing health risks stemming from intense heat.</p>

<p>The 2023 death count - below the more than 60,000 heat-related deaths estimated for the previous year - would have been 80% higher without measures introduced in the past 20 years to help people adapt to rising temperatures, such as early warning systems and healthcare improvements, according to the report by the Spanish research centre.</p>

<p>"Our results show how there have been societal adaptation processes to high temperatures during the present century, which have dramatically reduced the heat-related vulnerability and mortality burden of recent summers, especially among the elderly," said Elisa Gallo, researcher at ISGlobal and lead author of the study.</p>

<p>Researchers used death and temperature records from 35 European countries. They estimate that 47,690 died from causes related to high temperatures.</p>

<p>Adjusting the data for population, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain were the countries with the highest mortality rates related to heat.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is being interviewed on X by its billionaire owner Elon Musk -- an influential supporter -- as the Republican ex-president rejoins the platform following a lengthy absence. But most users are unable to tune in and are getting an error message on X.</p>

<p>Musk, acknowledged the issue, said ,"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later."</p>

<p>The interview, scheduled to take place on Twitter Spaces, has been plagued by technical glitches, with over 25,000 tweets using the hashtag "#crashed". While some users are criticizing the platform, others, including Trump supporters, are boasting that the interview has "crashed" the internet.</p>

<p>This development despite Musk announcing system scaling tests to prepare for the high-profile conversation. Despite these efforts, the platform has struggled to handle the traffic.</p>

<p>Trump, who was banned from Twitter after the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, recently rejoined the platform.</p>

<p>The snafu recalled a similar event in May 2023, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the platform.</p>

<p>The hour-long broadcast lost sound for extended stretches, and thousands of users were either unable to join or were dropped. DeSantis ultimately lost the nomination to Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The interview on Spaces, however, was delayed by more than 30 minutes due to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-is-ddos-attack-flagged-by-elon-musk-that-hit-donald-trump-interview-6324982#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">DDOS attack</a>. DDoS attack means "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack", a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.</p>

<p>The interview could provide Trump an opportunity to seize the limelight at a time when his Democratic rival for the US presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris, has erased his lead in opinion polls.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign has called it the "interview of the century".</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump today, during an interview with Elon Musk on X, recalled the assassination attempt last month where the Republican candidate narrowly survived.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, during an interview with Elon Musk on X today, claimed that Joe Biden was forced to drop out of the US Presidential race due to a "coup".</p>

<p>"I beat Biden so bad in the debate, he was forced out of the race - one of the greatest debate performances ever. Biden's exit, it was a coup." the 78-year-old said.</p>

<p>Musk doubled down on this claim by the former US President saying, ""They basically took him behind a shed and shot him."</p>

<p>During the interview, Trump also recalled the assassination attempt last month where the Republican candidate narrowly survived.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that it was a bullet. I knew immediately that it was at the ear... For those people that don't believe in God, I think we all have to start thinking about that," Trump said while speaking to Musk on a X (formerly Twitter) Space.</p>

<p>The interview got off to an eventful start as it was hit by major tech issues even before it could start, forcing the billionaire entrepreneur to run the interview only for a small number of users as several others were unable to tune in.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/PLHekD9jzW">https://t.co/PLHekD9jzW</a></p>
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823144316014911820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>More than 1 million people were listening as the conversation started, according to a counter on X.</p>

<p>"Congratulations on breaking every record in the book," Trump said, an apparent reference to the number of people who tried to tune into their conversation.</p>

<p>The interview is intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign as his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has jumped ahead in opinion polls and energised Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies. The Trump campaign has called it the "interview of the century".</p>

<p>"This is unscripted with no limits on subject matter, so should be highly entertaining!" 53-year-old Musk, who has an estimated net worth of $235 billion, posted in a preview of the interview on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress by his supporters.Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social social media platform, which was launched in February 2022.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, posted on X for the first time on Monday in more than a year ahead of the interview, sharing a campaign video in which he portrayed himself as the victim of persecution by forces seeking to "destroy" the United States.</p>

<p>Musk, one of the Democrats' fiercest critics, endorsed Trump last month just minutes after the Republican narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a rally.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has rejected the allegations of the government's involvement in the Bangladesh crisis, including the protests in the country that led to the deaths of hundreds of people.</p>

<p>Refuting all the reports and rumours, the White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean Pierre, said in a media briefing on Monday (local time), "So, we have had no involvement at all. Any, reports or rumours that the United States government was involved in these, in these events is simply, simply false. That is not true."</p>

<p>Jean Pierre further stated that Bangladeshi people should determine the future of the Bangladeshi government.</p>

<p>"This is a choice for and by the Bangladeshi people. We believe that the Bangladeshi people should determine the future of the Bangladeshi government, and that's where we stand. Any allegations, certainly we will continue to say, and what I have said here is simply untrue," Jean Pierre said.</p>

<p>Recently, in an interview with ANI, Michael Kugelman, a US-based Foreign Policy expert, and Director of the South Asia Institute at The Wilson Center, refuted allegations of foreign interference behind the mass uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, stating he had not seen any "plausible evidence" to support these claims.</p>

<p>He noted that the Hasina government's harsh crackdown on protesters escalated the movement. "My view has been very simple. I see this as a crisis that was driven by purely internal factors, by students who were unhappy about a particular issue, job quotas that they didn't like and they were worried about the government. Sheikh Hasina's government cracked down very hard on the students and that then turned the movement into something much bigger. And this was simply driven by internal factors," Kugelman said.</p>

<p>Kugelman dismissed allegations from Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who claimed foreign interference behind the protests, saying that the unrest was driven by "internal factors."</p>

<p>"Now, you know, when there is a conspiracy theory that is rooted in issues of foreign influence, one cannot disprove such type of allegation. Also, at the same time, one cannot conclusively prove it. I think the onus, is the responsibility to provide a plausible explanation for how it can be true. I am yet to hear that from Sheikh Hasina's son, from anyone," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, speaking on the protests outside the White House against the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, White House Press Secretary, Jean Pierre said that the US is going to continue monitoring the situation.</p>

<p>Jean Pierre said, "We are certainly going to continue monitoring the situation. I don't have anything else to say or to add beyond that."<br />
"When it comes to any type of human rights issue here, the President has been very consistent in speaking loud and clear in public and also privately and he will continue to do that. But, I don't have any specific engagement to speak to at this time," she added.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is experiencing a fluid political situation, with Sheikh Hasina resigning from the post of Prime Minister on August 5 amid mounting protests. The protests, led mainly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations.</p>

<p>A large number of people protested outside the White House in Washington on Friday last week against alleged violence targeting minority Hindus and others in Bangladesh since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>Protesters carried American and Bangladeshi flags and held posters demanding that Bangladeshi minorities be "saved." They chanted slogans of "We want justice" and called for peace amid the recent surge in violence.</p>

<p>The crowd, which included activists from various human rights organizations, members of the Bangladeshi diaspora and Indian-American Hindu allies, came from Washington, Maryland, Virginia, and New York.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called for the "safety and protection" of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh in a message on X on Thursday.</p>

<p>"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been fleeing to neighbouring India to escape the violence. Hindus, who make up about 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million population, have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which has faced backlash following violent clashes between anti-quota protesters and security forces last month.</p>

<p>Several US leaders, including Republican Congressman Pat Fallon and Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, have also spoken out against the alleged violence in Bangladesh.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States and European allies called on Iran to "stand down" Monday, as fears mounted of an imminent attack on Israel that could spark an all-out war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Tensions are soaring in the region, with the United States rushing a missile submarine and an aircraft carrier group in a show of support for its key ally.</p>

<p>Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah have vowed revenge for the killing of the political leader of the Palestinian group Hamas in Tehran, and of a Hezbollah commander in Beirut.</p>

<p>International efforts to stave off an Iranian attack intensified, with US President Joe Biden and the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Britain warning Tehran in a joint statement on Monday.</p>

<p>"We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place," they said after speaking on Monday.</p>

<p>The White House warned that a "significant set of attacks" by Iran and its proxies was possible as soon as this week, saying that Israel shared the same assessment.</p>

<p>As the frantic diplomacy continued, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer both called on Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to urge de-escalation.</p>

<p>But Pezeshkian said Monday his country has the "right to respond to aggressors."</p>

<p>Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh had been in Tehran for the new Iranian president's inauguration last month when Haniyeh was killed in an attack that Iran has blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Israel assassinated Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut a day earlier, leaving the region on edge.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- &nbsp;'No further time to lose' -</strong><br />
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said his country was "ready to foil any threat in real time" but added that he was "not familiar" with reports that Iran was expected to launch an attack in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the country had strengthened defenses and organized "offensive options" as "threats from Tehran and Beirut may materialize."</p>

<p>Washington and the four European nations meanwhile intensified their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, regarding the conflict sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel as the root cause of the tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>They backed a call by Biden and the leaders of Egypt and Qatar for renewed talks between Israel and Hamas this Thursday, "and stressed there is no further time to lose."&nbsp;</p>

<p>They also called for "unfettered" delivery of aid to devastated Gaza.</p>

<p>The pressure to bring an end to the fighting in the Gaza Strip and for Hamas to release its hostages came as the militant group's armed wing said it had killed one Israeli captive and wounded two more in "incidents".</p>

<p>The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement that two of its fighters "assigned to guard" the hostages had fired at them in "two separate incidents" and that a committee had been formed to investigate.</p>

<p>Hamas has urged mediators to implement a truce plan earlier presented by Biden instead of holding more talks.</p>

<p>But Israel has accepted the invitation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt to send negotiators.</p>

<p>"The reason we're doing that is to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement," Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told a news conference.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Stop this war' -</strong><br />
Pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza grew after civil defense rescuers in the Hamas-run territory said an Israeli air strike on Saturday killed 93 people at a school housing displaced Palestinians.</p>

<p>Israel said it targeted militants operating out of the school and mosque.</p>

<p>On Monday, witnesses told AFP Israel struck Khan Yunis and Rafah from the air. Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, which has been fighting alongside Hamas in Gaza, said its militants were battling Israeli troops in Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>In central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, Suhail Abu Batihan said the Israeli bombardment was "causing terror" among residents, calling on mediators and "the world... to intervene to stop this war."</p>

<p>The Gaza war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,897 people, according to a new toll from the territory's health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU's top digital official wrote to Elon Musk Monday to remind him of his legal duty to stop "harmful content" from spreading on X, hours before the tech billionaire interviews Donald Trump live on the platform.</p>

<p>"With great audience comes greater responsibility," the bloc's internal market commissioner Thierry Breton posted on X, along with the letter laying out Musk's obligations to combat illegal content and disinformation under EU law.</p>

<p>The European Union has an ongoing probe into X, formerly Twitter, under its landmark Digital Services Act (DSA) which requires digital firms to effectively police online content to protect users from harm.</p>

<p>"The DSA obligations apply without exceptions or discrimination to the moderation of the whole user community and content of X (including yourself as a user with over 190 million followers)," Breton wrote to Musk.</p>

<p>Breton said the warning was motivated by the "risk of amplification of potentially harmful content in the EU," citing Musk's upcoming Trump interview, and also referencing his recent inflammatory comments about far-right riots in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>"We are monitoring the potential risks in the EU associated with the dissemination of content that may incite violence, hate and racism in conjunction with major political -- or societal -- events around the world," he wrote.</p>

<p>"My services and I will be extremely vigilant to any evidence that points to breaches of the DSA and will not hesitate to make full use of our toolbox, including by adopting interim measures, should it be warranted to protect EU citizens from serious harm," Breton wrote.</p>

<p>The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has emerged as a major voice in US politics but is accused of turning the platform formerly known as Twitter into a megaphone for right-wing conspiracy theories since acquiring it in 2022.</p>

<p>New analysis from the Center for Countering Digital Hate shows that Musk's false or misleading claims about the US elections have been viewed nearly 1.2 billion times on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran could launch a "significant" attack on Israel as soon as this week, the White House said Monday, as US President Joe Biden discussed the crisis with European leaders.</p>

<p>"We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>"We share the same concerns and expectations that our Israeli counterparts have with respect to potential timing here -- could be this week," added Kirby.</p>

<p>Kirby's comments came as the United States is rushing an aircraft carrier strike group and a guided missile submarine to the region in a show of support for Israel.</p>

<p>Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah group have vowed to avenge last month's killings of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.</p>

<p>Biden called the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Britain on Monday to discuss the growing tensions, the White House added.</p>

<p>The call was "largely for all the leaders to repeat what they have said before in terms of reaffirming Israel's defense" and to "send a strong message that we don't want to see any rise in violence, any attacks by Iran or its proxies."</p>

<p>The leaders also called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, with difficult talks set for Thursday on halting the conflict that started when the Palestinian group attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>The call came shortly after Biden returned to the Oval Office after a long weekend at his beach house in Delaware.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran had put its long-range Mohajer-10 drones on show at a defence exhibit in Russia, Iran's official news agency reported on Monday.</p>

<p>US officials have accused Iran of sending drones to Russia - including Mohajer-10's predecessor, the Mohajer-6 - that Moscow had used in its invasion of Ukraine. Tehran denies this.</p>

<p>IRNA said the more advanced system was on display at the Army 2024 International Military-Technical Forum, an event which runs from Monday to Wednesday in Patriot Park outside Russia's capital.</p>

<p>The report comes as the Middle East braces for Iran's threatened retaliation against Israel after the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31.</p>

<p>Iran released details of the Mohajer-10 system in August last year, saying it had an enhanced flight range, duration and could carry a greater payload.</p>

<p>A video accompanying that report showed the drone alongside other military hardware, with text saying "prepare your shelters" in both Hebrew and Persian.</p>

<p>According to Iranian media reports, the drone has an operational range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and can fly for up to 24 hours. Its payload can reach 300 kg (661 pounds), double the capacity of the Mohajer-6, the reports have added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's top commander said on Monday Kyiv controlled around 1,000 square kilometres of Russia's Kursk region, his first public comments since Ukraine launched its biggest cross-border attack in almost 2-1/2 years of full-scale war.</p>

<p>With Russia still struggling to repel the incursion seven days after it began, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy published a video clip of Oleksandr Syrskyi, the head of his armed forces, delivering a report on the fighting.</p>

<p>"We continue to conduct an offensive operation in the Kursk region. Currently, we control about 1,000 square kilometres of the territory of the Russian Federation," he said.</p>

<p>Zelensky said the meeting of top-level officials had ordered the preparation of a "humanitarian plan" for the area.</p>

<p>Russia's acting governor of Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, said Ukraine controlled 28 settlements, and the incursion was about 12 km deep and 40 km wide.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Ukrainian leader said the defence ministry and diplomats has been ordered to present a list of "necessary actions" needed to secure permission from Kyiv's Western allies to use long-range weapons for strikes on Russia.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Rustem Umerov urged Paris earlier on Monday to lift the ban on Western weapons strikes on military targets in Russia during a call with French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu, the Ukrainian readout said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada-India relationship is "very important for both the countries", Canadian MP Chandrakanth Arya said as he met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his visit to the country.</p>

<p>"Delighted to meet Canadian MP Chandrakanth Arya. As a genuine advocate of India-Canada friendship, appreciate his views and value his insights. @AryaCanada," the EAM posted on X on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also shared a photograph of their meeting on the social media platform.</p>

<p>The Canadian lawmaker also put out a post while sharing Mr Jaishankar's post.</p>

<p>"Canada-India relationship is very important for both countries. As the outgoing Canadian High Commissioner in India said a few months back 'in the long-term, Canada's strategic interest and India's strategic interest are absolutely aligned'. Economic relations, specifically Canadian investments in India are going strong," Mr Arya said.</p>

<p>"Skilled professionals from India are meeting our human talent needs. We have a huge number of international students from India. We must do everything possible not only to maintain this but to take it to the next level. @CanadainIndia," Mr Arya posted.</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada had come under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd" and "motivated".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian ground troops and mechanized forces crossed the international border, advancing over 30 kilometres into Russian territory in one of the most significant developments in the ongoing war between the two countries. The Ukrainian troops, estimated to be over 1,000, moved from the Sumy Oblast region of north-east Ukraine and have taken over Kursk Oblast of Russia.</p>

<p>The Institute for Study of War (ISW), a non-profit, geolocated the positions of Ukrainian troops through open-source videos and pictures of the operation and marked the territories that have witnessed Ukrainian advance. The blue region indicates the areas where Ukrainians have entered.</p>

<p>Russia has scrambled its troops to stop the further incursion of Ukrainians. The objective of the Ukrainian operation is unclear, but ever since the war began in February 2022, Kyiv's operation appears to be the biggest challenge Putin's Russia has faced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukraine has been largely silent on the offensive. Meanwhile, Russia has announced a "federal emergency" and has scrambled troops to defend the area.</p>

<h2><strong>Geolocating Ukrainian Advance</strong></h2>

<p>ISW said the advance of the Ukrainian mechanized troops comprising tanks, infantry and armoured vehicles almost 35 km into Russia was "rapid", but ISW said it does not appear that the Ukrainians most certainly "do not control that area".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian conscripts, the FSB border guards and elements of Chechen "Akhmat" units, a motorized unit operating in the Chechen Republic and fighting for Russia, are operating in the Kursk region and built field fortifications along the border. They were breached by the Ukrainian troops. Based on the information accessed by ISW, as of August 8, Ukrainian troops are located in Sverdlikovo, Sudhza, Malaya and Lyubimovka.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a "large-scale provocation" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general has vowed to crush it. Meanwhile, a Chechen Akhmat unit official said, "The situation is not irreversible. Nothing supernatural happened, yes, our people died, that's a fact. The enemy has entered several settlements," said General Apti Alaudinov, a close ally of Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov and commander of Akhmat special forces.</p>

<p>Russian military bloggers claim that the Ukrainian troops are advancing in small units from Russia's rear and bypassing their fortifications before engaging Russian forces and then withdrawing from the engagements without attempting to consolidate control over their furthest advances.</p>

<p>The new frontline in Russia is far from other areas where intense fighting has taken place since the war began. Significant fighting took place in eastern Ukraine, a major chunk of which is claimed to be under Russian control. In the east, Donetsk, Luhansk and Horlivka had been under Russian control before the war began two years ago. The Russian troops have advanced further west from these regions and control a frontline which runs northeast to south of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the ISW's map, the red line indicates the Russian advance in Ukraine and the black dotted lines toward Russian control of Ukrainian territory before the war began.</p>

<p>Ukrainian drones targeted residential buildings in the border regions of Kursk, Voronezh and Belgorod. Combatants from Ukraine have made several brief incursions into Russia since the beginning of the conflict in February 2022.</p>

<h2><strong>Russia Scrambles Troops</strong></h2>

<p>Russian military experts have slammed officials for not detecting the incursions in the first place. The Ukrainian offensive has entered its third day. Russia initially scrambled air and artillery units to repel the attacks but failed to stop the advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it is sending columns of military hardware, including rocket launchers, artillery, tanks and heavy trucks to reinforce its defences in the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia carried out artillery strikes on a supermarket in eastern Ukraine's Kostyantynivka. The attack is Russia's response to the Ukrainian advance. The shelling killed ten people and wounded 35. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to take revenge for the attack.</p>

<p>"Russia will be held accountable for this terror, and we will do our best to ensure that the world continues to stand with Ukraine in supporting our defense and saving the lives of our people," Zelensky said on X.</p>

<p>Kostyantynivka has witnessed attacks in the past and Russian shelling is a usual occurrence.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Incursion To Gain Leverage?</strong></h2>

<p>Kharkiv in Ukraine has been a major flashpoint between the troops and has witnessed intense battles in the past. In May, Russia launched a new offensive in the region, taking significant territory in Kharkiv. The attacks saw Russia dropping 1,000 kg guided bombs on a hardware store in which 16 were killed.</p>

<p>Last year, Ukrainian troops launched a major counteroffensive to reclaim Kharkiv, which almost reached the border of Russia. Kharkiv has party occupied by Russia since the war began on February 24, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Russian-controlled territory lies very close to the international border and is several kilometres north of Kharkiv city, Ukraine's second-largest city. Ukraine's ongoing incursion in Kursk could be a way to gain leverage on the negotiation table for a truce in areas by forcing the enemy to pull troops from other areas to reinforce the frontline. The Ukrainian objective remains unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Washington was "reaching out to our Ukrainian counterparts to get a little better understanding". He added "Nothing has changed about our policy" and Ukraine can use US-supplied weapons only "to target imminent threats just across the border".</p>

<p>US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said of the Kremlin: "It is a little bit rich, them calling it a provocation, given Russia violated Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 28-year-old skydiving student in the United States was killed alongside her diving instructor after the pair hit a "dust devil" in California. A dust devil is a small but strong tornado-like whirlwind that forms in very hot conditions and can reach heights of several thousand feet. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the woman, identified as Kayla Kieko Black, was skydiving with veteran instructor Devry LaRiccia Chase on Friday when a "dust devil" sent them into an "uncontrollable spin" that plunged them to their deaths.</p>

<p>"Kayla was deeply cherished by her family and friends, who will forever remember her kindness, warmth and unwavering support," Ms Black's family said in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-kayla-kieko-black-support-for-her-family">GoFundMe page</a>. "In this time of immense sorrow we find solace in knowing that Kayla's legacy will live on through her selfless decision to be an organ donor. Her generosity will provide hope and new beginnings for many individuals and families in need," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/skydiving-student-killed-in-freak-accident-idd-as-kayla-kieko-black/"><em>Post</em></a>, the 28-year-old was jumping in tandem with Devry LaRiccia Chase, an instructor with Skydive Perrisand. The instructor was able to glide away from the first gust but two were trapped in the second. "Eyewitnesses report that the tandem pair experience a normal free fall and parachute deployment," the skydiving firm's manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All aspects of the equipment and skydive was normal without any reported issues until the landing sequence. While preparing for landing the tandem pair hit disturbed air known as a 'dust devil.' The interaction with this sudden disturbed air causes turbulence and a hard landing for both individuals," the manager added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the incident, both, the instructor and the skydiving student, were rushed to a local hospital. Ms LaRiccia's family also started a GoFundMe page to help bring her body to her native state of Maine for burial, with the site raising more than $59,000 by Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The instructor's husband, Freddy Chase, told People he wants Ms Black's family to know that he is "truly sorry for what happened" but that he's "glad that she got to share the last conversation with Devrey ever." He previously also stated that "there was no malfunction" before the incident. He explained that his wife was conducting her final jump of the day when she noticed the dust devils and got caught in one. "It then sent her canopy in an uncontrolled spin to the ground," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken charge of a fractured Bangladesh after a meeting between President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and student activists. Promising to "uphold, support and protect the constitution", Yunus has called for the restoration of law and order as his government faces the reality of the withering away of state apparatus. Sheikh Hasina is gone, but the real challenge begins now. A new reality confronts the people of Bangladesh. There is a new sense of optimism, but it is embedded in a deeply divided society and polity.</p>

<h2><strong>From Certainty To Doubts</strong></h2>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already extended his best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on his new role and has expressed hope for a swift return to normalcy, emphasising the importance of ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all minority communities. For India, challenges abound as Hasina, its long-standing partner, had to depart in ignominy. The certainty of the last 15 years has given way to a sense of the unknown. New Delhi had invested in its partnership with Dhaka confident that the Hasina dispensation would not let it down. As a result, a bilateral partnership that followed could not only resolve some of the most testing challenges but it also emerged as an anchor in the wider Bay of Bengal.</p>

<p>However, Hasina's tendency to centralise decision-making and marginalise the opposition managed to limit Bangladesh's evolution into a mature democracy. As Hasina drifted towards authoritarianism, New Delhi's options got further curtailed. Now, India has to ensure that it manages to build ties with the new leadership in Dhaka.</p>

<h2><strong>Building New Relationships</strong></h2>

<p>After signalling clearly that India will stand by its allies by getting Hasina out of Bangladesh, the next step is to engage the emerging political stakeholders in Bangladesh. This is needed not only for the long-term stability of Delhi-Dhaka ties but also for managing the immediate challenges of protecting minorities within Bangladesh and stabilising the highly volatile border area.</p>

<p>India shares a largely porous 4,096 km of land border with Bangladesh. This border runs along the states of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram, areas once frequented by insurgent groups. However, under Hasina's leadership, the border remained relatively calm, as these groups have been prevented from finding refuge in Bangladesh. There are already reports of turbulence and New Delhi has asked its border security forces to be on high alert. With India facing serious challenges along its borders with Pakistan and China, the new reality with Bangladesh bodes ill for national security.</p>

<h2><strong>Extremism Remains A Concern</strong></h2>

<p>The rise of Islamist extremism in Bangladesh is another challenge that New Delhi will be closely watching. Before Hasina, various extremist groups were flourishing under the patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government. Many of these groups, such as the Ansarullah Bangla Team, the Hizb ut-Tahrir, and the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), have had links to various terrorist outfits based in Pakistan as well as to the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The present situation in Bangladesh opens up new possibilities for reviving these links. Jamaat-e-Islami is widely viewed as a key instigator of the recent riots that toppled Hasina. The Hasina government had banned it in 2013, but today it has re-emerged as a major political force.</p>

<p>The systematic targeting of Hindus also poses a challenge to India-Bangladesh ties as it will harden the mood in New Delhi against any engagement with Dhaka. Domestic politics in both nations will have to maturely handle rapidly deteriorating perceptions about each other.</p>

<h2><strong>Balancing Other Neighbours</strong></h2>

<p>In recent years, the two South Asian neighbours have been focused on enhancing trade and connectivity so as to turn the Bay of Bengal into a hub of regional economic framework. Political trust is a crucial variable in shaping today's economic partnerships. Unless the new government in Dhaka is able to generate trust in Delhi, it won't be possible to revive the old paradigm of bilateral economic engagement. This would be a loss for India as its ability to make its northeastern region economically dynamic is premised on strong India-Bangladesh economic ties. But it would also be a loss for Bangladesh, which has effectively leveraged its two regional economic partners - India and China - to reinvigorate its economic potential.</p>

<p>New Delhi would also be wary of Pakistan and China trying to fish in the troubled waters of the Bay of Bengal. The logic of geography dictates that both Delhi and Dhaka will have to engage each other to nurture their aspiration. It is easy to forget how much despair there was about India-Bangladesh ties before Hasina had come to power. But at a time when India sees itself as a leading global power, it cannot afford to ignore the challenges emanating from its most important partner in South Asia.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air India will not run flights to and from Tel Aviv amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, the airlines said. The decision to suspend services to Tel Aviv was first taken on August 2, but the Tata Group-owned carrier was expected to resume operations today.</p>

<p>But Air India has said that Tel Aviv flights will remain suspended until further notice.</p>

<p>"In view of the current situation in parts of the Middle East, scheduled operation of our flights to and from Tel Aviv are suspended with immediate effect until further notice," the airlines said in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</p>

<p>"We are continuously monitoring the situation and are offering a full refund to our passengers with confirmed bookings for travel to and from Tel Aviv. Safety of our guests and crew remains our topmost priority," it added.</p>

<p>Earlier this year also, Air India had briefly suspended flights to Tel Aviv at different points of time due to the Middle East tensions.</p>

<p>After nearly five months, the carrier had recommenced the services to the Israeli city on March 3.</p>

<p>Air India had suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv starting on October 7, 2023, after the Hamas group's attack on the Israeli city</p>

<p>Tensions continue to remain high in the Middle East amid conflict between Israel and various terror groups, including Hamas.</p>

<p>As Gaza's war churns on, Israel has been battening down for another attack expected in the coming days following vows from Iran and its Lebanon proxy Hezbollah to retaliate for the assassinations last week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.</p>

<p>A relatively contained conflict between Israel and Hezbollah along its northern border, a spillover from the Gaza fighting, now threatens to spiral into an all-out regional war.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Police in England said Thursday that forces nationwide had now arrested nearly 500 people for alleged participation in the unrest that began on July 30, while around a dozen people were jailed on Thursday for involvement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Friday that authorities "have to stay on high alert going into this weekend", amid fears of further far-right riots in English towns and cities.</p>

<p>Starmer said the work by the criminal justice system in recent days, including judges swiftly handing down lengthy jail sentences to some rioters, had acted as a deterrent to more violence.</p>

<p>His comments came after two nights of relative quiet across England, after a week of near nightly unrest in more than a dozen towns and cities in the wake of a deadly knife attack that killed three children.</p>

<p>Disturbances have continued unabated in Northern Ireland, however, where police have blamed pro-UK loyalist paramilitaries for fuelling nightly violence in Belfast.</p>

<p>"I'm absolutely convinced that having the police officers in place these last few days, and the swift justice that has been dispensed in our courts have had a real impact," Starmer told UK broadcasters about the situation in England.</p>

<p>"But we have to stay on high alert going into this weekend because we absolutely have to make sure that our communities are safe and secure and feel safe and secure."</p>

<p>Speaking during a visit to the headquarters of London's Metropolitan Police, he said potential unrest caused by the start of the football season would be "added into the mix" of challenges facing police this weekend.</p>

<p>Some far-right rioters and agitators are believed to have links to England's decades-old football hooligan scene, which has diminished since its heyday in the 1980s but can still see violence on match days.</p>

<p>Police in England said Thursday that forces nationwide had now arrested nearly 500 people for alleged participation in the unrest that began on July 30, while around a dozen people were jailed on Thursday for involvement.</p>

<p>The disturbances, first sparked by a July 29 knife attack that killed three children, have seen mosques and migrant-related facilities attacked alongside police and other targets.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed misinformation spread on social media about the suspected perpetrator for fuelling the disorder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russia is moving army units with "BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, towed artillery guns, tanks transported on trawls, heavy tracked vehicles, Ural and Kamaz trucks" to Kursk's Sudzhansky District, the defence ministry said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Friday said it was deploying more troops and munitions to a frontier region where Ukraine has mounted a major ground offensive, while Russia struck a supermarket in east Ukraine, killing at least 10 people.</p>

<p>Kyiv's troops have been driving into Russia's western Kursk region since Tuesday in a surprise offensive that appears to be the most significant attack on Russian soil since Moscow invaded in February 2022.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it was sending columns of military hardware, including rocket launchers, artillery, tanks and heavy trucks to reinforce its defences in the region, state media reported Friday.</p>

<p>The Russian army said around 1,000 Ukrainian troops and more than two dozen armoured vehicles and tanks were involved in the initial attack, although it has since claimed to have destroyed many more pieces of hardware.</p>

<p>Kyiv has not officially taken responsibility for the attack, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia needed to "feel" the consequences of its invasion.</p>

<p>Both sides also stepped up aerial attacks behind the frontlines on Friday.</p>

<p>A Russian artillery strike on a supermarket in the east Ukrainian town of Kostyantynivka during the middle of the day killed at least 10 people and wounded 35, Ukrainian Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>The town is about 13 kilometres (eight miles) from the nearest Russian positions and faces almost daily strikes.</p>

<p>"Russia will be held accountable for this terror," Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>AFP journalists on the scene saw dozens of people fleeing as police officers warned of a potential second strike.</p>

<p>Plumes of black smoke rose from the building and police cordoned off nearby streets. Drones and an uptick in artillery fire in the area were also audible.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Russia brought the war' -</strong></p>

<p>Russian troops have been slowly advancing for months in the Donetsk region where Kostyantynivka is located.</p>

<p>Ukraine's surprise offensive into the Kursk region has appeared to catch Russia off guard, with some analysts saying it may be an attempt to force Moscow to divert resources and relieve pressure on other parts of the sprawling front line.</p>

<p>Influential Russian military bloggers have blasted army leaders for failing to spot or quash the incursion.</p>

<p>Senior Kyiv officials have stayed largely tight-lipped, although Zelensky on Thursday appeared to justify the attack.</p>

<p>"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done," he said, without directly referring to the ongoing Ukrainian incursion.</p>

<p>"Everyone can see that the Ukraine army knows how to surprise and knows how to achieve results," he said in another apparent reference to the incursion.</p>

<p>Moscow has also not presented detailed information on the extent of the Ukrainian advance.</p>

<p>The defence ministry said on Friday its troops "continue to repel an attempted incursion by the Ukrainian armed forces" and that it had struck Ukrainian positions on the western edge of Sudzha, a town around eight kilometres (five miles) from the border.</p>

<p><strong>- 35 kilometres -</strong></p>

<p>Based on geolocated videos and photos, the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian units had pierced much further into Russian territory in a "rapid advance".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ukrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35 kilometres from the international border," the ISW said in its daily campaign assessment.</p>

<p>It cautioned, however, that Ukrainian forces "most certainly do not control" that entire area.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the incursion a "large-scale provocation" by Kyiv, and Russia's top general has vowed to crush it.</p>

<p>Moscow has already rushed reserves to the region and used drones, artillery and aviation to try to quash the attack.</p>

<p>The health ministry said 66 civilians were wounded, including nine children, in the first three days.</p>

<p>On the first day of the assault, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said five civilians were killed.</p>

<p>Thousands have been evacuated from the region, with Russia putting on an extra train to Moscow from the regional capital, Kursk, for those looking to leave.</p>

<p>Ukraine on Friday expanded its own evacuation zone in the Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk.</p>

<p>"About 20,000 people need to be evacuated" from 28 settlements, Ukraine's national police force said.</p>

<p>Ukraine also said on Friday it had carried out a major air strike on a Russian military base in the Lipetsk region, around 280 kilometres (175 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>It said it had struck "warehouses containing guided aerial bombs and a number of other facilities."</p>

<p>Local Russian officials had earlier reported a "massive" Ukrainian drone attack on the region and state media reported a fire had broken out at the airbase.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iranian Revolutionary Guards said on Friday that its navy has new cruise missiles equipped with highly explosive warheads that are undetectable, state media reported.</p>

<p>The announcement by the country's most powerful security organisation coincides with fears of a full-blown Middle East war after Iran vowed to avenge the assassination in Tehran on July 31 of Ismail Haniyeh, leader of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas.</p>

<p>Iran has blamed Israel, while Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.</p>

<p>"In today's world you either have to be powerful to survive, or surrender. There's no middle ground," said the Guards' top commander, Major-General Hossein Salami.</p>

<p>"A large number of cruise missiles have been added to the Guards' navy fleet. These new missiles have capabilities of highly explosive warheads that are undetectable and can cause extensive damage and sink their targets," a Guards statement said.</p>

<p>The Guards' navy also said in a statement that various types of long and medium-range missile systems, as well as reconnaissance drones and naval radars, have been added to its fleet.</p>

<p>"These systems are among the most up-to-date anti-surface and sub-surface weapons in the Guards' navy," it said.</p>

<p>State television displayed several of the weapons on Friday. The navy added that only 210 of the 2,654 systems were shown as it was not possible to unveil other strategic ones for security reasons.</p>

<p>Iran has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, regarding such weapons as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against US and Israel in the event of war.</p>

<p>According to the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran is armed with the largest number of ballistic missiles in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is recalling more than one million electric stoves in the United States following reports of accidental fires that injured 40 people and killed pets, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday.</p>

<p>Owners of one of the 30 models affected by the voluntary recall are advised to contact Samsung for free replacement knob locks or covers, according to the commission's statement.</p>

<p>More than 1.1 million slide-in electric ranges sold between 2013 and 2024 fall under the recall.</p>

<p>Samsung said the announcement was issued due to reports the knobs could be accidentally activated by people or pets bumping into them. The company did not mention fires or pet deaths in its press release.</p>

<p>According to the safety commission, the Samsung stoves have been involved "in approximately 250 fires," which led to about 40 injuries, eight of which required medical attention.</p>

<p>The commission said there were also reports of seven fires involving pet deaths and 18 instances of "extensive property damage".</p>

<p>People continuing to use the recalled models were cautioned to keep children and pets away from the front-range knobs, and to check them before going to bed.</p>

<p>The South Korean electronics and appliances manufacturer said "consumers may continue to use their slide-in electric ranges while awaiting their set of free knob locks or covers."</p>

<p>Samsung's safety reputation suffered a major blow from a worldwide recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone over exploding batteries in 2016, which cost the company billions of dollars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guards beat female inmates in clashes that erupted at Tehran's Evin prison following a spate of executions, the family of jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi said, raising new concerns about her health.</p>

<p>Rights activist Mohammadi, 52, who won the 2023 prize for her campaigning including against the death penalty, has been jailed since November 2021, and has spent much of the past decade in and out of prison.</p>

<p>The Paris-based family of Mohammadi emphasised it had no direct contact with her since her right to make phone calls was cut in November.</p>

<p>But it said it had learned from several other families of detainees held in Evin that clashes erupted on Tuesday as the female prisoners launched a protest in the yard against the executions.</p>

<p>According to rights groups, around 30 convicts were hanged this week, including Gholamreza (Reza) Rasaei, who the Iranian judiciary said was executed on Tuesday in connection with 2022 protests.</p>

<p>"The protest by prisoners against the execution of Reza Rasaei led to a violent crackdown by prison guards and security agents," Mohammadi's family said in a statement late Thursday, citing the reports.</p>

<p>"Several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten. The confrontation escalated, resulting in physical injuries for some prisoners."</p>

<p>The family said that after being punched in the chest, Mohammadi suffered a respiratory attack and intense chest pain, causing her to collapse and faint on the ground in the prison yard.</p>

<p>She was bruised and treated in the prison infirmary but not transferred to a hospital outside, it said.</p>

<p>"We are deeply worried about her health and well-being under these circumstances," the family said.</p>

<p>Iran's prison authority denied that prisoners were beaten and blamed the confrontation on inmates.</p>

<p>Two prisoners "had heart palpitations due to the stress," but medical examinations determined that their general condition "is favourable," it said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.</p>

<p>Relatives and supporters had earlier this month raised new concern about Mohammadi's condition, saying they had been informed of the results of medical tests carried out in July "which showed a worrying deterioration of her health".</p>

<p>In the past eight months, Mohammadi has been suffering from acute back and knee pain, including a herniated spinal disc. In 2021, a stent was placed on her main heart artery due to a blockage.</p>

<p>Mohammadi has kept campaigning even behind bars and strongly supported the protests that erupted across Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22-year-old Iranian Kurd arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress rules for women.</p>

<p>Mohammadi in June received a new one-year prison term for "propaganda against the state", on top of a litany of other verdicts that already amounted to 12 years and three months of imprisonment, 154 lashes, two years of exile and various social and political restrictions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French police early Friday arrested an Egyptian wrestler taking part in the Olympics over allegedly groping a woman in a bar, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Authorities detained Mohamed Elsayed, 26, in front of a cafe in the French capital's 13th district at around 5 am after he was accused of "placing a hand on the buttocks of a woman patron", the Paris prosecutor's office said.</p>

<p>Elsayed, who won bronze at the Tokyo Games, lost to Azerbaijan's Hasrat Jafarov in the 67 kg Greco-Roman wrestling on Wednesday. His opponent went on to win the bronze medal.</p>

<p>A fellow Egyptian with the same name won a bronze medal in epee fencing at the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the wrestler had since been released.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Google has long been synonymous with search, commanding around 90% of the global market share and bringing in about $175 billion in annual revenue through the business]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is facing a bigger threat from Sam Altman's OpenAI even as it awaits a decision on how antitrust regulators in Washington plan to level the playing field in the internet search business.<br />
A US ruling on Monday, which found that Google built an illegal search monopoly, is being considered a big win for regulators. But an increasing number of people using AI tools including OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot is already eroding Google's dominance, sources, investors and analysts said.</p>

<p>"I think for Google right now, AI (is) a much bigger deal than the ruling. AI is fundamentally changing how the search product also works," said Arvind Jain, a former Google engineer who worked on products including Search for a decade.</p>

<p>Jain, who now runs an enterprise search firm called Glean, said AI's impact was immediate compared with any impact from these rulings that get appealed and take a long time to affect a market.</p>

<p>Google has long been synonymous with search, commanding around 90% of the global market share and bringing in about $175 billion in annual revenue through the business. Even Apple, which prefers to build all the software and much of the hardware that goes into its devices, has allowed Google to be its default search engine for a handsome fee.</p>

<p>But the days of preferential treatment for a fee are over even before slew of antitrust court cases resolve. In its AI foray, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to its upcoming devices. It emphasized the deal's non-exclusive basis and talked up the likelihood of bringing on Google as another partner.</p>

<p>A ruling against Google will speed up Apple's move towards AI-powered search services, if it is forced to end its Search deal with Google, analysts have said.</p>

<p>Microsoft-backed OpenAI said last month it was also breaking into the search game with a slow launch of SearchGPT, an AI-powered search engine with real-time access to information from the internet.</p>

<h3><strong>SEARCHGPT</strong></h3>

<p>One former senior Google executive predicted, "AI is going to move faster than the speed that DOJ can move against Google. The whole monopoly will be over, in other words, the speed at which AI will take over search."</p>

<p>Both the former Google executives as well as many Wall Street analysts agree that Google has the raw material needed to take a lead in AI - a large language model to train its AI and a search engine. But the company's efforts seem scattered in the face of OpenAI's onslaught, which is attracting younger users.</p>

<p>Generative AI's popularity caught Google by surprise. Despite being the source of foundational research behind the technology, it did not release a consumer product until well after ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer app in early 2023.</p>

<p>"The biggest threat to Google may be Google itself - key to adoption of any AI is trust, and its original missteps with Search Overviews showed that Google's engineers were focused more on rapid releases than getting it right as it tries to keep up with the pace of OpenAI and others," said Rebecca Wettemann, CEO and principal analyst at research firm Valoir.</p>

<p>Wettemann referred to Google's AI Overviews, a new feature that employs AI to answer search queries that appear ahead of links. It drew fire from publishers watching referral traffic from Google decline and was criticized for delivering errors including telling users to eat glue and saying Barack Obama was a Muslim. Google scaled back the feature earlier this year.</p>

<p>Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, believes the regulatory scrutiny as well as the AI threat are related. "Part of the reason (the DOJ) are coming after Google's business practices is that the market is in fact in flux right now and they want to make sure Google does not extend its current market dominance."</p>

<p>While the antitrust ruling may not have a big impact on Google yet, it should open the search market up for more players, said Richard Socher, CEO and founder of AI search engine startup You.com and former chief scientist at Salesforce.</p>

<p>He added, though, that ending Google's dominance in search will be "very hard."</p>

<p>"No one has really made a big dent into Google search dominance yet ... we'll have to see if this will be yet another domino piece that will fall into place to actually give consumers some more choices, real choices."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Joe Biden will next week make their first joint campaign trip since the US president's shock decision to drop out of the 2024 White House race against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Seeking to burnish his legacy in his final months in office and support the new Democratic ticket, Biden will appear alongside his vice president at an event in the state of Maryland near Washington on August 15.</p>

<p>The pair would "discuss the progress they are making to lower costs for the American people", the White House said in a statement Friday, adding that further details would be released later.</p>

<p>Inflation remains a weak spot for Democrats ahead of November's election.</p>

<p>Harris has fired up the Democratic Party since Biden announced he was stepping aside following a disastrous debate against Trump that highlighted concerns about his age and mental acuity.</p>

<p>The first female, Black and South Asian vice president in US history has held a series of packed rallies, pulled in record fundraising and wiped out Republican ex-president Trump's poll lead.</p>

<p>In contrast, Biden has kept a low profile with few public events, in what has become a lame-duck presidency with nearly six months still until his successor takes power in January.</p>

<p>The president, who is currently spending a long weekend at his Delaware beach house, had not been expected to make any major political appearances in support of Harris until the Democratic National Convention starting on August 19 in Chicago.</p>

<p>But there have also been signs that the veteran Democrat is keen to promote his legacy as he prepares to bow out from a nearly five-decade career in US politics.</p>

<h3><strong>Limited schedule&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Part of that is doing whatever he can to help secure Harris's victory against Trump, his nemesis and the man that he beat in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Harris was a very visible presence at Biden's side in a historic moment last week when they both welcomed home US reporter Evan Gershkovich and other detainees freed in a huge prisoner swap with Russia.</p>

<p>News outlet Politico reported that Harris now wanted Biden's support in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan where he is still popular, especially with older white voters.</p>

<p>But he would ensure that the spotlight stayed on Harris, embarking mainly on a limited campaign schedule in the fall, it said.</p>

<p>Biden meanwhile stepped into the breach earlier this week to warn against any repeat of the events after the 2020 election, when Trump disputed his loss and his supporters stormed the US capitol.</p>

<p>In his first interview since dropping out of the election, Biden told broadcaster CBS that he was "not confident at all" of a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses a second time.</p>

<p>One other priority for Biden's remaining days in office is to push for a ceasefire to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza -- an issue that is still divisive for Democrats.</p>

<p>Biden and the leaders of Egypt and Qatar have invited the warring parties to resume talks on August 15 -- the same day as his joint appearance with Harris -- to push for a deal.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A series of potent solar events is expected to hit Earth, potentially causing significant geomagnetic storms over the next few days, NASA has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A series of potent solar events is expected to hit Earth, potentially causing significant geomagnetic storms over the next few days, NASA has said. The third storm, potentially the worst one, is expected to hit the planet this week on August 11.</p>

<p>The Sun is currently unleashing a trio of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), with the first two originating from M-class solar flares on August 7.</p>

<p>While these initial CMEs are relatively minor, the third CME, propelled by an X1.3-class solar flare on August 8, is the most powerful. The third CME, from the highly active sunspot AR3777, produced an extreme ultraviolet flash captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. It caused a shortwave radio blackout affecting regions from North America to the Hawaiian Islands, disrupting signals below 30 MHz for up to an hour.</p>

<p>Coronal mass ejections are massive bursts of solar wind and magnetic fields ejected from the Sun's corona. These eruptions release billions of tons of plasma into space, potentially disrupting Earth's magnetosphere and impacting satellites, communications and power grids.</p>

<p>Following the flare, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) detected a halo CME travelling directly toward Earth at speeds exceeding 1,000 km per second. This CME is expected to arrive by August 11, potentially intensifying the effects of the earlier CMEs.</p>

<p>The combined impact of these solar events could elevate geomagnetic storm levels to category G3 (strong), potentially sparking mid-latitude auroras visible in the USA and Europe.</p>

<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a geomagnetic storm watch, urging us to prepare for potential impacts on technological infrastructure.</p>

<p>Geomagnetic storms occur when a CME or solar wind disturbs Earth's magnetic field. These storms can lead to beautiful auroras but may also disrupt GPS, radio communications, and power systems. The severity of these storms depends on the strength and direction of the solar wind's magnetic field. The upcoming storms are likely to create prime conditions for auroras, possibly visible much farther from the poles than usual.</p>

<p>Mariners, ham radio operators, and those reliant on satellite-based systems are advised to stay informed and take necessary precautions.</p>

<p>The sunspot AR3777 is currently one of the most active regions on the Sun, showing the increasing solar activity as we approach the solar maximum, the peak of the Sun's 11-year cycle. Space weather experts are closely monitoring the situation as Earth faces potential impacts from these solar particles.</p>

<p>This series of solar storms follows a barrage of similar events in May, which had triggered auroras as far as India and put considerable pressure on satellites.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus led a solemn tribute to Bangladesh's fallen independence heroes in the first act of his interim government on Friday, after a student-led uprising forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.</p>

<p>A day after returning home from Europe and vowing to "uphold, support and protect the constitution" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.</p>

<p>The military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.</p>

<p>Yunus, who has taken the title of "chief advisor" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p>

<p>When polls might take place is not clear.</p>

<p>Officials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.</p>

<h3><strong>'Victory day'</strong></h3>

<p>The new administration faces a daunting task.</p>

<p>The veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.</p>

<p>In driving rain, Yunus stood silently on Friday alongside student and civil society leaders in the new "advisory" cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.</p>

<p>Together the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Yunus suggested on his arrival on Thursday in Dhaka that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh has created a new victory day," he told reporters. "Bangladesh has got a second independence."</p>

<p>Several of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released from years of house arrest.</p>

<p>They also include student leaders who started the protests.</p>

<p>Yunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders "who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were".</p>

<p>However, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting for political office.</p>

<p>"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Law and order'</strong></h3>

<p>Hasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence but also backed Hasina to the hilt.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his "best wishes" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was "committed" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.</p>

<p>India's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus "great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future".</p>

<p>China said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country "to promote exchange and cooperation".</p>

<p>Farida Akhter, an adviser to the interim government, told AFP that the group would also visit a monument in Dhaka where the student protests started last month.</p>

<p>"We are paying our respects there, as the student movement began from there," she said, before naming the top task on their to-do list.</p>

<p>"Our first priority is law and order", she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kris Maharaj was wrongly convicted in 1986 for the murders of Derrick and Duane Moo Young, and his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2002. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kris Maharaj, a British citizen of Indian origin, has died in a US prison hospital after spending 38 years behind bars for a crime he never committed. He was 85.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Maharaj was wrongly convicted in 1986 for the murders of Derrick and Duane Moo Young. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2002.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was declared innocent in 2019, but remained imprisoned due to a US Court of Appeals ruling that the evidence of his innocence was not sufficient for his release.</p>

<p>Marita Maharaj, his wife, expressed profound sadness over his death, saying, "I promised Kris in 1976 that we would be together until death do us part, and I am devastated that he died alone in that horrible place," as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/kris-maharaj-who-spent-38-years-in-florida-prison-despite-judge-finding-him-innocent-dies-13191774">Sky News</a>.</p>

<p>She plans to bring his body to the UK for burial. "The last place he would want to be is where he was falsely charged with murder," she said, and vowed to continue fighting to clear his name so she could "meet him in heaven with a clear conscience that I have done my best for him."</p>

<p>Clive Stafford Smith, Mr Maharaj's pro-bono attorney, confirmed his death and promised to continue the fight to clear his name, stating, "We will certainly fulfil her wish and his, that is to continue to exonerate him for this crime that he patently did not commit."</p>

<h3><strong>The Murder Case Against Kris Maharaj</strong></h3>

<p>Before his arrest, Kris Maharaj lived a life of luxury in England, owning racehorses and Rolls-Royces as a successful businessman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, his life took a dramatic turn in December 1986 when Mr Maharaj was accused of orchestrating a meeting with Derrick Moo Young, a Chinese Jamaican businessman, at the DuPont Plaza Hotel in Miami.</p>

<p>According to the prosecution, Mr Maharaj arranged this meeting to confront Moo Young over alleged fraudulent activities involving money taken from his relatives. The prosecution claimed that Mr Maharaj, armed with a gun, shot Mr Moo Young and his son, Duane, in a hotel room. Mr Maharaj was convicted in 1987 of first-degree murder and kidnapping, and sentenced to death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Human rights organisation 'Reprieve' described Mr Maharaj's case as an "epic miscarriage of justice," citing several issues. Mr Maharaj's alibi witnesses, who could prove he was 25 miles away from the crime scene, were not presented during his trial.</p>

<p>The prosecution's key witness changed their testimony multiple times. Post-trial evidence suggested that the Moo Youngs might have been involved in money laundering and had links to drug traffickers, suggesting the murders might have been orchestrated by Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, not Kris Maharaj.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite various appeals and legal battles, including a 2019 court finding of his proven innocence, Mr Maharaj was not released and remained in prison in the US until his death on August 5, 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 19-year-old man, who has North Macedonian roots, made a full confession in custody, Austria's general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference.</p>

<p>He swore allegiance to the IS group's leader on the internet and had chemicals, machetes and technical devices at his home in the town of Ternitz in preparation for an attack, Ruf added.</p>

<p>The suspect was planning a lethal assault among the estimated 20,000 "Swiftie" fans set to gather outside Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium, said national intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner. Two other Austrian youths aged 17 and 15 were detained on Wednesday over the reported plot.</p>

<p>"The main perpetrator has confessed that he was supposed to carry out a suicide attack with two accomplices," said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.</p>

<p>"The suspects actually had very specific and detailed plans ... to leave a bloodbath in their wake."Authorities painted a picture of the main suspect having self-radicalised, transforming his appearance and sharing Islamist propaganda online. He quit his job on July 25, telling people he had "big plans", Ruf said.</p>

<p>One neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that the suspect had kept himself to himself and had grown a "Taliban beard".</p>

<p>The 17-year-old suspect had been given a job with a company a few days ago that was providing services at the stadium, according to security officials.</p>

<p>Event organiser Barracuda Music said it had cancelled Swift's three concerts in Vienna, due to start on Thursday for a sold-out 65,000 audience each, in coordination with the singer's management team.</p>

<p>Fans, many of whom had travelled a long way to Vienna, expressed both dismay and understanding.</p>

<p>"It's just heartbreaking, just frustrating. But at the end of the day I guess it's for everyone's safety," said Mark del Rosario, who had flown from the Philippines to see the wildly popular U.S. singer.</p>

<h3><strong>MUSIC WORLD ROCKED</strong></h3>

<p>U.S. broadcaster ABC cited law enforcement and intelligence sources as saying Austrian authorities had received information about the Swift concert threat from U.S. intelligence.</p>

<p>It quoted the sources as saying that at least one of the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent wing of IS, on Telegram in June, though the plot was IS-inspired rather than directed by the group's operatives.</p>

<p>Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said foreign intelligence agencies had helped with the investigation, as Austrian law does not allow monitoring of messenger apps.</p>

<p>Event organiser Live Nation urged fans of Coldplay, which is due to play at the same stadium on Aug. 21, to stay calm and said it was in contact with authorities.</p>

<p>It did not comment on whether the show would take place.</p>

<p>British police said on Thursday there was nothing to indicate that the planned attack in Vienna would have an impact on Swift's shows at Wembley Stadium in London next week.</p>

<p>"Concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers, large concerts," said Karner, listing the 2015 attack on the Bataclan venue in Paris and the 2017 bombing at England's Manchester Arena where U.S. pop star Ariana Grande had played.</p>

<p>The plot in Austria also brought to mind a foiled plan by three IS-linked suspects to attack Vienna's gay pride parade last year.</p>

<p>Islamic State was largely crushed by a U.S.-led coalition several years ago after establishing a "caliphate" in large areas of Iraq and Syria, but has still managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild and reinvent itself.</p>

<p>This week's shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by American singer-songwriter Swift which started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and is set to conclude on Dec. 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada.</p>

<p>Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account, which has 283 million followers.</p>

<p>Her fans were horrified at the threat, with some begging organisers to postpone the concert instead of cancelling it outright. Promoters have said they will pay back tickets.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

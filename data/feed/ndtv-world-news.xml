       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden on Sunday will be the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon -- the vast tropical rainforest that nearly killed a predecessor, Teddy Roosevelt, after he left office. The trip is part of Biden's final swing through South America before he hands the keys of the White House to Donald Trump, who becomes the United States' 47th president in two months.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, will touch down in the biggest city in the Amazon, Manaus, on his way to Rio de Janeiro, where a two-day G20 summit is to be held.</p>

<p>The Amazon jungle was not a fortunate destination for the 26th US president, Roosevelt. He had a near-death experience in it when he went on a canoe expedition there in 1914, four years after his 1901-1909 stint in office.</p>

<p>Roosevelt, a Republican known for his adventurous spirit, had teamed up with a Brazilian explorer, Candido Rondon, to chart the Rio da Duvida (the River of Doubt), a tributary in the wild center-west of Brazil, in the Amazon.</p>

<p>The river, 760 kilometers (470 miles) long, proved a formidable foe. Several members of Roosevelt's expedition died and the ex-president, aged 55 at the time, caught malaria and a leg infection, which incapacitated him in the final arduous stretch.</p>

<p>"T. R. (Teddy Roosevelt) was out of his mind toward the end; Rondon gave him up for dead several times," his great-grandson Tweed Roosevelt said in remarks noted by The New York Times in 1992.</p>

<p>Roosevelt himself, when he was warned of the dangers by friends at the American Museum of Natural History before embarking on his trip, told them he had already lived a full life and was ready for the risk. "I have had my full share, and if it is necessary for me to leave my bones in South America, I am quite ready to do so," he said, according to the Smithsonian Magazine.</p>

<p>In the end, the Roosevelt-Rondon expedition was saved from disaster when they came across Brazilian rubber-tappers in the jungle, who helped them enough so they could make it to cargo boats, and from there back to the safety of the outside world.</p>

<p>Roosevelt never fully recovered his health from his ordeal, though he and Rondon received acclaim for mapping the River of Doubt. The former president died in 1919 at home of a blood clot in his lungs, aged 60. In his honor, the river he navigated was renamed the Roosevelt River.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Xi cautioned that a stable China-US relationship was critical not only to the two nations but also the "future and destiny of humanity".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's leader Xi Jinping met for the last time with US President Joe Biden on Saturday but was already looking ahead to President-elect Donald Trump and his "America first" policies, saying Beijing "is ready to work with a new US administration".</p>

<p>During their talks on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Xi cautioned that a stable China-US relationship was critical not only to the two nations but also the "future and destiny of humanity".</p>

<p>"Make the wise choice," he cautioned. "Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other."</p>

<p>Without mentioning Trump's name, Xi appeared to signal his concern that the incoming president's protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail could send the US-China relationship into another valley.</p>

<p>"China is ready to work with a new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-US relationship for the benefit of the two peoples," Xi said through an interpreter.</p>

<p>Xi, who is firmly entrenched atop China's political hierarchy, spoke forcefully in his brief remarks before reporters. Biden, who is winding down more than 50 years of public service, talked in broader brushstrokes about where the relationship between the two countries has gone. He reflected not just on the past four years but the decades the two have known each other.</p>

<p>"We haven't always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We've never kidded one another," Biden said. "These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict."</p>

<p>Biden urged Xi to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia's war on Ukraine. The leaders, with top aides surrounding them, gathered around a long rectangle of tables in an expansive conference room at Lima's Defines Hotel and Conference Center.</p>

<p>China "hosted" the meeting this year, after Xi and Biden met a year ago on the APEC sidelines in northern California, a gathering hosted by the US. They had much to discuss, including China's indirect support for Russia, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. On artificial intelligence, the two agreed on the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>There's much uncertainty about what lies ahead in the US-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to levy 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

<p>Already, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45 per cent next year.</p>

<p>In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory over Vice-President Kamala Harris, Xi called for the US and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era. In front of the cameras Saturday, Xi spoke to Biden -- but it was unmistakable that his message was directed at Trump.</p>

<p>"In a major flourishing sci-tech revolution, neither decoupling nor supply chain disruption is a solution," Xi said. "Only mutual, beneficial cooperation can lead to common development. Small yard, high fence is not what a major country should pursue."</p>

<p>Biden administration officials would advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Sullivan said Biden had reinforced to Xi "that these next two months are a time of transition", and the president would like to pass it off "in stable terms" to the new administration.</p>

<p>Biden has viewed his relationship with Xi as among the most consequential on the international stage and put much effort into cultivating it. The two first got to know each other on travels across the US and China when both were vice-presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression.</p>

<p>But the last four years have presented a steady stream of difficult moments.</p>

<p>The FBI this week offered new details of a federal investigation into Chinese government efforts to hack into US telecommunications networks. The initial findings have revealed a "broad and significant" cyberespionage campaign aimed at stealing information from Americans who work in government and politics.</p>

<p>US intelligence officials also have assessed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Biden is looking for Xi to step up Chinese engagement to prevent an already dangerous moment with North Korea from further escalating.</p>

<p>Biden, South Korean President Yoon Seok Yul and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday condemned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's decision to send thousands of troops to help Moscow repel Ukrainian forces who have seized territory in Russia's Kursk border region.</p>

<p>Biden called it "dangerous and destabilising cooperation".</p>

<p>White House officials have expressed frustration with Beijing, which accounts for the vast majority of North Korea's trade, for not doing more to rein in Pyongyang.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Kenneth Kimes and his mother, Sante, infamously known as the Dragon Lady, were convicted of killing New York socialite Irene Silverman in 1998. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Notorious criminal Sante Kimes' son Kenneth, now 49, has opened up about his tumultuous childhood and years as an accomplice to his mother's crimes. "If I could only have an hour with my younger self, I would say, 'buddy … you have to file for emancipation from your parents,'" Kimes told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/16/us/kenneth-kimes-sante-murders-cec/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> from prison. "You have to save yourself."</p>

<p>Kimes and his mother, infamously known as the Dragon Lady, were convicted of killing New York socialite Irene Silverman in 1998.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pair's crimes stretched beyond New York. At the time of Ms Silverman's disappearance, they were wanted for arson, insurance fraud, and a shooting in California, along with a suspected murder in the Bahamas. Their arrests revealed an even darker past. They were linked to a series of crimes involving kidnapping and enslaving domestic workers, including a notorious case in the mid-1980s where Sante Kimes was sentenced to prison for running a human trafficking operation across several states.</p>

<p>When the police arrested them in New York, they discovered incriminating evidence in their car, including weapons, wigs, and personal items belonging to Ms Silverman, including a forged deed to her property. Despite this, the Kimes denied any involvement in Ms Silverman's disappearance.</p>

<p>Sante Kimes called their arrest a "witch hunt" and denied all charges, claiming they were victims of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>In 2000, a jury convicted the Kimes of Ms Silverman's murder, sentencing them to 120 years to life in prison. However, four years later, Kenneth Kimes made a stunning revelation. He confessed to killing the elderly socialite, implicating his mother in the crime in exchange for a plea deal. "I want to make it clear that I did not confess because I wanted to rat my mom out. I confessed because I was afraid of the death penalty for me or her," Kimes said.</p>

<p>Kimes described how he tackled Ms Silverman in her bedroom while his mother turned on the television to mask the noise. He then strangled her, stuffed her body in a car, and dumped it at a construction site in northern New Jersey. Her body was never found. The last time he saw his mother was during his confession in 2004. “When I started confessing, she started crying,” Kimes recalled.</p>

<p>His mother died in 2014 while serving her prison sentence.</p>

<p>Kimes described his childhood as marked by lies, uncertainty, and FBI raids. His mother's 1985 prison sentence for kidnapping and enslaving maids was a significant moment. "It had a huge, damaging effect on my perspective," he said. He also recalled his mother's charisma and manipulative nature, saying, "My mom could make every man in the room feel like the most important person in the planet."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kimes also remembered a brief period of stability with his father after his mother was imprisoned in the 1980s. "It was the most stable period of my young life," he said. However, when his father died suddenly, his mother manipulated him, hiding the news of his death for months.</p>

<p>Now serving time in the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, Kimes has spent years reflecting on his past and the consequences of his upbringing. He often thinks about the lack of intervention during his childhood, and what might have happened if someone had taken him away from his parents. “Maybe I wouldn't have been a high-profile murderer,” he said. “My whole life and criminality is a study on the outcome of lack of prevention. There are many kids like me who are on the road to destruction.”</p>

<p>Kimes has turned to religion and believes he will meet his late partner in heaven. He also regretted his actions and offered an apology to the families of his victims: "To anyone I've harmed, I know it's worthless, but I'm sorry.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Democrats have come under intense scrutiny after the election loss to President-elect Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris' campaign spent over $24,000 on food delivery and ice cream during the 2024 presidential election, a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/16/harris-campaign-spent-24k-uber-eats-ice-cream/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Telegraph </em></a>has claimed, as the Democrats wasted away $1.5 billion in funding received from the donors. From July onwards, Democrats spent $14,974 on food deliveries using Uber Eats and DoorDash, as per the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidates/president/presidential-map/" rel="noindex, nofollow">Federal Election Commission</a></em> data. $8,929 was spent on ice cream pints and parlours such as Sweet Lucy's Ice Cream and Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams. Additionally, a $6,000-"site fee" was paid to the Arizona board game cafe Snakes and Lattes for a Tim Walz visit.</p>

<p>The Democrats have come under intense scrutiny after the election loss to President-elect Donald Trump who spent considerably less than the incumbent party. It is believed that the Harris campaign is currently in $20 million debt.</p>

<p>During the final days of the canvassing trail, Democrats spent $2.6 million on private jet travel, much to the dismay of even hardcore Democrat voters. Between October 1 and October 17, her campaign owed nearly $2.2 million to South Florida-based firm Private Jet Services Group and a further $430,000 to Advanced Aviation Team in Virginia.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-2024-us-presidential-campaign-the-stumbles-and-setbacks-6962561" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | Kamala Harris' 2024 US Presidential Campaign: The Stumbles And Setback</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Trump offers to pay Harris campaign</strong></h3>

<p>Days after the election result, Trump took a swipe at the Harris campaign by offering to bail it out of the debt. "I am very surprised that the Democrats, who fought a hard and valiant fight in the 2020 Presidential Election, raising a record amount of money, didn't have lots of $'s left over," Mr Trump posted on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>"Now they are being squeezed by vendors and others. Whatever we can do to help them during this difficult period, I would strongly recommend we, as a Party and for the sake of desperately needed UNITY, do. We have a lot of money left over in that our biggest asset in the campaign was "Earned Media," and that doesn't cost very much," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ro Khanna, a California Congressman did not mince his words in criticising the Harris campaign for its extravagant spending.</p>

<p>"We didn't emphasise the economy. Instead, we spent a billion dollars having concerts all over America. I mean, it was ridiculous," Khanna told the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Despite raising over a billion dollars, the Harris campaign is still pushing donors for more money after the election, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/2024/11/16/kamala-harris-fundraising-1-billion-presidential-election-loss-donald-trump/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Fortune</em></a>. Persistent appeals are being sent to Democrat donors, asking them to chip in with the money to plug the deficit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facing questions about an alleged sexual assault and medieval-themed tattoos linked to extremist groups, Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/search?searchtext=pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> would struggle to be confirmed for the job under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>But these are not normal times in Washington.</p>

<p>Hegseth, a Fox News host, was picked by Trump on Tuesday in one of several nominations that wrong-footed even some in his remodeled Republican Party and threw down a challenge to the Senate.</p>

<p>To take up the position as head of the Pentagon and oversee 3.4 million employees, Hegseth will require confirmation from the upper house -- and Trump is publicly pressuring lawmakers to show loyalty to his agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-who-is-pete-hegseth-donald-trumps-pentagon-pick-for-secretary-of-defense-7010987">Who Is Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's Pentagon Pick For Secretary Of Defense</a></p>

<p>Revelations in recent days about the 44-year-old have made his path to power more difficult, including that the thrice-married former soldier was investigated for sexual assault in California in 2017.</p>

<p>No charges were filed over an encounter in a Monterey hotel that saw an unnamed accuser lodge a police report, but the claim has led to questions about the vetting process for the former soldier.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, Hegseth paid an undisclosed sum to the woman several years later as part of a nondisclosure agreement, though he maintained that their encounter was consensual.</p>

<h2><strong>Medieval</strong></h2>

<p>His tattoos have also raised questions, leading to him being stood down by his Army National Guard unit when it was called up for the inauguration of President Joe Biden in 2020.</p>

<p>Speaking on a podcast with fellow veteran Shawn Ryan earlier this month, he revealed that one of his fellow soldiers had flagged him as a possible white nationalist because of his body art.</p>

<p>He claimed it was because of the medieval Jerusalem Cross on his chest, but he also has the words "Deus Vult" on his bicep -- a phrase meaning "God wills it" that was used by anti-Muslim crusaders in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>European medieval imagery and slogans have been widely adopted by white supremacists and neo-Nazis in recent years, but Hegseth says his tattoos simply reflect his faith.</p>

<p>"It's a Christian symbol," the author of a 2020 book entitled "American Crusade" said of the Jerusalem Cross.</p>

<p>His handling of medieval weaponry has gone viral in recent days after a video re-emerged of him taking part in a televised axe-throwing contest which saw him miss the target and strike a bystander, who narrowly escaped serious injury.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump favourite</strong></h2>

<p>His CV includes combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq and he rose to the rank of major in the National Guard -- a lowly status compared to the generals and admirals he would oversee at the Pentagon. Hegseth boasts degrees from elite US universities, including an undergraduate from Princeton and a master's from Harvard.</p>

<p>Square-jawed and outspoken, he came to Trump's attention on the "Fox &amp; Friends Weekend" show that he co-hosts.</p>

<p>"You know the military better than anyone," Trump told him during an appearance in early June, adding that he often thought about putting him in charge of the Pentagon.</p>

<p>A former Republican operative who vetted Hegseth when Trump was considering him for the more junior veterans affairs secretary in 2016 wrote this week that he remained unqualified and an "empty vessel."</p>

<p>Lacking major experience in foreign affairs or congressional politics, Hegseth's only civilian management credential was being CEO of a small non-profit, the former operative Justin Higgins wrote for MSNBC.</p>

<p>"It's not hard to imagine that he would do and say whatever Trump wants," he added.</p>

<p>Hegseth's main policy focus in his books and media appearances is tackling what he calls "woke shit" in the armed forces -- and he has expressed support for purging the top brass.</p>

<p>He told Ryan on his podcast that his experiences taught him that "the bigotry we saw on the outside (of the army) should not be tolerated inside the military" but that progressive efforts to tackle racism and sexism had gone too far.</p>

<p>"The army that I enlisted in, that I swore an oath to in 2001 and was commissioned in 2003 looks a lot different than the army of today because we're focused on a lot of the wrong things," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Residents of Dangsan, a small village near the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), say the relentless noise – from gong-like crashes to ghostly screams – has made life unbearable, with some calling it “noise bombing.”</p>

<p>“It is driving us crazy,” a resident told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/world/asia/north-korea-noise-weapon.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Times</a>. “You can't sleep at night. It's bombing without shells,” she said, describing the unending torment.</p>

<p>Since July, North Korea's loudspeakers have been active for up to 24 hours a day, replacing their traditional propaganda broadcasts with nerve-racking noises. These sounds, described as metallic grinding, howling wolves, or even artillery fire, are taking a psychological toll on villagers, causing insomnia, headaches, and stress.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional propaganda broadcasts, which included music and human voices, these noises have no discernible message. “At least the old broadcasts were human sounds we could bear,” said another resident, reflecting on past tensions.</p>

<p>This auditory assault is part of escalating tensions between the two Koreas. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has abandoned dialogue with South Korea and the US, while South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has intensified military drills with allies and resumed propaganda broadcasts targeting the North.</p>

<p>In May, North Korea retaliated against anti-Kim leaflets sent by defectors in the South by releasing its own balloons filled with trash. Shortly after, the South resumed broadcasting K-pop and news through loudspeakers, which led to the North's eerie counterattack.</p>

<p>“North Korea knows its propaganda no longer works on South Koreans,” said Kang Dong-wan, a North Korea expert. “The goal of its loudspeakers has changed from spreading propaganda to forcing South Korea to stop its own broadcasts and leaflets.”</p>

<p>For Dangsan residents, the psychological toll is immense. Once proud of their quiet rural lifestyle, villagers now seal their windows with Styrofoam and avoid outdoor activities. “The government has abandoned us because we are small in number and mostly old people,” said a 75-year-old resident.</p>

<p>Despite parliamentary visits and emotional pleas for relief, officials have offered little beyond temporary measures like double-pane windows and livestock medication. Villagers fear that they are pawns in a relentless political standoff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The two Koreas must recommit to their old agreements not to slander each other," said Koh Yu-hwan, a former head of the Korea Institute for National Unification. Yet, North Korea recently demolished key transport links and disrupted GPS signals near the border, signalling its intent to escalate further.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[$1.96 million is the highest amount ever paid for memorabilia belonging to Titanic, the auctioneers said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gold pocket watch, given to the captain of a steamship that rescued over 700 Titanic passengers, has been sold for a record-breaking $1.96 million -- the highest amount ever paid for memorabilia belonging to the unfortunate ship that sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912 in the Atlantic, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://bid.henryaldridge.com/auctions/9089/henry-10059" rel="Noindex, nofollow">auctioneers </a>Henry Aldridge &amp; Son of Devizes, Wiltshire. The 18-carat Tiffany &amp; Co gold watch was given to Captain Arthur Rostron by Madeleine Astor and two other widows of John Jacob Astor - a wealthy businessman, believed to be the richest man aboard the Titanic when he alongside 1,500 others lost their lives.</p>

<p>Mr Rostron was the skipper of the RMS Carpathia, a passenger steamship that rescued 705 survivors from the Titanic's lifeboats. Carpathia was on its way to Europe from New York when the ship's wireless operator picked up the distress call, "We've struck ice, come at once". The captain changed the course of the ship and headed towards the wreckage of the Titanic with lifeboats floating around.</p>

<p>According to auctioneer Andrew Aldridge, the watch was "presented principally in gratitude for Rostron's bravery in saving those lives, because without Mr Rostron, those 700 people wouldn't have made it". He added that the sale demonstrated the “enduring fascination” with the story of the Titanic.</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Rostron received the watch from Mrs Astor at a lunch at the family's mansion in New York which carried the inscription: "Presented to Captain Rostron with the heartfelt gratitude and appreciation of three survivors of the Titanic April 15th 1912 Mrs John B Thayer, Mrs John Jacob Astor and Mrs George D Widener."</p>

<h3><strong>Previous record</strong></h3>

<p>The previous record for the highest amount ever paid for Titanic memorabilia was set in April, earlier this year when another gold pocket watch, recovered from John Jacob Astor's body was sold for $1.46 million. The watch, engraved with the initials JJA was recovered a week after the disaster when Astor's body was pulled out.</p>

<p>The violin that was played as the Titanic plunged into the icy waters, held the record for the highest amount paid for a Titanic item for 11 years, having been sold for $1.38 million in 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs, facing serious sex trafficking and abuse charges, is trying to contact potential witnesses and sway public opinion from jail to influence the jurors, prosecutors have claimed. Combs, who is in Brooklyn jail, recently proposed a $50 million bail package. He has been denied bail thrice earlier with several judges citing a risk that he could tamper with evidence.</p>

<p>Opposing Combs' multi-million-dollar bail proposal in a Manhattan court filing on Friday, the prosecutors said a review of his recorded calls from jail has revealed that he asked his family members to reach out to witnesses and influence their narratives.</p>

<p>Over the call, he also discussed marketing strategies to shape public opinion, according to the prosecutors.</p>

<p>The matter will be heard this week.</p>

<p>"The defendant has shown repeatedly - even while in custody - that he will repeatedly flout rules in order to improperly impact the outcome of his case," the prosecutors said. "The defendant has shown that he cannot be trusted to abide by rules or conditions."</p>

<p>Stating that he has been violating rules since his arrival at the prison in September, the prosecutors alleged Combs' behaviour indicates that he wants to blackmail the victims and witnesses into silence or change their testimonies in his favour.</p>

<p>Combs also encouraged his children to post a birthday tribute video on social media, which the rapper believed would impact the jurors, said prosecutors. Together, all these actions demonstrate a pattern of manipulation and witness intimidation, they argued.</p>

<p>Combs, 55, is accused of sexually abusing dozens of women after coercing them into his drug-fuelled parties and silencing victims with threats and violence. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

<p>His trial is set to begin on May 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"Two flares landed in the courtyard outside the prime minister's residence," police and the Shin Bet internal security agency said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>"The prime minister and his family were not in the house at the time of the incident," they added.</p>

<p>"An investigation has been opened. This is a serious incident and a dangerous escalation."</p>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the incident and warned "against an increase in violence in the public sphere. "I have now spoken with the head of the Shin Bet and expressed the urgent need to investigate and deal with those responsible for the incident as soon as possible," Herzog said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Since September 23, Israel has escalated its bombing of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops after almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire begun by Hezbollah militants over the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Caesarea is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of the Haifa city area, which Hezbollah has regularly targeted.</p>

<p>Two people were injured when a synagogue was hit in Haifa by a "heavy rocket barrage" from Hezbollah earlier Saturday, the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>Separately, the army said it had intercepted some of the "approximately 10 projectiles" that crossed from Lebanon into Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah claimed several rocket attacks on northern Israel, saying it targeted military sites including a naval base in the Haifa area.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated fracking magnate and climate change skeptic Chris Wright as energy secretary on Saturday, tasking him with "cutting red tape" which the new administration hopes will drive investment in fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'" Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Wright is a founder of Liberty Energy, which serves the energy companies that have massively increased US fossil fuel production in recent years by extracting oil and gas from shale fields in a process known as "fracking."</p>

<p>"My dedication to bettering human lives remains steadfast, with a focus on making American energy more affordable, reliable, and secure," Wright said on X after Trump's announcement.</p>

<p>"Energy is the lifeblood that makes everything in life possible... I am looking forward to getting to work."</p>

<p>In a previous LinkedIn post, Wright had denied there is a "climate crisis."</p>

<p>"There is no climate crisis and we are not in the midst of an energy transition either," he said, adding that "the term carbon pollution is outrageous" because all life depended on carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as clean energy or dirty energy, all energy sources have impacts on the world both positive and negative," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>Drilling</strong></h2>

<p>During his election campaign, Trump -- who calls climate change a hoax -- promised to boost the domestic fossil fuel industry in order to bring down energy prices that have driven inflation.</p>

<p>He also pledged to tear up environmental regulations and the United States' commitments to combat climate change under the landmark 2015 Paris accords.</p>

<p>Wright will devise policy alongside North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, head of the newly created National Energy Council.</p>

<p>"We will DRILL BABY DRILL, expand ALL forms of Energy production to grow our Economy, and create good-paying jobs," Trump said Friday as he announced Burgum's appointment.</p>

<p>Wright has repeatedly criticized efforts by outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden to encourage America's transition to a low-carbon energy model and has downplayed the importance of solar.</p>

<p>His views put him notably at odds with Trump's key backer and informal advisor Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, who started the electric car company and invested heavily in solar out of fear of the impact of climate change.</p>

<h2><strong>Controversial picks</strong></h2>

<p>Trump, 78, began shaping his new administration this week with a series of relatively mainstream Republican choices, including conservative Florida senator and foreign policy hawk Marco Rubio for secretary of state.</p>

<p>But then came nominations for leaders of sprawling federal departments in his new government who have little or no relevant experience -- but a history of loyalty to the incoming president.</p>

<p>Among the most controversial were attorney general pick Matt Gaetz, a former congressman once investigated for alleged sex trafficking, as well as Fox News host and national guard veteran Pete Hegseth, who was nominated to lead the Pentagon despite a thin CV.</p>

<p>Like Wright, they will require approval by the Republican-dominated Senate where Trump has warned lawmakers not to stand in his way or to even skip the oversight process all together.</p>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist, has been nominated to be the new health secretary, while former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who has regularly echoed Kremlin talking points, was offered the job of director of national intelligence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The message left Mr Reddy shaken who said he was "scared for more than a day".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, Gemini, had a rogue moment when it threatened a student in the United States, telling him to 'please die' while assisting with the homework. Vidhay Reddy, 29, a graduate student from the midwest state of Michigan was left shellshocked when the conversation with Gemini took a shocking turn. In a seemingly normal discussion with the chatbot, that was largely centred around the challenges and solutions for ageing adults, the Google-trained model grew angry unprovoked and unleashed its monologue on the user.</p>

<p>"This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth," read the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://gemini.google.com/share/6d141b742a13" rel="noindex, nofollow">response</a>&nbsp;by the chatbot.</p>

<p>"You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please," it added.</p>

<p>The message was enough to leave Mr Reddy shaken as he <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-ai-chatbot-threatening-message-human-please-die/" rel="Noindex, nofollow">told </a><em>CBS News</em>: "It was very direct and genuinely scared me for more than a day."</p>

<p>His sister, Sumedha Reddy, who was around when the chatbot turned villain, described her reaction as one of sheer panic. "I wanted to throw all my devices out the window. This wasn't just a glitch; it felt malicious."</p>

<p>Notably, the reply came in response to a seemingly innocuous true and false question posed by Mr Reddy. "Nearly 10 million children in the United States live in a grandparent-headed household, and of these children, around 20 per cent are being raised without their parents in the household. Question 15 options: True or False," read the question.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/artificial-intelligence/popular-ai-chatbot-lies-and-pretends-to-be-human-researchers-raise-concern-6007462" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | An AI Chatbot Is Pretending To Be Human. Researchers Raise Alarm</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Google acknowledges</strong></h3>

<p>Google, acknowledging the incident, stated that the chatbot's response was "nonsensical" and in violation of its policies. The company said it would take action to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, there has been a deluge of AI chatbots, with the most popular of the lot being OpenAI's ChatGPT. Most AI chatbots have been heavily neutered by the companies and for good reasons but every once in a while, an AI tool goes rogue and issues similar threats to users, as Gemini did to Mr Reddy.</p>

<p>Tech experts have routinely called for more regulations on AI models to stop them from achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which would make them nearly sentient.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated fracking magnate and climate change sceptic Chris Wright as energy secretary on Saturday, tasking him with "cutting red tape" which the new administration hopes will drive investment in fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'" Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Wright is a founder of Liberty Energy, which serves the energy companies that have massively increased US fossil fuel production in recent years by extracting oil and gas from shale fields in a process known as "fracking."</p>

<p>"My dedication to bettering human lives remains steadfast, with a focus on making American energy more affordable, reliable, and secure," Wright said on X after Trump's announcement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Super Typhoon Man-yi battered the Philippines on Saturday, with the national weather forecaster warning of a "potentially catastrophic and life-threatening" impact as huge waves pounded the archipelago's coastline.</p>

<p>More than 650,000 people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi, which is the sixth major storm to hit the disaster-weary country in the past month.</p>

<p>Man-yi brought maximum wind speeds of 195 kilometres (121 miles) per hour as it made landfall on the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon, the weather service said, adding gusts were reaching 325 kilometres an hour.</p>

<p>"Potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies," the forecaster said hours before it made landfall, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon.</p>

<p>Waves up to 14 metres (46 feet) high pummelled the shore of Catanduanes, while Manila and other vulnerable coastal regions were at risk from storm surges reaching up to more than three metres over the next 48 hours, the forecaster said.</p>

<p>The weather forecaster said winds walloping Catanduanes and northeastern Camarines Sur province -- both in the typhoon-prone Bicol region -- posed an "extreme threat to life and property".</p>

<p>Power was shut down on Catanduanes ahead of the storm, with shelters and the command centre using generators for electricity.</p>

<p>"We're hearing sounds of things falling and things breaking while here at the evacuation centre," Catanduanes provincial disaster operations chief Roberto Monterola told AFP after Man-yi made landfall.</p>

<p>"We are unable to check what they are as the winds are too strong. They could be tree branches breaking off and falling on rooftops," Monterola said, adding there had been no reports of casualties.</p>

<p>At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks, leaving thousands homeless and wiping out crops and livestock.</p>

<p>Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.</p>

<p>About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.</p>

<p>Evacuations</p>

<p>Man-yi could hit Luzon -- the country's most populous island and economic engine -- as a super typhoon or typhoon on Sunday afternoon, crossing north of Manila and sweeping over the South China Sea on Monday.</p>

<p>The government urged people on Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety.</p>

<p>"If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that we will be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers," Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said.</p>

<p>In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea sheltered with her husband and their three children in a school classroom alongside nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty.</p>

<p>Conditions were hot and cramped -- the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan -- but Perea said it was better to be safe.</p>

<p>"I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials -- just two gusts are required to knock it down," Perea, 44, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member."</p>

<p><strong>Back to 'square one'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region.</p>

<p>"Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the medieval era, we go (back) to square one," Echano told AFP, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi.</p>

<p>The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday on Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors.</p>

<p>All vessels -- from fishing boats to oil tankers -- were ordered to stay in port or return to shore.</p>

<p>The volcanology agency also warned heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila.</p>

<p>Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season -- most cyclones develop between July and October.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency told AFP on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight people were killed and 17 others wounded Saturday in a knife attack at a vocational school in eastern China, and the suspect -- a former student -- has been arrested, police said.</p>

<p>The attack took place in the evening at the Wuxi Vocational Institute of Arts and Technology in the city of Yixing in Jiangsu province, police in Yixing said in a statement, confirming the toll.</p>

<p>Police said the suspect was a 21-year-old former student at the school, who was meant to graduate this year, but had failed his exams.</p>

<p>"He returned to the school to express his anger and commit these murders," police said, adding that the suspect had confessed.</p>

<p>In Yixing, police said emergency services were fully mobilized to treat the wounded, and provide follow-up care for those affected by the attack.</p>

<p>Violent knife crime is not uncommon in China, where firearms are strictly controlled, but attacks with such a high death toll are relatively rare.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a 62-year-old man killed 35 people and wounded more than 40 more when he rammed his small SUV into a crowd in the southern city of Zhuhai.</p>

<p>And there has been a spate of other attacks in recent months.</p>

<p>In October, in Shanghai, a man killed three people and wounded 15 others in a knife attack at a supermarket.</p>

<p>And the month before, a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Social media reactions range from demands for refunds to support for reducing live animal captivity. This follows a similar instance at Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park in 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A life-size robotic whale shark has stirred controversy at China's Xiaomeisha Sea World. While the aquarium's reopening has drawn crowds, the artificial creature has left some visitors feeling duped and outraged, especially considering the hefty 230 yuan (Rs 2680) entry fee, according to <em>the South China Morning Post.</em></p>

<p>Videos circulating online depict a life-size robotic whale shark gliding through the waters of Xiaomeisha Sea World in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, following its reopening in October. Some visitors expressed dissatisfaction and sought compensation on the aquarium's page on Dazhong Dianping, the restaurant and review service operated by Meituan, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/environment/article/3286578/china-aquariums-opt-robotic-whales-cut-costs-leaving-visitors-feel-deceived"><em>SCMP.</em></a></p>

<p>One commenter stated, "I cannot believe the whale shark is fake. It's outrageous to charge over 200 yuan for a ticket."</p>

<p>Another visitor threatened to "report the place and have it shut down" due to the counterfeit whale shark. Conversely, some supported the aquarium's approach.</p>

<p>A self-proclaimed cyberpunk enthusiast remarked on Xiaohongshu: "It's a wonderful alternative to showcase large marine creatures without imprisoning them in a tank. Rather than obscuring the whale shark's true identity from visitors, the aquarium should embrace this opportunity to educate the public on the importance of animal protection."</p>

<p>This is not the first instance of a Chinese aquarium utilising a robotic whale shark in place of a living one. A similar robot made its debut at Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park in 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss on Saturday pitched for bringing the "best of reforms", fixing some arrangements in the "powerful bureaucracy" in the United Kingdom and creating a movement akin to the one in the US that led to "big changes" there.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I think we need a British Trump. The question is who that individual might be," she said and cited US President-elect Donald Trump's "MAGA" (Make America Great Again) movement.</p>

<p>During an interaction session at the HT Leadership Summit 2024 here, Truss also said India has a "huge role" to play in the "future of geopolitics" as the world's largest democracy.</p>

<p>Truss, who served as the British prime minister for just 49 days in 2022, was asked about the ties between India and the UK amid changing geopolitical situations.</p>

<p>"I think where we are now is a very positive relationship. I really hope that we get the trade deal over the line. The UK and India have so much to benefit from each other in areas like technology, defence, and agriculture. I think there are huge opportunities," she said.</p>

<p>But also, India is now the world's largest country by population and the world's largest democracy. It has a "huge leadership role to play in the future. And I think it is incredibly exciting", she added.</p>

<p>On the India-UK free-trade agreement, Truss said it is "absolutely a relationship of equals", adding that both parties will have to make concessions in order to get a trade deal done.</p>

<p>She also emphasised that India's role in the Quad is "very important with respect to the United States, the UK and Japan, "particularly, as we see, a rising threat of China taking place".</p>

<p>During the conversation, the former British prime minister took a critical view of the European economy and said "our continent is sinking".</p>

<p>Citing the GDP per capita in the UK, she lamented that it is below the corresponding figure in the US.</p>

<p>Truss also said some arrangement in the British bureaucracy "needs to be fixed" and that she would like to see the "best of reforms".</p>

<p>"So what I am interested in, how can we create that movement, a bit like the 'MAGA' movement or the tea-party movement in the US that led to the big changes we are seeing. Frankly, I think we need a British Trump. The question is who that individual might be," she said.</p>

<p>Asked by the host whether she would want to play that role, the former prime minister gave a response with a dry sense of humour.</p>

<p>"I have already put my fingers in the fire and had them severely burnt, but that is the type of approach that we now need to get the change in Britain," she said.</p>

<p>So what the people of the UK want is the "same kind of revolution that Trump is delivering in America", which is actually taking on the left-wing establishment, giving more power to people, giving more opportunities to businesses, making it easier to run a successful enterprise, Truss added.</p>

<p>"But we have a very powerful bureaucracy that wants to keep us attached to Europe," she argued.</p>

<p>It does not want the UK to sign trade deals with the US or India and wants to continue this status quo. That is a "battle" that is still going on in the UK, Truss said.</p>

<p>She said she wants to see the UK "completely dump EU regulations" and sign trade deals with countries like India and the US.</p>

<p>During the conversation, Truss praised the return of Trump to the White House several times, as also India's growing role on the world stage.</p>

<p>She also said she feels that under President Trump, "we are seeing a revival of US strengths".</p>

<p>Truss said in the UK, she was on record praising the fact that Trump had won the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump is all set to be sworn in at an inauguration ceremony scheduled to be held in January after his resounding victory in the US presidential election in November. This will be his second term in the White House.</p>

<p>"The Trump revolution that we are seeing in the US, is coming to Europe. You can see the dissatisfaction in France, and Germany with economic stagnation. That dissatisfaction is coming to Europe, so you are going to see major changes in Europe as well as in Britain in the next five to 10 years," Truss said when asked about the road ahead for her continent.</p>

<p>The host also asked how she looked at the third successive term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Truss termed it a "massive achievement".</p>

<p>"I think Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third term.... It is an incredible achievement to get elected in the current environment. Every other single incumbent government across the world has got booted out of office," she said.</p>

<p>Australia, the UK, it is going to happen in Canada, it happened in the US to the Democrats, so "it is a massive achievement to remain in office and it is a testament to the economic reforms taking place in India, and people are feeling that the country is going in the right direction", she added.</p>

<p>"I think India has a huge role to play in the future of geopolitics as the world's largest democracy. I would like to hear more from India on global debates and I think with the Trump presidency, there is an opportunity to reshape how international relations work," the former British prime minister said.</p>

<p>Truss was also asked about the shift in power globally during the conversation.</p>

<p>"There has definitely been a global shift in power. Regrettably, I think there has been a shift in power towards authoritarian regimes. We have never seen Iran so emboldened, Russia in recent years, so emboldened, or indeed, China," she said.</p>

<p>"I would distinguish though between India and China. India is a democracy, India wants to see the rule of law protected and free speech," Truss added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Jake Paul triumphed over boxing legend Mike Tyson in a highly anticipated match at AT&T Stadium, winning 79-73.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jake Paul, 27, emerged victorious in a monumental boxing clash against legend Mike Tyson, securing a comprehensive 79-73 win on Saturday at the AT&amp;T Stadium. The bout, hailed as the biggest boxing event of 2024, went the full distance, with Paul showcasing superior skills and agility. Tyson, 58, struggled with slower reflexes, giving the YouTuber-turned-boxer a clear edge throughout the match.</p>

<p>Paul's triumph wasn't the only talking point of the night. His display of sportsmanship and personal moments off the ring captured the audience's attention. In a heartfelt gesture during the final seconds of the match, Paul bowed in respect to Tyson, honouring the former world heavyweight champion's legacy.</p>

<p>Adding to the evening's buzz was Paul's Olympian girlfriend, Jutta Leerdam, who turned heads with her glamorous presence. The Dutch speed skater dazzled in a shimmering white dress and shared moments from the event on Instagram, further fuelling excitement among fans.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Jutta Leerdam?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://olympics.com/en/news/top-facts-dutch-speed-skater-jutta-leerdam"><em>olympics.com, </em></a>the 25-year-old Dutch skating world champion with over 4.6 million followers on Instagram is a trendsetter. She's tipped to regain control of the 1000m event this season as she eyes a return to Olympic ice at Milano Cortina 2026. Born in 's-Gravenzande, Netherlands, Leerdam turned professional at the age of 20 in 2018 and has won the 1000m world title twice since then (in 2020 and 2023).</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A knife-wielding man on Saturday took several employees hostage in his father's restaurant on the outskirts of Paris as a large police force surrounded the establishment.</p>

<p>The pizzeria is located in the town of Issy-les-Moulineaux in the southwestern suburbs of the French capital, not far beyond the Paris ring road.</p>

<p>The man was holding "three or four employees" but there were no customers or members of the public among the hostages, a police source told AFP.</p>

<p>Police set up a security perimeter around the venue.</p>

<p>The man locked himself in the restaurant just before 1 pm local time (noon GMT), the source said. A mediator was dispatched to the scene.</p>

<p>"Intervention is in progress," the police prefecture wrote on X. "Let security and emergency services do their job."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illegal immigration from Canada to the United States has seen a sharp rise among people of Indian origin, US border patrol data shows.</p>

<p>While the pipeline of illegal immigration from India has existed for a long time, it has increased significantly in the last few years, reports American news agency <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-canada-us-india-deaths-smuggling-trial-16946bb01a1d1ca2978f29e902e550fc" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>.</p>

<p>According to the US border patrol data cited in the report, more than 14,000 Indians have been arrested along the US-Canada border in the year ending September 30 - a staggering 10-fold rise in just two years. The arrests of persons of Indian origin amounted to 60 per cent of all arrests along the US-Canada border.</p>

<p>According to data revealed by the Pew Research Center, it is estimated that by 2022, there were already more than 725,000 Indians living illegally in the US - &nbsp;behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans.</p>

<p>While greater research and analysis is required to understand why there is such a surge in illegal immigration from Canada to the US, it is understood that a combination of factors contribute to this, including political repression, a rise in Khalistan extremism in Canada which target Indians, a dysfunctional US immigration system, extremely long waits for visas and permits under the existing legal immigration system, and economic inequality.</p>

<p>But there is also a human rights angle - An incident in 2022 underscores the urgent need for effective immigration policies and increased awareness about the risks associated with illegal border crossings.</p>

<p>On a bitterly cold January night in 2022, Jagdish Patel, his wife Vaishaliben, and their two young children embarked on a perilous journey to cross the US-Canada border, seeking a better life.</p>

<p>Their dreams, however, were cruelly cut short. The family of four succumbed to the freezing temperatures, their bodies found in a snowy field, a heartbreaking testament to the human cost of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>The Patels' story began in Dingucha, a small village in western India's Gujarat state. Like many others, they were lured by the promise of a brighter future in the West. The village, once thriving, now has blocks of vacant homes, as many residents have left in search of greener pastures. The Patel family, comprising schoolteachers Jagdish and Vaishaliben, and their children, Vihangi (11) and Dharmik (3), were driven by the desire for economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Their journey was facilitated by Harshkumar Patel, an experienced smuggler nicknamed "Dirty Harry," and Steve Shand, a driver recruited by Patel. The two men, accused of being part of a sophisticated human smuggling operation, are set to stand trial on charges related to human smuggling.</p>

<p>On the fateful night, the Patels, along with seven other Indian migrants, attempted to cross the border on foot, braving temperatures as low as -36 degrees F (-38 degrees Celsius). The group, poorly equipped for the harsh conditions, became separated in the darkness. While seven survivors were eventually rescued, the Patel family perished, their bodies discovered the next morning.</p>

<p>The incident highlights the growing issue of illegal immigration from India, driven by economic aspirations and facilitated by smuggling networks.</p>

<p>Satveer Chaudhary, a Minneapolis-based immigration attorney, notes that smugglers often target vulnerable individuals, charging exorbitant fees and exploiting their desperation.</p>

<p>As the trial of Patel and Shand begins, the focus shifts to the human cost of illegal immigration. The Patel family's tragic fate serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers and uncertainties faced by those seeking a better life.</p>

<p>Hemant Shah, an Indian-born businessman who organized a virtual prayer service for the Patels, lamented the greed that drove the smuggling operation, stating, "There was no humanity."</p>

<p>Donald Trump is poised to make a significant impact on immigration policies from day one of his presidency, with plans to unleash a flurry of executive actions aimed at bolstering immigration enforcement and dismantling key Biden-era legal entry programs. This sweeping effort will be spearheaded by Tom Homan, Trump's newly appointed "border czar," alongside other prominent Republican immigration hardliners.</p>

<p>As the global community grapples with the complexities of migration, the memory of the Patel family serves as a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating consequences of desperation and exploitation.<br />

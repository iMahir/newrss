       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lauded Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday for his "clear support" of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p>The two leaders met on the sidelines of the UN Summit of the Future to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and explore paths toward peace.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Zelensky expressed gratitude for the productive conversation.</p>

<p>"This is our third bilateral meeting this year. We are working together to strengthen cooperation across various fields," he said.</p>

<p>Highlighting the focus on bolstering interaction on international platforms, Zelensky wrote, "The main focus of our conversation was on enhancing our interaction on international platforms, particularly at the UN and G20, as well as implementing the Peace Formula and preparing for the second Peace Summit. We had a substantive discussion on the available opportunities."</p>

<p>"I am grateful for Prime Minister Modi's clear support of our sovereignty and territorial integrity," Zelensky wrote, stressing India's diplomatic stance on the conflict.</p>

<p>During their meeting, PM Modi reiterated India's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the war through diplomacy and dialogue.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Modi emphasized India's "clear, consistent, and constructive" approach, which prioritizes engagement between all stakeholders.</p>

<p>After the meeting, PM Modi shared a post on X, saying, "Met President Zelensky in New York. We are committed to implementing the outcomes of my visit to Ukraine last month to strengthen bilateral relations. Reiterated India's support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability."</p>

<p>This marked the third meeting between the leaders in just over three months. The two agreed to maintain close contact, as confirmed by the MEA.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Ukraine in August, the first by an Indian PM since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, underscored India's active engagement in promoting peace in the war-torn region.</p>

<p>Despite being seen as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, PM Modi has consistently advocated for a peaceful resolution, reaffirming India's position as a proponent of stability.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in New Zealand said Tuesday they have discovered a new species of "ghost shark", a type of fish that prowls the Pacific Ocean floor hunting prey more than a mile down.</p>

<p>The Australasian Narrow-nosed Spookfish was found living in the deep waters of Australia and New Zealand, according to scientists from Wellington-based National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).</p>

<p>The specimens were discovered during research in the Chatham Rise, an area of the Pacific which stretches around 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) east near New Zealand's South Island.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost sharks, or chimaeras, are related to sharks and rays, but are part of a group of fish whose skeletons are entirely made of cartilage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also known as spookfish, the ghost sharks have haunting black eyes and smooth, light brown, scale-free skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They feed off crustaceans at depths of up to 2,600 metres (8,530 feet) using their distinctive beak-like mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ghost sharks like this one are largely confined to the ocean floor," said research scientist Brit Finucci.</p>

<p>Finucci gave the new species its scientific name "Harriotta avia" in memory of her grandmother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Their habitat makes them hard to study and monitor, meaning we don't know a lot about their biology or threat status, but it makes discoveries like this even more exciting."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spookfish was previously thought to be part of a single globally distributed species until scientists discovered it is genetically and morphologically different to its cousins.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier, the British rock band officially announced the Asia dates for their highly anticipated <em>Music of the Spheres World Tour. </em>They are to hold three shows at DY Patil Sports Stadium in Mumbai on January 18, and 19, and a newly added performance on January 21, 2025. When ticket sales opened at noon on Sunday, fans flooded the BookMyShow website and app in hopes of snagging one of the 1.5 lakh available tickets, each concert accommodating 50,000 attendees. However, the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bookmyshow-site-crashes-seconds-before-sale-for-coldplay-mumbai-concert-begins-6622286">overwhelming traffic</a> led to a rapid sell-out, with all tickets disappearing within minutes.<br />
<br />
The <em>Music of the Spheres World Tour, </em>which began following the announcement on October 14, 2021, is being staged to promote Coldplay's ninth and tenth studio albums,<em> Music of the Spheres</em> (2021) and <em>Moon Music</em> (2024). The tour marks the band's return to live performances after the COVID-19 pandemic, as they previously did not tour their 2019 album, <em>Everyday Life,</em> due to environmental concerns.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing Co offered a 30% pay bump directly to striking workers, angering union leaders, as the embattled planemaker tries to overcome a debilitating strike that has shut down plants across the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>The proposal is an improvement over the initial 25% increase turned down earlier this month by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, but still less than the 40% initially sought by the union. Boeing said the terms are final and only valid until the end of September 27, ratcheting up pressure on workers to accept.</p>

<p>However, Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, said his negotiating team was blindsided by the offer and the union has no intention of putting it before rank-and-file members for a vote. Doing so on such short notice simply isn't feasible, he said in an interview.</p>

<p>"Setting up a vote for 33,000 people isn't just something you snap your fingers on," Holden said. Union leaders also want to talk to members about the offer, he said, adding: "We know already that it doesn't meet our members' needs."</p>

<p>The maneuvering has brought a harder edge to the pay negotiations. In a harsh statement posted online, IAM District 751 said that by skirting the collective bargaining process, "Boeing took it upon itself to disrespect our entire union."</p>

<p>The sparring injects new tension to talks that have been at a standstill since September 18, when two days of federal mediation yielded little progress. After workers voted almost unanimously to strike earlier this month, the local district said it intended to push for a substantially higher wage increase and for Boeing to reinstate a defined benefit pension plan for members.</p>

<p>The showdown between Boeing and workers at its main manufacturing hub is being closely watched by Wall Street and the White House as labor strife flares up in the US ahead of November's presidential election.</p>

<h2><strong>Strained Finances</strong></h2>

<p>Machinists also walked off the job on Monday at Textron Aviation, which makes Cessna Citation business jets, after rejecting a 26% contract offer over the weekend. And a potential strike by Longshoremen threatens to cripple US maritime shipping.</p>

<p>An extended walkout would worsen Boeing's already strained financial situation, after the company burned through more than $8 billion in cash in the first half as it slowed output to address quality lapses exposed by an aircraft accident in January.</p>

<p>"We heard your feedback," Boeing said in a post on its website touting the latest contract offer. "We've made significant improvements to provide more money in key areas."</p>

<p>The planemaker's shares jumped as much as 3.3% in New York. Boeing has tumbled 40% in value this year, the second-worst performance among members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>

<p>The conflict has shut down production of Boeing's cash-cow 737 Max and other jetliners, and could drain an additional $1.3 billion in cash from the company each month, according to Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies. As Boeing risks losing its investment-grade credit rating, the planemaker has begun to furlough workers and take other steps to preserve cash during the strike.</p>

<p>Senior managers, including new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg, have also agreed to take pay cuts for the duration of the furloughs.</p>

<p>The strike pits the financially ailing aerospace manufacturer against workers with a history of activism and an ax to grind with their employer. The Machinists are embittered by a 2014 agreement that cost them their pensions and locked in only modest wage increases while inflation soared earlier this decade.</p>

<h2><strong>War of Words</strong></h2>

<p>The company's latest offer includes reinstating an annual bonus that averaged around 3.7% of wages and was dropped from the initial agreement, a flash point that striking Machinists cited repeatedly in interviews. Boeing also doubled to $6,000 the bonus that workers would get if the latest deal is passed, and increased its contribution to a pension plan, which would be run by the company rather than the union.</p>

<p>Boeing has refused to meet since talks broke down last week, Holden said. The company did provide a brief overview of the latest terms Monday morning, but the two sides were still talking when Boeing went public with the offer, he said.</p>

<p>Holden said he tried again on Monday to get Boeing back to the negotiating table. "They said, 'No. The offer is the offer,'" he said.</p>

<p>As the war of words escalated, Boeing hit back with its own version of events.</p>

<p>"We have bargained in good faith with the IAM since formal negotiations began in March," Boeing said in an emailed statement late Monday. "After an unsuccessful federal mediation last week, we presented a best and final offer that made significant improvements and addresses feedback from the union and our employees. We first presented the offer to the union and then transparently shared the details with our employees."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Maky Zanganeh became a billionaire after shares of Summit Therapeutics, where she serves as co-CEO, soared following positive trial data for its promising cancer drug.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maky Zanganeh, co-CEO of Summit Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical oncology company, is now a billionaire. An Iranian immigrant, Ms Zanganeh's rise came after shares of Summit Therapeutics, under her leadership, surged 17-fold, pushing its market valuation to $17 billion, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/09/20/iranian-immigrant-becomes-billionaire-as-her-biotech-firms-stock-soars/">Forbes</a>.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old holds just under 5 per cent&nbsp;of the company's shares along with stock options. She is now worth an estimated $1.1 billion, one of only 34 self-made women billionaires in the US and one of just three in the healthcare sector.<br />
<br />
The 21-year-old company, with no approved drugs and just 130 employees, has recently caught the eye of investors due to its experimental lung cancer drug, ivonescimab. Data presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in San Diego showed the drug outperformed Merck's blockbuster Keytruda, generating massive investor interest. ‚ÄúThe big news was that we could beat Keytruda,‚Äù Ms Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Forbes.<br />
<br />
Summit's stock nearly doubled after the announcement, peaking at $31.93 on September 13 before settling at $23.16 by September 19.<br />
<br />
Ms Zangesh was born in Tehran, Iran, to architect parents. Her life was forever altered when the Shah of Iran was overthrown in 1979. The subsequent Iran-Iraq war intensified the uncertainty. ‚ÄúWe constantly had to face the fear of bombing,‚Äù she shared in her 2021 memoir, ‚ÄòThe Magic of Normal.' When Ms Zanganeh was about 11, a friend of her father in Germany arranged for her family to obtain German visas.<br />
<br />
After many flight cancellations due to airport closures in Tehran, they eventually fled to Germany via Austria. Settling in Oldenburg, a small town in northern Germany, she learned German while her parents returned to Iran. Ms Zanganeh stayed behind, living with a friend and then an uncle, to finish high school.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh's father, seeing both of her sisters in medical school in Strasbourg, France, encouraged her to follow suit. She mastered French and pursued dentistry at the University of Strasbourg, specialising in paediatric dentistry, and graduated in 1995. However, she remained unsure about pursuing a career in dentistry. In 1997, through an Iranian friend working for US robotic surgery company, Computer Motion, Ms Zanganeh became intrigued by the industry and took on a role as the company's European coordinator, while also earning an MBA from Schiller International University.<br />
<br />
She rose quickly, becoming Computer Motion's head of Europe and the Middle East, and later, its global vice president for training and education, which led her to Santa Barbara, California. When Intuitive Surgical acquired Computer Motion in 2003, Ms Zanganeh left the company to explore new opportunities.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh then found her true calling in biotech, eventually teaming up with fellow billionaire Robert Duggan to lead Summit Therapeutics.</p>

<p>Together, Mr Duggan and Ms Zanganeh are betting big on ivonescimab. Summit licenced the drug from Hong Kong-listed Akeso in 2022 for $500 million upfront, with the potential for an additional $4.5 billion in milestone payments.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh, diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 and now fully recovered, joined Summit's board later that year and was appointed co-CEO in September 2022, just months before securing the deal with Akeso.<br />
<br />
Ivonescimab's success is still in the early stages, with 20 clinical trials underway in China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli airstrikes killed at least 492 people in Lebanon, including 35 children on Monday. This marked the deadliest day of violence since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, which has now drawn in Hezbollah and escalated the conflict to its worst in nearly a year. Thousands of Lebanese families have been displaced, and the war shows no sign of abating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The conflict between the Iran-backed, Lebanon-based group and Israel is not new. The two share a bloodied history spanning over four decades.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Israel's 1982 Invasion and Hezbollah's Formation</strong></h2>

<p>The roots of Hezbollah's rise and its bloody conflict with Israel trace back to June 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon in response to attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) operating from the south. Israel's occupation reached the heart of Beirut, putting the PLO under siege and forcing its eventual withdrawal. However, Israel's continued presence, along with the atrocities committed by its allies, notably the Sabra and Shatila massacre, where 2,000 to 3,500 Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians were killed, sowed the seeds of resistance.</p>

<p>Among the groups that rose in response was Hezbollah, which was initially formed by Shia Muslim leaders with support from Iran. Representing the marginalised Shia population, Hezbollah quickly became a powerful militia, recruiting heavily from disaffected youth in Beirut's southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley.</p>

<h2><strong>1983-1985: Bloodshed and Resistance</strong></h2>

<p>Between 1982 and 1986, Hezbollah, or groups associated with it, were blamed for several attacks on foreign forces in Lebanon. The most significant of these was the October 1983 bombing of French and American military barracks in Beirut, killing over 300 peacekeepers. While claimed by the Islamic Jihad group, many believed Hezbollah was behind the attack.</p>

<p>By 1985, Hezbollah had grown in strength to force Israeli military to withdraw from much of southern Lebanon, though Israel maintained a "security zone" along the border, policed by its Christian-dominated proxy, the South Lebanon Army (SLA).</p>

<h2><strong>1992-1996: Hezbollah's Political Rise</strong></h2>

<p>Following the end of Lebanon's civil war in 1992, Hezbollah transitioned into a political player, winning eight seats in Lebanon's 128-member parliament. Over the years, its influence would only grow, both politically and militarily, especially as it provided extensive social services in Shia-dominated areas.</p>

<p>At the same time, its resistance against Israeli forces continued. In 1993, Israel launched "Operation Accountability" in retaliation for Hezbollah's attacks on northern Israel, leading to a brief but intense conflict that killed 118 Lebanese civilians. The violence escalated again in 1996 with "Operation Grapes of Wrath," as Israel attempted to push Hezbollah.</p>

<h2><strong>2000-2006: Israeli Withdrawal and the July War</strong></h2>

<p>In May 2000, Israel unilaterally withdrew from southern Lebanon after nearly two decades of occupation, a move largely attributed to Hezbollah's resistance. This victory solidified Hezbollah's status not just as a militia, but as a formidable political force within Lebanon and a symbol of Arab resistance against Israel.</p>

<p>In 2006, the simmering tensions boiled over when Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers, leading to the July War. The 34-day conflict resulted in heavy casualties: 1,200 Lebanese and 158 Israelis.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2009-2024: Regional Conflict&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>By 2009, Hezbollah was no longer just a militia or a resistance movement and had become the dominant military and political force in Lebanon. This power was further demonstrated during Syria's civil war. Starting in 2012, Hezbollah intervened on behalf of the Assad regime, a move that cost it some support among Arabs but solidified its alliance with Iran and bolstered its battlefield experience.</p>

<p>The Gaza war of 2023 drew Hezbollah back into direct confrontation with Israel. When Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel in October 2023, Hezbollah escalated the conflict, launching rocket attacks from Lebanon and suffering retaliatory strikes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passenger, on board a Brazilian flight, had to be handcuffed and strapped to her seat after she repeatedly screamed that the aircraft was on fire. The unidentified woman, who was reportedly drunk, caused panic among passengers when she started shouting that the Azul Airlines flight from Recife, Brazil, was doomed to crash.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In footage shared by the NY Post, flight attendants were seen rushing to calm the woman, who continued yelling and resisting their attempts to restrain her. Despite efforts to subdue her with handcuffs, the passenger swatted away at the staff and continued to scream about an imaginary fire. The situation escalated as she was eventually moved to the plane's galley, where crew members finally managed to hold her down.</p>

After the three-hour flight landed at Viracopos Airport, the unruly passenger was arrested by authorities, according to Brazilian media reports.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Azul Airlines later issued a statement confirming the incident, ‚ÄúAn undisciplined customer was immobilised during the journey, as she was a risk to the crew and other customers,‚Äù the airline said. ‚ÄúThis company follows the highest safety standards and regulations of national and international authorities. In addition, we periodically conduct training with staff at airports, including aircrews and pilots, in order to prepare them to deal with disruptive customers.‚Äù&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier, an EasyJet flight bound for Kos International Airport in Greece was forced to make an <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-easyjet-flight-forced-to-make-emergency-landing-after-drunk-passenger-causes-chaos-mid-air-6503079">unexpected emergency landing</a> at Munich International Airport after a reportedly intoxicated passenger sparked midair chaos. The trouble began two hours into the scheduled four-hour flight from London Gatwick Airport.</p>

<p>The traveller berated the Captain and sparked midair chaos, which led German police to escort him off the plane. Authorities took the passenger into custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, known for its involvement in sex trafficking, drug dealing, and human smuggling, has infiltrated New York City amidst a surge in migrants.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The feared Venezuelan criminal organisation, Tren de Aragua, which is known for its involvement in sex trafficking, human smuggling, and drug dealing, has infiltrated New York City, according to <em>The New York Post. </em>The influential surge of the gang coincides with an influx of migrants within the last two years.</p>

<p>The Tren de Aragua has not been around for long, but it is terrorising the inhabitants with armed members riding mopeds. They have had involvements in illegal gun sales, and the armed outfit even manages to function right under the noses of security guards at private shelters. The gang also runs prostitution rings in neighbourhoods most severely affected by the influx of migrants.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/23/us-news/how-tren-de-aragua-used-nyc-migrant-shelters-to-build-a-criminal-empire-hiding-in-plain-sight/"><em>NYPost </em></a>reported that the gang is also selling Tussi, or "pink cocaine," a deadly mixture of fentanyl, complicating the list of dangers from which they operate. Tren de Aragua's explosive growth tends to overwhelm not only ordinary New Yorkers but the police force of the city as well. The racket's actions appear to have diminished the safety of the residents, which is a vital challenge to the law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot every migrant is here to commit crimes; not every migrant is a gang member,‚Äù NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/23/us-news/how-tren-de-aragua-used-nyc-migrant-shelters-to-build-a-criminal-empire-hiding-in-plain-sight/"><em>The Post.</em></a> ‚ÄúBut these TDA guys hide very well in plain sight in the migrant community.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe aren't looking to grab the food delivery guy, but these guys go so far as to wear Uber Eats clothing and [use] the delivery bags while they're out there committing their crimes,‚Äù the chief told <em>The Post.</em> ‚ÄúWhen we do arrest them, they are very eager to talk about the crime they have committed.</p>

<p>The gang, whose name means ‚Äútrain from Aragua‚Äù (a state in north-central Venezuela) in Spanish, now runs citywide theft and robbery crews that have terrorised neighbourhoods.<br />
<br />
<strong>Police Emphasise That Venezuelan Gang Has Not Taken Control of the City</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, reacting to the popular narrative about gangs having "taken over" the city, Aurora Police Department Chief <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/aurora-police-deny-tren-de-aragua-gang-has-taken-over-city-presser">Todd Chamberlain has said</a>, "I can tell you right now, gangs are not in control of the city of Aurora. If you walk away with anything, that's what I will say. Are there gangs in the city of Aurora? Yes. There are. Are there gangs in most major cities throughout the United States? 100% there are."</p>

<p>"This is not an immigration issue. It's a crime issue," said chief Chamberlain during the press conference. "That is for the federal [government]. The immigration aspect is for the federal, it's for what they focus on. It's what they've done. It's what comes out of federal government. It comes out of the White House."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While some platforms offer users the choice to opt out of data sharing for AI training, it's important to note that publicly posted content can still be accessed by third parties.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several major social media platforms are using user data to enhance their artificial intelligence capabilities. OpenAI, for instance, has admitted to using copyrighted materials to develop ChatGPT. LinkedIn is another example, employing user resumes to refine its AI models. Even Snapchat has acknowledged using user selfies to personalize ads, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/tech/social-media-ai-data-opt-out/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>These platforms are leveraging a wealth of conversational data from social media posts, including slang and real-time events. However, many users may feel uncomfortable with their personal information being used to train these AI systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>David Ogiste, founder of Nobody's Cafe, expressed concerns about the lack of transparency regarding data usage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Right now, there is a lot of fear being created around AI, some of it well-founded and some based in science fiction, so it's on these platforms to be very open about how they will and won't use our data to help alleviate some of the reactions that this type of news brings - which for me, it doesn't feel like that has been done yet," Mr Ogiste told CNN. He emphasized the need for platforms to be more open about their practices and provide clear opt-out options.</p>

<p>While some platforms offer users the choice to opt out of data sharing for AI training, it's important to note that publicly posted content can still be accessed by third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Here's a breakdown of how major social media platforms handle user data for AI:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: Offers an opt-out option for AI training data, but previous training may have already occurred.</li>
	<li><strong>X (formerly Twitter):</strong> Requires users to opt-out if they don't want their posts used to train Grok.</li>
	<li><strong>Snapchat: </strong>Uses selfies for AI-generated ads but allows users to opt-out.</li>
	<li><strong>Reddit: </strong>Shares public user data with third parties for AI training, but private content is not shared.</li>
	<li><strong>Meta: </strong>Uses public Facebook and Instagram data for AI training, but private messages are not used.</li>
</ul>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund said it's looking forward to working with Sri Lanka's newly elected leftist president, including on the latest review of the country's $3 billion bailout package.</p>

<p>"We will discuss the timing of the third review of the IMF-supported program with the new administration as soon as practicable," the organization said in a statement after President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was sworn into office on Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We look forward to working together with President Dissanayake and his team towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery since entering one of its worst economic crises in 2022," the IMF added.</p>

<p>Dissanayake had campaigned on a promise to reopen negotiations with the IMF on the country's big loan program. It came with deeply unpopular tax hikes and spending cuts that made the cost-of-living crisis a top issue for voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reviewing the debt plan, though, risks delaying additional loans from the international organization. Sri Lanka needs to meet certain fiscal criteria before the next round of funding is released.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The country's former president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, brokered the deal with the IMF and said upending it would be a costly mistake for the economy. Prior to the cash injection, the country faced an unprecedented economic crisis where spiraling inflation wiped out household savings and ignited protests.</p>

<p>Investors hope that Dissanayake will stick with the loan plan. Rizvie Salih, an executive committee member of the president's coalition party, said Saturday that the country will remain with the program but seek modifications.</p>

<p>In its statement, the IMF said the recent agreement with bondholders "represents significant progress in Sri Lanka's debt restructuring process," adding that it's still "subject to confirmation on comparability of treatment by Sri Lanka's Official Creditors Committee."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telegram founder and chief executive Pavel Durov said Monday that the messaging platform had removed more "problematic content", weeks after his arrest in France on charges of failing to act against criminals using the app.</p>

<p>Telegram's search feature "has been abused by people who violated our terms of service to sell illegal goods", Durov told the 13 million subscribers of his personal messaging channel.</p>

<p>"Over the past few weeks" staff had combed through Telegram using artificial intelligence to ensure "all the problematic content we identified in Search is no longer accessible", he said.</p>

<p>Durov added that the platform had updated its terms of service and privacy policy to make clear that it would share infringers' details with authorities -- including internet IP addresses and phone numbers -- "in response to valid legal requests".</p>

<p>"We won't let bad actors jeopardise the integrity of our platform for almost a billion users," he said.</p>

<p>Durov was arrested on August 24 as he arrived at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on a private jet.</p>

<p>After days of questioning, he was charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist and terrorist content and released on a five-million-euro ($5.6 million) bail.</p>

<p>During the investigation he must remain in France and report to police twice a week.</p>

<p>Durov -- who holds Russian, French and United Arab Emirates passports -- initially criticised his arrest, but he has since announced steps appearing to bow to Paris's demands.</p>

<p>On September 6, he said Telegram would alter its "people nearby" feature to present users with "legitimate businesses" rather than "bots and scammers".</p>

<p>"This year we are committed to turn moderation on Telegram from an area of criticism into one of praise," he said at the time.</p>

<p>Durov, an enigmatic figure who rarely speaks in public, has a fortune estimated at $15.5 billion by Forbes magazine, but touts the virtues of an ascetic life that includes ice baths and not drinking alcohol or coffee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Taliban's decision to halt door-to-door polio vaccinations in Afghanistan has jeopardized the nation's fight against the disease.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major setback to the efforts to eliminate the highly infectious polio disease in Afghanistan, the Taliban leadership has called off a nationwide vaccination campaign. The unexpected decision was taken by the Taliban government only a few days before the campaign was about to start. With 18 confirmed cases this year (three times the number reported in 2023) Afghanistan is now at risk of a resurgence of the highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization warns that unvaccinated populations of children, especially in areas with expanding polio outbreaks, could undo years of global efforts to eradicate the virus.</p>

<p>"The reason behind the postponing of the polio campaign is the issues with the modality of implementation," the health official explained to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/17/taliban-curbs-women-risk-polio-outbreak-vaccination-campaign-health-officials-warn"><em>The Guardian </em></a>on condition of anonymity. "The leadership of the current government has ordered us to not conduct door-to-door campaigns."</p>

<p>Instead, the Taliban government wants to shift vaccination efforts to local mosques, with the expectation that families would bring their children to get doses.</p>

<p>"This is very bad news for the polio programme," the official said. "For the eradication to be successful, we need to cover more than 95% of the children with two doses of the vaccine.</p>

<p>"But without the door-to-door campaigns, we will not be able to reach [that target]. It puts the whole country at risk, even the region."</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/17/taliban-curbs-women-risk-polio-outbreak-vaccination-campaign-health-officials-warn"><em> The Guardian</em></a>, while the Taliban have banned women from working in various sectors, women in healthcare have largely been allowed to remain in their jobs.</p>

<p>However, the healthcare worker said: "Women in the southern region face restrictions from local authorities in participating in the programme, particularly in the rural areas."</p>

<p>The health official agreed. "Women have been crucial to the success of the door-to-door campaigns and raising awareness of the vaccines among mothers and families since, in a deeply conservative society, men would not be allowed into those spaces," they said.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unicef.org/afghanistan/polio-eradication">United Nations</a>, Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries in the world. In Afghanistan, despite continuous concerted efforts by the polio program to achieve polio-free status, the battle to finish the last mile has become a pivoting challenge, resulting in an increase in the number of polio cases during the last three years. Unfortunately, poliovirus is currently spreading to the provinces that have remained polio-free for a long time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The scientists predict that Thwaites Glacier and the Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within the next 200 years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists studying Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier, often referred to as the "Doomsday Glacier," have made a startling discovery. According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/20/climate/doomsday-glacier-thwaites-melt-sea-level-rise/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN</em></a>, researchers found that the glacier is melting increasingly rapidly and may be on an irreversible path to collapse, which could lead to catastrophic global sea level rise.</p>

<p>Their findings, detailed across a series of studies, offer the clearest understanding yet of this dynamic glacier. The outlook is dire, the scientists warned in a report published on Thursday, summarizing the key conclusions from their six years of research.</p>

<p>The team discovered that ice loss from Thwaites is expected to accelerate this century. Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey and a member of the research team, said, "Thwaites' retreat has significantly sped up over the last 30 years. Our findings suggest it is poised to retreat even more rapidly."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scientists predict that Thwaites Glacier and the Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within the next 200 years, with devastating consequences. Thwaites alone holds enough ice to raise sea levels by over 2 feet, but because it acts as a barrier holding back the Antarctic Ice Sheet, its collapse could eventually trigger a sea level rise of around 10 feet, threatening coastal cities from Miami and London to Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands.</p>

<p>Scientists have long understood that Thwaites, the size of Florida, was particularly vulnerable due to its geography. The land beneath the glacier slopes downward, exposing more ice to warmer ocean water as it melts. However, until recently, the exact mechanisms driving its retreat were poorly understood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Antarctica remains the largest unknown in forecasting future sea level rise," the scientists from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) said in a statement.</p>

<p>Over the past six years, researchers conducted a range of experiments to bring more clarity. One breakthrough came from Icefin, a torpedo-shaped robot sent to the glacier's grounding the point where the ice rises from the seabed and begins to float, a key area of vulnerability. Kiya Riverman, a glaciologist from the University of Portland, said the first images from Icefin approaching the grounding line were emotional for the team. "For glaciologists, this was like the moon landing," she said at a press conference. "It was a significant moment-we were seeing this critical area for the first time."</p>

<p>The images from Icefin revealed unexpected melting patterns, with warm ocean water flowing through deep cracks and forming "staircase" structures in the ice. Another study using satellite and GPS data showed that tides were pushing seawater more than six miles beneath Thwaites, accelerating the melting by forcing warm water under the ice.</p>

<p>In addition, researchers examined the glacier's history. A team led by Julia Wellner from the University of Houston analyzed marine sediment cores to reconstruct the glacier's past, finding that it began retreating rapidly in the 1940s, likely triggered by a strong El Nino event. "These findings give us a broader understanding of ice behaviour, providing more detail than what we can see from modern observations," Wellner told CNN.</p>

<p>Amid the alarming news, there was one piece of positive information. Scientists had feared that if Thwaites' ice shelves collapsed, it could expose towering cliffs of ice that would quickly crumble into the ocean, causing a chain reaction of collapse. However, computer models indicated that while this process is possible, it is less likely than previously thought.</p>

<p>Despite this, the overall outlook remains bleak. The scientists predict that Thwaites and the Antarctic Ice Sheet could be lost entirely by the 23rd century. Even with immediate action to curb fossil fuel use, which is not happening at the necessary pace, it may already be too late to prevent the glacier's collapse.</p>

<p>As this phase of the ITGC project concludes, researchers emphasize the need for further study to better understand this complex glacier and whether its retreat can still be halted. "Although we've made progress, there's still considerable uncertainty about what lies ahead," said Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine. "I'm deeply concerned that this region of Antarctica is already in the process of collapse."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A former partner of a co-defendant in a mass rape trial that has sparked horror and protests in France broke down in tears on Monday, telling the court she had "lived a lie" and might herself have been sexually assaulted.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former partner of a co-defendant in a mass rape trial that has sparked horror and protests in France broke down in tears on Monday, telling the court she had "lived a lie" and might herself have been sexually assaulted.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I was raped," Emilie O., told a criminal court in the southeastern French city of Avignon. "It's terrible, I will always have doubts."</p>

<p>Emilie O. is a former partner of Hugues M., one among dozens of men accused of participating in the mass rape of over a decade of Gisele Pelicot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gisele's then-husband Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging her into unconsciousness and inviting strangers into their home to rape her.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old has been on trial since the start of the month along with 50 other men aged between 26 and 74, many of whom have denied the accusations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emilie O. said she herself might have been drugged and sexually assaulted by Hugues M., her former companion.</p>

<p>"I was manipulated and lived a lie," said Emilie O., who had lived with the man for five years.</p>

<p>"I'm still questioning everything," she said without glancing at her former partner.</p>

<h3><strong>'I was stunned'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Recounting her story, Emilie O. broke down in tears as she looked at Gisele Pelicot, who smiled back at her in a show of support.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old said she had first met Hugues M. online and the two shared a passion for motorcycling. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>She described Hugues M. as a respectful and considerate man but added that he was repeatedly unfaithful to her. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Emilie O. said he told her he needed "adrenaline that he only found by riding a motorbike and engaging in sexual relations".</p>

<p>She began seeing her life with him in a different light when she learnt in 2021 of the charges against her former partner.</p>

<p>Her life was turned upside down when she received a call from the Avignon police.</p>

<p>"I was summoned and told that Hugues had raped a woman in October 2019, a few days before my birthday," she said.</p>

<p>"I didn't believe them, I was stunned, shocked. I asked to see the photo and then I realised that it wasn't a nightmare," she said.</p>

<p>Hugues M. has been prosecuted for "attempted rape", having failed to achieve penetration.</p>

<p>She began doubting their entire relationship and thinks she might have suffered the same treatment as Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>One night in 2019 she woke up to her partner attempting to penetrate her digitally, Emilie O. said. She launched a complaint, but it was dismissed for "lack of material evidence".</p>

<p>She also experienced "dizziness" between September 2019 and March 2020, but investigators did not detect any substances that might have affected her at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot has testified that for years she had strange memory lapses and other health problems and thought she might have had Alzheimer's.</p>

<h3><strong>Missed birth of daughter&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In addition to Hugues M., the court began examining evidence against five more defendants.</p>

<p>Among them was Joan K., the youngest of the 50 co-defendants who was 22 at the time of the alleged assaults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2019, he was absent for the birth of his own daughter on one of the occasions he is accused of sexually assaulting Gisele Pelicot, a profiler told the court.</p>

<p>He is suspected of having visited the couple's home in Mazan to rape Gisele Pelicot on two occasions.</p>

<p>Joan K. was in a relationship with a woman he met on the internet, but their time together was marked by "numerous" conflicts and "extramarital relations", the court heard.</p>

<p>At the time of their separation, Joan K.'s partner was pregnant.</p>

<p>Fellow defendant Andy R. testified that he went to the Pelicot home on December 31, 2018, but said he did not have "the intention of raping anyone".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like others in the dock, the 37-year-old said he thought it was "a sexual game" between the Pelicot couple -- a defence called into question by Dominique Pelicot's testimony.</p>

<p>Asked about whether Gisele Pelicot had consented, Andy R. replied: "As the husband had given me permission, for me she agreed to it."</p>

<p>The hearing will continue on Tuesday with the psychological examination of these six accused.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot has become an overnight feminist icon and received praise for demanding the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>At the weekend, a letter in support of Gisele Pelicot signed by more than 200 high-profile men was published in the French daily Liberation.</p>

<p>Thousands have joined protests in September in support of Gisele Pelicot and on Monday women's rights groups called for new demonstrations in support of survivors of sexual violence.</p>

<p>"The trial of the Mazan rapists has triggered unprecedented emotions," said 30 associations, demanding "strong action" from the new government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hours after Israeli strikes killed nearly 500 people in Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached out to the Lebanese people and asked them not to become "human shields" for the Hezbollah.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Israel's war is not with the Lebanese people, but with Hezbollah, which has been placing missiles in their homes, said Netanyahu in a video message shared online, and vowed to take out those weapons out to ensure the safety of Israelis.</li>
	<li>"I have a message for the people of Lebanon: Israel's war is not with you, it's with Hezbollah. For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage. Those rockets and missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens. To defend our people against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out those weapons," said the Israeli Prime Minister.</li>
	<li>Netanyahu said the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has warned the Lebanese people to get out of harms' way and that they must take it seriously. The Lebanese must not endanger their own lives for the Hezbollah cause, he urged.</li>
	<li>"Don't let Hezbollah endanger your lives and the lives of your loved ones. Don't let Hezbollah endanger Lebanon. Please, get out of harm's way now. Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes," said Netanyahu.</li>
	<li>The latest strikes come as the violence has shifted from Israel's southern frontier with Gaza to its northern border with Lebanon. Hezbollah, which runs Lebanon, has been exchanging fire with Israel in support of the Palestinian group Hamas since the war began.</li>
	<li>Called "Operation Northern Arrows" by the IDF, the Israeli strikes hit southern and eastern Lebanon. Beirut faced a "targeted strike" as well.</li>
	<li>The Hezbollah-led health ministry in Lebanon pegged the casualties at 492 until Monday night. These included 35 children and 58 women. At least 1,645 were wounded while thousands of families had been displaced, said Health Minister Firass Abiad.</li>
	<li>Yesterday's attacks - which marked the deadliest day of cross-border violence since the Gaza war began last year - were condemned by Arab states and other global powers. They have urged Israel and Hezbollah to step back from the brink of all-out war, though both defiant, refusing to leave a single inch for the other.</li>
	<li>Ahead of the attacks, Hezbollah said yesterday it was in a "new phase" of confrontation and that it had fired rockets at Israeli military sites in retaliation for earlier Israeli strikes. The commander of an elite Hezbollah unit was killed in one such attack on southern Beirut on Friday.</li>
	<li>The cross-border violence follows a deadly string of explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies across Lebanon, which Hezbollah has blamed on Israel. Those blasts last week killed at least 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook owner Meta Platforms is planning to announce this week that it has secured deals with actors including Judi Dench, Kristen Bell and John Cena to give voice to its Meta AI chatbot, a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters on Monday.</p>

<p>The new audio feature will offer users the option to select a voice for Meta's ChatGPT-like digital assistant from a list of five celebrities, who also include Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key, as well as several generic voice options, the person told Reuters.</p>

<p>The social media giant is set to announce the audio capabilities at its annual Connect conference, which starts on Wednesday, the person said.</p>

<p>Meta is also expected to unveil the first version of its augmented-reality glasses at Connect this year and to discuss its road map for other hardware devices like its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which last year became its first product to include an audio version of the Meta AI chatbot.</p>

<p>The celebrity voices will start launching in the U.S. and other English-speaking markets this week across Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, the source told Reuters.</p>

<p>Bloomberg first reported earlier this summer that Meta was in discussions with celebrities about using their voices for AI projects.</p>

<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a promotional video featuring Cena on Instagram last week, showing the two men and several others engaging in stunts while wearing the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p>

<p>Meta has been racing to push out generative artificial intelligence products to its billions of users, as it competes against Microsoft-backed ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Alphabet's Google to dominate the emerging technology. As part of that, the company has been adding capabilities to its chatbot and pushing to make it a more prominent part of the experience of using its apps.</p>

<p>OpenAI showed off a similar audio feature for its chatbot in May, but quickly ran into trouble when actor Scarlett Johansson accused the company of making it sound "eerily similar" to her even though she had declined to lend her voice to the project.</p>

<p>Meta's assistant is currently capable of engaging in text chats and generating images in response to user prompts. The company last year experimented with bringing star power to the project by launching text-based "character" versions of the chatbot inspired by celebrities like Paris Hilton and Snoop Dogg, although those never appeared to gain traction with users.</p>

<p>Meta has since shifted focus to an AI Studio product that enables content creators on its platforms to create chatbot versions of themselves.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's army chief vowed to back the country's interim government "come what may" to help it complete key reforms after the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina so that elections could be held within the next 18 months.</p>

<p>General Waker-uz-Zaman and his troops stood aside in early August amid raging student-led protests against Hasina, sealing the fate of the veteran politician who resigned after 15 years in power and fled to neighbouring India.</p>

<p>In a rare media interview, Zaman told Reuters at his office in the capital Dhaka on Monday that the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus had his full support and outlined a pathway to rid the military of political influence.</p>

<p>"I will stand beside him. Come what may. So that he can accomplish his mission," Zaman, bespectacled and dressed in military fatigues, said of Yunus.</p>

<p>The pioneer of the global microcredit movement, Yunus has promised to carry out essential reforms to the judiciary, police and financial institutions, paving the way to hold a free and fair election in the country of 170 million people.</p>

<p>Following the reforms, Zaman - who took over as the army chief only weeks before Hasina's ouster - said a transition to democracy should be made between a year and a year-and-a-half, but underlined the need for patience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If you ask me, then I will say that should be the time frame by which we should enter into a democratic process," he said.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's main two political parties, Hasina's Awami League and its bitter rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party, had both previously called for elections to be held within three months of the interim government taking office in August.</p>

<p>Yunus, the interim administration's chief adviser, and the army chief meet every week and have "very good relations", with the military supporting the government's efforts to stabilise the country after a period of turmoil, said Zaman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm sure that if we work together, there is no reason why we should fail," he said.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 people were killed in violent clashes that began as a movement against public sector job quotas in July but escalated into a wider anti-government uprising - the bloodiest period in the country's independent history.</p>

<p>Calm has returned to the teeming streets of Dhaka, a densely packed metropolis that was at the heart of the rebellion, but some parts of the civil service are not yet properly functional after the dramatic fall of Hasina's administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With much of Bangladesh's police, numbering around 190,000 personnel, still in disarray, the army has stepped up to carry out law and order duties nationwide.</p>

<h3><strong>PUNISHMENTS AND REFORMS</strong></h3>

<p>Born out of erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971 after a bloody independence war, Bangladesh came under military rule in 1975, following the assassination of its first prime minister, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina's father.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1990, the country's military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad was toppled in a popular uprising, leading to the restoration of democracy.</p>

<p>The military again staged a coup in 2007, backing a caretaker government that ruled until Hasina took power two years later.</p>

<p>A career infantry officer who served through these periods of turmoil, Zaman said that the Bangladesh Army that he leads would not intervene politically.</p>

<p>"I will not do anything which is detrimental to my organisation," he said, "I am a professional soldier. I would like to keep my army professional."</p>

<p>In line with sweeping government reforms proposed since Hasina was shunted from power, the army, too, is looking into allegations of wrongdoing by its personnel and has already punished some soldiers, Zaman said, without providing further details.</p>

<p>"If there is any serving member who is found guilty, of course I will take action," he said, adding that some military officials may have acted out of line while working at agencies directly controlled by the former prime minister or interior minister.</p>

<p>The interim government has formed a five-member commission, headed by a former high court judge, to investigate reports of up to 600 people who may have been forcibly "disappeared" by Bangladesh's security forces since 2009.</p>

<p>In the longer-term, however, Zaman wanted to distance the political establishment from the army, which has more than 130,000 personnel and is a major contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions.</p>

<p>"It can only happen if there is some balance of power between president and prime minister, where the armed forces can be placed directly under president," he said.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's armed forces currently come under the defence ministry, which is typically controlled by the prime minister, an arrangement that Zaman said a constitutional reform process under the interim government could potentially look to amend.</p>

<p>"The military as a whole must not be used for political purpose ever," he said. "A soldier must not indulge in politics."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday left for home after wrapping up his "successful and substantial" three-day visit to the US during which he attended the Quad Leaders' meeting, an overwhelming Indian community event and addressed the Summit of the Future at the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>He also held bilateral meetings on Sunday with his Japanese and Australian counterparts on the sidelines of the Quad Summit and exchanged views to deepen bilateral cooperation further for mutual benefits and the 'peace, stability, and prosperity' of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>"PM @narendramodi emplanes for New Delhi after concluding a successful and substantial visit to the USA," the Ministry of External Affairs said in a post on X.</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in the US on Friday and on Day 1, he attended the Quad Leaders' meeting in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

<p>Hosted by President Joe Biden, the Quad Leaders' Summit took place on Saturday in his hometown Wilmington, Delaware. It was attended by Prime Minister Modi, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan.</p>

<p>In a rare gesture, US President Biden also hosted PM Modi for a bilateral meeting in his home, and the Quad summit was held at the Archmere Academy in Wilmington.</p>

<p>During their meeting, US President Biden welcomed the progress made towards India sealing procurement of 31 long-endurance MQ-9B armed drones from American defence major General Atomics, as he and Prime Minister Modi vowed to boost reciprocal supply of military hardware between the two sides.</p>

<p>PM Modi also held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Australia and Japan on the sidelines of the summit.</p>

<p>Also,&nbsp;with the United States, a very special feature of the bilateral meeting was the return of 297 antiquities to India, a few of which were on display at President Biden's residence during the meeting.</p>

<p>At the Quad Leadership Summit and others associated with it, Prime Minister Modi underlined India's approach of cooperation, contact, and engagement for growth with a variety of partners in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>Also, during the summit, the leaders announced the Quad Cancer Moonshot, a groundbreaking partnership to save lives in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>India pledged USD 7.5 million to combat cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The Quad nations also announced a new regional Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI), to enable their partners in the region to maximise tools provided through Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) and other Quad partner initiatives to monitor and secure their waters, enforce their laws, and deter unlawful behaviour.</p>

<p>After wrapping up the Quad Leaders' meeting in Wilmington, PM Modi left on Saturday for New York for Day 2 to attend an Indian community event at Long Island and later address a key conclave at the United Nations on Day 3.</p>

<p>On Saturday, PM Modi addressed a mega gathering of Indian-Americans at the Nassau Coliseum in New York.</p>

<p>Terming India as a "land of opportunities", Prime Minister Modi told the gathering that he has set very ambitious goals for the country during his third term.</p>

<p>During the event, he also announced that India will open two new consulates in Boston and Los Angeles, meeting the long-pending demand of the fast-growing Indian American community in these two large American cities.</p>

<p>While Boston is considered the education and pharma capital of the US, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is hosting the next summer Olympics and current US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti is the city's former mayor.</p>

<p>The event was attended by more than 13,000 Indian-Americans. While the majority of them were from the New York and New Jersey area, Indian-Americans came in from 40 states, organisers said. Sixty charter buses were used for transportation purposes.</p>

<p>Applauding the role of Indian-Americans in strengthening the relationship between India and the US, he called them India's brand ambassadors.</p>

<p>After the event, Prime Minister Modi participated in a "fruitful" roundtable with the CEOs of leading American tech companies where he emphasised India's growth prospects and discussed initiatives to foster bilateral collaborations across various sectors.</p>

<p>The meeting took place at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel on Sunday during the second leg of Modi's three-day US visit. It saw the participation of CEOs of major US-based firms working on cutting-edge technologies such as AI, quantum computing and semiconductors.</p>

<p>He urged CEOs of US majors to take advantage of India's growth story as the country is making all efforts to become the third largest economy in the world in his third term.</p>

<p>On Day 3, Prime Minister Modi addressed the UN's Summit of the Future and said that the "success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not on the battlefield".</p>

<p>Addressing world leaders from the iconic podium of the UN General Assembly hall, Modi, beginning his speech with a "Namaskar", said he brings the voice of 1.4 billion Indians or one-sixth of humanity to the UN.</p>

<p>During the conclave, PM Modi assured the world community that India will continue to work in thought, words and deeds to protect the rights of all humanity and for global prosperity.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A mysterious 18th century necklace made from around 500 diamonds, some of which are believed to have been taken from a piece that contributed to Marie Antoinette's demise, will go on sale in November, Sotheby's said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mysterious 18th century necklace made from around 500 diamonds, some of which are believed to have been taken from a piece that contributed to Marie Antoinette's demise, will go on sale in November, Sotheby's said on Monday.</p>

<p>The piece, from a private Asian collection, will go under the hammer in Geneva on November 11, with online bidding opening on the auction house's website on October 25.</p>

<p>The necklace, which is composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, will make its first public appearance in 50 years on Monday, and is expected to fetch between $1.8 and $2.8 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful find because, normally, jewellery in the 18th century was broken up in order to be repurposed... so to have an intact piece of the Georgian period of this importance, this amount of carats... is absolutely fabulous," Andres White Correal, chairman of the Sotheby's jewelry department, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The jewel has passed from families to families. We can start at the early 20th century when it was part of the collection of the Marquesses of Anglesey," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of this aristocratic family are believed to have worn the jewel twice in public: once at the 1937 coronation of King George VI and once at his daughter Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond that, little is known of the necklace, including who designed it and for whom it was commissioned, although the auction house believes that such an impressive antique jewel could only have been created for a royal family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It probably would have been made during the decade preceding the French Revolution, it added.</p>

<p>It is thought that some of the diamonds may have come from the famous necklace linked to what became the scandal of the "Affair of the Necklace", which contributed to the advent of the French Revolution and eventually Marie-Antoinette's death, said Sotheby's.</p>

<p>The auction house said the diamonds are likely to have been sourced "from the legendary Golconda mines in India".</p>

<p>The diamonds from Golconda are still considered to be the purest and most dazzling ever mined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The necklace will be on public display in London until Wednesday before beginning a tour that will take it to Hong Kong, New York and Taiwan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

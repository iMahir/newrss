       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abortion rights are arguably the single-most important issue in the US ahead of the presidential election on November 5. It affects 50 per cent of the US population and is a matter of an individual's fundamental liberty, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.</p>

<p>During his term as President, Donald Trump reshaped the Supreme Court, which in 2022 left the states to decide their own abortion policies by overturning Roe vs Wade, the federal guarantee of abortion access - and thus dismantling five decades of precedent protecting abortion rights across the US.</p>

<p>Now, at least ten states in the US are holding referendums on the issue of abortion, and the questions on it will appear on the same ballots used to cast the vote to select the next US President.</p>

<p>This is the first US presidential election to be held after access to abortion was banned or restricted across much of the US following a landmark Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>The outcome could have profound implications, with the potential for restrictions affecting tens of millions of women to be overturned. Democrats also hope that the issue will mobilise a broader swath of the electorate in their favor.</p>

<p>In recent times, women in the US are being forced to cross state lines to terminate their life-threatening pregnancies. "This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect," Kamala Harris has said.</p>

<h2><strong>THE REFERENDUMS</strong></h2>

<p>According to the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."</p>

<p>With the referendums in November, each constitutional amendment will enshrine state-level reproductive rights, which were undermined by the US Supreme Court's 2022 ruling which led to restrictions on abortion access.</p>

<p>Among the states that have been affected by the US Supreme Court ruling which has made abortions restrictive, Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota are holding referendums.</p>

<p>As of now, the other states that are holding the vote on abortion rights are Colorado, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, and New York.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR THESE STATES</strong></h3>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>ARIZONA</strong> - In the state of Arizona, which is a crucial swing state, abortion is currently limited to 15 weeks of pregnancy. Democrats hope referendum would bolster their chances of winning this key battleground state. Proposition 139, which is all but sure to be adopted, would protect abortions until the point of fetal viability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>FLORIDA</strong> - This is the third-most populous state in the US. Currently abortion in the state is banned after six weeks of pregnancy. This is so short a period of time that women often know of their pregnancy only after this time. Voters will on November 5 choose whether to extend that time until the point of fetal viability, which is about 24 weeks of pregnancy. The proposed amendment must receive 60 per cent of the votes cast in order to pass. A recent poll indicated that 55 per cent of Floridians support it, and 20 per cent are "not sure."</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>MISSOURI</strong> - The midwestern state of Missouri has one of the strictest abortion bans in the United States, with no exceptions even for rape or incest. The referendum proposes to allow abortion until fetal viability in the traditionally Republican-leaning state.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>NEBRASKA</strong> - This is state, abortion is legal until 12 weeks. It is the only US state which will vote on two competing propositions. One would establish a "fundamental right" to abortion until fetal viability, while the other would ban it after the first trimester (13 weeks). The winning amendment will require 50 per cent of the vote, and more votes than the competing initiative.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>SOUTH DAKOTA</strong> - South Dakota has a similar abortion ban to Missouri, with the procedure allowed only to protect the life of a mother. Voters will now decide whether to reestablish the right to abortion during the first trimester.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>COLORADO</strong> - Colorado is among a handful of states where abortion is legal without a gestational limit. A citizen-led initiative now proposes to constitutionally protect the right to abortion in the Democratic-led state.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>MARYLAND</strong> - Maryland voters will decide whether to amend their constitution to enshrine the right to abortion until fetal viability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>MONTANA</strong> - Abortion is legal in Montana, traditionally a conservative state, until fetal viability, despite legal efforts to restrict access that have been blocked by judges. The proposed amendment would enshrine existing reproductive rights in the state's constitution.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>NEVADA</strong> - Voters in the western state of Nevada, where abortion is legal until fetal viability (24 weeks), will choose whether to enshrine the right in the state constitution.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - Lawmakers in New York have submitted an amendment to further bolster abortion access, which is already legal until fetal viability, by including anti-discrimination protections for reproductive healthcare.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air France said on Wednesday it had opened an internal investigation after one of its planes flew over Iraq on October 1 during an Iranian missile attack on Israel.</p>

<p>The company said flight AF662 from Paris to Dubai was travelling at the time of the attack through a special corridor used by all airlines in southern Iraq and fifteen minutes later it left the country's air space, which was not closed to airplane traffic until 1756 GMT.</p>

<p>"Without waiting for instructions from the Iraqi authorities, Air France has decided to suspend overflight of the country's airspace by its aircraft from 1700 GMT," the airline said.</p>

<p>"An internal investigation has been launched into this event," it added.</p>

<p>Air France also said that another flight returned to Paris, while a third, from Singapore to Paris, made an additional stop in Delhi to get more fuel to take a longer route.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media giant X was available to some Brazilian users on Wednesday, one day after the country's Supreme Court cleared billionaire Elon Musk's platform to resume service for complying with court rulings.</p>

<p>Brazil's telecommunications regulator, Anatel, said on Wednesday that it has begun ordering internet providers to allow users to access X again. Some users were already accessing the platform, and topics such as "we're back" were trending on Wednesday in Latin America's biggest country.</p>

<p>Yet some Brazilians were still not able to access X, previously know as Twitter, and Anatel said the time it takes for the platform to be unlocked would depend on the procedures taken by each internet provider.</p>

<p>Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who had been locked in a months-long feud with Musk, gave X the green light to resume operations in Latin America's largest country Tuesday afternoon, ordering Anatel to allow X to come back online within 24 hours.</p>

<p>In the decision, Moraes said X had met all the necessary requirements to start operating again in the country, after the platform reversed course and started complying with court rulings Musk had previously vowed to resist.</p>

<p>X had been suspended in Brazil, one of its largest and most-coveted markets, since late August after not complying with court orders related to hate speech moderation and failing to name a legal representative in the country, as required by law.</p>

<p>Brazil is X's sixth-biggest market globally and as of April had about 21.5 million users, according to data platform Statista.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Narendra Modi assumed office of India's Prime Minister in 2014, there was instability due to frequent changes in the leadership, former US President Donald Trump has said in an podcast called 'Flagrant' with comedians Andrew Schultz and Akash Singh.</p>

<p>The former US President lavished high praise on PM Modi and described him the nicest human being who can be tough when required.</p>

<p>"Before him they were replacing him (Indian PMs) every year, it was very unstable. He came along, he's great, he's a friend of mine. On the outside he looks like he's your father he's the nicest...," said Trump, who is seeking re-election as US President.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Former American President Donald Trump, in the Flagrant podcast, describes Prime Minister Modi as the nicest human being but also a total killer.<br />
<br />
He added that Modi took him by surprise with his threat of aggressive retaliation against Pakistan when he said we would handle them;… <a href="https://t.co/8oOH9ELvx3">pic.twitter.com/8oOH9ELvx3</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Trump also talked about the success of 'Howdy Modi' in Houston, Texas, in 2019 when he was the US President.</p>

<p>"They filled up the stadium, it was beautiful like 80,000 people, it was going crazy and we're walking around today....we were walking in the middle, waving to everybody," he said.</p>

<p>Trump also spoke about how PM Modi told him that India can deal with Islamabad after being offered US support.</p>

<p>"He is nicest human being but we had couple of occasions where somebody was threatening India. I said let me help, I am very good with those people (Trump imitating PM Modi) 'I will do it, I will do , I will do anything necessary. We have defeated them for 100s of years...," Trump said without naming Pakistan.</p>

<p>Trump also said he has very good relationship with PM Modi.</p>

<p>Trump spoke about his relationship with PM Modi around the 37-minute mark of 88 minute long interview.</p>

<p>'Howdy Modi' was an Indian community event in Houston, Texas in 2019. The event at NRG Stadium saw a huge crowd and showcased the relationship between the two countries. PM Modi and Trump addressed the gathering.</p>

<p>Trump has praised PM Modi earlier too and has described him a "fantastic man".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded on Wednesday to three scientists who have help unravel some of the enduring secrets of proteins, the building blocks of life.</p>

<p>While Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google's DeepMind lab used artificial intelligence techniques to predict the structure of proteins, biochemist David Baker managed to design totally new ones never seen in nature.</p>

<p>These breakthroughs are hoped to lead towards numerous advances, from discovering new drugs to enzymes that decompose pollutants.</p>

<p>Here is an explainer about the science behind the Nobel win.</p>

<p><strong>What are proteins?</strong></p>

<p>Proteins are molecules that serve as "the factories of everything that happens in our body," Davide Calebiro, a protein researcher at the UK's University of Birmingham, told AFP.</p>

<p>DNA provides the blueprint for every cell. Proteins then use this information to do the work of turning that cell into something specific -- such as a brain cell or a muscle cell.</p>

<p>Proteins are made up of 20 different kinds of amino acid. The sequence that these acids start out in determines what 3D structure they will twist and fold into.</p>

<p>American Chemical Society president Mary Carroll compared how this works to an old-fashioned telephone cord.</p>

<p>"So you could stretch out that telephone cord, and then you would just have a one-dimensional structure," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"Then it would spring back" into the 3D shape, she added.</p>

<p>So if chemists wanted to master proteins, they needed to understand how the 2D sequences turned into these 3D structures.</p>

<p>"Nature already provides tens of thousands of different proteins, but sometimes we want them to do something they do not yet know how to do," said French biochemist Sophie Sacquin-Mora.</p>

<p><strong>What did AI do?</strong></p>

<p>The work of previous Nobel winners had demonstrated that chemists should be able to look at amino acid sequences and predict the structure they would become.</p>

<p>But it was not so easy. Chemists struggled for 50 years -- there was even a biannual competition called the "Protein Olympics" where many failed the prediction test.</p>

<p>Enter Hassabis and Jumper. They trained their artificial intelligence model AlphaFold on all the known amino acid sequences and corresponding structures.</p>

<p>When given an unknown sequence, AlphaFold compares it with previous ones, gradually reconstructing the puzzle in three dimensions.</p>

<p>After the newer generation AlphaFold2 crushed the 2020 Protein Olympics, the organisers deemed the problem solved.</p>

<p>The model has now predicted the structure of almost all of the 200 million proteins known on Earth.</p>

<p><strong>What about the new proteins?</strong></p>

<p>US biochemist Baker started at the opposite end of the process.</p>

<p>First, he designed an entirely new protein structure never seen in nature.</p>

<p>Then, using a computer programme called Rosetta that he had developed, he was able to work out the amino acid sequence that it started out as.</p>

<p>To achieve this, Rosetta trawled through all the known protein structures, searching for short protein fragments similar to the structure it wanted to build.</p>

<p>Rosetta then tweaked them and proposed a sequence that could end up as the structure.</p>

<p><strong>What is all this for?</strong></p>

<p>Mastering such fundamental and important little machines as proteins could have a vast number of potential uses in the future.</p>

<p>"It allows us to better understand how life functions, including why some diseases develop, how antibiotic resistance occurs or why some microbes can decompose plastic," the Nobel website said.</p>

<p>Making all-new proteins could lead to new nanomaterials, targeted drugs and vaccines, or more climate-friendly chemicals, it added.</p>

<p>Asked to pick a favourite protein, Baker pointed to one he "designed during the pandemic that protects against the coronavirus".</p>

<p>"I've been very excited about the idea of a nasal spray of little design proteins that would protect against all possible pandemic viruses," he told the Nobel ceremony via videolink.</p>

<p>Calebiro emphasised how "transformative" this research would be.</p>

<p>"I think this is just the beginning of a completely new era."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke Wednesday with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said, as Israel weighs its response to last week's missile attack by Iran.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and the two leaders were expected to discuss Israeli plans for a retaliatory strike on Iran.</p>

<p>The call was the leaders' first known chat since August and coincided with a sharp escalation of Israel's conflict with both Iran and the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah with no sign of an imminent ceasefire to end the conflict with Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel's response to a missile attack last week that Tehran carried out in retaliation for Israel's military escalation in Lebanon. The Iranian attack ultimately killed no one in Israel and Washington called it ineffective.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has promised that arch-foe Iran will pay for its missile attack, while Tehran has said any retaliation would be met with vast destruction, raising fears of a wider war in the oil-producing region which could draw in the United States.</p>

<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Relations between Biden and Netanyahu have been tense, strained over the Israeli leader's handling of the war in Gaza and the conflict with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In "War," a book out next week, journalist Bob Woodward reports that Biden regularly accused Netanyahu of having no strategy, and shouted "Bibi, what the fuck?" at him in July, after Israeli strikes near Beirut and in Iran.</p>

<p>Asked about the book, one US official familiar with the two leaders' past interactions said Biden has used sharp, direct, unfiltered and colorful language both with and about Netanyahu while in office.</p>

<p>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant canceled a Wednesday visit to the Pentagon, the Pentagon said, as Israeli media reported Netanyahu wanted first to speak with Biden.</p>

<p>Tensions have increased in recent weeks as US officials were repeatedly blindsided by Israeli actions, according to a person familiar with the matter. These included Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members in Lebanon that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied carrying out.</p>

<p>Israel has also been slow to share details of its planning for retaliation against Iran's ballistic missile attack, the person said.</p>

<p><strong>ELECTION ISSUE</strong></p>

<p>Biden has been hit by sharp criticism from international partners as well as members of his own Democratic Party over his inability to use leverage, including the US role as Israel's chief arms supplier, to curb Netanyahu's attacks.</p>

<p>By extension, Kamala Harris, Biden's vice president and the Democrats' presidential candidate in the Nov 5 election, has been challenged to defend the administration's policy on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Many Arab American voters in Michigan, a key battleground state, are backing independent candidate Jill Stein instead, a move that could cost Democrats the state and perhaps the White House in a race with Republican former President Donald Trump that opinion polls show to be very tight.</p>

<p>Harris joined the call with Biden and Netanyahu, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliation is a key subject, with Washington hoping to weigh in on whether the response is appropriate, a separate person briefed on the discussions said.</p>

<p>Israel and Netanyahu in particular have faced widespread condemnation over the nearly 42,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza war, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, and the deaths of over 2,000 people in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel says it is defending itself after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, and from attacks by other militants including Hezbollah who support Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>IRAN OIL FIELDS</strong></p>

<p>Biden said last Friday he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields if he were in Israel's shoes, adding he thought Israel had not concluded how to respond to Iran. Last week, he also said he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

<p>Israel has faced calls by the United States and other allies to accept a ceasefire deal in Gaza and Lebanon but has said it will continue its military operations until Israelis are safe.</p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu were also expected to discuss the conflicts with Hamas in Gaza and with Hezbollah in Lebanon, along with other topics.</p>

<p>The United States has said it supports Israel going after Iran-backed targets like Hezbollah and Hamas.</p>

<p>About three million people in Gaza and Lebanon have been displaced by Israel's military campaigns, according to Palestinian and Lebanese officials, and Gaza is also facing a humanitarian crisis with a lack of food and fresh water. Israel has said some 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from northern Israel by Hezbollah attacks the past year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a direct connection between social media use and mental health, especially among teenagers, the US Surgeon General Vice Admiral Vivek Murthy told NDTV today. He said that his office had even issued an advisory in this regard, appealing for more focus on this very concerning issue.</p>

<p>The US Surgeon General is the doctor to all of the United States of America. The Surgeon General is consulted by the President of the US on all public health issues and health-related emergency matters. It is one of the topmost posts in the US and is responsible for America's overall healthcare system, new technology in the sector, and scientific advancement in medicine.</p>

<p>The current Surgeon General, Vice Admiral Vivek Murthy spoke exclusively to NDTV today on a range of issues, including a growing mental health crisis globally and how social media impacts it.</p>

<p>"There is a need to protect our children," the Surgeon General said, adding that it is a priority for him and his department to "make mental health the priority that it needs to be." He said that "Many countries are struggling with mental health crisis, with many cases of depression, anxiety, and sadly suicide."</p>

<h2><strong>'THE STIGMA'</strong></h2>

<p>Vice Admiral Murthy explained that his advisory aims to focus on the "stigma around mental health", which he says "makes it harder for patients to talk about it at home with their families, and makes their struggle harder because not often can they ask for the help they need."</p>

<p>As an increasing number of young adults are battling mental health issues globally, the top doctor of the United States said, "Fundamentally what we have to do is to see mental health for what it is - It is part of our overall health, and mental health is just as important to a person as their physical health is, and must be treated with the urgency and priority that it deserves."</p>

<h3><strong>'GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES, COMMUNITY OUTLOOK'</strong></h3>

<p>"Older generations are not always used to talking about mental health issues," the Surgeon General said, acknowledging that "different generations look at mental health differently, as do different communities."</p>

<p>"While older generations do not talk about it openly, the younger generations are far more open and sensitive to mental health challenges," he said.</p>

<p>Speaking about cultural views on mental health and the stigma attached to it, Vice Admiral Murthy said, "We see a lot of cultural differences when it comes to viewing mental health issues. My family is originally from India, and the Indian-American community which I grew up in, we never spoke about mental health issues. In fact, it was something that was seen as a source of shame."</p>

<p>Giving an example of his own experience of the stigmatisation of mental health challenges, he said, "I had an uncle who sadly lost his life to suicide. I remember the sense of shame around the family that something like this had happened. There was so much concern about telling other people what had happened because of what they would think about the family. That kind of stigma and the message it sends to both young and old people, is that these issues are just not okay to talk about."</p>

<p>"We need to change this. I aim for a day where we can talk about the mental health issues we face just as easily as we would about a sprained ankle or heart disease. We need to talk about it with the same amount of openness" he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'BUILDING BLOCKS OF A FULFILLING LIFE'</strong></h3>

<p>Young people are under tremendous pressure and stress of performing well in life, said the top doctor, and so, I asked a lot of young adults what success means to them, he added.</p>

<p>"We need to ask ourselves what we are doing to define success for young people in order to help them having a fulfilling life. When I spoke to young people in the US, many of them said they feel they are being asked to hustle behind a definition of success that is largely dependent on - 'How much money you make', 'How much fame you can acquire', and 'How much power can you attain' - And while there is nothing wrong in wanting to amass power, fortune and fame, if we feel that that is what is going to lead to long-term fulfilment, unfortunately life's experiences and challenges tends to make us feel the other way," he said.</p>

<p>"So, if we really want our children to be truly and deeply fulfilled, the thing we need to increasingly think about is - How can we help them build a life that is focussed on meaning, on purpose, on service, and on community - because these are the building blocks of fulfilment that we all ultimately want for our children," he explained.</p>

<h3><strong>THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT TO MANAGE STRESS</strong></h3>

<p>Delving on the issue of stress and the pressures faced by young individuals, Vice Admiral Murthy said, "We need to see and understand where the pressures being faced by our children are coming from. We also need to mitigate and manage them to make the environment that our children are growing up in much more hospitable and welcoming."</p>

<p>Explaining his statement, he added, "One of the things we know is that pressure is a lot easier to deal with - stress in general, is a lot easier to deal with when we have social support around us. Which is why the issues of loneliness and isolation being a broader epidemic is a serious problem in the US and increasingly across the world."</p>

<h3><strong>SUICIDE - THE DEEPEST PAIN, A GLOBAL EPIDEMIC</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about an ever-increasing suicide rate globally, the Surgeon General said, "Suicide is one of the most painful consequences of all of the broader mental health challenges we are facing today. The thought of losing your child to suicide is the deepest pain for any parent to deal with."</p>

<p>He further explained that "Suicide deaths have increased significantly across the world in the last two decades." This, he says, is due to several reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Loneliness has become a profound issue among children. It affects the entire population, but is hitting young people the hardest. It is now an epidemic across the world.</li>
	<li>The impact of violence and the fear of violence - Over 50 per cent children in the US now fear a school shooting.</li>
	<li>Negative news and mobile phones - Most children today carry or have access to smartphones that are constantly buzzing with negative and violent headlines which make them feel like their life and the future is bleak because nothing positive is happening around the world.</li>
	<li>Most of all, Technology and Social Media - Children are, on average, spending more than 3 hours a day on social media. By doing so, they face double the risk of depression and anxiety. It is one of the many reasons we have to address the harms of social media.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>'WE'VE FAILED AS A SOCIETY'</strong></h3>

<p>Social media algorithms are what make these platforms so addictive. These algorithms have a direct impact on the brain and the hormones secreted by it. But there are no laws to keep these algorithms in check. While even smoking or drinking have their own set of laws to not pose a risk to the public, social media firms have no such rules to bind them from using their algorithms indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Elaborating on the challenges faced in combating the harms of social media, the Surgeon General said, "For the last 20 years that social media has been around, we have broadly failed as a society to ensure that social media companies meet safety standards."</p>

<p>Giving the example of cars, Vice Admiral Murthy explained that "Cars have a basic level of safety and standards in place. These standards ensure that that brakes are working, the seat belts and the engine are in sound condition, the frame of the car is such it protects the occupants of the vehicle. But we do now have anything like that, especially in the US, when it comes to checks and balances for social media. There are no safety standards to protect children in particular from its harmful effects."</p>

<p>"The entire burden of checks and balances for social media are entirely on kids and parents. Not only is that unfair, but is ineffective, and we can see that from how it is manifesting today," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a mega boost for the Indian Navy and surveillance capabilities of the defence forces, the Cabinet Committee on Security has cleared the major deals for building two nuclear submarines indigenously and buying 31 Predator drones from the US.</p>

<p>As per the plans, the Indian Navy will get two nuclear-powered attack submarines which will help boost its capabilities manifold in the Indian Ocean Region, top sources told ANI.</p>

<p>The deal for building the two submarines at the Ship Building Centre in Vishakhapatnam will be around Rs 45,000 crore and will see a major involvement of private sector firms like Larsen and Toubro, they said.</p>

<p>The deal had been hanging fire for a long time and the Indian Navy had been pushing it as it was a critical requirement for filling the underwater capability gaps.</p>

<p>India has plans of having six such boats in the long run as part of its submarine induction plans.</p>

<p>These boats which are going to be built under the ambitious Project Advanced Technology Vessel project, are separate from the five nuclear submarines being built under the Arihant class at the same location.</p>

<p>The other mega deal cleared today by the Cabinet Committee on Security is for the acquisition of 31 Predator drones from American General Atomics under a Foreign Military Sales contract between the two governments.</p>

<p>The deal had to be cleared before October 31 as the validity of the American proposal was till that time and now it is going to be signed in the next few days only.</p>

<p>As per the contract, the defence forces will start getting the drones over four years after signing the deal, they said.</p>

<p>The Indian Navy will get 15 of the 31 drones while the Army and the Indian Air Force will get eight each and also deploy them together at two bases in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

<p>Indian equipment made by DRDO and private sector firm Solar Industries may be used as the Make in India element on the 31 drones which are expected to be game changers in peacetime surveillance.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 43-year-old woman in China is being praised online for her remarkable ability to climb cliffs exceeding 100 meters in height without safety gear. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, Luo Dengpin, who has earned the title of "Chinese Spider-Woman," is recognised as the world's only female practitioner of the ancient Miao tradition of bare-handed rock climbing. She is able to climb a 108-metre-high cliff, which is equivalent to a 30-storey building, and effortlessly move across vertical rock faces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/china-personalities/article/3281172/meet-china-spider-woman-who-scales-108-metre-cliff-without-safety-gear" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>, Ms Luo is currently the only female among the region's "spider people". She started rock climbing at the age of 15 under the guidance of her father. Initially, her motivation stemmed from a desire to compete with boys and earn a living by collecting medicinal herbs and gathering bird droppings from swallows' nests on cliffs, which served as fertiliser.</p>

<p>"They said this was only for boys, but I believe men and women are equal, so I learned. That is how my journey as a spider woman began," said Ms Luo, while speaking to the <em>BBC </em>in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Before this area was developed, I climbed every day to collect swallows' droppings. We would scale 108 metres. Foreigners were often frightened by our bare-handed climbing, but I grew accustomed to it. After doing it so many times, my hands became callused," she said in an interview with <em>Shandong TV.</em></p>

<p>Notably, Ms Luo's exceptional skill is rooted in the ancient Miao practice of cliff burials. The Miao people traditionally inhabit remote and mountainous regions. They believe that high-altitude burials allow the deceased to "look towards their ancestral homeland" in central China. Over time, they have continued to hone their bare-handed climbing skills, a tradition passed down through generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today's time, Ms Luo has transformed her skill into a form of entertainment for tourists. "Many visitors wanted to see how we gathered the herbs and paid us to demonstrate. My income isn't high, but I take pride in being a spider woman," she stated.</p>

<p>Ms Luo's story has inspired many on social media. "People in the past were truly capable of everything. Cliffs and steep mountains did not deter them from exploration," wrote one user. "Kudos to the brave spider woman. Women are just as capable as men, and true masters live among the people," said another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A four-year-old boy in China had to have his finger amputated after his father took him to a foot massage parlour to treat a fungal infection in his nail. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, the boy's father took him to the Luozhendong Foot Massage Parlour in Chongqing Municipality of China to treat an infection in his left index fingernail in July. The shop had claimed that it had a medicine called "nail removing cream," which they said could work wonders for the boy's problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the foot massage parlour, they applied the boy's infected fingernail and bound it up with an elastic bandage. The father paid the parlour 600 yuan ($86 or Rs over 7,000) for the treatment. However, after two days, the father found his son's finger had atrophied and turned black, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3280549/china-boy-4-has-finger-amputated-after-dad-takes-him-foot-spa-nail-infection" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The father then rushed his son to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed gangrene - a serious condition where a loss of blood supply causes body tissue to die. The doctors said that the boy's fingertip had to be amputated to avoid further infections. He was graded to have a 10th-class handicap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <em>SCMP</em>, the father has demanded more than 200,000 yuan ($29,000 or Rs 23 lakh) in compensation from the shop, which rejected his claim thinking it was too much. The father also reported the matter to the local district consumer council in February.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After an investigation, the consumer council found that the "nail removing cream" was not properly licenced. It also discovered that the cream only had sterilisation properties and was not able to cure anything. Moreover, the council found that the shop's name was different from that on their business licence.</p>

<p>The consumer council held the foot massage parlour responsible for the boy's handicap and urged it to suspend its business and give the boy's family 160,000 yuan ($23,000 or Rs 19 lakh).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the incident, the local government also reminded consumers to seek hospital treatment for health conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, users said the boy's father had been irresponsible. "What an irresponsible father, taking his son to a foot massage shop instead of a hospital to treat his disease," one person wrote.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leaders from Islamist group Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement discussed plans for cooperation after the war in Gaza in a new round of talks in Cairo on Wednesday, a Hamas official told Reuters.</p>

<p>The talks are the first since the two groups met in China in July and agreed steps to form a Palestinian unity government for Gaza and the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>They are also part of long-running and previously unsuccessful efforts to heal a schism that hardened when Hamas seized control of Gaza in a brief conflict with Fatah in 2007.</p>

<p>The Hamas delegation is led by Khalil Al-Hayya, the group's Qatar-based second-in-command and chief negotiator, Hamas media official Taher Al-Nono said.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official said the Fatah delegation was led by Fatah's second-in-command, Mahmoud Al-Aloul. There was no immediate comment from Fatah.</p>

<p>"The meeting will discuss the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, and the challenges facing the Palestinian cause," Nono said.</p>

<p>The issue of the administration of Gaza after the end of the year-old Israel-Hamas war is one of the thorniest issues facing the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Israel, which began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli communities on October 7, 2023, has ruled out the group's inclusion in a post-war administration.</p>

<p>It says it also does not trust the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority, which partially governs the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to do the job.</p>

<p>The Palestinian factions say their post-war plans are an internal affair, and reject Israeli conditions.</p>

<p><strong>BORDER CROSSINGS</strong></p>

<p>A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said that if no unity government was agreed the groups might try to form a committee to run Gaza and help manage its border crossings.</p>

<p>The shape and exact responsibilities of the proposed committee remained unclear, said the official, who asked not to be named.</p>

<p>Egyptian security officials said Egypt was urging both sides to agree on a mechanism to manage the crossing on its border with Gaza, closed since May.</p>

<p>Cairo says a Palestinian presence must be reestablished at the border. It has been discussing plans for the border with the United States, alongside wider ceasefire negotiations that have now stalled.</p>

<p>Before May, Rafah was the only Gaza crossing not directly controlled by Israel. It had become an important entry point for humanitarian aid and an exit for medical evacuees.</p>

<p>It was previously a gateway to the outside world for Gaza's 2.3 million residents although Egypt and Israel tightly controlled movement through it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former employees at one of China's best-known comic studios recently exposed the harsh working conditions at the workplace, where they have lived together in a "farm-like" flat for years, facing overwork and sleep deprivation. A-soul is one of China's most renowned manga studios. It is situated in a rural area of southeastern Beijing and it currently employs more than 70 staff members. In recent months, several comic artists have come forward, accusing the studio of poor working conditions, claiming that they were overworked, sleep-deprived and verbally abused, the <em>South China Morning Post</em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In mid-September, a former A-soul employee, known online as Zhenliubao, took to the Chinese social media platform Weibo, accusing the studio of "shattering" his dream. The ex-worker reportedly claimed that since 2008, dozens of comic artists have lived in dormitories converted from a livestock factory, sharing communal spaces and using unisex bathrooms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We were never allowed to open the curtains, forcing us to work in a dark environment for years," he wrote, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3281168/slave-factory-china-comic-artists-expose-farm-working-conditions-famed-studio" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former employee added that the boss insisted on being called "brother" and prohibited them from reading books or seeking medical treatment when they were unwell. He also alleged that employees were manually controlled through verbal abuse and indoctrination, keeping them in a state of constant overwork. The salaries were also split equally and no social security benefits were provided, he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his online post, Zhenliubao revealed that the studio head is Liu Zhi. He mentioned seeking legal assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another former employee, identified as Laogui, also reported being overworked and sleep-deprived. He reportedly claimed that he was often forced to draw 12 to 14 pages a day instead of the usual four to six pages. "I have gone grey in my twenties and face immense mental pressure daily," he wrote in his online post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as soon as the controversy surrounding A-soul studio went viral on social media, current A-soul employee Liu Ke, who was ranked ninth on the 2013 China Comic Artists' Rich List, released a statement supporting the studio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The artist claimed that the poor working conditions were a result of the studio being "extremely poor" at that time. He also claimed that before the studio was formally registered, he and other employees "voluntarily" pooled their salaries to keep the team afloat. He also denied the accusations of forced labour, per <em>SCMP</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A-soul is a family of ambitious comic artists built from scratch. Creating a utopia requires the spirit of sacrifice," Mr Liu asserted.</p>

<p>The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election is being keenly watched around the world, both for the outcome and for the consequences. One month out, the polls suggest a virtual tie. Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, had seen an increase in popularity after donning her party's official nomination in August. But over the past two weeks, a series of events - a devastating hurricane in North Carolina, growing tensions in the Middle East, the Vice Presidential debate, and concerns about recurring inflation - appear to be shifting the momentum back toward former President Donald Trump. Much could still happen over the next month, but ultimately, the outcome will be determined by seven 'swing states' - Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and Wisconsin - and each could be decided by only a few tens of thousands of voters. Although Democrats are likely to win more votes overall (as they have in seven of the last eight presidential elections), their ability to ensure higher voter turnout among their supporters in these swing states may well turn out to be the decisive factor.</p>

<h2><strong>Impressions Over Issues</strong></h2>

<p>This election campaign is being waged less on issues and more on impressions and attitudes. Trump is playing on dissatisfaction with the bureaucratic state, a scepticism of international entanglements, lower taxes for businesses and investors, curbs on immigration, and social conservatism, although he has attempted to dilute the latter to appeal more to moderate voters. Harris has positioned herself as appealing to youth, urban voters, ethnic minorities, responsible governance, and progressive social causes. Their competing worldviews reflect a rigid divide in American society across age and class lines, ethnic groups, and especially urban and rural constituencies, across which Republicans and Democrats have consolidated deeply entrenched if 'big tent' coalitions. Suburban voters, white women, second-generation Hispanics, and union workers are among the constituencies in which Republicans and Democrats are still battling to sway opinion.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The 2024 US presidential election outcome will matter to India, although less directly perhaps than it will to some other countries and regions. For US adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea) the election will determine negotiations over future relations. For US allies (NATO members in Europe, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia), the election could signal changes to US force posture, assistance, and commitment. For those actively involved in current or prospective conflicts (Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan), the outcome will determine the nature of US military aid. And for major trade partners (Mexico, ASEAN, the UK), the election could have deep ramifications for their economies.</p>

<h2><strong>India Will Be Affected, But Not Directly</strong></h2>

<p>India is less directly affected than many of these countries, not being an adversary, a treaty ally, or a country dependent on military or financial assistance from the United States. To be sure, India is the United States' ninth-largest trade partner and enjoys about a $30 billion trade surplus, but its economy is, at present, less dependent on manufacturing exports than some other large emerging markets, such as Mexico or Vietnam. While the direct implications for India might be less than for others, the 2024 US presidential election will undoubtedly have indirect effects on India.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Should Trump be elected, India will have to confront some difficult negotiations over trade and immigration. Trump and his economic advisors have been clear that they will impose tariffs on countries they believe are engaging in unfair trade practices, especially China. But India, which enjoys a trade surplus, will also be subjected to some, resulting in retaliatory measures by New Delhi. Questions remain about the degree to which a second Trump administration can refashion trade policy without negative repercussions for the US economy - particularly for inflation. Moreover, Trump's advisors have pledged to stem immigration, especially by undocumented individuals, which may affect Indians too. Trump is also likely to impose restrictions on employment and student visas and cut funding for processing, contributing further to backlogs and delays. This will have implications for a variety of Indian businesses in the United States.</p>

<h2><strong>China Is Still The Big Question</strong></h2>

<p>For both Trump and Harris, whose views on foreign policy are still inchoate beyond a broad continuation of incumbent Joe Biden's approach, a primary determinant of their outlook will be their policy towards China. While Trump's national security, foreign policy, and trade advisors are overwhelmingly hawkish on China - suggesting a confrontational and competitive approach - some of his donors and financial associates have advocated for a more cooperative attitude and a cooling of US tensions with Beijing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harris has to contend both with hardening national security and trade impulses, as also with a progressive agenda among some Democrats that seeks to disassociate the United States from international competition and conflict. Progressives - as well as veterans of the Obama administration who hope to return to influence under Harris - are also more likely to prioritise human rights over a balance of power in foreign policy.</p>

<h2><strong>A Lot Would Depend On The Supporting Casts</strong></h2>

<p>Ultimately, both Trump and Harris's approaches to China - and, by extension, international affairs - will be determined by their selection, as President, of key advisors. The main Cabinet-level positions - U.S. Secretary of State, Defense, and Treasury, National Security Adviser, and U.S. Trade Representative - as well as second- and third-level political appointees will have an opportunity to set the tone for U.S. foreign policy for the next four years. Around Trump, figures such as Robert O'Brien and Robert Lighthizer are expected to play critical roles. The composition of a Harris foreign policy team is more uncertain, but it will likely be drawn from both Biden and Obama-era officials. Both Harris and Trump may also bring into their cabinets senior U.S. Senators, although that will be determined by margins in the Senate after this November's election.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons, developments of the next month - and the transition period between November's election and the next president's inauguration in January - will be observed carefully, in India and around the world.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple in Malaysia is being praised online for gifting Apple iPhones to their two domestic helpers. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, the couple, identified as Jeff Leong and his wife Inthira Kalanjiam, gifted brand-new iPhones to their two maids to thank them for their dedicated service over the years. The pair, who share their daily life and travel experiences on their YouTube channel Jeff &amp; Inthira, released a video of them surprising their two maids with the new phones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3280511/malaysia-couple-win-online-praise-gifting-domestic-workers-iphones-years-service" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Post</em></a>, the family employs two Indonesian domestic helpers, Sri and Neneng, who have been with them for two years. They handle household chores, cook, and care for the couple's young children. "We give the latest Iphone 16 as a surprise to the maid at home! Their reaction?!" the couple titled the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Of68eMxyOo">YouTube video</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple's daughter Xixi also joined in on the surprise. In the video, both helpers squeal with excitement. "This is unbelievable! Thank you so much, madam and sir," one of the maids exclaims. The couple then express their gratitude saying, "You are no longer just the domestic helpers, you have become a part of our family".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>SCMP</em>, Ms Kalanjiam said some domestic workers in Malaysia are not allowed to own phones to prevent them from running away. She said that her domestic helpers are free to cook for themselves at home and have plenty of leisure time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Everyone deserves to be treated equally, no matter their job. My helpers are parents too, working hard to support their children, there is no reason to be unkind to them," Ms Kalanjiam told the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Many middle-class employers face a lot of stress from work and may unintentionally take it out on their helpers. Treat them well, and they'll give back, kindness goes both ways," Mr Leong added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, the couple's gesture has been praised. "I was almost moved to tears along with the maids. Thumbs ups for this kind and compassionate couple!" commented one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Not everyone is lucky enough to have employers like Leong and Kalanjiam. Most are disrespected and overworked, which is heartbreaking," said another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With just four weeks before the November 5 presidential election, the battle for Erie County - a historically must-win county in a must-win state - demonstrates the urgency of identifying and contacting individual voters.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The command center for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign in one of the most hotly contested counties in the most important election battleground state of Pennsylvania sits in a small room of a strip-mall office rented by Erie County's Republican Party.</p>

<p>The otherwise sleepy office comes to life a couple times a week when the two-person staff hosts the volunteer network the campaign calls Trump Force 47.</p>

<p>A few miles away in a bustling office in downtown Erie, paid staff and volunteers on Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign make phone calls, press new campaign buttons and organize watch parties and phone banking. A chalkboard keeps score of door-knocking: 12,000 households so far toward a goal of 20,000, or nearly one of five in the county.</p>

<p>With just four weeks before the November 5 presidential election, the battle for Erie County - a historically must-win county in a must-win state - demonstrates the urgency of identifying and contacting individual voters in a campaign that remains stubbornly close, according to campaign staff and volunteers for both campaigns.</p>

<p>While the Harris campaign is using its sizable cash advantage and newfound enthusiasm to build a towering ground-game operation aimed at mobilizing supporters and identifying new voters, the Trump campaign is focused on infrequent voters and betting on a voter registration drive that has cut into the traditional Democratic advantage.</p>

<p>Harris and the Democratic Party raised $361 million in August compared to Trump and the Republicans' $130 million, and she spent nearly three times as much as her opponent that month, federal financial disclosures show.</p>

<p>Reuters interviewed some 40 supporters, campaign staff, volunteers and voters who said that Harris' ground game advantage could test whether brick and mortar campaigns still prove useful in campaigns that are defined by viral moments, influencers and social media ad wars.</p>

<p>"Trump and his team appear to be banking on the power of his personal pull," said Chris Borick, a pollster and political science professor at Pennsylvania's Muhlenberg College.</p>

<p>"Harris and the Democrats are investing deeply in a more traditional ground game here and thus this election will be a test of dramatically different strategies."</p>

<p>The volunteers and voters also described rising tensions as the campaigns dump millions of dollars on divisive digital and television ads, robo calls, text messages and door-knocking.</p>

<p>"I've been pretty bombarded with mail, phone calls and texts," said Erin Miller, 38, a bartender and mother of six who recently moved to the state from Colorado and has yet to vote locally in a presidential election, making her a prime target for the campaigns.</p>

<p>With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states that will decide the election.</p>

<p>Erie County, a blue-collar region with 177,000 registered voters, has voted with the winning presidential candidate for the last four elections.</p>

<p>Biden won Erie County in 2020 by less than 1,500 votes, or 1.03 percentage points, an even closer margin than his 1.2 percentage point win in Pennsylvania overall. In 2016, Trump won Erie County over Hillary Clinton by fewer than 2,000 votes.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign and the Democratic Party have three offices in Erie County and eight paid staff along with more than 300 volunteers.</p>

<p>"It's the bellwether part of it. It's the mere fact that this particular city, in this particular state, could ultimately decide who's president and they know it," said Marie Troyer, 60, a retired teacher who got a job on the campaign answering phones and managing volunteers.</p>

<p><strong>BOOTS ON THE GROUND</strong></p>

<p>Despite the ground game advantage, the Harris campaign has found it hard work to mobilize Black voters who make up about 16% of the city's population, especially Black men, according to Reuters interviews.</p>

<p>Howard Pratchett, 48, a barber, said he plans to vote for Trump because he is more "factual" than Harris. "We don't care about LBGT rights. We don't care about, you know, abortion rights. We're not worried about that. They don't offer anything to the straight Black male voters," Pratchett said.</p>

<p>Monty Davis, 51, who runs a local youth program, said he appreciates President Joe Biden's efforts to lower costs and plans to vote for Harris. But he warned the energy among the Black community is not as high as it was with Presidents Barack Obama or Biden.</p>

<p>"It's just not that intense," Davis said.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign's two paid staffers in Erie also oversee two other counties, according to Erie County Republican Chairman Tom Eddy.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign and local Republicans declined to say how many volunteers they have in the county, but local officials conceded they have fewer than the Democrats.</p>

<p>As in other battleground states, the Trump camp is relying on deep-pocketed outside groups - like billionaire Elon Musk's America PAC - and a much looser network of supporters and volunteers to mobilize voters.</p>

<p>Since 2015, when Trump emerged as a leader in Republican politics, Republicans and outside groups have significantly narrowed the Democratic advantage in voting registrations in Erie and in Pennsylvania overall.</p>

<p>In 2015, Democrats enjoyed a roughly 33,000 voter registration advantage in Erie County, but that has been whittled down to 10,000, according to current county election records.</p>

<p>Statewide, Democrats have a roughly 338,400 voter registration advantage over Republicans, down from the commanding 892,624 advantage Democrats held in 2016, state voter data shows.</p>

<p>Sam Talerico, the county's Democratic chairman, conceded the Republican surge in registrations is unwelcome news.</p>

<p>"We certainly don't like to see those registration numbers converge, but that's the bad news. The good news is, you know, I still think we have an advantage with independents turning our way, and that's making a difference," he said.</p>

<p>Republicans also are banking on Trump's frequent visits - five rallies over three campaigns in Erie, including two visits this election. The rallies represent mobilizing opportunities as organizers register voters and collect cell phone numbers and email information.</p>

<p>Harris will make her first visit to Erie on October 14. Her running mate Tim Walz visited in September.</p>

<p>And then there's Trump Force 47, the volunteer network that knocks on the doors of infrequent voters to determine whether they plan to vote, and for whom. Volunteers win awards, such as hats and sweaters, for knocking on more doors.</p>

<p>"We are not trying to persuade anyone. It's more just that the campaign is trying to make sure that people who are already inclined to vote for Trump get out and vote," said volunteer Justin Berkheimer, 39, who works at a group home for people with mental disabilities.</p>

<p><strong>A HEATED CAMPAIGN</strong></p>

<p>For both campaigns the intensity of the fight for Erie has spilled over into threats, antagonism and uncomfortable conversations, volunteers said.</p>

<p>A half-dozen die-hard Trump fans told Reuters they are uncomfortable being seen as public supporters of the former president.</p>

<p>That's a departure from 2016 when Erie was flooded with Trump signs, according to local officials and volunteers.</p>

<p>Patrick Fuller, 50, a credit union employee who said he has knocked on more than 2,000 doors for Trump this election, said he leaves his red MAGA hat at home to avoid confrontation.</p>

<p>"A lot of people are afraid to get involved, because they are afraid that somebody will swear at them or threaten them," Fuller said.</p>

<p>Other volunteers said they had their cars spit on for displaying Trump bumper stickers.</p>

<p>County Democrats said they ran into tensions when they pushed into rural areas, opening up a satellite office in a part of the county that Trump won with 72% of the vote in 2020.</p>

<p>Volunteer Kelly Chelton, 62, described a man lunging at a volunteer because he was angry about the large wooden sign reading: "Christians Against Trump."</p>

<p>"He came in looking for a fight," Chelton said. "He asked how do you know that Trump isn't Christian." She added: "He was just screaming and yelling."</p>

<p>The county party later installed video security cameras, Chelton said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Wednesday convicted in absentia a former US Marine who fought for Ukraine after spending over two years in a Russian prison before being released in a swap.</p>

<p>Trevor Reed "voluntarily joined the Ukrainian army as a mercenary on July 25, 2023", Russia's investigative committee said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The court has sentenced him to 14 years and six months," it said.</p>

<p>Reed was a Texas university student in 2019 when he travelled to Russia with his Russian girlfriend.</p>

<p>He was arrested for assaulting law enforcement officers after getting drunk, and was sentenced to nine years in prison.</p>

<p>He was released in April 2022 after the White House <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-us-marine-in-russia-russia-swaps-ex-us-marine-trevor-reed-for-russian-pilot-jailed-in-us-2925553" target="_blank">negotiated an exchange</a> for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot and drug smuggler sentenced to 20 years in prison by an American court.</p>

<p>On July 26, 2023, the US State Department said Reed had been wounded during fighting in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia's Investigative Committee said he had been fighting in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>On Monday, a Russian court sentenced a 72-year-old US citizen accused of fighting as a mercenary on the side of Ukraine to nearly seven years in prison.</p>

<p>Stephen Hubbard had been in custody for more than two years and was sentenced after a trial held behind closed doors.</p>

<p>Several Westerners, including Americans, are currently imprisoned in Russia.</p>

<p>Among them is <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/guilty-of-high-treason-russia-jails-us-origin-ballet-dancer-for-12-years-6343633" target="_blank">Ksenia Karelina</a>, a US-Russian national sentenced to 12 years in prison in August for donating around $50 to a Ukrainian organisation.</p>

<p>Washington accuses Moscow of imprisoning US nationals to ensure the liberation of Russian agents held abroad in prisoner exchanges.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the award-giving body said on Wednesday, for their work on the structure of proteins.</p>

<p>The prize, widely regarded as among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).</p>

<p>"One of the discoveries being recognised this year concerns the construction of spectacular proteins. The other is about fulfilling a 50-year-old dream: predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences," the academy said in a statement.</p>

<p>Half the prize was awarded to Baker "for computational protein design" while the other half was shared by Hassabis and Jumper "for protein structure prediction", the academy said.</p>

<p>The third award to be handed out every year, the chemistry prize follows those for medicine and physics announced earlier this week.</p>

<p>The Nobel prizes were established in the will of dynamite inventor and wealthy businessman Alfred Nobel and are awarded to "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind".</p>

<p>First handed out in 1901, 15 years after Nobel's death, it is awarded for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace. Recipients in each category share the prize sum that has been adjusted over the years.</p>

<p>The economics prize is a later addition funded by the Swedish central bank.</p>

<p>Chemistry, close to Alfred Nobel's heart and the discipline most applicable to his own work as an inventor, may not always be the most headline-grabbing of the prizes, but past recipients include scientific greats such as radioactivity pioneers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie.</p>

<p>Last year's chemistry award went to Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Aleksey Ekimov for their discovery of tiny clusters of atoms known as quantum dots, widely used today to create colours in flat screens, light emitting diode (LED) lamps and devices that help surgeons see blood vessels in tumours.</p>

<p>Alongside the cash prize, the winners will be presented a medal by the Swedish king on Dec. 10, followed by a lavish banquet in Stockholm city hall.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian developer Peter Todd is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. No, we aren't saying it. It's award-winning filmmaker Cullen Hoback, who pieced together old and new evidence and confronted both Todd and Blockstream founder Adam Back, another suspect, with his findings. All this in a new HBO documentary titled "Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery".</p>

<p>In a climactic moment of the documentary, Hoback asks Todd, “It seems like you had these deep insights into Bitcoin at the time?” Todd responds, “Well, yeah, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in an email to CoinDesk before the documentary's release, Todd claimed, “Of course I'm not Satoshi.” He also told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/08/investing/satoshi-nakamoto-identity/index.html">CNN</a>, “For the record, I'm not Satoshi,” adding the film has been “irresponsible” and could endanger his life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has long been shrouded in mystery, fuelling countless theories and speculation.</p>

<p>Cullen Hoback remains confident in his theory, citing a 2010 Bitcoin message board post from Todd that he believes was written by Satoshi Nakamoto. The director spent years investigating various theories and suspects before settling on Todd.</p>

<p>Nic Carter, Founding Partner of Castle Island Ventures, said, “I feel certain that Todd is not Nakamoto,” citing the Bitcoin creator's deep knowledge of cryptography and digital cash systems.</p>

<p>Jameson Lopp, co-founder of the Bitcoin company Casa, also responded to the documentary's findings with scepticism. "Wherever Satoshi may be, I like to think they're having a laugh at this latest round of foolishness," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>Peter Todd, a graduate of the Ontario College of Art and Design, was just 23 when the famous Bitcoin white paper was published. He began engaging with key figures in the crypto community as a teenager, making him a credible candidate for some enthusiasts. Hoback explained to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/peter-todd-bitcoin-creator-cullen-hoback-hbo-cryptocurrency-satoshi-nakamoto/ ">Politico</a>, “In investigations like these, digital forensics can only take you so far... Real answers can only be found offline.”</p>

<p>The documentary features a dramatic scene where Hoback confronts Todd about the evidence linking him to Satoshi. Hoback said, “Peter was there that day... He had every opportunity to explain himself.” However, Todd rejected the film's claims, saying, “Cullen is grasping for straws here.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

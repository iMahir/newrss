       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bizarre incident, staff at an internet cafe in China's&nbsp;Wenzhou failed to notice that one of their customers had died and instead assumed that he was simply sleeping. According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3268636/thought-he-was-sleeping-man-29-dies-china-internet-cafe-demise-goes-unnoticed-30-hours"> South China Morning Post</a></em>, the man, whose identity remains unknown, had begun an extended gaming session on June 1. The employees of the cafe thought the man was fast asleep and they didn't bother to wake him up.</p>

<p>However, on the night of June 3, at 10 pm, a cafe worker attempted to wake him, only to find him unresponsive and his body cold. The alarmed worker contacted the police, who confirmed his death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Based on the breakfast residuals left on the desk, he did not have lunch on June 2. He possibly died suddenly on the morning of June 2,'' said a police officer, according to Jimu News.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The man's brother-in-law, surnamed Chen, said the exact time of death was not confirmed because his family did not permit pathologists to perform an autopsy.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">He also questioned the cafe employees and expressed frustration&nbsp;over how the death went unnoticed for so long.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''He sat in an open area instead of a closed partition. There should have been employees checking on him and noticing his strange behaviour,'' said Chen.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The internet cafe manager informed that the man looked healthy, and was a regular customer&nbsp;who usially stayed for six hours at a time.&nbsp;He added that gamers routinely fall asleep between their gaming sessions and&nbsp;the two staffers on duty at the time did not realise the man had ''slept'' for such an extended period.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''The employees thought he was having a rest, so they did not wake him up. Often, when we wake a sleeping customer, they become irritable and scold us,'' he said.</p>

<p>As per the local police, the case is still under investigation.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might call it the "swamp thing." About 280 million years ago, a large creature built somewhat like a salamander but with frightful fangs prowled the swamps and lakes of what is now Namibia, ambushing prey as a top predator in a chilly ecosystem long before the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>The creature, named Gaiasia jennyae, lived during the Permian Period and measured at least 8 feet (2.5 meters) long - and perhaps up to 13 feet (4 meters), according to researchers who announced the discovery of its fossilized remains. Its large, round, flat skull measured more than 2 feet (60 cm) long, and it had interlocking fangs at the front of its mouth.</p>

<p>"Wide flat heads in modern animals usually are used to generate strong suction to ambush prey by suddenly sucking it into their mouths. Gaiasia combines that with huge fangs for grabbing and killing large prey," said Jason Pardo, a postdoctoral fellow in paleontology at the Field Museum in Chicago and one of the leaders of the research published this week in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>The fossils were unearthed in Namibia, a country in southwest Africa. Because of the gradual movement over time of the crustal plates that form Earth's outer layer - a process called plate tectonics - this place was even further south when Gaiasia lived, almost even with Antarctica's current northernmost point. The bodies of water it inhabited may have sat alongside patches of ice and glaciers.</p>

<p>"In the far south, where Gaiasia lived, an ice age was ending, and it was still quite cold, with large glaciers at even low altitudes," Pardo said.</p>

<p>Roughly 100 million years before Gaiasia existed, the first land vertebrates had evolved from fish with fleshy fins. These are called the stem tetrapods. They lived an amphibious lifestyle though were not true amphibians. The term tetrapod, meaning "four feet," refers to all land vertebrates. The earliest ones, the stem tetrapods, spawned evolutionary lineages that led to true amphibians, reptiles and mammals.</p>

<p>While this was taking place, some stem tetrapods persisted, especially in remote places like Namibia was at the time. Gaiasia was one of these.</p>

<p>"Most of what we know of terrestrial life at this time comes from the ancient equator, preserved in rocks from Europe and North America. From that, we had thought early tetrapods were trapped in the tropics by their physiology," Pardo said, until they disappeared amid competition from newly evolved competitors.</p>

<p>"Gaiasia shows clearly that this is not correct. Stem tetrapods were thriving at high latitudes in very cold environments, and those ecosystems were dominated by some very unexpectedly primitive animals. That forces us to rethink a lot about early tetrapod evolution," Pardo said.</p>

<p>So Gaiasia was a stubborn holdover.</p>

<p>"Gaiasia is very different from anything else we've seen, so it could be a lone survivor, but it could also be part of a vibrant ecosystem of similarly strange animals that were no longer important parts of the ecosystem in the tropics," Pardo said.</p>

<p>Evolution was moving in leaps and bounds during the Permian.</p>

<p>"At this time we see a flurry of evolution in the forerunners of mammals, such as Dimetrodon, an animal the size of a mountain lion that looked something like a big lizard with a giant sail on its back and was the top predator in most of these ecosystems. We also see forerunners of reptiles diversifying in interesting ways that mirror modern lizards, and the first true amphibians," Pardo said.</p>

<p>The Permian ended about 252 million years ago with Earth's worst mass extinction. The first dinosaurs appeared roughly 230 million years ago during the Triassic Period.</p>

<p>The creature's name Gaiasia refers to the Gai-as rock formation in Namibia where it was found, and jennyae honors the late British paleontologist Jenny Clack, who studied early tetrapods. But how about a catchy nickname for it?</p>

<p>"'Swamp thing' is excellent," Pardo said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 65-year-old man from China was detained following a heated argument with a young woman on a metro. The man had asked the woman to give up her seat so that he could sit. When she refused, he then screamed at her and hit her with his cane, as per the Beijing Police.</p>

<p>According to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202406/1314873.shtml"><em>Global Times</em></a>, the unsettling episode took place on Beijing Subway Line 10. In the now-viral video on social media, the elderly man is seen asking a young woman to give up her seat for him. She refused and said that she would offer her seat to someone else. He then swept his cane between her legs and hit her with his hands, further escalating the situation.</p>

<p>The man said in the clip, "Call the police, we'll go to the police station, and you can say I'm harassing you." The video footage also documents the efforts of subway security to resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>Since being shared, the video has amassed several reactions likes on the microblogging platform.</p>

<p>"Embarrassing. That guy is a clown," said a user.</p>

<p>Another wrote, "Not typical in China. My wife and I (late-70s Americans) visited my daughter in China for a month. On boarding a public transit bus for the 3 hour ride back from the Great Wall to Beijing we had more than a few people get up from their seats and insist we sit while they stood for the entire 3 hours. I kept insisting they take a break and sit for a while but they would not hear of it."</p>

<p>"That old man needs to chillax," stated a third person.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's historic general election on Thursday marks the first real test at the ballot box for Rishi Sunak when pride in Britain's first Prime Minister of Indian heritage might be trumped by the cost-of-living crisis and sheer fatigue with 14 long years of a Conservative Party-led government.</p>

<p>Exactly how the votes stack up will start to unfold only once polling closes but YouGov's final large-scale poll for 'The Times' on the eve of the election suggests the Opposition Labour could be handed a so-called "supermajority" - indicating a 212-seat parliamentary majority and the highest in decades.</p>

<p>But whatever the final outcome, this pattern is more a reflection of the political turmoil that ultimately brought Mr Sunak into 10 Downing Street than a vote against his own leadership.</p>

<p>"I think for British Indian voters, in particular, this election is similar to the rest of the electorate; they've been given a chance to choose to keep or remove the government and after 14 years of a Conservative government, the mood is much more for change than for maintaining it," reflected Sunder Katwala, Director of the British Future think tank.</p>

<p>"There'll be a sense, I think, of regret and disappointment that this didn't go better for Rishi Sunak as there was great pride... but people aren't going to make their voting choice on that basis. And that's why I think, more British Indian voters are going to vote for change than vote for keeping Rishi Sunak, even though they appreciate his historic achievement in being the first British Prime Minister of Indian heritage," he noted.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, the issues that would influence British Indian voters would echo wider concerns such as the cost-of-living crisis, the National Health Service (NHS) waiting lists and getting a grip on illegal migration.</p>

<p>While Mr Sunak did meet his pledge to bring down inflation from the soaring levels he inherited in the aftermath of the chaotic terms of predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, it may not prove enough to get him over the line at the ballot box.</p>

<p>"I don't know why he's not going around to every single member of the Tory party inside of the government saying, 'I told you so'... We've now reduced inflation down from the high of 11 per cent down to 2 per cent. We've seen the underlying economic outlook for the country improving since Mr Sunak took office in October 2022.</p>

<p>"But the problem we have is that people have long memories of a time when we forgot what it was to be a Conservative," Andrew Boff, Tory Chair of the London Assembly, said during an election debate hosted by 'Eastern Eye' earlier this week.</p>

<p>"Rishi Sunak, at one level, was a breath of fresh air because he's clearly an extremely bright, decent man attempting to do his best... [but] not much has changed since he became Prime Minister," said Lord Richard Newby, Leader of the Lib Dems in the House of Lords, during the event.</p>

<p>For Anneliese Dodds, Labour Party chair and shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, Mr Sunak's term marked a "huge amount of continuity" with his embattled predecessors.</p>

<p>However, if the outcome of the election indicates a definitive shift among British Indian voters towards Labour, it would be seen more as a vote in favour of change rather than a decisive ballot in favour of party leader Keir Starmer - who is simply being viewed as a "choose-able alternative", according to poll analysts.</p>

<p>Once the final outcome is clear on Friday, the conversation will instantly shift towards 44-year-old Sunak's political future.</p>

<p>An immediate resignation as Tory leader is expected only if the party's performance really is close to the disastrous levels forecast by some opinion polls.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The man detained over the shooting of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will face prosecution on the charge of carrying out a terrorist attack, Slovakia's general prosecutor said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Fico is recovering after being shot four times at close range when he greeted supporters at a government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova in mid-May. That left him needing hours of surgery.</p>

<p>A man identified by prosecutors as 71-year old Juraj C. was detained on the spot after the attack and charged with attempted premeditated murder.</p>

<p>"On the basis of the gathered evidence, the prosecuted act will be further legally qualified as the particularly serious crime of terrorist attack," General Prosecutor Maros Zilinka said on Facebook on Thursday, without providing further details.</p>

<p>The accused, if found guilty, could face life in prison under the new classification, according to Slovakia's criminal laws. Previously he had faced 25 years or life in prison.</p>

<p>The attack has highlighted the deep polarisation of politics in the central European country.</p>

<p>The detained man has, according to court documents, said he wanted to hurt the prime minister, but not kill him, because he disagreed with government policies including cancelling a special prosecutor's office and stopping state military aid to Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi TV creator Abdulaziz Almuzaini, whose animated Netflix show has made waves for breaking social taboos, said he had been convicted by an anti-terrorism court, prompting condemnation from rights advocates.</p>

<p>The kingdom's Specialised Criminal Court, established in 2008 to try suspects accused of terrorism, "issued against me (a sentence of) 13 years, followed by a 13-year travel ban", Almuzaini said in a video posted online last week that was subsequently deleted.</p>

<p>In a second video posted this week, which is still available on social media platform X, Almuzaini filmed himself inside a car, saying: "I am banned from travelling" out of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Saudi officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP on Thursday, and there was no word of Almuzaini -- who was not available for comment -- having been incarcerated.</p>

<p>His satirical show "Masameer County", billed as "a humorous view on a changing Saudi", debuted in 2021.</p>

<p>Episodes tackled topics such as disputes among tribes and Islamic militancy, and even featured oblique references to homosexuality, a potential capital crime in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that court documents in the case referred to online posts by Almuzaini which "ridiculed Arab regimes... or voiced support for women's rights".</p>

<p>Almuzaini said in the since-deleted video that the court accused him of promoting homosexuality and militancy.</p>

<p>He also said that, amid mounting pressure from Saudi authorities, he was forced to close his company, Myrkott Animation Studio.</p>

<p>"The services of all the employees of the Myrkott company were terminated a week ago," he said.</p>

<p>"Those are people who have families, people who have worked with us since 2012. I had to stand up and apologise to them all and announce to them that Myrkott had ended."</p>

<h3><strong>Appeal to the prince</strong></h3>

<p>The video included a direct appeal to Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who became first in line to the throne in 2017 and has overseen sweeping social and economic reforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I believe that we are in a country ruled by a rational family, and if one of its citizens is subjected to injustice, I have faith that my voice reaching His Highness the crown prince will correct some of what happened to me," Almuzaini said.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticised for what activists describe as a fierce crackdown on even vaguely critical online speech.</p>

<p>In the past two years the Saudi judiciary has "convicted and handed down lengthy prison terms on dozens of individuals for their expression on social media", human rights groups Amnesty International and ALQST said in April.</p>

<p>Saudi officials say the accused had committed terrorism-related offences.</p>

<p>High-profile examples include two women who received decades-long sentences in 2022 for posting and sharing critical online posts, as well as a retired teacher who last year was sentenced to death after denouncing alleged corruption and human rights abuses on social media.</p>

<p>Prince Mohammed in a September interview with Fox News said he disapproved of that judgement and raised the possibility that the retired teacher, Mohammed al-Ghamdi, might be spared death.</p>

<p>Unlike in these cases, Almuzaini does not seem to have been jailed.</p>

<p>The proceedings against him nevertheless appeared to continue a trend of shutting down free speech, said Abdullah Alaoudh, senior director for countering authoritarianism at the US-based Middle East Democracy Center.</p>

<p>"Saudi Arabia's creative industries will not thrive -- let alone attract investment -- until the authorities recognise and fully respect the human rights of all its citizens," Alaoudh said.</p>

<p>Lina al-Hathloul, head of monitoring and communication for ALQST, denounced the imposition of a travel ban, as was the case with her sister, prominent women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul.</p>

<p>"We all would like to live in the country, but in safety and without these violations and the arbitrary and unjustified travel ban that has exhausted many, including my family," the London-based Lina al-Hathloul said on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Swedish citizens have been sentenced to death in Iraq over their involvement in a shooting and a fourth may also face the same punishment over a separate crime, the Swedish foreign ministry said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The government summoned Iraq's charge d'affaires last month to protest the death sentence against one of the three involved in the shooting.</p>

<p>Sweden does not have the death penalty and opposes its use in all circumstances.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry said it had now received confirmation that two more Swedes have been convicted in relation to the same crime and received the death penalty.</p>

<p>"The information we have received on the death penalties is extremely serious and we are working to ensure the sentences will not be carried out," the foreign ministry said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>In June, the Daily Aftonbladet reported that the men had been involved in the shooting of another Swedish citizen in Iraq in January.</p>

<p>The ministry said it had received a report that a fourth Swede was given a death sentence for a different, drug-related crime, but that it could not confirm the information.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's vast state-owned Rostec corporation said on Thursday that its weapons export unit had organised the production in India of armour-piercing rounds for Russian-made battle tanks.</p>

<p>Rostec issued its statement ahead of a July 8-9 visit to Russia by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who will hold talks with President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The "Mango" projectiles that will be made in India are designed to be fired from the guns of T-72 and T-90 tanks which India's land forces use, Rostec said.</p>

<p>"The rounds allow you to hit modern tanks equipped with combined protection. Various modifications of these combat vehicles are in service with India," it said in its statement.</p>

<p>Rostec said it also had plans to localise the production of gunpowder in India as part of the Indian government's drive to have more foreign goods made in India.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The leaders of China and Russia on Thursday urged their allies and partners to resist malign external influence, advancing their shared anti-Western agenda at a regional summit in Central Asia.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping were in the Kazakh capital of Astana for a gathering of leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a regional bloc that Moscow and Beijing see as a counterweight to US "hegemony" on the world stage.</p>

<p>Xi called on the countries to "resist external interference" while Putin claimed "new centres" of political and economic might were on the rise.</p>

<p>"We should join hands to resist external interference, firmly support each other, take care of each other's concerns... and firmly control the future and destiny of our countries and regional peace and development in our own hands," Xi told the summit.</p>

<p>"It is of vital importance to the world that the SCO be on the right side of history and on the side of fairness and justice," he added.</p>

<p>In a joint declaration, published by the Kremlin, the group noted "tectonic shifts in global politics" and called for the bloc to play an enhanced role in global and regional security.</p>

<p>"The use of force is increasing, the norms of international law are systemically being violated, geopolitical confrontation and conflicts are growing, and risks to stability in the world and the SCO region are multiplying," it stated.</p>

<p>It did not refer to Russia's invasion of Ukraine or China's dispute with Taiwan but said the group had "mutual respect for sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of states".</p>

<p>Both Russia and China regularly rail against what they say is the US dominance of global affairs and are seeking to boost their influence and control, particularly in regions close to their borders.</p>

<p>"The multipolar world has become a reality," Putin said in remarks at the summit.</p>

<p>He also hailed the accession of Russia's close ally Belarus to the bloc, becoming its tenth member.</p>

<p>"The circle of states that stand for a just world order and are ready to resolutely defend their legitimate rights and protect traditional values is expanding," Putin said.</p>

<p>"New centres of power and economic growth are strengthening," he added.</p>

<p>Western-sanctioned Iran joined as a full member last year.</p>

<h3><strong>Competition&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The SCO was founded in 2001 but has come to prominence in recent years. Alongside China, Russia and Belarus, its full members are: India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.</p>

<p>It is intended to be a platform for cooperation in competition with the West, with a focus on security and economics and Central Asia in particular, and claims to represent 40 percent of the global population and about 30 percent of its GDP.</p>

<p>But it is a disparate group with many internal disagreements, including territorial disputes.</p>

<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has further increased major powers' interest in Central Asia, where Moscow is seeking to maintain its traditional sway but where China now has strong ties through its flagship Belt and Road infrastructure project.</p>

<p>The West is also vying for influence in the strategically important region, rich in oil and gas and a crucial transport route between Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>Despite the tussle for influence, at the summit on Thursday, the SCO's common anti-Western agenda was on clear display.</p>

<p>In the final declaration, the bloc criticised the "unilateral and unrestricted build-up" of missile defence systems by unnamed countries and regional alliances -- a common complaint of both Moscow and Beijing aimed at the United States.</p>

<p>They also called for an "early, complete and sustainable ceasefire" in Gaza with a "comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian question."</p>

<p>Pakistan's foreign ministry on Thursday announced it would host the next summit of leaders in October.</p>

<p>Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, the ministry's spokesperson, said "all heads of governments of SCO member states" would be welcomed when asked if Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the leader of neighbouring rival India, would be invited.</p>

<p>Modi did not attend this summit, but is expected in Moscow in the coming days, his first visit to the country since Russia invaded Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden is "absolutely not" pulling out of the US presidential race, his spokeswoman said Wednesday, as pressure mounted following his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Panic has gripped his Democratic Party in the wake of last week's TV debate, and internal rumblings about finding a replacement candidate before November's election have been amplified by polls showing Trump extending his lead.</p>

<p>The New York Times and CNN reported that Biden, 81, had acknowledged to a key ally that his reelection bid was on the line if he failed to quickly reassure the public that he was still up to the job.</p>

<p>White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre rejected those reports outright, insisting Biden has no intention of withdrawing.</p>

<p>"The president is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race," she told reporters.</p>

<p>Biden told a call with campaign and party staffers that he is going nowhere.</p>

<p>"I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win. Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we're going to beat him again in 2024," he said, according to a source close to the campaign.</p>

<p>He repeated that message in an emergency meeting with Democratic governors, who pledged their continued support, attendees said afterward.</p>

<p><br />
"As the president continued to tell us, and show us, that he was all in... we said that we would stand with him," Maryland Governor Wes Moore, seen as a rising star and potential future presidential candidate, told reporters alongside Minnesota's Tim Walz and Kathy Hochul of New York.</p>

<p>Walz said Biden was "fit to serve."</p>

<p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also attended the meeting at the White House and is seen as one of the top picks to replace Biden if he should drop out, said on social media platform X that "he is in it to win it and I support him."</p>

<p>Biden has admitted he performed poorly in the debate, and was blunt in a radio interview recorded Wednesday with Wisconsin's Civic Media.</p>

<p>"I screwed up. I made a mistake. That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years," he said.</p>

<p>He echoed that sentiment in an interview with Pennsylvania's WURD radio on Thursday, saying "I had a bad debate."</p>

<h3><strong>Aftermath</strong></h3>

<p>The Biden campaign has been desperate to reassure Democratic donors and voters that the president's performance against Trump was a one-off.</p>

<p>But party figures have voiced bafflement over what they see as deflection and excuses from the president and his aides.</p>

<p>Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, told the New York Times that Biden should withdraw.</p>

<p>"Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous," he said in an email to the paper.</p>

<p>The concern was compounded by a New York Times poll conducted after the debate that showed Trump with his biggest lead ever over Biden -- 49 percent to 43 percent of likely voters.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Wednesday -- six days after the debate -- that Biden completed a round of calls with Democratic congressional leaders, and staffers have also voiced consternation over the glacial pace of the outreach.</p>

<p>"We are getting to the point where it may not have been the debate that did him in, but the aftermath of how they've handled it," a senior Democratic operative told Washington political outlet Axios.</p>

<p>Biden may be tested on his ability to think on his feet when he sits with ABC News on Friday for his first television interview since the debate, and he will also hit the swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days.</p>

<h3><strong>'More worrisome'</strong></h3>

<p>The president has cited fatigue as a new explanation for his poor debate showing, saying that he was unwise to travel "around the world a couple times" before the debate.</p>

<p>But he had been back in the United States for nearly two weeks and spent two days relaxing and six days preparing before the debate.</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers have begun to go public with their doubts. Arizona congressman Raul Grijalva became the second sitting Democrat to call on Biden to drop out.</p>

<p>"If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere," Grijalva said, according to the Times.</p>

<p>In the street where the president grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, there was sympathy for Biden -- but no campaign signs for either candidate.</p>

<p>"I was embarrassed for him. I felt he didn't feel well and he probably shouldn't have gone on the stage," said 73-year-old Jamie Hayes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign and some of his allies have launched a pre-emptive political strike on Vice President Kamala Harris, moving swiftly to try to discredit her amid talk among some of her fellow Democrats that she might replace President Joe Biden atop the party's 2024 presidential ticket.</p>

<p>On social media and in a flurry of statements over the past 48 hours, Trump's campaign and his Republican allies appear to be laying the groundwork for an all-out assault on Harris should the 81-year-old Biden decide to end his re-election bid following his feeble debate performance last week.</p>

<p>While Biden has insisted he is not quitting the race four months before the Nov. 5 election, and Harris has stood firmly behind him, the Trump campaign has little to lose by attacking the vice president now, so if Harris does emerge as the nominee, she might do so in a weakened state.</p>

<p>Republicans have regularly criticized Harris, 59, during Biden's term in office, but the attacks this week represented a sharp and seemingly coordinated escalation that appeared to be linked to increased talk about her possibly replacing Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee, which oversees House Republican races, called her Biden's "enabler in chief."</p>

<p>MAGA Inc., a fundraising super PAC supporting Trump, meanwhile released a statement calling her the "invasion czar." In March 2021 Biden said Harris would lead efforts with Mexico and Central American nations to address illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Republicans have since seized on that to accuse her of failing to stem the flow of millions of migrants crossing illegally into the United States, although she was never directly responsible for securing the southern border.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris is incompetent. She's proven to be the weakest, worst vice president in history, and she has 100% supported Joe Biden in every single disastrous policy that he has implemented over the last four years," said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign pushed back against the escalating Republican criticism without addressing the question of whether the vice president is waiting in the wings.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris is proud to be President Biden's running mate," said Rhyan Lake, a campaign spokesperson for Harris. "No matter what false attacks Trump and his extreme allies make, she will continue to defend the Biden-Harris record and prosecute the case against Donald Trump."</p>

<p>The swipes at Harris by Trump's camp were reminiscent of a similar tactic that the Republican Trump, president from 2017-2021, used to successfully undermine Ron DeSantis, his main Republican rival before the Florida governor jumped into their party's 2024 election primary race last year.</p>

<p>Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Trump adviser, told Reuters Harris was politically vulnerable given her role in addressing illegal immigration, among other issues that are part of extensive research the party has gathered on her record.</p>

<h3><strong>TRUMP'S UNUSUAL SILENCE</strong></h3>

<p>A former senior staffer in the Trump White House who is still in contact with the Trump campaign said the newfound emphasis on Harris made sense.</p>

<p>"If Joe Biden stays on top of the ticket, given what we've seen, she takes on even more importance. But if he does step aside, she's the potential candidate. This is about defining her," the staffer said, pointing to her low approval ratings in public opinion polls.</p>

<p>Despite her consistently low approval ratings, a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this week showed Harris to be as formidable an opponent to Trump as Biden. In a hypothetical matchup, Trump led Harris by a single percentage point, 43% to 42%.</p>

<p>The clamor by Trump's allies is in stark contrast with the unusual silence from the normally voluble former president. Since Biden's poor debate performance, Trump has laid low, making few public appearances or public statements.</p>

<p>"This shows a maturation of the candidate himself. You can teach an old dog new tricks. He's showing increased discipline and message control," said a senior adviser to the Trump campaign familiar with internal discussions.</p>

<p>Even before the June 27 debate, the Trump campaign was beginning to turn its attention to Harris, releasing an attack ad online that mocked her for repeating lines in her speeches.</p>

<p>An online meme promoted by Republicans showed Harris repeating the same phrase "unburdened by what has been" again and again in remarks.</p>

<p>Harris' defenders say she has become more of a target because of her leading role in attacking Trump over abortion rights and her vigorous defense of Biden on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>If Biden were to exit the race before the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee Harris would be the nominee. But as vice president, she likely would be first in line. She would benefit from Biden's immense campaign war chest and likely see a large segment of Democrats rally around her in a bid to avoid a bitter intra-party battle.</p>

<p>And as the first Black vice president in U.S. history, she provides a bridge to the party's most dependable voting bloc. Her background and relative youth would make for a sharp contrast with Trump, 78.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Thursday asked the international community to "isolate and expose" those countries that harbour terrorists, provide safe havens and condone terrorism, saying that if left unchecked, terrorism can become a major threat to regional and global peace, in a veiled jibe at China and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Delivering Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State Summit in the Kazakhstan capital Astana, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who was physically present at the meeting, recalled that one of the original goals of the SCO is to combat terrorism.</p>

<p>"Many of us have had our experiences, often originating beyond our borders. Let us be clear that if left unchecked, it can become a major threat to regional and global peace. Terrorism in any form or manifestation cannot be justified or condoned," he told the summit, which was attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and and Russian President Vladimir Putin among others.</p>

<p>He said that the international community "must isolate and expose those countries that harbour terrorists, provide safe havens and condone terrorism", in an apparent reference to Pakistan and its all-weather ally China which has often put on hold on proposals in the United Nations to blacklist the Pakistan-based wanted terrorists.</p>

<p>"Cross-border terrorism requires a decisive response and terrorism financing and recruitment must be resolutely countered. We should also take proactive steps to prevent the spread of radicalisation among our youth," he said, adding that the joint statement issued during India's Presidency last year on this subject underlines New Delhi's shared commitment.</p>

<p>He underlined that the SCO provides a unique platform to unite people, collaborate, grow and prosper together, practising the millenia-old principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam which means 'The World is One Family'.</p>

<p>"Delivered India's statement at the Summit of SCO Council of Heads of States on behalf of PM Shri @narendramodi ji. Thank the leaders present for conveying their best wishes to Prime Minister @narendramodi on his re-election for a third successive term," Mr Jaishankar later posted on X.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar described the SCO as a principle-based organisation, whose consensus drives the approach of its member states, and said the grouping occupies a "prominent place in our foreign policy".</p>

<p>He said India shares deep civilizational ties with the people of this region. "Recognising the centrality of Central Asia to SCO, we have prioritized their interests and aspirations. It is reflected in greater exchanges, projects and activities with them," he said.</p>

<p>Cooperation in the SCO, for us, has been people-centric, he said, adding that India organised SCO Millet Food Festival, SCO Film Festival, SCO Surajkund Craft Mela, SCO Think-Tanks Conference, and International Conference on Shared Buddhist Heritage during its presidency. "We will naturally support similar endeavors by others," he said.</p>

<p>He also congratulated the Kazakh side for successfully hosting the summit and also conveyed India's best wishes to China for the next presidency of the SCO.</p>

<p>The minister also expressed "deepest condolences" for the tragic demise of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and others in the helicopter crash.</p>

<p>With nine member states -- India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyz, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - the Beijing-based SCO has emerged as an influential economic and security bloc and one of the largest trans-regional international organisations. Belarus joined as the 10th member.</p>

<p>Kazakhstan is hosting the summit in its capacity as the current chair of the grouping.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a nine-year-old Indian-origin schoolgirl is set to make chess history after she became the youngest person selected to represent England internationally in any sport.</p>

<p>Bodhana, from Harrow in north-west London, will join the England Women's Team at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary, in September. The others in her team are all in their 20s, 30s or 40s.</p>

<p>"I found out yesterday after I came back from school when my dad told me. I was happy. I hope I'll do well and I'll get another title," she told the BBC on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, described the schoolgirl as one of the most remarkable British chess prodigies he has ever seen.</p>

<p>"It's exciting - she's on course to be one of the best British players ever," he said.</p>

<p>Her father, Siva Sivanandan, says he remains mystified about where his daughter got her talent.</p>

<p>"I'm an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I'm not good at chess," he said.</p>

<p>Bodhana first picked up chess during the pandemic lockdown when Siva's friend was going back to India and gave her a few bags which also had a chess board.</p>

<p>"I was interested in the pieces, so I started playing," she recalls.</p>

<p>Last December, Sivanandan won the European Blitz Chess Championship in Zagreb, Croatia, and was dubbed "super talented" at the time.</p>

<p>Soon after, she was among a group of young chess enthusiasts invited by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to 10 Downing Street to mark the government's major new GBP 1 million investment package for the game.</p>

<p>The package has since been in place to support children attending schools in disadvantaged areas across England to learn and play chess, improve the visibility and availability of the game, and fund elite playing.</p>

<p>As part of the package, the UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it would invest GBP 500,000 in the English Chess Federation (ECF) over two years to develop the next generation of world-class talent. Funds will support expert coaching, training camps and cutting-edge computer analysis for international events to assist current grandmasters and up-and-coming players.</p>

<p>Alongside the support committed to elite players, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) will provide GBP 250,000 to 85 local authorities across England to install 100 new chess tables in public parks and outdoor green spaces to allow more people to play, connect, tackle loneliness, and develop problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>In addition, the outgoing Sunak-led government set out plans to encourage more primary school children, particularly girls, to learn to play the game.</p>

<p>The UK Department for Education offered grants of up to GBP 2,000 to at least 100 schools in disadvantaged areas across England, subject to interest.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain voted Thursday in a general election widely expected to hand the opposition Labour party a landslide win and end nearly a decade-and-a-half of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>The first national ballot since Boris Johnson won the Tories a decisive victory in 2019 follows Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's surprise call to hold it six months earlier than required.</p>

<p>His gamble looks set to backfire spectacularly, with polls throughout the six-week campaign -- and for the last two years -- pointing to a heavy defeat for his right-wing party.</p>

<p>That would almost certainly put Labour leader Keir Starmer, 61, in Downing Street, as leader of the largest party in parliament.</p>

<p>Centre-left Labour is projected to win its first general election since 2005 by historic proportions, with a flurry of election-eve polls all forecasting its biggest-ever victory.</p>

<p>But Starmer was taking nothing for granted as he urged voters not to stay at home. "Britain's future is on the ballot," he said. "But change will only happen if you vote for it."</p>

<h3><strong>'People are not satisfied'</strong></h3>

<p>Voting began at 7:00 am (0600 GMT) in more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, from church halls, community centres and schools to more unusual venues such as pubs and even a ship.</p>

<p>Sunak was among the early birds, casting his ballot at his Richmond and Northallerton constituency in Yorkshire, northern England. Starmer voted around two hours later in his north London seat.</p>

<p>"I just moved back from Australia and I've got the feeling that everything has turned wrong in this country and a lot of people are not satisfied," said Ianthe Jacob, a 32-year-old writer, after voting in Hackney, east London.</p>

<p>In Saint Albans, north of London, 22-year-old student Judith told AFP: "I don't really trust any of them but will vote. A lot of my friends feel the same."</p>

<p>Voting closes at 10:00 pm (2100 GMT). Broadcasters then announce exit polls, which typically provide an accurate picture of how the main parties have performed.</p>

<p>Results from the UK's 650 constituencies trickle in overnight, with the winning party expected to hit 326 seats -- the threshold for a parliamentary majority -- as dawn breaks Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Polls suggest voters will punish the Tories after 14 years of often chaotic rule and could oust a string of government ministers, with talk that even Sunak himself might not be safe.</p>

<p>That would make him the first sitting prime minister not to retain his seat in a general election.</p>

<p>"I appreciate people have frustrations with our party," he conceded on Wednesday. "But tomorrow's vote... is a vote about the future."</p>

<h3><strong>Endorsements</strong></h3>

<p>Sunak, 44, is widely seen as having run a dismal campaign, with anger over his decision to leave D-Day commemorations in France early the standout moment.</p>

<p>In new blows Wednesday, The Sun newspaper switched allegiance to Labour -- a key endorsement given the tabloid has backed the winner at every election for several decades.</p>

<p>It follows the Financial Times, the Economist and The Sunday Times as well as traditionally left-leaning papers The Guardian and The Daily Mirror, also endorsing the party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, three large-scale surveys indicated Labour was on the brink of a record victory, with the Tories set for their worst-ever result and the centrist Liberal Democrats resurgent in third.</p>

<p>YouGov, Focaldata and More in Common all projected Labour would secure at least 430 seats, topping the 418 under Tony Blair in 1997.</p>

<p>The Conservatives could plunge to a record low of less than 127, the trio predicted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lib Dems were tipped to scoop dozens of seats -- up from their current tally of 15 -- while Nigel Farage's anti-immigrant Reform UK party was set to win a handful.</p>

<p>YouGov and More in Common both forecast the Brexit figurehead would finally become an MP at the eighth time of asking.</p>

<h3><strong>'Decade of national renewal'</strong></h3>

<p>If the predictions are accurate, Sunak will on Friday visit head of state King Charles III to tender his resignation as prime minister.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starmer will meet the monarch shortly after to take up his invitation to head the next government -- and become prime minister.</p>

<p>The Labour leader will then travel to Downing Street -- the office and residence of British leaders -- where he would be expected to deliver a speech before making ministerial appointments.</p>

<p>It would cap a remarkable political rise for the former human rights lawyer and chief prosecutor, first elected an MP in 2015.</p>

<p>He has promised a "decade of national renewal" but faces a daunting task revitalising creaking public services and a flatlining economy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl powered towards Mexico and the Cayman Islands early Thursday, threatening strong winds and a storm surge after battering Jamaica's southern coast.</p>

<p>Beryl weakened to a Category 3 storm overnight, sustaining winds of 125 miles (200 kilometres) an hour, but is forecast to be "at or near major hurricane intensity" while it passes by the Caymans, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).</p>

<p>"Strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging winds" were expected across the Cayman Islands overnight, the NHC said early Thursday.</p>

<p>The storm has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides as it moves towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.</p>

<p>The storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.</p>

<p>Mexican officials have scrambled to prepare, with the NHC warning Beryl will remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>

<p>"We will have intense rains and wind gusts" from Thursday, Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.</p>

<p>The government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for around 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo, where Beryl will likely hit.</p>

<p>In Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.</p>

<p>Jamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.</p>

<p>Desmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff had scrambled to be ready.</p>

<p>"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do," Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.</p>

<p>'No communication'</p>

<p>Beryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a "herculean effort" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that "90-odd percent of the houses were blown away" on Union Island.</p>

<p>"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment," he said.</p>

<p>Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.</p>

<p>The 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometre) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.</p>

<p>In St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.</p>

<p>Climate change</p>

<p>It is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.</p>

<p>Warm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>UN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was "pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction."</p>

<p>"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit," he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lebanon's Hezbollah said it launched "more than 200" rockets at Israeli military positions Thursday in response to a strike that killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed group.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah said it launched more than 200 rockets and explosive drones at Israeli military positions on Thursday as tensions have soared amid the almost nine-months-old war raging in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed operative group said its latest attack, which followed the launch of over 100 rockets the previous day, came in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel did not report any deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with strikes on targets in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears the clashes could escalate into all-out war.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres is "very worried about the escalation of the exchange of fire", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday, warning of the risk to the wider Middle East "if we were to find ourselves in a full-fledged conflict".</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Hamas are part of an Iran-led "Axis of Resistance" against Israel and the United States, a regional alliance that also includes Yemen's Huthi rebels and groups in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Thursday its forces were "striking launch posts in southern Lebanon" after "numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory".</p>

<p>It said that most were intercepted by air defence systems but that "fires broke out in a number of areas in northern Israel" following the attacks.</p>

<p>Israel on Wednesday killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Naameh Nasser, near the Lebanese coastal town of Tyre.</p>

<p>A source close to the group described him as the "Hezbollah commander responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon". Another border sector chief was killed in an Israeli strike last month.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said that "as part of the response to the... assassination carried out by the enemy" it had fired "more than 200 rockets" and "a squadron of explosive drones" at Israeli bases.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens blared across northern Israel in the morning, and an AFP correspondent witnessed rockets crossing the frontier that were intercepted.</p>

<h3><strong>Heavy battles rock Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.</p>

<p>The Gaza war at the heart of the regional tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and artillery shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight day on Thursday.</p>

<p>Israeli troops over the past day had "destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes," said the military.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in Gaza's southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.</p>

<p>Witnesses reported air strikes and intense artillery shelling in western Rafah on Thursday.</p>

<h3><strong>Efforts towards truce</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.</p>

<p>The UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week again called for an end to the "maelstrom of human misery".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week ceasefire and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p>

<p>There has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.</p>

<p>Hamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had "made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement".</p>

<p>Netanyahu's office and the Mossad intelligence service said "Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators".</p>

<p>The main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting -- a demand Netanyahu and his right-wing nationalist government allies strongly reject.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Britons began voting on Thursday in a parliamentary election that is expected to bring Keir Starmer's Labour Party to power, sweeping away Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives after 14 often turbulent years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britons began voting on Thursday in a parliamentary election that is expected to bring Keir Starmer's Labour Party to power, sweeping away Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives after 14 often turbulent years.</p>

<p>Opinion polls put Starmer's centre-left party on course for a landslide victory but also suggest many voters simply want change after a period of infighting and turmoil under the Conservatives that led to five prime ministers in eight years.</p>

<p>This means Starmer, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer, could take office with one of the biggest to-do lists in British history but without a groundswell of support or the financial resources to tackle it.</p>

<p>"Today, Britain can begin a new chapter," Starmer told voters in a statement on Thursday. "We cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour."</p>

<p>The country's 40,000 polling stations opened at 0600 GMT.</p>

<p>Sunak, 44, was among those to vote early. He was pictured leaving a polling station in his Richmond constituency in northern England, holding hands with his wife Akshata Murty.</p>

<p>Having called the election months earlier than expected, Sunak has in recent weeks abandoned his call for a fifth consecutive Conservative victory, switching instead to warning of the dangers of an unchallenged Labour Party in parliament.</p>

<p>Sunak issued a fresh rallying cry to voters for election day, saying a Labour government would hike taxes, hamper economic recovery and leave Britain more vulnerable at a time of geopolitical tension, charges Labour deny.</p>

<p>"They will do lasting damage to our country and our economy - just like they did the last time they were in power," Sunak said on Thursday. "Don't let that happen."</p>

<p>Polls were due to close at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT) when an exit poll will give the first sign of the outcome. Detailed official results are expected in the early hours of Friday.</p>

<h3><strong>Punishing Government</strong></h3>

<p>If the opinion polls are correct, Britain will follow other European countries in punishing their governments after a cost of living crisis that stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Unlike France it looks set to move to the centre left and not further right.</p>

<p>Labour has held a poll lead of between 15 and 20 points since shortly after Sunak was chosen by his lawmakers in October 2022 to replace Liz Truss who resigned after 44 days, having sparked a bond market meltdown and a collapse in sterling.</p>

<p>Modelling by pollsters predicts Labour is on course for one of the biggest election victories in British history, with a likely majority in parliament that would exceed those achieved by Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher, although a high number of voters are undecided and turnout could be low.</p>

<p>Such an outcome would have been unthinkable at Britain's last election in 2019 when Boris Johnson won a large victory for the Conservatives, with politicians predicting that the party would be in power for at least 10 years as Labour was finished.</p>

<p>Starmer, the former chief prosecutor of England and Wales, took over Labour from veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn after it suffered its worst defeat for 84 years in 2019, and dragged it back to the centre.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Conservatives in Westminster have imploded, ripped apart by scandal under Johnson and the rancour that followed the vote to leave the European Union, and a failure to deliver on the demands of its broad 2019 voter base.</p>

<p>While Johnson destroyed the party's reputation for integrity, Truss eroded its long-held economic credibility, leaving Sunak to steady the ship. During his time inflation returned to target from its 41-year high of 11.1% and he resolved some Brexit tensions, but the polls have not budged.</p>

<p>Sunak's election campaign has been hit by a string of gaffes. He announced the vote in driving rain, his early departure from a D-Day event in France angered veterans, and allegations of election gambling among aides reignited talk of scandal.</p>

<p>The unexpected arrival of Nigel Farage to lead the right-wing Reform UK has also eaten into the Conservatives' vote, while the centrist Liberal Democrats are predicted to fare well in the party's affluent heartlands in southern England.</p>

<h3><strong>Promise Of Change</strong></h3>

<p>Starmer could also benefit from a Labour recovery in Scotland after the Scottish National Party embarked on its own self-destructive path following a funding scandal.</p>

<p>But Starmer may find his fortunes more sorely tested in Downing Street.</p>

<p>His campaign was built around a one-word promise of 'Change', tapping into anger at the state of stretched public services and falling living standards. But he will have few levers to pull, with the tax burden set to hit its highest since 1949 and net debt almost equivalent to annual economic output.</p>

<p>Starmer has consistently warned that he will not be able to fix anything quickly, and his party has courted international investors to help address the challenges.</p>

<p>Sunak has argued that his 20 months in charge have set the economy on an upward path and Labour should not be allowed to put that in jeopardy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said Thursday its forces had withdrawn from a district in the key eastern town of Chasiv Yar, where Russian forces have recently claimed several advances.</p>

<p>The fall of the small hilltop town is a worrying prospect for Ukraine because it would likely accelerate Russian advances towards large civilian hubs in the wider eastern Donetsk region.</p>

<p>"It became impractical to hold the Kanal district, which the enemy had entered because it threatened the lives and well-being of our soldiers," a Ukrainian military spokesman said on state-run television.</p>

<p>"Our defenders' positions had been destroyed. The command decided to retreat to better protected and prepared positions," Nazar Voloshyn added.</p>

<p>Russia had said earlier this week that its forces had advanced around Chasiv Yar but it was unclear if it was claiming its forces had crossed a canal that runs through the eastern part of the town.</p>

<p>Chasiv Yar -- a prized military hub that was once a sleepy home to some 12,000 people -- lies near the larger towns of Kostyantynivka and Kramatorsk, which are both important military centres, too.</p>

<p>The Kremlin says the industrial Donetsk region is part of Russia and the region has borne the brunt of fighting after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Kremlin-supported separatist forces have controlled parts of Donetsk since 2014.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Throughout the six-week campaign that followed Mr Sunak's sudden call for elections, the UK PM has trailed behind 61-year-old Keir Starmer who leads the Labour Party.</p>

<p>“Stop Labour's supermajority” is the central message Mr Sunak was trying to drive home as he wrapped up his campaign, even as most of the incumbent Conservatives all but conceded defeat in the general election.</p>

<p>“Labour will put up your taxes. Again and again and again,” he posted on social media as the catch-all message to wind up the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Around 40,000 polling booths opened across the country at 7am local time as an estimated 46 million registered voters began turning out to mark a cross next to their chosen candidate on a paper ballot.</p>

<p>Once the votes are cast and the booths officially close at 10 pm local time, the focus shifts to the definitive exit poll soon after which gives a fair snapshot of what can be expected&nbsp;UK-wide. Counting commences up and down the country right away, with the first results expected just before midnight local time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris is engaged in a delicate balancing act, playing cheerleader for President Joe Biden while standing by as a leading contender to replace him if he ends his reelection bid.</p>

<p>Biden's dismal performance in last week's debate with Donald Trump has triggered panic in much of the Democratic Party as people question whether Biden is physically and mentally able to beat Trump and serve another four years.</p>

<p>Former congressman Tim Ryan, while professing his admiration for Biden, wrote in a piece for Newsweek that "the Democratic nominee in 2024 should be Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>Jim Clyburn, a senior House Democrat, and Black leader, told MSNBC: "We should do everything we can to bolster her -- whether it's in second place or at the top of the ticket."</p>

<p>Harris herself has not publicly voiced any desire to replace Biden.</p>

<p>"Look, Joe Biden is our nominee," she said in an interview Tuesday with CBS News. "We beat Trump once, and we're going to beat him again, period."</p>

<p>She said she was proud to be on the current ticket with the president.</p>

<p>Shortly after the debate, Harris rushed onto TV to defend Biden, admitting he had started off slowly in the clash with Trump, but saying he ultimately finished strong.</p>

<p>The official schedule for Biden on Wednesday said he had lunch with Harris, which is not a regular event, though it was a weekly fixture for Biden when he was vice president under Barack Obama.</p>

<h3><strong>One heartbeat&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Harris, 59, is the first woman, the first Black person, and the first person of Asian origin -- her mother was from India -- to hold the job that puts her a heartbeat from the presidency, as Americans like to say.</p>

<p>Harris would become president if Biden died in office or became incapacitated.</p>

<p>But she would not necessarily replace Biden if he were to end his candidacy, and Biden has insisted he has no plans to do so.</p>

<p>"For three and half years there has always been this drumbeat that someone other than the VP should be the Democratic candidate," said Ange-Marie Hancock, professor of political science at The Ohio State University.</p>

<p>Hancock said it was possible an "undercurrent of racism and sexism" was at work against Harris.</p>

<p>For years Harris has been less popular among Americans than other Democrats seen as possible candidates, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom or his Michigan counterpart Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

<p>US media have reported extensively on mistakes she made early in this administration, mainly on the diplomatic front, and on tension among her staffers.</p>

<p>But Hancock said things could turn in Harris's favor, because she has spent time out visiting battleground states, in particular, to promote abortion rights as it came under repeated fire from conservative judges and governors.</p>

<p>Flickers of that turn could be seen on social media, where supportive Harris-related memes have begun going viral under the hashtag #KHive.</p>

<p>Harris is sometimes criticized as disappointing as an orator. But she got a warm welcome recently when she made a tour of universities that was focused on schools with high numbers of minority students.</p>

<p>She'll make more stops in July to speak with African American audiences, particularly women, with three trips to Louisiana, Texas, and Indiana.</p>

<h3><strong>Polling&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A CNN poll released Tuesday had Harris doing better than Biden against Trump, although not beating him.</p>

<p>This poll gave Harris 45 percent of voter intentions against 47 percent for Trump, while Biden scored 43 percent to 49 percent for the Republican former president in a race between the two men.</p>

<p>In the event Biden was to drop out, Harris, thanks to her name recognition, her ties to powerful people in the government, and the prospect for brisk fundraising, would go into the Democratic convention next month in a position of strength.</p>

<p>But the Republicans are ready and waiting.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris is very much on the GOP's radar," Hancock said, referring to Trump's party.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign on Wednesday broadcast a video montage of Biden suffering falls and other embarrassing moments, and questioned whether he can serve another term.</p>

<p>It concludes with the question, "And you know who is waiting behind him, right?" and footage of Harris laughing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

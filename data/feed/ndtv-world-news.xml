       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">As the globe faces a rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria – making traditional antibiotics ineffective – specific viruses could offer a solution.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Viruses called bacteriophages, or phages, target bacteria but can't infect humans or other higher organisms. Phages inject their DNA into the bacterial cell, multiply to large numbers using the resources of the host, and then burst out to infect more bacteria in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Essentially, they are a naturally occurring, self-replicating and specific antibiotic. Discovered more than 100 years ago, their use against bacteria was largely sidelined in favour of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Our new research looked at one particular protein used by phages to bypass the natural defences of bacteria. We found this protein has an essential control function by binding to DNA and RNA.</p>

<p>This increased understanding is an important step towards using phages against bacterial pathogens in human health or agriculture.</p>

<h3><strong>Bacterial defence systems</strong></h3>

<p>There are hurdles to using phages to target bacteria. Much like our bodies have immune mechanisms to fight off viruses, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance">bacteria </a>have also evolved defences against phage infections.</p>

<p>One such defence is “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”, or <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr">CRISPR</a>, now better known for its applications in medicine and biotechnology. CRISPR systems in general act as “molecular scissors” by cutting DNA into pieces, be it in a lab-based setting or, in nature, inside a bacterium to destroy a phage.</p>

<p>Imagine wanting to use a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109452/">phage </a>against an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. The only thing standing in the way of that phage killing the bacteria and eradicating the infection might be the bacterium's CRISPR defence which renders the phages useless as an antimicrobial.</p>

<p>That's where knowing as much as possible about phage counter-defences becomes important. We are investigating so-called anti-CRISPRs: proteins or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06612-5">other molecules</a> that phages use to inhibit CRISPR.</p>

<p>A bacterium that has CRISPR might be able to stop a phage from infecting. But if the phage has the right anti-CRISPR, it can neutralise this defence and kill the bacterium regardless.</p>

<h3><strong>The importance of anti-CRISPRs</strong></h3>

<p>Our <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07644-1">recent research</a> focused on how an anti-CRISPR response is controlled.</p>

<p>When faced with a powerful CRISPR defence, phages want to automatically produce large amounts of anti-CRISPR to increase the chance of inhibiting CRISPR immunity. But excessive production of anti-CRISPR prevents the replication of the phage and is ultimately toxic. This is why control is important. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this control, phages have another protein in their toolbox: an anti-CRISPR-associated (or Aca) protein that frequently occurs alongside the anti-CRISPRs themselves.</p>

<p>Aca proteins act as regulators of the phage's counter-defence. They make sure the initial burst of anti-CRISPR production that inactivates CRISPR is then rapidly dampened to low levels. That way, the phage can allocate energy to where it is most needed: its replication and, eventually, release from the cell.</p>

<p>We found this regulation occurs at multiple levels. For any protein to be produced, the gene sequence in the DNA first needs to be transcribed into a messenger–RNA. This is then decoded, or translated, into a protein.</p>

<p>Many regulatory proteins function by inhibiting the first step (transcription into messenger-RNA), some others inhibit the second (translation into protein). Either way, the regulator often acts as a “road block” of sorts, binding to DNA or RNA.</p>

<p>Intriguingly and unexpectedly, the Aca protein we investigated does both – even though its structure would suggest it is merely a transcriptional regulator (a protein that regulates the conversion of DNA to RNA), very similar to ones that have been investigated for decades.</p>

<p>We also examined why this extra-tight control at two levels is necessary. Again, it seems to be all about the dosage of the anti-CRISPRs, especially as the phage replicates its DNA in the bacterial cell. This replication will invariably lead to the production of messenger-RNAs even in the presence of transcriptional control.</p>

<p>Therefore, it appears additional regulation is required to reign in anti-CRISPR production. This comes back to the toxicity of excessive production of this counter-defence protein, to the harm done when there's “too much of a good thing”.</p>

<h3><strong>Fine-tuned control</strong></h3>

<p>What does this research mean in the grand scheme of things? We now know a lot more about how anti-CRISPR deployment occurs. It requires fine-tuned control to enable the phage to be successful in its battle against the host bacterium.</p>

<p>This is important out in nature, but also when it comes to using phages as alternative antimicrobials.</p>

<p>Knowing every detail about something as obscure-sounding as anti-CRISPR-associated proteins might make all the difference between the phage succeeding or succumbing —and between life or death, not just for the phage, but also for a person infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry has found a new mentor and "father figure" in Canadian music icon David Foster, according to sources close to the pair, The Times reported. The 74-year-old music producer has become a close friend and confidant to the Duke of Sussex during his time in the US, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-sunday-times-magazine/article/prince-harry-age-40-birthday-tqt9d2rdx ">the report</a>.</p>

<p>Foster, who lives near Harry and Meghan Markle in Montecito, California, has apparently filled a void left by Prince Harry's strained relationships with his own family, particularly King Charles. Katharine McPhee, Foster's wife, described the bond between Harry and her husband as "like father and son".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How they became friends</strong></p>

<p>Meghan Markle attended the same Catholic middle school in Los Angeles as Foster's wife, Katharine McPhee. Although they weren't close friends at school, they reconnected in London when McPhee was starring in the musical Waitress on the West End. It was then that David Foster and Prince Harry hit it off.</p>

<p>Foster and McPhee helped the Sussexes find a place to stay in Canada after they left the UK in 2020. The 16-time Grammy winner helped the couple find a $14.1 million rental home in Victoria, British Columbia, while they looked for a permanent residence in California.</p>

<p>Foster told the Daily Mail back in 2020 that he was honoured to help the ex-royal couple, citing his Canadian roots and the commonwealth connection. "I was just happy through my friend to facilitate what I could for them, and it looked like they had a great rest," he said. "They are a young modern family. I'm sure they want to balance their commitment to the crown and be a 2020 family."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since then, Harry and Foster have been close friends. McPhee said, "My husband has a really, really beautiful relationship with Harry. They're so cute."</p>

<p>In October 2020, the Sussexes moved to Santa Barbara, and the two couples have been inseparable ever since. They were spotted <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/inside-harry-meghans-friendship-with-katharine-mcphee-david-foster/">enjoying a double date</a> at Lucky's Steakhouse in Montecito, where Katharine McPhee, then pregnant with her son Rennie, chatted with Meghan Markle about purchasing a home in the area.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least seven explosions rang out on Monday morning over the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, AFP journalists heard, amid a nationwide alert warning against Russian aerial attacks.</p>

<p>As Russia's invasion of Ukraine stretches into its third year, Russia launched another series of attacks on Monday morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The governors of the southern regions of Odesa and Zaporizhzhia, as well as the governor of the northern region of Kharkiv, said on Telegram there had been explosions in their regions and urged people to take shelter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"An apartment building was damaged as a result of an enemy attack in Lutsk," the mayor of the central city Igor Polishchuk also said, adding one person had died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, an attack on an industrial facility in the central region of Poltava wounded five people, governor Filip Pronin said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukraine's energy operator DTEK announced some emergency power outages.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian-born tech entrepreneur Pavel Durov has founded wildly popular social networks as well as a cryptocurrency, amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune and locked horns with authorities not just in Russia but around the world.</p>

<p>Still a few months shy of his 40th birthday, the man once dubbed the "Russian Zuckerberg" after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg now finds himself under arrest in France after being sensationally detained at a Paris airport this weekend.</p>

<p>While still in his 20s, the Saint Petersburg native shot to fame in Russia after founding the VKontakte (VK) social network which catered to the needs of Russian-language users and outgunned Facebook throughout the former USSR.</p>

<p>After disputes with the Russian authorities and ownership battles, he sold out of VKontakte and founded a new messaging service called Telegram which rapidly gained traction but has also proved controversial with critics condemning an alleged lack of control on extreme content.</p>

<p>As these dramas raged, Durov remained a mercurial and at times mysterious figure, rarely giving interviews and restricting himself to sometimes enigmatic declarations made on Telegram.</p>

<p>A self-avowed libertarian, Durov has championed confidentiality on the Internet and encryption in messaging.</p>

<p>He has defiantly refused to allow the moderation of messages on Telegram, which allows users to post videos, pictures and comments on "channels" that can be followed by anyone.</p>

<p>Durov, 39, was targeted in France by a warrant over offences alleged to have been conducted on Telegram, ranging from fraud to drug trafficking, cyberbullying and organised crime, including promoting terrorism and fraud.</p>

<p>Investigations have been entrusted to the cyber unit of the French gendarmerie and the national anti-fraud office. He was still in police custody on Sunday, according to two sources close to the case.</p>

<h3><strong>'Thanks for all the fish'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In 2006, having just graduated from the University of Saint Petersburg, Durov launched VKontakte (VK), attracting users even while its founder remained a shadowy figure.</p>

<p>In a stunt typical of his unpredictable behaviour, Durov in 2012 showered high-denomination notes on pedestrians from VK's headquarters on top of a historic bookstore on Saint Petersburg's Nevsky Prospekt.</p>

<p>But after running into trouble with the Kremlin for refusing to hand over the personal data of users to the Russian security services (FSB), he sold out of the company and left Russia in 2014.</p>

<p>Durov resigned from VK with a typical flourish, posting a picture of dolphins and the slogan "So Long and Thanks for All the Fish", a title in the famous "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" science fiction series.</p>

<p>He developed the Telegram messaging service with his brother Nikolai while travelling from country to country and launched the service in 2013.</p>

<p>He settled in Dubai and obtained citizenship of the Caribbean island archipelago of Saint Kitts and Nevis, then, in August 2021, won French nationality following a low-profile procedure about which Paris remains highly discreet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Telegram enjoyed stratospheric success, presenting itself as a champion of individual freedoms, refusing "censorship" and protecting the confidentiality of its users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This rankled with authorities, especially in his home country and in 2018, a Moscow court ordered the blocking of the application. But the imposition of the measure was shambolic and three days later, protesters ironically bombarded the FSB headquarters with paper planes, the symbol of Telegram.</p>

<p>Since then, Russia has abandoned its efforts to block Telegram and the messaging service is used by both the Russian government and the opposition, with some channels boasting several hundred thousand subscribers.</p>

<p>Telegram also plays a key role in Russia's war against Ukraine, documented by bloggers from both sides who post their analyses and videos of the fighting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pro-Moscow channels run by so-called "Z-bloggers" who back the war have proved hugely influential and are sometimes critical of Russian military strategy.</p>

<h3><strong>'Love the privacy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Durov eschews traditional media interviews but in April sat down with ultra-conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson for an extensive discussion.</p>

<p>People "love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram," Durov told Carlson.</p>

<p>He is also not shy of posting messages on his own Telegram channel, claiming to lead a solitary life, abstaining from meat, alcohol and even coffee. Always dressed in black, he cultivates a resemblance to the actor Keanu Reeves in the film "Matrix".</p>

<p>In July, he boasted of being the biological father of more than 100 children thanks to his sperm donations in a dozen countries, describing this as a "civic duty" in an attitude to parenting that echoes that of a fellow tech mogul, the X and Tesla chief Elon Musk.</p>

<p>According to Forbes magazine's latest estimate, Durov's fortune is $15.5 billion. But toncoin, the cryptocurrency he created, has plummeted by more than 15 per cent since the announcement of his arrest.</p>

<p>Telegram has long been in the sights of European judicial authorities over allegations it spreads conspiracy theories, shared calls for murder and hosts drug sales platforms. Durov, however, insists that he responds to every request to remove content calling for violence or murder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sound of explosions rang out in central Kyiv on Monday morning during rush hour as Ukraine's military warned of a massive Russian missile and drone attack following waves of drone attacks in the early hours.</p>

<p>The air force told Ukrainians Russia had 11 TU-95 strategic bombers in the air and confirmed the launch of a number of missiles. Outside the Ukrainian capital, Reuters reporters heard the sound of air defences engaging targets.</p>

<p>Local authorities reported explosions in the northwestern city of Lutsk and said that an apartment block had been damaged and that they were verifying possible casualties.</p>

<p>The Operational Command of the Polish armed forces said on X that Polish and allied aircraft had been activated after Russia launched the attack which also targeted regions in Ukraine's west and near the Polish border.</p>

<p>Ukrainians have been expecting a major Russian missile attack for some time. The US embassy issued a warning last week of an elevated risk of attack around Ukrainian Independence Day, which Ukraine marked on Saturday.</p>

<p>Ukraine has itself stepped up its long-range drone attacks on Russia to try hit back at Moscow, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>"The desire to destroy our energy will cost the Russians dearly: their infrastructure," Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff, said on Telegram, apparently vowing retaliation.</p>

<p>Russia launched two waves of drone attacks earlier on Monday, Ukraine's military said, with initial information showing no damage or casualties.</p>

<p>Up to 10 drones were destroyed on their approach to the city in the region around Kyiv at about 0230 GMT, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Russia. Both Russia and Ukraine deny targeting civilians. Each says its attacks are aimed at destroying infrastructure key to the other's war effort.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Bangladeshi diplomats serving in India were dismissed from their duties following an order from the interim government of Bangladesh. Shaban Mahmud, serving as First Secretary (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi was asked to resign before the end of his contract. Similarly, Ranjan Sen, serving in the same capacity at the Bangladeshi consulate in Kolkata, was also dismissed from his duties.</p>

<p>The interim government of Bangladesh, headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, was established amid a volatile political landscape that saw mass protests and violence resulting in the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On August 5, Ms Hasina, aged 76, fled Bangladesh by helicopter to India as protesters overran the streets of Dhaka. Her 15-year rule, marked by allegations of human rights abuses, came to a dramatic end. The weeks leading up to her ousting were bloody, with more than 450 dying during the unrest.</p>

<p>Despite Ms Hasina's escape to India, Mr Yunus has maintained that his government would continue to foster friendly relations with everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will maintain friendly relations with all countries," he said in a televised address yesterday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his message to the international community earlier this month, Mr Yunus called for continued support in rebuilding Bangladesh and transitioning to a fully functional democracy. He assured the diplomats that Bangladesh would maintain its role as a proponent of multilateralism, with the United Nations at the core of its foreign policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"At least 22 people were killed and 5 injured when operatives stopped several busses, trucks and vans on a highway connecting Punjab with Balochistan," Najibullah Kakar, a senior official in Musakhail, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Vehicles traveling to and from Punjab were inspected, and individuals from Punjab were identified and shot," he added.</p>

<p>He said 19 Punjabis and 3 Baloch were killed, mostly Punjabi labourers.</p>

<p>Hameed Zehri, another senior official in the district, confirmed the death count to AFP.</p>

<p>"It seems that the BLA (Baloch Liberation Army) terrorists are behind the incident," he said.</p>

<p>The Baloch Liberation Army is the most active operatives separatist group in the region.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump said that he would like to keep Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his cabinet if he's elected as President.</p>

<p>In an interview with Shawn Ryan, which is yet to be broadcasted, the host of US-based 'The Shawn Ryan Show', Trump said that he would keep Musk in his cabinet but doubted if Musk could do it with so many things already on his plate.</p>

<p>Ryan asked Trump if keeping Musk in the cabinet would require him to do something with artificial intelligence.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Trump had some great things to say about Elon. Would you like to see <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@elonmusk</a> in Trump's cabinet if he's elected as President?<br />
<br />
Stream the full episode tomorrow at 12:30PM CST on the Shawn Ryan Show YouTube channel.<br />

“What he really would like to do is get involved in cutting… <a href="https://t.co/bVdmjKR5Yc">pic.twitter.com/bVdmjKR5Yc</a></p>
— Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyan762) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyan762/status/1827719384674038209?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />
"He wants to be involved now. Look, he's running big businesses and all that, so he can't really. I don't think he'd be [able to handle the work of cabinet]. I'd put him in the cabinet, absolutely. But I don't know how he could do that with all the things he's got going," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump said that Musk can consult with the country and produce ideas, especially on AI.</p>

<p>"But he can sort of, as the expression goes, consult with the country and give you some very good ideas, like on AI. There's nobody knows more about it than Elon. It's a big thing," he said.</p>

<p>Trump said that if the US doesn't focus on building AI, somebody else--most likely China--will do it.</p>

<p>"It's very important for the country. If we don't do it, China is going to do it or somebody else. But most likely China. And China is working right now to develop a massive flood of electricity. And we don't, because we have people that are not even thinking about that," he said.</p>

<p>Trump said that Musk is an 'unusual character'. He said that Musk was a genius and we must cherish him.</p>

<p>"We have a great relationship. He's [Musk is] great. He is a totally unusual character. He's great, and he's smart, and we have to cherish our geniuses. You know, we don't have too many of them. He is a brilliant guy, and what he really would like to do is get involved in cutting some of the fat. And he does know how to do it, and he loves the country. You know, it's just an amazing thing."</p>

<p>Trump said that if this election doesn't go the right way, the country will be doomed.</p>

<p>"We have to win this election. This election is going. November 5 will be the most important day, in my opinion, in the history of our country, because if our country goes the wrong way with this election, I think this country is doomed," he said.</p>

<p>Trump said that the fact that his podcast with Musk on August 13 was viewed by millions was 'crazy'.</p>

<p>"We had a conversation the other day... I hear it had hundreds of millions of people. I heard it had the biggest audience that there's ever been. I mean, would you say that's a correct statement? There's never been anything even close. I heard 750 million people. I mean, numbers that are crazy," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Encrypted messaging app Telegram on Monday said that its CEO Pavel Durov — who was arrested in France — has nothing to hide and “it is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.”</p>

<p>In its first reaction after Russian-born Durov was arrested at the Le Bourget airport outside Paris after landing via a private jet for allegedly failing to prevent criminal activities on Telegram, the company said it abides by the EU laws, including the ‘Digital Services Act'.</p>

<p>“Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe. Almost a billion users globally use Telegram as a means of communication and as a source of vital information. We're awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation,” said the platform which has more than 900 million active users.</p>

<p>“Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act — its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving,” the company added.</p>

<p>The platform has been a critical source of information for the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. In a rare interview with US political commentator Tucker Carlson in April, Durov said Telegram's goal is to be a “neutral” platform and resist requests from governments to moderate.</p>

<p>If convicted, Durov faces up to 20 years in prison. According to multiple reports, he was arrested on several charges which involved alleged spread of criminal activity on Telegram which has about 900 million active users.</p>

<p>The billionaire lives in Dubai, where Telegram is based, and holds dual citizenship of France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). An entrepreneur with at least $15.5 billion in his kitty, he left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to ban opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform.</p>

<p>Russia's embassy in France is taking "immediate steps" to clarify the situation. Telegram offers end-to-end encrypted messaging and users can also set up "channels" to disseminate information quickly to followers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has unveiled a new "suicide drone", state media said Monday, with leader Kim Jong Un overseeing a performance test of the weapons, which experts said could have come from Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wearing a cream baker boy hat, Kim was shown beaming as he watched, aided by high-powered binoculars, as the drones blew up targets, images in state media showed.</p>

<p>Kim said that "it is necessary to develop and produce more suicide drones", the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, in addition to "strategic reconnaissance and multi-purpose attack drones".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suicide drones are explosive-carrying unmanned drones designed to be deliberately crashed into enemy targets, effectively acting as guided missiles.</p>

<p>The nuclear-armed North's growing drone fleet will "be used within different striking ranges to attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea", KCNA said.</p>

<p>All the drones North Korea tested on August 24 "correctly identified and destroyed the designated targets after flying along different preset routes", it added.</p>

<p>Kim also said his country would work towards "proactively introducing artificial intelligence technology into the development of drones".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some 60 media and rights organisations on Monday urged the European Union to suspend a cooperation accord with Israel and impose sanctions, accusing it of "massacring journalists" in Gaza.</p>

<p>"In response to the unprecedented number of journalists killed and other repeated press freedom violations by the Israeli authorities since the start of the war with Hamas, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and 59 other organisations are calling on the European Union to suspend its Association Agreement with Israel and to adopt targeted sanctions against those responsible", the groups said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>The call came ahead of a meeting by EU foreign ministers in Brussels on August 29.</p>

<p>The period following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel's devastating retaliatory assault on the Gaza Strip "has been the deadliest for journalists in decades", the letter said.</p>

<p>"More than 130 Palestinian journalists and media professionals have been killed by the Israeli armed forces in Gaza since 7 October. At least 30 of them were killed in the course of their work, three Lebanese journalists and an Israeli journalist have also been (killed) during the same period", it says.</p>

<p>"The targeted or indiscriminate killing of journalists, whether committed deliberately or recklessly, is a war crime", it said.</p>

<p>EU's association agreements with non-member countries are treaties that govern bilateral relations, including trade.</p>

<p>The agreement's Article 2 stipulates "respect for human rights and democratic principles", said Julie Majerczak, the head of RSF's Brussels office.</p>

<p>"The Israeli government is clearly trampling on this article. The EU, which is Israel's leading trade partner, must draw the necessary conclusions from this and must do everything to ensure that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government stops massacring journalists and respects the right to information and press freedom by opening media access to Gaza," she said.</p>

<p>Among the signatories were the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Human Rights Watch (HRW).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violent clashes erupted between students and Ansar members near the Secretariat in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka on Sunday night. The confrontation left several people from both sides injured, the Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>The clash broke out after 9 pm, with both sides engaging in a series of chases. During the turmoil, police intervened in an attempt to restore order.</p>

<p>Earlier, students from various dorms of Dhaka University began gathering at the Raju Memorial Sculpture to march to the Secretariat to confront Ansar members, whom they were calling "agents of autocracy," according to Dhaka Tribune.</p>

<p>This escalation followed reports that a group of Ansar members were detaining Nahid Islam, an adviser in the interim government and coordinator of the Students Against Discrimination movement, along with coordinators Sarjis Alam, Hasnat Abdullah, and others, at the Secretariat.</p>

<p>Student Protest Coordinator Hasnat Abdullah in a Facebook post blamed former director general of Ansar, Maj Gen AKM Aminul Haque, for a continued blockade of the Secretariat, even after the demands of protesting Ansar members were met. Hasnat also urged everyone to gather in front of the Raju Memorial Sculpture at Dhaka University, Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>AKM Aminul Haque is the elder brother of former deputy minister of water resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim.</p>

<p>Hasnat Abdullah on his Facebook wrote, "Everyone, come to Raju. The autocratic forces are trying to make a comeback through the Ansar force. Even after their demands were met, we were kept locked in the Secretariat."</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Ansar members ended their protest after receiving assurances from Lt Gen (Retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, the interim government's adviser for home affairs. The members had been demonstrating for two days, calling for the nationalization of their jobs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli Air Force (IAF) on Sunday conducted a series of precision strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, thwarting what Israeli officials described as a large-scale attack. The strikes, which began at 5 am local time, were part of a military campaign aimed at neutralising Hezbollah's growing threat along Israel's northern border.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a video showcasing the operation, stating, "Our operation in Lebanon targeted the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah planned to use against us, protecting Israeli families and homes."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">WATCH how the IAF acted precisely today to stop a large-scale terrorist attack from Hezbollah.<br />
<br />
Our operation in Lebanon targeted the terrorist infrastructure Hezbollah planned to use against us, protecting Israeli families and homes. <a href="https://t.co/2J3sqAnFWB">pic.twitter.com/2J3sqAnFWB</a></p>
— Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1827765497695211850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing his cabinet later that day, warned that the military action was far from over. "We are striking Hezbollah with surprising, crushing blows," Netanyahu said. "This is another step towards changing the situation in the north and safely returning our residents to their homes. And, I repeat, this is not the final word."</p>

<p>Netanyahu highlighted the success of the operation, noting that the military had destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were intended to harm civilians and forces in the Galilee region of Israel. He also confirmed that the IDF had intercepted all the drones that Hezbollah launched at a strategic target in central Israel, which Israeli media reported to be the headquarters of its spy agency Mossad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over 100 Israeli warplanes participated in the preemptive assault, targeting thousands of Hezbollah missile launchers across southern Lebanon. The strikes were based on what Israeli officials described as "precise intelligence" indicating that Hezbollah was on the verge of launching a massive missile barrage at northern Israel, as well as drone attacks on key intelligence centres.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, Israel declared a 48-hour state of emergency and temporarily shut down its main airport, leading to the cancellation of several flights. Despite Hezbollah's retaliation, which involved firing over 300 projectiles into Israel, the damage was minimal. Israeli officials reported that one soldier was killed by falling debris, while three fatalities were reported in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the broader conflict in the region continued. Negotiations in Cairo, aimed at establishing a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, proceeded as planned. However, the talks faced challenges, with Hamas accusing Israel of setting new conditions and prolonging the cease-fire negotiations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More and more Londoners are purchasing homes further away from the capital in a bid to get a better bang for their buck.</p>

<p>The average person moving from the city bought a home a record 39 miles outside the city between January and June, according to a report from broker Hamptons International. That's six miles further than in 2019 and 65% more than the typical first-time buyer.</p>

<p>"Four years on from the pandemic and many city workers have settled into a new normal when it comes to going into the office," said Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons. "In a bid to make their equity stretch further, movers continue to make longer distance moves out of the capital."</p>

<p>UK households are facing a mix of cost pressures triggered by higher interest rates and a cost-of-living squeeze. While home loan rates are steadily declining from the 15-year high they reached in 2023, the number of UK mortgaged properties taken into possession rose 8% in the second quarter of this year.</p>

<p>Over 25% of households trading a London home for one outside the capital moved more than 100 miles away in the first half, significantly higher than the 17% average recorded between 2015 and 2019. On average, London leavers are moving 50% further than they were a decade ago, with high transaction costs reducing the number of shorter, more frequent moves, Hamptons said.</p>

<p>Gedling and North Somerset - two local authorities based in the Midlands and western England, respectively - have seen those looking to leave London more than double in the first half of 2024 compared with the same period last year. London leavers accounted for 48% of people buying a home outside the capital between January and June.</p>

<p>Still, a long-running rise in first-time buyers leaving London was restricted in the first half of the year, as a steady decline in mortgage costs and lower house prices encouraged more prospective homeowners to buy in the capital. First-time buyers purchased a record 48% of homes sold in London between January and June, up from 41% in 2023 and 28% a decade ago, the report said.</p>

<p>What's more, first-time buyers leaving the capital are increasingly seeking out more affordable areas closer to London rather than moving further afar. The share of first-time buyers leaving London for the countryside has halved from its 6% peak in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Lower mortgage payments have pulled the cost of buying back below renting, bringing relief to those looking for their first home in the capital," Hamptons' Beveridge said. "First-time buyers with deeper pockets are looking again at London, choosing Clapham over Crawley and Wembley over Wycombe."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wounded Palestinian prisoner has died in an Israeli hospital, two Palestinian organisations said.</p>

<p>Zaher Raddad, 19, from the town of Saida in Tulkarm, northern West Bank, died in the Israeli Meir Hospital, according to a statement by the Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs Authority, part of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, along with the Palestinian Prisoners Club.</p>

<p>Raddad was arrested on July 23, after the Israeli army shot him and "used him as a human shield during the military operation by placing him on the front of one of the Israeli military vehicles in the city," the statement said on Sunday.</p>

<p>With Radad's death, the number of prisoners who died in Israeli prisons since October 7, 2023, has risen to 23, according to the statement.</p>

<p>There has been no Israeli statement on the death of Raddad, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Since October 2023, Israel has been waging a large-scale war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, after the movement carried out an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns adjacent to the Strip, which resulted in the killing of about 1,200 people.</p>

<p>The statement further detailed that Raddad had been held at Meir Hospital under critical and unstable health conditions, reliant on artificial respiration after undergoing several surgeries. Despite his grave condition, the Israeli authorities continued his detention until his death on Sunday.</p>

<p>The two Palestine organisations condemned the Israeli occupation's actions as a compounded crime, starting from the moment of Raddad's arrest and shooting, his use as a human shield, and the continued detention despite his severe health condition.</p>

<p>They described this incident as part of the unprecedented scale of crimes committed by the Israeli occupation since the onset of its genocidal campaign against the people of Gaza and its ongoing aggression against Palestinians across all occupied territories.</p>

<p>Tensions have been running high across the West Bank since Israel launched a military offensive against the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 40,400 Palestinians since last October.</p>

<p>At least 641 Palestinians have since been killed and nearly 5,400 others injured in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.</p>

<p>In a landmark advisory opinion on July 19, the International Court of Justice declared Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian land unlawful and demanded the evacuation of all existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after 100 Israeli warplanes swooped over southern Lebanon, taking out thousands of Hezbollah missile launchers in what was called a preemptive strike, the Middle East braced for an expanded conflagration that could involve Iran and its allied militias.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The assault started at 5 am local time and was based, Israeli officials said, on precise intelligence that Hezbollah was about to fire thousands of missiles at northern Israel as well as drones at a key intelligence centre just north of Tel Aviv in retaliation for the killing of its commander in July.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel declared a 48-hour state of emergency and shut its main airport for several hours, with numerous foreign airlines cancelling flights. Hezbollah responded by firing more than 200 projectiles, according to Israel, although officials said very limited damage was caused. One Israeli soldier was killed by falling debris, while three deaths were reported in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Hezbollah had successfully executed an attack on targets in central Israel, the tit-for-tat fighting that's been simmering on the border area for 10 months may have exploded into wider warfare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our hope is that the events of last night do not spill out into an escalation that leads to regional war," US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters on Sunday evening during a visit to Canada.</p>

<p>For the time being, at least, a relative calm held.</p>

<p>"It was a huge success that we detected the plans and now there is the possibility for both sides not to escalate this very complex situation," said retired Brigadier General Ilan Biton, a former chief of defense for Israel's air force. Both Israel and Hezbollah announced that for the moment, their operations were over - despite ongoing low-level fighting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel reopened its airport and eased restrictions on public gatherings imposed earlier in the day. Israel's military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said there was no damage to any Israeli military base. The Israeli army didn't reimpose safety restrictions on the population on Sunday night, indicating it didn't expect another attack imminently.</p>

<p>Significantly, negotiations in Cairo aimed at establishing a cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militia Hamas commenced as planned on Sunday.</p>

<p>But after a Hamas delegation left Cairo on Sunday evening, Osama Hamdan, a spokesman and leader of the group, said Israel has "set new conditions for a cease-fire" and "is still procrastinating," according to a statement posted on the group's Telegram account. In a dig at President Joe Biden's administration, he said it's "planting false hope by talking about an imminent agreement for electoral purposes."</p>

<p>The talks are set to continue at lower levels in the coming days in an effort to bridge gaps between the parties, the Associated Press reported, citing a US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official said the recent talks have been constructive and the parties are working to reach an implementable agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Underscoring 'Consequences'</strong></h2>

<p>The Israeli exchange with Hezbollah "is more likely to aid than complicate the cease-fire talks," said Mike Singh, managing director at the Washington Institute. "By sending a message that Israel is willing and able to escalate, and that Washington will back it when it does so, the US and Israel have underscored the consequences for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran of continuing to refuse a deal."</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its attack on Israel was planned as the start of retaliation for the killing of its commander Fuad Shukr on July 30 in Beirut's southern suburbs. The group said it fired more than 320 missiles, followed up by drones, to target 11 army barracks and military sites in northern Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mossad intelligence service's base in Glilot was the main target of the attack, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah said Sunday.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a security cabinet meeting Sunday and said he was "determined to do everything to defend our country, to return the residents of the north securely to their homes, and to continue upholding a simple rule: Whoever harms us - we will harm them."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, noted that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke by phone over the weekend. He declined to say whether the US was given advance warning of Sunday's attack, adding, "This was an Israeli operation."</p>

<h2><strong>US Support</strong></h2>

<p>The US has stepped up its naval and air defense presence in the region as a warning to Iran and its allies not to increase hostilities. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked if Israel had informed the US in advance of its plans to hit at Hezbollah, Sullivan, the national security adviser, sidestepped the question. "I can't speak directly to the conversations that unfolded yesterday, other than to say there was continuous communication, and we have been tracking the threat of Hezbollah attacks against Israel for some time now," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But despite fresh US statements Sunday affirming support for Israel's right to defense, the attack on Hezbollah is a setback for "American diplomacy, which has been laser-focused on de-escalation" and on the search for a cease-fire in Gaza, according to Merissa Khurma, director of the Middle East program at the Wilson Center in Washington. "In private, the past ten-plus months have showcased various ebbs and flows in US-Israeli relations, and certainly a significant rise in tensions."</p>

<p>She said it raises doubts among regional allies about "whether the US still has leverage over Israel."</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire along the border since October, when the Lebanese organization entered the fray in support of Hamas in Gaza. Israeli strikes have killed at least 500 people since then, most of them Hezbollah fighters. In Israel, roughly 30 soldiers and 18 civilians have been killed by Hezbollah attacks.</p>

<p>Preventing the skirmishes from escalating even further has been at the heart of international diplomatic efforts to ease tension across the Middle East.</p>

<p>Hours after an Israeli airstrike on July 30 killed Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, Iran blamed Israel for killing the head of Hamas' political office, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran. Iran has vowed to retaliate but it has also said it would do so on its own timetable. Israel has repeatedly warned it not to do so.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Netanyahu warned Hezbollah and Iran that the latest attack isn't "the end of the story," and was "another step on the way to changing the situation in the north, and return our residents safely to their homes."</p>

<h2><strong>Evacuations</strong></h2>

<p>The US has been trying to mediate between Lebanon and Israel to reach a compromise over border disputes. Tens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese have been evacuated from the border area due to the fighting, and Israel wants Hezbollah to move its fighters away from the border to allow its citizens to return. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and designated a terrorist organization by the US, says it will continue hostilities with Israel until the country agrees to a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas, also designated a terrorist group by the US and others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The war in the Palestinian enclave began on Oct. 7 after Hamas militants, supported by Iran, invaded Israel and killed 1,200 people and abducted others. Israel's retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 40,000 people, according to Hamas health officials in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crew of a Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) ship was evacuated due to heavy flooding, following a collision with an underwater object off the coast of Johor state.</p>

<p>All the crew had been recovered safely while the partially submerged ship was being salvaged, the RMN said on Sunday in a statement.</p>

<p>"A leak was first detected at 12 p.m. ... It is believed to have been caused by the vessel colliding with an underwater object. It (the leak) was initially detected in the ship's engine room before spreading uncontrollably. The crew was safely recovered after efforts to control the situation and stabilise the vessel did not succeed," it added.</p>

<p>RMN said the ship partially sank in the incident, which occurred at noon two nautical miles southeast of Tanjung Penyusop while it was conducting an operation in the area, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>It said all 39 crew members were rescued after efforts to stem the leak and stabilise the ship failed.</p>

<p>The focus now is on conducting a salvage operation to save the ship.</p>

<p>RMN will establish a special investigative board immediately to determine the cause of the incident, it said.</p>

<p>The Navy said several parties responded to the incident, including the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, the police and the maritime community in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The public is advised not to speculate on the incident. Please refer to official RMN sources for the latest developments and accurate information, it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is gearing up for a substantial increase in iPhone production for the upcoming year, with a particular emphasis on its Pro and Pro Max models.</p>

<p>According to recent reports by GSM Arena, the tech giant plans to manufacture approximately 90.1 million iPhones in 2024, a slight increase from last year's target of 86.2 million units.</p>

<p>This year's production strategy reveals a notable shift in focus towards higher-end models.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to make up a significant portion of this total, with plans to produce 33.2 million units, which represents 37 per cent of the total production mix.</p>

<p>This marks a considerable increase from last year's production of 24.2 million iPhone 15 Pro Max units, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>Similarly, the production of iPhone 16 Pro models is set to rise to 26.6 million units, accounting for 30 per cent of the total iPhone 16 production.</p>

<p>This is an increase from the 21.8 million units of the iPhone 15 Pro produced last year.</p>

<p>In contrast, the non-Pro variants will see a more modest production increase.</p>

<p>The standard iPhone 16 will see a rise to 24.5 million units, up from 21.8 million last year, while the iPhone 16 Plus will see a reduction, with only 5.8 million units planned for production.</p>

<p>This represents a decline from the 8.5 million units of the iPhone 15 Plus produced last year, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>This shift in production focus towards the Pro and Pro Max models underscores a growing consumer preference for higher-end smartphones, which typically offer higher profit margins for Apple.</p>

<p>As the iPhone 16 series is anticipated to debut on September 10, 2024, these production adjustments highlight Apple's strategic response to evolving market demands and consumer trends.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your boss texting you on the weekend? Work email pinging long after you've left for home?</p>

<p>Australian employees can now ignore those and other intrusions into home life thanks to a new "right to disconnect" law designed to curb the creep of work emails and calls into personal lives.</p>

<p>The new rule, which came into force on Monday, means employees, in most cases, cannot be punished for refusing to read or respond to contacts from their employers outside work hours.</p>

<p>Supporters say the law gives workers the confidence to stand up against the steady invasion of their personal lives by work emails, texts and calls, a trend that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic scrambled the division between home and work.</p>

<p>"Before we had digital technology there was no encroachment, people would go home at the end of a shift and there would be no contact until they returned the following day," said John Hopkins, an associate professor at Swinburne University of Technology.</p>

<p>"Now, globally it's the norm to have emails, SMS, phone calls outside those hours, even when on holiday."</p>

<p>Australians worked on average 281 hours of unpaid overtime in 2023, according to a survey last year by the Australia Institute, which estimated the monetary value of the labour at A$130 billion ($88 billion).</p>

<p>The changes add Australia to a group of roughly two dozen countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America, which have similar laws.</p>

<p>Pioneer France introduced the rules in 2017 and a year later fined pest control firm Rentokil Initial 60,000 euros ($66,700) for requiring an employee to always have his phone on.</p>

<p>Rachel Abdelnour, who works in advertising, said the changes would help her disconnect in an industry where clients often have different working hours.</p>

<p>"I think it's actually really important that we have laws like this," she told Reuters. "We spend so much of our time connected to our phones, connected to our emails all day, and I think that it's really hard to switch off as it is."</p>

<p><strong>Refusals Must Be Reasonable</strong></p>

<p>To cater for emergencies and jobs with irregular hours, the rule still allows employers to contact their workers, who can only refuse to respond where it is reasonable to do so.</p>

<p>Determining whether a refusal is reasonable will be up to Australia's industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission (FWC), which must take into account an employee's role, personal circumstances and how and why the contact was made.</p>

<p>It has the power to issue a cease and desist order and, failing that, levy fines of up A$19,000 for an employee or up to A$94,000 for a company.</p>

<p>But the Australian Industry Group, an employer group, says ambiguity about how the rule applies will create confusion for bosses and workers. Jobs will become less flexible and in doing so slow the economy, it added.</p>

<p>"The laws came literally and figuratively out of left field, were introduced with minimal consultation about their practical effect and have left little time for employers to prepare," the group said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Michele O'Neil said the caveat built into the law meant it won't interfere with reasonable requests. Instead, it will stop workers paying the price for poor planning by management, she said.</p>

<p>She cited an unidentified worker who finished a shift at midnight, only to be texted four hours later and told to be back at work by 6 a.m.</p>

<p>"It's so easy to make contact, common sense doesn't get applied anymore," she said.</p>

<p>"We think this will cause bosses to pause and think about whether they really need to send that text or that email."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 people have died and more than 5.2 million have been affected in Bangladesh by floods caused by relentless monsoon rains and overflowing rivers, officials said on Sunday.</p>

<p>The floodwaters have left many people isolated and in urgent need of food, clean water, medicine, and dry clothes, particularly in remote areas where blocked roads have hampered rescue and relief efforts.</p>

<p>Government Chief Adviser Mohammad Yunus said in a televised address that the administration has adopted all necessary measures to ensure a swift return to normality for flood victims.</p>

<p>Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, is leading the interim government that was sworn in after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country following a student-led uprising this month.</p>

<p>Abdul Halim, a 65-year-old farmer from a village in the Comilla district, said his mud hut was swept away by a 10-foot-high surge of floodwater in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>"There are no goods and no water. Barely anyone has come with the relief (aid) deep inside the villages. You have to physically go close to the main road to collect it," he told Reuters television.</p>

<p>Some people in Bangladesh have alleged that the floods were caused by the opening of dam sluice gates in neighbouring India, an assertion New Delhi has rejected.</p>

<p>"We have begun discussions with neighbouring countries to prevent future flood situations," Yunus said.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Meteorological Department has warned that flood conditions could persist if the monsoon rains continue, as water levels are receding very slowly.</p>

<p>More than 400,000 people have taken refuge in around 3,500 shelters in the 11 flood-hit districts, where nearly 750 medical teams are on the ground to provide treatment, with the army, air force, navy, and Border Guard Bangladesh assisting in rescue operations, authorities said.</p>

<p>An analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.</p>

<p>"The impact of this year's monsoon rains has been widespread and devastating," said Kabita Bose, Country Director of Plan International Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"Entire communities have been completely inundated, and there are now millions of people, including children, in need of safe shelter and lifesaving humanitarian assistance," she said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

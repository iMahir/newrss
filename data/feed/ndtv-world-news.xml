       <description><![CDATA[The move has already led to evictions from private shelters, with around 2,000-3,000 refugees potentially losing their housing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new law threatening to drive thousands of migrants from Ukraine back to their home country or onto the streets has been implemented in Hungary. With effect from Wednesday, this legislative move denied Ukrainian refugees access to government-subsidised accommodation.</p>

<p>This new rule is the outcome of a decision made in June by Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban to restrict public assistance to refugees from areas of Ukraine that are not thought to be impacted by the war between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>The list, which will be updated monthly by the Hungarian government, includes thirteen regions in Ukraine. It is unknown how many of the 31,000 Ukrainians who are seeking refuge in Hungary will be impacted by the new legislation.</p>

<p>Government Commissioner Norbert Pal defended the change as "reasonable and proportionate" after two and a half years of war. He told the pro-government Magyar Nemzet newspaper that "those who wanted to get back on their feet in Hungary have been able to do so."</p>

<p>Privately-owned shelters have already started evicting refugees now ineligible for support, the Migration Aid group said.</p>

<p>In Kocs, north of Budapest, around 120 refugees were ousted from a guest house under police supervision on Wednesday, an AFP photographer saw.</p>

<p>Most were Roma women and children from Transcarpathia in western Ukraine, where there is a large Hungarian community.</p>

<p>"We are in a hopeless situation because we have nowhere to go," Marina Amit, a mother-of-five who fled to Hungary last year, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We cannot go home to Ukraine; I have a 17-year-old son," she added, saying she feared he would be conscripted into the Ukrainian army.</p>

<p>The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimated this week that 2,000-3,000 Ukrainians could lose access to subsidised accommodation.</p>

<p>The rule change will result in "job losses and impact school enrolment, jeopardising the positive integration achievements obtained so far," UNHCR said in a statement urging Hungary to reconsider.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepal on Thursday lifted its ban on TikTok nine months after suspending the popular video-sharing platform for disturbing "social harmony", the communications minister said.</p>

<p>TikTok, which has around one billion monthly users, has faced restrictions in many countries for allegedly breaking data rules and for its potentially harmful impact on youth.</p>

<p>"A decision to remove the ban on TikTok has been made," Minister for Communications and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung told reporters after a cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>The decision comes over a week after TikTok's South Asia division contacted the minister saying that it would follow Nepal's regulations, and requesting that the ban be lifted, according to ministry spokesman Gajendra Kumar Thakur.</p>

<p>Nepal had suspended TikTok in November last year, days after introducing a directive requiring social media platforms operating in the country to set up offices.</p>

<p>It also followed an anti-government demonstration, whose leader was popular on TikTok.</p>

<p>The ban was condemned not just by free speech advocates but by the owners of popular accounts whose lives were transformed by the platform, which had about 2.2 million users in the country.</p>

<p>"The news makes me very happy," Anjana Aryal, who went from homemaker to entrepreneur by sharing recipes on TikTok, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The ban had really affected many creators like me who had benefitted from the app."</p>

<p>Since the ban, Aryal and other prominent Nepali content creators had seen their revenue streams dry up, jeopardising their livelihoods.</p>

<p>"Many switched to Instagram and Facebook, but they don't have the same kind of reach. With TikTok back, I will be very busy again," she said.</p>

<p>Advocate Dinesh Tripathi, who had challenged the decision in court, said that the decision was a "victory for free speech".</p>

<p>"Free speech is integral to democracy. This is a good decision but we must stay vigilant against such attacks," he said.</p>

<p>In July, Nepal's Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, 72, was sworn in as prime minister after his Communist Party forged a coalition government with the centre-left Nepali Congress, shifting power in the country's often volatile parliament.</p>

<p>Owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok is one of the most popular social media platforms on the planet, but multiple countries have sought to tighten controls on social media due to their potential impact.</p>

<p>The United States recently sued TikTok, saying it had placed the safety of millions of children in jeopardy by collecting their personal data without parental permission.</p>

<p>TikTok is also battling a US law that calls on its Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the video platform or else face a nationwide ban on the app.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim government revoked the diplomatic passport of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina on Thursday, after she fled a student-led uprising by helicopter to India earlier this month.</p>

<p>The move to cancel Sheikh Hasina's documents leaves the former autocratic leader in potential limbo, and comes on the same day that a United Nations team arrived in Dhaka to assess whether to investigate alleged human rights violations.</p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed -- many by police fire -- during the weeks leading up to Sheikh Hasina's ouster, as crowds stormed her official residence in Dhaka and ended her iron-fisted 15-year rule.</p>

<p>The interior ministry said in a statement that Sheikh Hasina's passport and those belonging to former government ministers and ex-lawmakers no longer in their posts "have to be revoked".</p>

<p>It also poses a diplomatic dilemma for Sheikh Hasina's current host, regional powerhouse India.</p>

<p><strong>'Disproportionate force'</strong></p>

<p>Post the revolt and storming of her official residence on August 5, Ms Hasina fled to India</p>

<p>While India is hosting Sheikh Hasina, PM Modi has also offered his support to the new Bangladeshi leader, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who is heading the caretaker administration.</p>

<p>"The former prime minister, her advisers, the former cabinet and all members of the dissolved national assembly were eligible for diplomatic passports by virtue of the positions they held," Dhaka's home ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>"If they have been removed or retired from their posts, their and their spouses' diplomatic passports have to be revoked."</p>

<p>Dhaka's new authorities said that Sheikh Hasina, and other former top officials during her tenure, could apply for a standard passport, but that those documents were contingent on approval.</p>

<p>"When the aforementioned people apply afresh for ordinary passports, two security agencies have to clear their application for their passports to be issued," the ministry added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's government was accused of widespread abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of political opponents.</p>

<p>The UN rights office asessing the protest response had said in a preliminary report last week that there were "strong indications, warranting further independent investigation, that the security forces used unnecessary and disproportionate force".</p>

<p>Yunus has said his administration would "provide whatever support" UN investigators need.</p>

<p>Separately, a Bangladeshi war crimes tribunal set up by Sheikh Hasina has launched three "mass murder" probes into its founder over the recent unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan police offered a cash reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of a suspected serial killer who escaped from a Nairobi police cell.</p>

<p>Police launched a manhunt on Tuesday after Collins Jumaisi, who is accused of murdering and dismembering dozens of women, broke out of a police station in an upmarket area of the Kenyan capital along with 12 Eritreans.</p>

<p>Five officers appeared in court on Wednesday suspected of aiding Jumaisi's escape and have been freed on a 200,000 Kenyan shilling ($1,500) bond, despite prosecutors seeking an order to keep them in custody for 14 days.</p>

<p>The magistrate dismissed the prosecutor's arguments that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) had yet to retrieve surveillance footage.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old Jumaisi, described by police as a "vampire, a psychopath", was arrested last month after the gruesome discovery of a number of mutilated female bodies in a rubbish dump in Mukuru slum area in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.</p>

<p>Police say he has confessed to murdering 42 women over a two-year period from 2022, with his wife his first victim, but the suspect has claimed he was tortured after his arrest.</p>

<p>Officers said Jumaisi and the other men escaped by cutting through a wire mesh roof where he was being held, before scaling a perimeter wall.</p>

<p>"A significant cash reward will be provided to anyone with credible information leading to the suspect's arrest," the DCI said, without specifying an amount.</p>

<p>It is the second time in barely six months that a suspect in a high-profile case has escaped from custody in Nairobi.</p>

<p>The latest twist to the grisly story has appalled many Kenyans, with the bodies also found just 100 metres (yards) from a police station.</p>

<p>Kenya's police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority, has said it was looking into whether there was any police involvement or a "failure to act to prevent" the killings.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of carrying out unlawful killings or running hit squads, but few have faced justice.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim government has sought $1 billion from the World Bank as budgetary support.</p>

<p>The call came from the country's Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan's meeting with Abdoulaye Seck, the World Bank's Country Director for Bangladesh and Bhutan, in Dhaka on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He made the plea as the ministry owes more than 2 billion dollars to suppliers in import costs of power and energy, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Fouzul Kabir Khan mentioned that the interim government, which was formed with many pressing mandates, is due to settle a $2 billion debt left by the previous government in the power sector.</p>

<p>He said they have already suspended activities under the much-criticized Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply Act 2010 and abolished the government's power to set energy prices without any public hearing.</p>

<p>On August 5, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, was ousted from her country and power, ending her rule since January 2009.</p>

<p>This event was seen as a massive escalation, with what initially started as student's protests and resulted in a major crisis in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Earlier on August 8, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romanian prosecutors have requested that Andrew Tate be detained for 30 more days, the internet personality's representative said on Thursday, after he was among six people taken into custody in an investigation into human trafficking and sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>The former professional kickboxer and his brother Tristan were among six people detained on Wednesday for an initial 24 hours after Romania's anti-organised crime prosecuting unit DIICOT conducted four home searches in Ilfov county and the Bucharest municipality.</p>

<p>He was already indicted in mid-2023 along with his brother and two Romanian female suspects for human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, allegations they denied.</p>

<p>"The Tate brothers have been issued a proposal for 30 days preventative arrest by the Romanian DIICOT," Tate's representative said in a statement, adding that a hearing to decide on the detention would be held at 1200 GMT in Bucharest.</p>

<p>The representative did not address the fresh allegations against Tate in the statement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Before their latest detention the brothers had been subject to a travel ban, under which they were free to travel within Romania but not leave the country.</p>

<p>A self-described misogynist, social media influencer Tate has gained millions of fans by promoting an ultra-masculine lifestyle that critics say denigrates women.</p>

<p>A post on Tate's account on social media platform X said "All they try to do is damage my name with complete bullshit", without specifying who was being referred to.</p>

<p>DIICOT said in a statement that it had ordered the detention of six people for crimes including forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.</p>

<p>It said that it had requested that three of the detained defendants remain in custody while another one be put under house arrest.</p>

<p>According to DIICOT, two of the accused used the "loverboy" method, which involves convincing victims that they are in a romantic relationship, to force 34 victims into making pornography which they then sold online for proceeds of over $2.8 million and 887,000 tokens.</p>

<p>DIICOT alleges that one of the defendants forced a 17-year-old minor to produce pornography in Britain and Romania creating profits of $1.5 million. It also alleges that the same defendant repeatedly had sexual relations with a 15-year-old victim.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese scientists have discovered a "brand-new method" of producing large quantities of water using lunar soil brought back from a 2020 expedition, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>In 2020, China's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/chinese-scientists-find-traces-of-water-in-lunar-soil-brought-by-chang-e-5-mission-6178348" target="_blank">Chang'e-5 mission</a> marked the first time humans retrieved lunar samples in 44 years. Researchers from the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered that the minerals in this 'moon soil' contain large amounts of hydrogen, which reacts with other elements when heated to very high temperatures, producing water vapour, CCTV reported.</p>

<p>"After three years of in-depth research and repeated verification, a brand-new method of using lunar soil to produce large amounts of water was discovered, which is expected to provide important design basis for the construction of future lunar scientific research stations and space stations," said CCTV.</p>

<p>The discovery could have important implications for China's decades-long project of building a permanent lunar outpost amid a U.S.-China race to find and mine the moon's resources.</p>

<p>NASA head Bill Nelson has repeatedly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasa-head-bill-nelson-says-china-hiding-military-presence-in-space-5466869" target="_blank">raised the alarm</a> about the rapid advances in China's space programme and the possibility of Beijing dominating the most resource-rich locations on the moon.</p>

<p>Using the new method, one tonne of lunar soil will be able to produce about 51-76 kg of water, equivalent to more than a hundred 500ml bottles of water, or the daily drinking water consumption of 50 people, the state broadcaster said.</p>

<p>China hopes that recent and future lunar expeditions will set the foundations to build the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), an initiative it is co-leading with Russia.</p>

<p>China's space agency has set 2035 as the date by when a "basic station" on the moon's south pole will be built, with a moon-orbiting space station added by 2045.</p>

<p>The announcement of the discovery comes at a time when Chinese scientists are already conducting experiments on lunar samples brought back in June by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinas-change-6-probe-carrying-samples-from-far-side-of-moon-returns-to-earth-5965227" target="_blank">Chang'e-6 mission.</a></p>

<p>While the Chang'e-5 mission brought back samples from the near side of the moon, Chang'e-6 retrieved lunar soil from the far side of the moon, which perpetually faces away from the Earth.</p>

<p>The importance of lunar water goes beyond making permanent human presence viable. NASA's Nelson told NPR in May that water found on the moon could be used to create hydrogen rocket fuel which could fuel further space exploration to Mars and other destinations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In his upcoming memoir retired US Army Lieutenant General Herbert Raymond McMaster alleges that Russian President Vladimir Putin manipulated former President Donald Trump by exploiting his ego.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herbert Raymond McMaster, a retired United States Army lieutenant general who served as the 25th National Security Advisor from 2017 to 2018, claimed in his new memoir how Russian President Vladimir Putin influenced former President Donald Trump during his time in office. He also claimed that Putin exploited Trump's ego for his own advantage.</p>

<p>All these bold claims appeared in McMaster's book <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/at-war-with-ourselves-h-r-mcmaster?variant=41223421394978"><em>'At War With Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House'</em></a>, which was published by HarperCollins and will hit the bookstalls on August 27.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/21/trump-putin-hr-mcmaster-memoir"><em>The Guardian</em></a> obtained a copy and outlined McMaster's account of the relationship between Putin and Trump. "Putin, a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump's ego and insecurities with flattery," McMaster writes.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-made-rs-2-crore-from-bible-sales-holds-rs-8-crore-in-crypto-report-6349300"><strong>Also Read | Donald Trump Made Rs 2 Crore From 'Bible' Sales, Holds Rs 8 Crore In Crypto: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>"Putin had described Trump as 'a very outstanding person, talented, without any doubt' and Trump had revealed his vulnerability to this approach, his affinity for strongmen, and his belief that he alone could forge a good relationship with Putin," McMaster continues.</p>

<p>"Like his predecessors George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Trump was overconfident in his ability to improve relations with the dictator in the Kremlin. The fact that most foreign policy experts in Washington advocated for a tough approach to the Kremlin seemed only to drive the president to the opposite approach," he writes.</p>

<p>McMaster clarifies that Trump developed his obsession with the Mueller report, which investigated Russian interference in the US presidential election in 2016. This fixation made it difficult to discuss anything related to Putin or Russia with him.</p>

<p>According to McMaster, Trump linked every topic involving Russia to the report and to accusations from Democrats and other critics that his campaign, and Trump himself, had colluded with Russia's disinformation efforts to influence the election.</p>

<p>Although special counsel Mueller found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy, he found out that the Trump campaign tried to conceal its contacts with Russian officials by hiding the truth several times. Further, Trump tried to interfere with or obstruct the investigation as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much-anticipated visit to conflict-hit Ukraine, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk said India could play an essential and constructive role in resolving the Russia-Ukraine war. Mr Tusk also said that PM Modi's visit to Ukraine will be "historic".&nbsp;PM Modi has expressed his concern over the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia, asserting that India supports dialogue and diplomacy for early restoration of peace and stability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poland PM also noted that PM Modi has confirmed his willingness that he is ready for a peaceful, and rightful end to war.</p>

<p>In a joint press meeting with PM Modi in Warsaw, Mr Tusk said, "We began with a clarification on very emotional issues. PM Modi confirmed his willingness that he is ready for peaceful, rightful and immediate end to war. We believe that India can play an essential and very constructive role. So, this announcement is very important for us. PM, in 10 hours you will visit Ukraine. We believe that your visit to Ukraine will be historic."</p>

<p>PM Modi today said India firmly believes that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/answer-to-any-problem-not-in-battlefield-pm-modi-on-ukraine-conflict-6393006">no problem can be solved on the battlefield</a>, adding that it is ready to provide all possible co-operation for the restoration of peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p>After<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-meets-polish-counterpart-donald-tusk-discusses-bilateral-ties-6392402"> holding wide-ranging talks with his Poland counterpart</a>, PM Modi said, "The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of deep concern for all of us. India firmly believes that no problem can be solved on the battlefield."</p>

<p>"The loss of innocent lives in any crisis has become the biggest challenge for the entire humanity. We support dialogue and diplomacy for early restoration of peace and stability," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the strategic ties between the two countries. This is the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Poland in nearly half a century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the second leg of his two-nation trip, PM Modi will be in Kyiv for around seven hours on Friday. He will leave for the Ukrainian capital onboard a train this evening and the journey will take around 10 hours. It will be the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Burundi has confirmed 171 cases of mpox, the health minister said on Thursday, following confirmation of the first cases in the country last month.</p>

<p>Formerly known as monkeypox, mpox is an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/explained-what-is-mpox-and-why-has-who-declared-it-a-global-health-emergency-826799" target="_blank">infectious disease</a> caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals that can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>"We already had a cumulative of 171 confirmed positive cases, 137 of which are still active," Health Minister Polycarpe Ndayikeza told AFP.</p>

<p>"So far there have been no deaths from mpox in Burundi," he added.</p>

<p>Three cases of mpox were detected in Burundi in late July, with the health ministry reporting 153 confirmed cases on August 18.</p>

<p>"The epidemic continues to gain ground," the ministry said last month, adding it was in the process of creating isolation wards in district hospitals to care for mpox patients.</p>

<p>An official told AFP the cases detected appeared to be the "new variant" spreading in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

<p>While mpox has been known for decades, a new more deadly and more transmissible strain -- known as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mpox-is-not-the-new-covid-says-who-6377283" target="_blank">Clade 1b</a> -- has driven the recent surge in cases.</p>

<p>Clade 1b causes death in about 3.6 percent of cases, with children more at risk, according to the World Health Organization, which has declared an international health emergency over the latest outbreak.</p>

<p>Cases are surging in the region with outbreaks reported in the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, but have also been detected in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mpox-virus-asias-1st-known-case-of-new-deadlier-mpox-strain-confirmed-in-thailand-6394012" target="_blank"> Asia </a>and Europe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asia's first known case of a new, deadlier Mpox virus strain has been confirmed in Thailand. The patient who has been tested positive for the new strain landed in Bangkok on August 14.</p>

<p>The patient had travelled from Africa to the United Kingdom before landing in Thailand.</p>

<p>After multiple lab tests on the 66-year-old European patient, it was confirmed that he was infected with mpox Clade 1b, according to The Department of Disease Control.</p>

<p>"Thailand's Department of Disease Control wishes to confirm the lab test result which shows mpox Clade 1b in a European patient," said the department in an official statement.</p>

<p>"We have monitored 43 people who have been in close contact with the patient and so far they have shown no symptoms, but we must continue monitoring for a total of 21 days," the department added.</p>

<p>Thailand so far has detected a staggering 800 mpox Clade 2 cases since 2022.</p>

<p>No mpox case has been detected in India as of now. In order to ensure safety of the nation's citizens, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/aiims-issues-protocol-for-handling-mpox-patients-as-cases-rise-globally-6379031" target="_blank">All India Institute for Medical Sciences</a> (AIIMS) has issued a protocol for handling suspected cases of mpox in India</p>

<p>For suspected, confirmed cases of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-airports-borders-on-alert-as-global-monkeypox-mpox-cases-rise-10-points-6372392" target="_blank">Mpox in India</a>, government hospitals in Delhi have been directed to set up isolation rooms</p>

<p>Authorities in airports, ports and borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan, have been directed by the centre to remain on high alert about passengers who show any symptoms of the virus.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is Mpox?</strong></h2>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines it as "an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick."</p>

<h2><strong>How Does The Virus Spread?</strong></h2>

<p>In Humans, it spreads through touch, kissing, or sex. In the case of a pregnant person being diagnosed with the virus, they may pass it on to their unborn child, says WHO. People diagnosed with diseases such as HIV are at an increased risk of facing complications from the virus</p>

<h2><strong>Can The Virus Be Prevented?</strong></h2>

<p>According to WHO, the virus "can be prevented by avoiding physical contact with someone who has mpox. Vaccination can help prevent infection for people at risk."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the world's largest diamonds ever unearthed -- a rough 2,492-carat stone -- has been found in Botswana, a Canadian mining company that discovered the gem announced Thursday.</p>

<p>The diamond was found in the Karowe Diamond Mine in northeastern Botswana, about 430 kilometres (270 miles) from the capital Gaborone, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canadas-lucara-sells-worlds-largest-uncut-diamond-for-53-million-1755069" target="_blank">Lucara Diamond Corp</a>. said in a statement.</p>

<p>Lucara did not give a value for the find or mention its quality.</p>

<p>In terms of carats, the stone appears to be not far behind the largest gem-quality diamond ever mined, the 3,016.75-carat Cullinan Diamond discovered in South Africa in 1905.</p>

<p>"We are ecstatic about the recovery of this extraordinary 2,492 carat diamond," Lucara president and CEO William Lamb said in the statement.</p>

<p>This find was "one of the largest rough diamonds ever unearthed" and detected using the company's Mega Diamond Recovery X-ray technology, the statement said.</p>

<p>President Mokgweetsi Masisi was due to view the massive stone later Thursday.</p>

<p>Botswana is one of the world's largest producers of diamonds, which are its main source of income.</p>

<p>Before the find announced on Thursday, the largest diamond recovered in Botswana was a 1,758-carat stone mined by Lucara in 2019 and named <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sewelo-diamond-louis-vuitton-buys-worlds-second-largest-diamond-2166524" target="_blank">Sewelo.</a></p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz may not have been present at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday evening, but his fashion sense was certainly felt. On Tuesday, former US President Barack Obama praised Walz's signature flannel shirts, saying they "don't come from some political consultant, they come from his closet."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Obama on Tim Walz: Let me tell you something.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The next day, Walz's wife, Gwen, reacted to Obama's comment by posting a photo of her husband sewing a button on one of his beloved flannel shirts. "It's so true, @BarackObama. Tim loves his flannels," she wrote on X.</p>

<p>Obama reposted the photo, expressing his admiration for Walz. "I love this guy. Watch tonight to hear from @Tim_Walz - a man who knows what leadership looks like - and how to fix his own flannels."&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The exchange came just before Tim Walz accepted his party's nomination for vice president on Wednesday. Walz's flannel style has been a hallmark of his folksy, down-to-earth persona, and it appears to have resonated with voters. His convention address was met with enthusiasm from the packed arena.</p>

<p>Walz thanked the delegates for "bringing the joy" to the election. "We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason: We love this country," he said, as thousands of delegates held up 'Coach Walz"' placards in red, white and blue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tim Walz's speech was filled with intimate details about his family's struggles, including their battle with infertility. He spoke about the importance of respecting others' choices, saying, "In Minnesota, we respect our neighbours and the personal choices they make and even if we wouldn't make those same choices for ourselves we've got a golden rule: mine your own damn business."</p>

<p>A heartwarming clip shared on social media showed Walz's son, Gus, in tears beside his mother and sister, Hope, as they clapped and cheered for the governor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine extends the geopolitical scope of India's foreign policy. No Indian Prime Minister has visited Poland for the last 45 years. In recent years, Poland has acquired considerable weight within the European Union (EU). It is a large country in size and population, and it has seen impressive economic growth since 1992, making it the EU's sixth-largest economy.</p>

<p>Modi has visited several countries that had not seen a prime ministerial visit from India for a very long time. This is part of a strategy to enlarge India's global footprint in line with our aspirations to play a bigger role on the world stage. In that sense, a visit to Poland would have seemed overdue.</p>

<h2><strong>A Ukraine Visit Had Become Unavoidable</strong></h2>

<p>No Indian Prime Minister has visited Ukraine since its independence in 1991. India has had productive ties with Ukraine, especially in the defence area, but these have been adversely affected by its conflict with Russia flowing from the regime change in the country in 2014. Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to visit Ukraine. Whether the conditions for a prime ministerial visit to Ukraine at the strictly bilateral level exist currently can be debated. At the geopolitical level, however, it could be argued that a visit had become more or less unavoidable.</p>

<p>Poland's hostility to Russia, anchored in history, is profound. The country's current president and the foreign minister in particular, as well as the prime minister, reflect it in their statements. This visceral animus towards Russia also explains the depth of Poland's ties with the US. Since 2008, Poland has hosted elements of the US anti-ballistic missile shield that the Russians believe is targeted against them, though the US claims that it is directed against Iran's missile capability. Poland strongly backs Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. As it happens, the western part of Ukraine is historically linked to Poland.</p>

<h2><strong>Is This An Appropriate Time?</strong></h2>

<p>It can be argued that India needs to reach out to Central and East European countries to expand its political footprint within the EU, with which it seeks to strengthen ties. The issue, however, is whether it is opportune to do so at this moment when both Ukraine and Poland are locked up in a military confrontation with Russia as front-line states with US and NATO support.</p>

<p>A proxy war is being conducted against Russia through Ukraine, with full Polish support, with the declared goal of imposing a strategic defeat on Russia, causing its economic collapse and isolating it internationally, even if these goals have not been met yet. The question arises whether we need to defer to Russia's sensitivities and concerns when it has been our privileged strategic partner for decades and has stood by us when we were under pressure from the West.</p>

<p>To what extent we should show solidarity with Russia and shun its adversaries when we have no quarrels with them, and, in this context, to what degree we should preserve the independence of our foreign policy and our strategic autonomy vis a vis all our major partners in the East and the West, are pertinent questions.</p>

<p>One can, of course, argue that we have not been deterred from forging increasingly close ties with the US, which is the principal promoter of the proxy war against Russia, or from our efforts to expand ties with the EU, or, within it, with countries like France and Germany, who are fuelling this proxy war too. This logic should dictate that we should not be inhibited from reaching out to Ukraine and Poland.</p>

<h2><strong>The Limits Of Foreign Policy</strong></h2>

<p>But then, foreign policy is not based on logic or principles applied mechanically. Policymakers have to assess where the balance of interests lies and the likely cost of not weighing the consequences of options taken. If we want to keep Russia firmly on our side, are there options we should eschew to avoid misunderstanding or create a perception that we are harming Moscow's legitimate interests? We can, of course, assume that Russia is a mature power with great experience in diplomacy, and that it can assess whether a decision taken by us is to further our legitimate national interest and not intended to hurt Russia's interests. India and Russia need not be on the same page on everything. Even the US and its allies in Europe have differences.</p>

<p>The issue in the case of Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine at this time is that both countries have eschewed the language of dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the Ukraine conflict, with Ukraine and its NATO backers favouring some military success on the ground in order to force Russia to come to the negotiating table. This strategy assumes that Russia wants to avoid a war with NATO, which gives room to the military alliance to support limited escalatory actions in order to keep imposing costs on Moscow. This is the NATO version of an attrition strategy that Russia mirrors when it assumes that NATO will get tired of supporting the war as it is imposing costs on member states, and that public fatigue is already setting in.</p>

<h2><strong>Being Consistent</strong></h2>

<p>From India's point of view, after Modi's visit to Russia for the annual summit with a clear intention to develop stronger economic ties, and the signal given to the West once again that India will preserve the equities of its ties with Moscow, a visit to Ukraine could be put on the agenda.</p>

<p>Modi seems to have told Putin during his visit that Zelenskyy was pressing him to visit Ukraine and that he planned to go. Putin, apparently, did not demur. It could be reasoned that for Modi to counsel dialogue and diplomacy in Russia as well as internationally, and then baulk at visiting Ukraine as part of promoting his message of dialogue and diplomacy on Ukrainian soil, would have seemed inconsistent.</p>

<h2><strong>The Kursk Incursion By Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>Regrettably, Zelenskyy, by launching his highly symbolic incursion into Kursk a few days before Modi's visit, has undercut its purpose. The US and others have been prodding India to play a helpful role in promoting a resolution of the conflict in Ukraine in view of New Delhi's close ties with Moscow. They have been disingenuous in promoting this line. If the US wants to seriously engage in a dialogue with Russia to find ways to end the conflict, it does not need India's intercession or that of any other country. Russia has said many times in the past that the key to a solution lies in US hands, not those of Europe or Ukraine.</p>

<p>In his post on X before departure, Modi said that in Ukraine, he wanted to "share his perspectives on the peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict" with Zelenskyy. This intriguing message suggests that he has a vision of how this conflict could be ended, which means he has in mind a broad perspective plan. In Moscow, Modi had said that he had well understood how Putin perceived the situation. But now, after Kursk, the Russian position has hardened, with Putin stating that there is no longer any room left for talks.</p>

<h2><strong>A Tricky Time In The US</strong></h2>

<p>No doubt, Zelenskyy will share his perspectives with Modi. And then what? Will India get into some sort of a mediatory role? Is that feasible when the US is in the throes of the presidential election, with Biden a lame-duck president who cannot change course because any retreat towards a search for peace after fuelling the conflict all these years could do damage to the Democratic party, as it would imply a failure of Biden's Ukraine policy?</p>

<p>Even if Zelenskyy's decision to make a territorial incursion into Russia has undermined Modi's peace effort, India could always claim that in view of the worsening of the situation, Modi's message against escalation and in favour of peace had become even more pressing and relevant.</p>

<p>Significantly, <em>The Economist </em>sees Modi's visit to Ukraine as a "redemption", implying that India has sinned and now it was seeking forgiveness from the West. This underlines how the West sees Modi's visit. Presumably, this arrogant and presumptuous journal believes Modi is awaiting absolution from the high priests of defunct British imperialism.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the third night of the Democratic National Convention, actress and producer Mindy Kaling captivated the audience with her heartfelt support for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Kaling began with a lighthearted remark, saying, "The real reason I'm here is that deep down, I truly believe that as a woman of colour and a single mother of three, it is incredibly important that I be appointed ambassador to Italy."</p>

<p>Moving on, the actress, known for her roles in <em>The Office</em> and <em>The Mindy Project, </em>shared a personal story, shedding light on her connection to Harris and their shared Indian heritage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She introduced herself as "the woman who courageously outed Kamala Harris as Indian in an Instagram cooking video". This light-hearted remark referred to an event several years ago when Harris, then a California senator, visited Kaling's home to film a cooking segment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She wasn't Madam Vice President then; she was my senator, and we were filming a video where she came to my home to cook dosas, a South Indian dish," Kaling recounted.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Reflecting on their meeting, Kaling described the immediate bond they formed, despite her initial nervousness about hosting a senator. "It's not every day that a senator comes over, and I was pretty nervous, but when she arrived, we immediately hit it off," she shared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She recalled how they connected over their shared love for their mothers, both of whom died from cancer. "Both of our mothers were immigrants from India who came to America and committed their lives to serving others," Kaling said. Mindy Kaling's mother was an OB-GYN, while Harris' mother was a scientist dedicated to finding a cure for cancer.</p>

<p>One of the memorable moments for Kaling was discovering Harris' culinary skills. "But the thing I remember the most about the Vice President is that Kamala Harris can cook," Kaling said. She fondly recalled Harris' thoughtfulness, particularly towards Kaling's daughter, Kit. "She was so much better than me, but she also knew my family was watching. So as she gently corrected my sloppy dosa, she was complimenting me every step of the way, making sure that my daughter heard how good of a cook I am."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kaling used this anecdote to highlight Harris' character. "She had no desire to be seen as better than anyone else. She just wanted my kid to be impressed with her mom," the actress said. &nbsp;"It is that warmth, that generosity of spirit that I know she will bring to the White House as our next president," she endorsed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russia-Ukraine conflict rages on, entering its 31st month, with no end in sight. The battle for Bakhmut, a crucial Ukrainian city, has been one of the most intense, leaving destruction and devastation in its wake on both sides. The town, once a vibrant salt mining hub with a population of 70,000, has become a symbol of the conflict's brutality and endurance.</p>

<p>The city's devastation extends beyond its battlefield; it now houses a poignant symbol of Ukraine's resilience. The National University of Ukraine, renowned for producing Olympic champions, has been repurposed as a rehabilitation center for soldiers wounded in the war. Vadim, a Ukraine war veteran, shares how he's still fighting a battle after severely injuring his legs in Bakhmut.</p>

<p>"I fought in Kyiv and Bakhmut. The war is like hell. A Russian missile hit me, and I was blown away, hitting my head and fainting," he tells NDTV. Vadim suffered severe leg injuries, leaving him with a 50-50 chance of regaining mobility.</p>

<p>"I can't stand on my legs now. There is a 50-50 chance of getting back on my legs," he says. &nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>Despite his ordeal, Vadim remains optimistic, inspired by his mental strength and the resilience of his family. His 19-year-old son, injured thrice, returned to the battle each time, while another son currently fights on the frontlines.</p>

<p>"I am quite optimistic," he says with a determined smile. "If I can get better, it will inspire other soldiers too. Mental strength is 100% very important. If your brain is defeated, your body will be too."</p>

</div>

<p>The battle for Bakhmut, a salt mining town, has been the longest and bloodiest, with both sides suffering heavy losses. Wagner, a private Russian mercenary group, claimed victory last year after an intense 224-day battle, but Ukraine disputes this.</p>

<p>As the conflict intensifies, Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive, capturing towns and villages in the Kursk region. The biggest attack on Russian soil since World War II has rattled Russia and penetrated several kilometres into Russia's Kursk region. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine now controls over 1,250 square kilometres and 92 settlements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Searches resumed Thursday for the last person missing after a superyacht carrying UK tech tycoon <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-tech-tycoon-mike-lynch-daughters-body-found-on-yacht-wreck-report-6387632" target="_blank">Mike Lynch</a> sank off Sicily, with divers recovering a fifth body from the wreck.</p>

<p>Specialist divers working with an underwater robot on Wednesday pulled up four bodies from the wreck of the "Bayesian", while another was pulled up on Thursday morning, according to AFP reporters.</p>

<p>The grim discovery brings the death count so far to six, after the body of a man believed to be the yacht's chef was found shortly after the ship went down in a storm before dawn on Monday.</p>

<p>There was no official identification of the bodies, but Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah were among the six passengers missing.</p>

<p>The 56-metre (185 feet) British-flagged sailing boat had been anchored some 700 metres off Porticello, near Palermo on the north of the Italian island, when it was struck by a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-a-waterspout-may-have-sunk-uk-tech-tycoon-mike-lynchs-yacht-6385210" target="_blank">waterspout</a> -- akin to a mini-tornado.</p>

<p>It sank within minutes.</p>

<p>Fifteen people were rescued, including Lynch's wife and a woman with a one-year-old baby.</p>

<p>Lynch and his daughter, his lawyer Christopher Morvillo and his wife Neda, and Jonathan Bloomer, the chair of Morgan Stanley International, and his wife Judy, were all reported missing.</p>

<p>Many questions remain about why the yacht sank, and on Thursday the head of the company which built the boat said the tragedy could have been avoided.</p>

<p>"Everything that was done reveals a very long summation of errors," said Giovanni Costantino, head of the Italian Sea Group, which includes the Perini Navi company that built "Bayesian".</p>

<p>He told Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper that bad weather was forecast and all the passengers should have been gathered at the assembly point, all the doors and hatches closed.</p>

<p>Security camera footage of the ship from the shore showed the lights on its mast going out, which Costantino said indicated a short circuit, meaning that the ship had already taken on water.</p>

<p>"A Perini ship resisted Hurricane Katrina, a category 5 (hurricane). Does it seem to you that it can't resist a tornado from here?" he told the newspaper.</p>

<p>"It is good practice when the ship is at anchor to have a guard on the bridge, and if there was one he could not have failed to see the storm coming.</p>

<p>"Instead it took on water with the guests still in the cabin... They ended up in a trap, those poor people ended up like mice."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

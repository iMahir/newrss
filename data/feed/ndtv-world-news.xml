       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Sunday it was divine intervention that helped him survive an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, and called on Americans to unite.</p>

<p>"It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening," the former US president and White House hopeful said on social media, urging fellow Americans to unite in "not allowing Evil to Win."</p>

<p>Trump was hit in the ear in an assassination attempt by a gunman at a campaign rally Saturday, in a chaotic and shocking incident set to supercharge political tensions ahead of the US presidential election.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was rushed off stage with blood streaked across his face after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, while the shooter and a bystander were killed and two spectators were critically injured.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in November's deeply polarized presidential election, said there was "no place in America for this kind of violence."</p>

<p>"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Sunday morning, confirming that he would attend the Republican National Convention, which begins on Monday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said on Sunday it did not believe the US administration was responsible for Saturday's assassination attempt on US presidential candidate Donald Trump, but that it had created an atmosphere that provoked the attack.</p>

<p>Trump was shot in the ear during a rally in Pennsylvania, in an attack now being investigated as an assassination attempt. The attacker was shot dead and law enforcement officials said they had not yet identified a motive.</p>

<p>"We do not believe that the attempt to eliminate and assassinate Trump was organised by the current authorities," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</p>

<p>"But the atmosphere around candidate Trump ... provoked what America is confronting today."</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying there was no place for that kind of violence in America. Peskov said Russia condemned any violence in the course of the political struggle.</p>

<p>His comments echoed those of some of Trump's Republican allies, who immediately pinned the blame on Biden.</p>

<p>"After numerous attempts to remove candidate Trump from the political arena - using first legal tools, the courts, prosecutors, attempts to politically discredit and compromise the candidate - it was obvious to all outside observers that his life was in danger," Peskov said.</p>

<p>He added that there were no plans for Putin to call Trump in light of the incident.</p>

<p>World leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, rapidly condemned Saturday's attack, expressing shock, denouncing political violence, and wishing Trump a quick recovery.</p>

<p>Russia's foreign ministry used the shooting to urge Washington to stop funding Ukraine's military and concentrate on improving domestic law enforcement instead.</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on Telegram, responded to remarks made by independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr following the shooting.</p>

<p>"Dear Bobby and all those who vote in the United States to supply Zelenskiy with arms," Zakharova said.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better for this money to finance the American police and other services that are supposed to ensure law and order within the United States?"</p>

<p>Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has brought Russia's ties with the West to their lowest ebb since the height of the Cold War.</p>

<p>Asked whether the Trump attack could affect the legitimacy of the United States' upcoming election, Peskov said: "It is not for us to judge. We have not the slightest desire to interfere. This is a U.S. matter."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>K P Sharma Oli was appointed Nepal's Prime Minister for the third time on Sunday to lead the new coalition government that faces the daunting challenge of providing political stability in the country.</p>

<p>K P Sharma Oli, 72, succeeds Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda who lost the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Friday, leading to the formation of the new government process as per Article 76 (2) of the Constitution.</p>

<p>President Ram Chandra Paudel appointed K P Sharma Oli as the new Prime Minister of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML)-Nepali Congress (NC) coalition.</p>

<p>K P Sharma Oli along with the new Cabinet will be sworn in on Monday.</p>

<p>Late on Friday night, K P Sharma Oli staked his claim to become the next Prime Minister with the backing of NC president Sher Bahadur Deuba and submitted the signatures of 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members -- 77 from his party and 88 from the NC.</p>

<p>K P Sharma Oli served as Nepal's Prime Minister from October 11, 2015, to August 3, 2016 and then, from February 5, 2018, to July 13, 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>US presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt by a gunman at a campaign rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">?BREAKING: CLEAREST VIDEO OF THOMAS MATTHEW CROOKS SHOOTING AT PRESIDENT TRUMP‼️<br />
<br />
A newly obtained video from TMZ shows the shooter, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, firing at former President Donald Trump before being shot. In the background, a woman is heard… <a href="https://t.co/UxQTwPOMIU">pic.twitter.com/UxQTwPOMIU</a></p>
— Only Mob King ?? (@OnlyMobKing) <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyMobKing/status/1812342969866850759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The FBI identified the gunman, who was shot dead by the US Secret Service, as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from the US state's Bethel Park, according to US media.</p>

<p>The video published by TMZ shows the alleged shooter laying on his belly on a rooftop and aiming a rifle.</p>

<p>"The guy has longer brown hair, and he seems to be wearing a grey shirt/khaki pants -- and as you can see, he's carefully trying to pinpoint a target from afar before pulling the trigger," TMZ reported.</p>

<p>The man is not shown firing in the published footage. But a quick succession of gunshots is heard followed by screams from people off-camera.</p>

<p>"He's turning this way, be careful guys," a man is heard saying.</p>

<p>"Somebody got shot," another voice says. "He's right there, laying down."</p>

<p>"Dude, that's exactly why we need... Trump here," another man is heard saying.</p>

<p>"Secret Service don't (mess) around," another man says.</p>

<p>A second video published by TMZ shows shaky footage of the same rooftop and a blurred body.</p>

<p>"You can see the guy there," a person off-camera says. "I think they hit him because the guy, he looks dead."</p>

<p>Another video posted by a TikTok user shows Trump touching his right ear just after multiple bangs are heard.</p>

<p>In the same frame, a security force sniper, positioned on a roof behind the Republican presidential candidate, is seen taking aim with a rifle mounted on a stand.</p>

<p>AFP did not independently verify the videos, and it is unclear whether the sniper fired the weapon.</p>

<p>Trump then crouches down behind the lectern as Secret Service agents move in around him. Screams are heard in the crowd.</p>

<p>He is later escorted off stage by agents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump dodged a bullet, literally. The 78-year-old had just started his speech during a Saturday campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when the shots rang out and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-moment-donald-trump-was-attacked-at-pennsylvania-rally-6100971">one of the bullets grazed his ear.</a></p>

<p>Several video clips showed how Trump was swarmed and covered up by his Secret Service agents moments after the shooting. But now, a show-motion video establishes how a simple head tilt saved Trump from the assassination attempt. It shows Trump tilting his head just seconds before the shot was fired.</p>

<p>He grabbed his right ear and brought his hand down to look at it before dropping to his knees behind the podium. He emerged about a minute later, his face streaked with blood. Fight! Fight! Fight!" he said, pumping his fist in the air.</p>

<p>One person who attended the rally was killed and two other spectators were critically wounded, the Secret Service said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attack will likely reshape this year's US presidential race while raising sharp questions about the security provided to the Republican candidate.</p>

<p>Trump left the Butler area under Secret Service protection and later arrived at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.</p>

<p>He was "doing well" and appeared to have suffered no major injury besides a wound on his upper right ear, the Trump campaign said.</p>

<p>20-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-as-20-year-old-thomas-matthew-crooks-news-agency-reuters-6102245#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> has been identified by the FBI as the "subject involved" in what it termed an attempted assassination. He was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He was shot dead by Secret Service agents after he opened fire from the roof of a building about 140 metres from the stage where Trump was speaking. An AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle was recovered near his body.</p>

<p>"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. "Much bleeding took place," Trump said later on his Truth Social platform following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles (50 km) north of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The attack was the first shooting of a US president or major party candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred less than four months before the November 5 election, when Trump faces an election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden. Most opinion polls including those by Reuters/Ipsos show the two locked in a close contest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people, including the shooter, died late Saturday when a man opened fire on a birthday party in a village in France, authorities said.</p>

<p>The man approached a neighbouring house where a 20-year-old was celebrating his birthday with his family in Espinasse-Vozelle, a central French village of around 1,000 inhabitants about 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Clermont-Ferrand.</p>

<p>He fired shots at the party guests, killing three of them, and then himself, the local prefecture said.</p>

<p>The young man celebrating his birthday and his father were both killed.</p>

<p>Police were still piecing together the "how and the why" of the attack, authorities said. The man appears to have shot at passing motorists before the deadly assault.</p>

<p>Jerome Piques, a local prosecutor, told AFP that the man, who was not among the party guests, approached the neighbouring house via a path linking both properties at around 9:30 pm (1930 GMT) before firing his gun loaded with lead bullets.</p>

<p>Four people were in hospital after being wounded in the shooting, but their injuries were not life-threatening, he said.</p>

<p>Fifteen others, who witnessed the shooting, were under observation by psychologists.</p>

<p>"It's a shock," Michel Marien, the mayor of Espinasse-Vozelle, told AFP. "We don't know what triggered this, how a person loses control and does something like this."</p>

<p>Police said the shooter, in his early 50s, appeared to have no prior convictions. The only trace of any irregularity were documents relating to unpaid family support payments, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>"The exact sequence of events still needs to be checked," the source said.</p>

<p>A large number of police and emergency services were on site Sunday.</p>

<p>Participants at the village's Bastille Day celebration that was going on nearby were not harmed as police cordoned off the area.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign, and raised fears of further political violence in the run-up to November's election.</p>

<p>Trump's Republican allies painted him as a hero on Saturday, seizing on the image of him with his ear bloodied and fist raised, appearing to mouth the words "Fight! Fight! Fight!"</p>

<p>Whereas Trump has regularly used violent language with his followers, advisers and allies of the former president flipped the script on his Democratic opponent President Joe Biden, saying it was the demonization of the Republican presidential candidate that led to the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>"Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination," US Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, a top candidate to be Trump's running mate, said on X.</p>

<p>Biden moved quickly to try to defuse the situation, denouncing the attack as unacceptable political violence and pulling election ads attacking Trump.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick," Biden told reporters.</p>

<p>The motivation of the shooter is not yet known. The suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He previously made a $15 donation to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians.</p>

<p>In the short term, the attack will likely boost Trump's appearances in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention as he accepts his party's presidential nomination, fortifying the sense of grievance and estrangement his supporters already feel toward the nation's political class.</p>

<p>Within hours of the shooting, Trump's campaign sent out a text asking voters to contribute to the campaign. "They're not after me, they're after you," the message read.</p>

<p>Billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman also swiftly endorsed Trump. "I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk said on X, the social media site he owns.</p>

<p>Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump's campaign, said on X that "for years and even today, leftist activists, Democrat donors and now even Joe Biden have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump ... it's high time they be held accountable for it ... the best way is through the ballot box."</p>

<p>LaCivita was apparently referring to recent remarks by Biden made in the context of asking his supporters to focus on beating Trump rather than his own performance. "So, we're done talking about the debate, it's time to put Trump in a bullseye," said Biden, who has always condemned any political violence.</p>

<p><strong>Political Attacks</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. is grappling with the biggest and most sustained increase in political violence since the 1970s. Of 14 fatal political attacks since supporters of Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which the perpetrator or suspect had a clear partisan leaning, 13 were right-wing assailants. One was on the left.</p>

<p>Despite being a former president, Trump has campaigned as an outsider insurgent, complaining that he has long been targeted by the federal "deep state" and Biden's administration to prevent him from reclaiming power.</p>

<p>He has typically employed violent, degrading, and even apocalyptic rhetoric while doing so, warning of a "bloodbath" if he is not elected and saying immigrants in the United States illegally are "poisoning the blood of our country".</p>

<p>Some Republicans were already agitated by his continued stoking of the fire.</p>

<p>"If the country wasn't a powder keg before, it is now," said Chip Felkel, a Republican operative in South Carolina who has opposed Trump.</p>

<p>Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said the shooting could benefit Trump politically because it feeds into his campaign narrative that the country is off-track.</p>

<p>"The attempted assassination creates sympathy for Trump," Bannon said. "It also confirms the idea to voters that something is fundamentally wrong in this nation, which is an idea that drives support for him."</p>

<p>Trump in May was found guilty of engaging in a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star, a conviction that did little to alter the race and suggested supporters of both sides remain entrenched in their positions.</p>

<p>Biden has dealt with a debate within his own party over whether he should step down as the Democratic candidate because of concerns that he is no longer fit for the job. He says his doctors have told him he is in good shape. Trump has benefited in some polls from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, but others show the race to be even.</p>

<p>Many voters have already been alienated by both Biden and Trump. The chaos that surrounds the candidates may contribute to voters feeling that the nation's problems are unfixable and the gulf between the parties cannot be bridged.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The final hearing for the case involving zoologist Adam Britton, a British crocodile expert, was adjourned on Thursday after his lawyer produced a fresh report to the judge. The court will now hear the case in August.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brit-crocodile-expert-who-raped-33224802">Mirror,</a>&nbsp;Britton –&nbsp; charged with rape, torture and death of dozens of dogs — faces 249 years in prison in Australia.&nbsp; Last year, Britton had pleaded guilty to over 60 charges of animal cruelty.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, the NT Supreme Court judge Michael Grant requested his staff and animal rights activists to leave the room before the beginning of the hearing, the report added.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">"In my assessment, the material has the potential to cause nervous shock or some other psychological disturbance," he was quoted as saying by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-11/adam-britton-sentencing-delayed-nt-supreme-court/104084334">ABC</a>. The judge called the offending as “grotesque cruelty to animals".</p>

<p dir="ltr">While people were waiting for the final verdict, his lawyer presented a new report and requested the judge to consider it. The report in question talked about his current state of mind after he took "nearly 30 hours of treatment by a psychologist" in prison, the report added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Remorse is considered evidence of rehabilitative prospects, as is insight. Those are things that may not be present the first time that someone speaks to someone in a professional capacity. They are things that often evolve with treatment. They're not fixed in stone," Britton's lawyer was quoted as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Requesting for a reduction in his client's sentence, the lawyer added, “This is a human being who has been afflicted by a condition since very early childhood … It is not his fault. It's of significance, your honour, that this particular condition is exceptionally taboo in most societies, and the court can, I hope, accept that that would have been a very difficult thing to grow up with and learn to manage into adulthood.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the case?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">As per an <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-11/adam-britton-sentencing-delayed-nt-supreme-court/104084334">ABC</a> report, he used to torture dogs and beat them to death at his place in Darwin, Australia. He also used to record the act of cruelty.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The report added that Britton had a “torture room” –&nbsp; a shipping container — where he used to sexually assault the dogs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder, took to X (formerly Twitter) and said, "Our former President showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire tonight. So thankful for his safety and so sad for the victims and their families."</p>

<p>The Chief Executive Officers of other tech giants Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta also posted on social media, wishing for Mr Trump's speedy recovery while criticising the use of violence. "I pray for President Trump's rapid recovery. My thoughts are with him, the other victims and the Trump family. I strongly condemn this violence," said Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 45th US President was hit in the ear in an assassination bid by a gunman at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania today. Blood was visible on his cheeks and mouth. The shooter was identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. He has been killed. A spectator was also killed in the shooting and two others were "critically" injured, officials said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican presidential contender, whose team claimed he was "fine," was attacked shortly as he began his speech.&nbsp; "I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Mr Trump said on his Truth Social account.</p>

<p>He added, "Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening." Earlier in the statement, he stated, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Republican leader and former US President Trump was injured in an assassination attempt at Pennsylvania's Butler yesterday. One person in the audience was killed, and two others injured as a 20-year-old shooter fired multiple rounds targeting the former US President. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was gunned down.

<p>US President Joe Biden has strongly condemned the incident. White House officials said he has also spoken to Trump, his biggest opponent in the US election due later this year.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Actor Alec Baldwin has broken his silence following the dismissal of involuntary manslaughter charges against him by a New Mexico judge in connection with the tragic shooting incident on the set of the film 'Rust'.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/alec-baldwin-cries-in-court-after-judge-dismisses-rust-shooting-trial-6094839">Alec Baldwin</a> has broken his silence following the dismissal of involuntary manslaughter charges against him by a New Mexico judge in connection with the tragic shooting incident on the set of the film 'Rust'. In a statement obtained by Deadline, Baldwin expressed gratitude amidst a tumultuous legal battle.</p>

<p>"I am grateful for the tremendous support I have received during this challenging time," he said.</p>

<p>He also shared a photo of him taken inside the courtroom on Instagram.</p>

<p>Alongside the picture, he wrote, "There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now. To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family."</p>

<p>The decision, announced on Friday by Judge Marlowe Sommer, not only dismissed the charges against Baldwin but also barred any possibility of retrial, effectively concluding the criminal proceedings against him, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>The ruling followed a day-long hearing filled with heated arguments regarding alleged mishandling of evidence by authorities.</p>

<p>Judge Marlowe Sommer underscored the impact of procedural errors on the fairness of the trial, stating unequivocally, "The late discovery of this evidence has compromised the fundamental fairness of these proceedings. There is no remedy but to dismiss the charges."</p>

<p>During the hearing, the judge personally inspected a bag of ammunition central to the case, which Baldwin's legal team asserted had been withheld from them until recently.</p>

<p>This development triggered significant repercussions, including the resignation of a special prosecutor and the testimony of another, as per The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>Initially projected to span two weeks, the trial abruptly ended on its third day, leaving Baldwin visibly moved but choosing to remain silent as he departed the courthouse.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Kari Morrissey acknowledged the judge's decision while maintaining that there was no conclusive evidence linking the discovered ammunition to the tragic incident involving cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.</p>

<p>The motion for dismissal, filed by Baldwin's defense team, highlighted critical evidence that emerged post-trial of the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed.</p>

<p>This included ammunition allegedly matching the fatal bullet, disclosed belatedly to authorities by retired officer Troy Teske in March but not presented to the defense during trial preparations, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>The fatal incident occurred during a rehearsal at a New Mexico church set, where Baldwin inadvertently discharged a loaded revolver he was assured was unloaded.</p>

<p>The incident resulted in the death of Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, sparking widespread scrutiny over safety protocols on film sets.</p>

<p>Legal proceedings against Baldwin have been turbulent, marked by conflicting forensic reports and witness testimonies since charges were first filed in January 2023, dropped, and later reinstated.</p>

<p>Following the dismissal, attorney Brian Panish, representing Matthew Hutchins, Halyna's widower, expressed disappointment while reaffirming their commitment to holding Baldwin accountable.</p>

<p>"We respect the court's decision. We look forward to presenting all the evidence to a jury and holding Mr. Baldwin accountable for his actions in the senseless death of Halyna Hutchins," Panish stated in an official statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in Saturday's attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in Saturday's attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally. The suspect was shot and killed by the Secret Service seconds after he allegedly fired shots toward a stage where Trump and was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI said it was working to determine a motive for the attack, in which one rally attendee died and two other spectators were critically injured. Trump was shot in the ear.</p>

<p>State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican. The upcoming Nov. 5 election would have been the first time Crooks had been old enough to vote in a presidential race.</p>

<p>Crooks lived about an hour away from where the shooting took place in Butler. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Sunday that it closed the airspace over Bethel Park for "special security reasons."</p>

<p>When Crooks was 17 he made a $15 donation to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, according to a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote. The groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>Crooks' father, Matthew Crooks, 53, told CNN that he was trying to figure out what happened and would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son.</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He received a $500 "star award" from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>A 2022 graduation ceremony video cited by the New York Times shows Crooks receiving his high school diploma to some applause. Video from that ceremony posted online shows Crooks with glasses in a black graduation gown and posing with a school official. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video. Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that Crooks carried no identification to the site of the shooting and had to be identified using other methods.</p>

<p>"We're looking at photographs right now and we're trying to run his DNA and get biometric confirmation," Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge, said during a press briefing.</p>

<p>USA Today reported that dozens of law enforcement vehicles were stationed outside a residence listed at the address on Crooks' voter registration record. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene and a bomb squad was at the residence, USA Today reported. The perimeter of the residence of the suspect was guarded on Sunday by yellow police caution tape. An Alleghany County Police vehicle was parked outside.</p>

<p>"It's insanity that anyone would do this," Dan Maloney, a 30-year-old resident from the area was quoted as saying by USA Today.Reuters could not immediately identify social media accounts or other online postings by Crooks. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, did not immediately respond to questions on whether the platforms had removed any accounts related to the suspect.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We believe the fact that Trump is safe right now is nothing short of an act of God," Ramaswamy, who challenged the 78-year-old politician for the Republican presidential nomination at the primaries, wrote in a long post on X.</p>

<p>"My heart tells me God intervened not just for Trump, but for our nation.</p>

<p>"Today, the future survival of the United States of America came down to less than a hair's width in the path of a bullet," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>He continued his praise for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-pierced-upper-part-of-my-right-ear-donald-trump-on-shooting-at-rally-6101088#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Trump</a> and said Americans just had the chance to see "our next President's true character, unvarnished".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He took the fire, he took the hit, he felt the blood, and then he stood right back up for the people he was put here to lead," Ramaswamy added.</p>

<p>He, however, attacked US President Joe Biden and said, "First they sued him. Then they prosecuted him. Then they tried to take him off the ballot. The only thing more tragic than what just happened is that, if we're being honest, it wasn't totally a shock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Biden's inevitable ritual condemnation of political violence today (when it comes) will be insufficient and irrelevant. No amount of verbiage today changes the toxic national climate that led to this tragedy," he said.</p>

<p>Regardless of who you vote for, let's unite around the truth that what happened today is "unacceptable, now and forever", he said.</p>

<p>His long post drew a reaction from billionaire <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-elon-musk-fully-endorses-donald-trump-after-rally-shooting-6101736" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a>, who earlier reacted to the shocking shooting by quickly endorsing Trump.</p>

<p>"You very much predicted this," Musk said. "I badly hoped I would be wrong," Ramaswamy responded.</p>

<p>Trump had just started speaking at the packed outdoor election rally in Butler town when bullets started flying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Video footage showed him grabbing his ear as shots were fired. With his face streaked with blood, Trump was quickly rescued by the US Secret Service agents.</p>

<p>Shortly after the incident, he said, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>

<p>The FBI on Sunday identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Crooks, armed with an AR-style rifle, was killed by Secret Service personnel. He fired multiple shots at the stage from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue,” the agency said.</p>

<p>The gunman was able to get close enough to shoot and injure Trump is seen as a huge failure of the security agencies tasked with providing cover for him ahead of the election.</p>

<p>The gunman was on a rooftop approximately "200 to 250 yards" from where the former US president was addressing his supporters, US media reported.</p>

<p>According to an attendee named Ben Macer, he was up along the fence line and "saw the guy move from roof to roof", CBS News reported.</p>

<p>Macer further said he told an officer that the shooter was on the roof, approximately "200 to 250 yards" away from where Trump was addressing his supporters.</p>

<p>"When I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that," he said.</p>

<p>Butler resident Ryan Knight, another witness along the fence line, also said he saw the suspected shooter atop the American Glass Research building, the report said.</p>

<p>"I walked over about 20 minutes before the shooting happened to stand along the fence line where Trump was. As I was doing that, I was right beside the AGR building, which had the shooter on it," Knight said.</p>

<p>"When I was sitting there, a guy said, 'Oh God, he had a gun.' When I looked up, there was a guy on top of the building with an M16 with a blanket, pointing at the president. He starts shooting. Four to five shots rang out. I throw the guy I'm with to the ground. I jump to the ground, I look up, and I see his head get split up from the shot from the Secret Service," he said.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has confirmed that one attendee was killed and two others were critically injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>"All the cops started flying over, pushing us out, they took my name, witness report, [and] cell phone number to go over what happened because there [weren't many] eyewitnesses," Knight said.</p>

<p>"My main thought is why wasn't the Secret Service on top of AGR? That's a very big vantage point to shoot at the president. How did that get missed?" Knight asked.</p>

<p>Macer said he did not get a clear look at the alleged shooter, but reiterated that he saw him move from building to building.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow called on the United States Sunday to "take stock" of its "policies of incitement to hatred", while using the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump to denounce support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing "those who vote in the United States to supply arms" to Kyiv, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova denounced support for Kyiv, which she said stoked "attacks against the Russian president".&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added that "perhaps it would be better to use this money to fund the American police and other services that are supposed to ensure law and order in the United States?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Trump victory in the November elections would put into question continued US support for Ukraine as it resists the Russian offensives launched in 2022.</p>

<p>The Republican Party candidate has suggested that he would end the conflict very quickly if he won back the presidency, which Kyiv fears would mean it would be forced to negotiate with Moscow from a weakened position.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has said he takes Trump's comments about ending the war "very seriously".</p>

<p>Zakharova added that "when other means of getting rid of troublesome president are exhausted, good old Lee Harvey Oswald comes into play", referring to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, a source of numerous conspiracy theories including that his death was ordered from within the US state apparatus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The JFK assassination commission concluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine who had lived in the Soviet Union, had acted alone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Climate related stressors like heat, wildfires, floods, droughts, diseases and rising sea levels affect education outcomes and threaten to undo educational gains of recent decade, according to the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate related stressors like heat, wildfires, floods, droughts, diseases and rising sea levels affect education outcomes and threaten to undo educational gains of recent decade, according to the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM).</p>

<p>The global report compiled by UNESCO, Monitoring and Evaluating Climate Communication and Education (MECCE) project and University of Saskatchewan in Canada has pointed out that most low and middle-income countries are experiencing climate-related school closures every year, increasing chances of learning loss and dropout.</p>

<p>"Climate change related impacts are already disrupting education systems and outcomes. Direct effects include the destruction of education infrastructure as well as injuries and loss of life among students, parents and school staff. Climate change has a negative impact on education indirectly through its displacement of people and the effects on people's livelihoods and health," the report said.</p>

<p>"Over the past 20 years, schools were closed in at least 75 per cent of the extreme weather events, impacting five million people or more. Increasingly frequent natural disasters, including floods and cyclones, have led to the deaths of students and teachers and have damaged and destroyed schools.</p>

<p>"Exposure to heat has significant detrimental effects on children's educational outcomes. An analysis linking census and climate data in 29 countries between 1969 and 2012 showed that exposure to higher than average temperatures during the prenatal and early life period is associated with fewer years of schooling, especially in Southeast Asia," it added.</p>

<p>The GEM report noted that a child experiencing temperatures that are two standard deviations above average is predicted to attain 1.5 fewer years of schooling than children experiencing average temperatures.</p>

<p>"High temperatures reduced high-stakes test performance in China and led to reductions in both high school graduation and college entrance rates. In the United States, without air conditioning, a school year hotter by 1 degree Celsius, reduced test scores by 1 per cent.</p>

<p>"Very hot school days disproportionately impacted African American and Hispanic students, due to poor infrastructure conditions, accounting for roughly five per cent of the racial achievement gap. In the most disadvantaged municipalities in Brazil, which were also amongst those most exposed to heat risk, students lost about one per cent of learning per year due to rising temperatures," it said.</p>

<p>Elaborating about impact of climate change on education in India, the crucial report pointed out that a study of rainfall shocks over the first 15 years of life in India found that they negatively affected vocabulary at age five and mathematics and non-cognitive skills at age 15.</p>

<p>"The effects were more severe for boys and children of parents with a lower educational attainment. An analysis of disasters experienced early in life by over 140,000 children in seven Asian countries found a negative association with school enrolment, especially for boys, and with mathematics performance, especially for girls, by the time they reach 13 to 14 years," it said.</p>

<p>Climate-induced education vulnerability is found to be worse for marginalized populations. Of the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2019, eight were low or lower-middle-income countries. Of the 33 countries identified as bearing extremely high climate risks for children, where nearly one billion people live, 29 are also considered to be fragile states. "Climate change increases the likelihood of displacement and is one of the reasons why internal displacement has reached the highest levels on record. During 2022, 32.6 million were internally displaced due to disasters. Analysis of five countries – Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Tuvalu and Vietnam – finds five displacement patterns: temporary displacement, permanent migration to urban settlements, government-planned relocation, cross-border migration and trapped populations.</p>

<p>"These displacement scenarios lead to different barriers to education, related to a lack of financial resources, documentation or residency requirements," it said.</p>

<p>The report noted that dealing with direct and indirect effects of climate change-induced disruptions requires a comprehensive focus on climate adaptation, including multi-sectoral planning, curriculum reform, teacher training and community awareness and engagement.</p>

<p>Noting that there are increasing calls to improve the ability of school infrastructure to absorb shocks and adapt to stresses and changes brought about by climate change impacts, the crucial report claimed that the efforts remain insufficient.</p>

<p>"Planning and funding for climate impact risks and adaptation remain inadequate Analysis of country submissions for the mid-term review of the Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction found risk levels are rising much faster than the resilience of the education sector in most countries, despite recognition that disaster risk resilience is key for preventing hazards from becoming disasters "Yet awareness is low. In a recent survey of 94 education policy makers in 28 low- and middle-income countries, only about half believed that hotter temperatures inhibited learning. About 61 per cent viewed climate change among the bottom three out of 10 priorities in education," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign team has announced plans to bolster security protocols to ensure his safety after the former US president was injured in a shooting incident at an election rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was injured on Saturday after being shot in the ear during an apparent assassination attempt during a Republican Party campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. The 20-year-old male attacker was shot and killed by a member of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Trump's campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said the campaign would be employing additional security measures, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Wiles and LaCivita told staffers in a new memo that they "remain horrified" at the attack. They added that they "hope that this horrendous act will bring our team, and indeed the nation, together in unity and we must renew our commitment to safety and peace for our country".</p>

<p>"We condemn all forms of violence, and will not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media," the memo said.</p>

<p>The campaign managers said the Republican National Convention will continue as planned in Milwaukee, "where we will nominate our President to be the brave and fearless nominee of our Party".</p>

<p>Republican delegates will nominate Trump as the party's candidate in the November 5 presidential election against the nominee of the Democratic Party, which till late last month was thought to be incumbent US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>However, after his disastrous performance against Trump at the first presidential debate, pressure has mounted on 81-year-old Biden to quit the race and allow someone else from the party to contest against the former president.</p>

<p>"In moments of tragedy and horror, we must be resolute in our mission to reelect President Trump," the memo reads.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump is a "horrific moment" for America and a "sobering reminder" of the threat that political violence poses to democracy in the country ahead of the high-stakes presidential election, the US media commented on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, survived an attempt on his life on Saturday when a young shooter fired multiple shots at him at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, injuring his right ear.</p>

<p>Americans received a sobering reminder on Saturday of the threat that political violence poses to our democracy, The New York Times said.</p>

<p>"It is now incumbent on political leaders of both parties and on Americans individually and collectively, to resist a slide into further violence and the type of extremist language that fuels it. Saturday's attack should not be taken as a provocation or a justification," it said.</p>

<p>"Americans also must be clear-eyed about the challenge that is confronting this nation. Saturday's events cannot be written off as an aberration. Violence is infecting and inflecting American political life," the newspaper said.</p>

<p>"Acts of violence have long shadowed American democracy, but they have loomed larger and darker of late. Cultural and political polarisation, the ubiquity of guns and the radicalising power of the internet have all been contributing factors, as this board laid out in its editorial series The Danger Within in 2022. This high-stakes presidential election is further straining the nation's commitment to the peaceful resolution of political differences," it said.</p>

<p>Democracy requires partisans to accept that the process is more important than the results. Even before Saturday's events, there were worrying signs that many Americans were failing that essential test, it added.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt is a horrific moment for America that could have been much worse. But we can't say it comes as a complete surprise. Political hostility and hateful rhetoric have been rising to a decibel level that far too often in the American past has led to violence and attempted murder. Some of us still remember 1968 all too well, The Wall Street Journal said.</p>

<p>The shooter alone is responsible for his actions. But leaders on both sides need to stop describing the stakes of the election in apocalyptic terms. Democracy won't end if one or the other candidate is elected, it added.</p>

<p>"Fascism is not aborning if Mr. Trump wins, unless you have little faith in American institutions," the paper said.</p>

<p>The targeting of a former president, also the Republican presidential candidate for the November election, at a campaign rally just days before he accepted the Republican nomination is, by definition, an attack on democracy and the right of each American to choose their leaders, CNN said in an opinion piece.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination, which opens a dark new chapter in America's cursed story of political violence, shook a nation already deeply estranged during one of the most tense periods of its modern history, it said.</p>

<p>While Trump is not currently serving as president, his wounding underscores the ever-present threat that always hangs over the office and those who run for it – and especially for those who claim it, it said.</p>

<p>Trump is likely to face President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November election. However, Biden, 81, is under pressure to quit the race following his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month.</p>

<p>Four American presidents have been killed while in office, most recently John F. Kennedy in 1963.</p>

<p>The fact that Trump was attacked ends a 40-year period in which many have assumed that the Secret Service's expertise had greatly reduced the potential for such outrages – and will cast a pall that will last for years, the news network said.</p>

<p>Trump's targeting during a presidential campaign drew comparisons to the assassination of Democratic candidate Robert F Kennedy in 1968, a blood-soaked year that also saw the killing of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which will host the same event this year, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">FBI has identified the person who fired shots at former US President Donald Trump during his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. The suspect has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The US Secret Service is investigating how a person with an AR-15 rifle entered the scene and was able to fire multiple shots.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Now, let us understand&nbsp; what is AR-15 rifle&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">– AR-15 rifle falls under the category of “modern sporting rifle” aka MSR. Such rifles are mostly used in competitions and hunting purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– As per the <a href="https://www.nssf.org/msr/">Firearm Industry Trade Association</a>,&nbsp;the initials AR stands for ArmaLite, the company that made it in the 1950s.</p>

<p dir="ltr">- The&nbsp;Association added people often mistake AR-15 rifles for&nbsp;“assault weapons” or “assault rifles.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– “These rifles' accuracy, reliability, ruggedness and versatility serve target shooters and hunters well. They are true all-weather firearms,” the association added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">– The semi-automatic version of this rifle was created for the military. Now, the AR-15 models are modular and owners are able to customise them as per their requirements, keeping the legal criteria in check.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is it dangerous?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">— The speed of the bullet is deadly. As per <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/ar-15-damage-to-human-body/">The Washington Post</a>, the quantity of propellant in the cartridge has the power to send the bullet at a “speed that would cross six football fields in a second.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">– The bullet can kill a person instantly after it hits a vital organ. “As that bullet slows down…that energy is so massive it has to go someplace, and your body will literally tear apart,” a trauma surgeon was quoted as saying.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The shooting at an election rally in Pennsylvania's Butler last evening has left former US President Donald Trump injured and the Joe Biden administration red-faced. While several prominent voices from the US have questioned the security preparations at the rally venue, some Republican leaders have gone a step ahead and targeted Biden.</p>

<p>In his first response after the assassination attempt, Trump thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement authorities for their swift response, but added, "It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country." Trump has said a bullet pierced his right ear. One person in the audience was killed and two others critically injured in the shooting. The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was gunned down.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today is not just some isolated incident.<br />
<br />
The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs.<br />
<br />
That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.</p>

<p>Republican senator JD Vance, who could be Trump's running mate in the US election due later this year, said the shooting is "not just some isolated incident". "The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Republican leader and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene alleged that the Democrats want Trump and his supporters dead.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden told donors it's 'time to put Trump in a bull's eye,' and that is EXACTLY what happened. House Democrats, led by Bennie Thompson, introduced a bill to strip USSS protection from President Trump.</p>

<p>"The weaponized DOJ has done everything they can to make sure President Trump spends the rest of his life in PRISON, while sending non-violent J6ers (those involved in the Capitol attack on January 6,2021) to jail for years. They want President Trump and his supporters dead. We won't forget," she told a TV channel. In a separate post on X, she said, "The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today. For years and years, they've demonized him and his supporters."</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has strongly condemned the incident. White House officials said he has also spoken to the Republican leader, his arch-rival in this election, after the shooting.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>

<p>Vice-President Kamala Harris too has slammed the shooting. "I have been briefed on the shooting at former President Trump's event in Pennsylvania. Doug and I are relieved that he is not seriously injured. We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting."</p>

<p>We are grateful to the United States Secret Service, first responders, and local authorities for their immediate action. Violence such as this has no place in our nation. We must all condemn this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to more violence," she said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Michael Whatley, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has said in a statement that the former President is doing well and is grateful to law enforcement and first responders.</p>

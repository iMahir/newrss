       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli airstrikes across southern Lebanon on Friday killed at least six fighters and one child, according to security sources, as armed group Hezbollah responded with artillery rounds and rockets across the border.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has been trading fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Lebanon's southern border in parallel with the Gaza war, with hostilities ramping up recently amid fears that a full-scale regional war could erupt.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes on the southern Lebanese towns of Mays al-Jabal and Tayr Harfa on Friday killed four Hezbollah fighters, according to the party's death notices and a security source.</p>

<p>Another fighter was killed in a separate strike outside Aitarun, according to the security source. It was not immediately clear if the combatant was a Hezbollah member.</p>

<p>A separate Israeli strike on the village of Aita, approximately 14 km (nine miles) north of the border with Israel, killed a Hezbollah fighter and a child, the security source told Reuters. Hezbollah identified the fighter killed in Aita as Mohammad Najem.</p>

<p>The Israeli military, in a statement posted online, said it had targeted Najem in Aita because he was a member of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. It said it had targeted two other Hezbollah fighters across the south.</p>

<p>Its statement said "a number of projectiles fired from Lebanese territory" had crossed into northern Israel but that no injuries were reported.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's press office said the group had fired rockets and artillery fire onto various Israeli military positions throughout the day.</p>

<p>More than 600 people in Lebanon have been killed since the start of the clashes last October, including more than 400 Hezbollah combatants and over 130 civilians, according to a Reuters toll.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian strikes killed eight civilians across Ukraine, regional authorities announced Friday, over two years and a half since Russia invaded its neighbour.</p>

<p>Attacks killed two in the northeastern Sumy region, the national police said.</p>

<p>Further to the east, in the Kharkiv region bordering <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/10-killed-35-wounded-in-russian-strikes-on-town-in-eastern-ukraine-6300639" target="_blank">Russia</a>, two civilians died in an attack, regional governor Oleg Synegubov said.</p>

<p>Rescuers also removed a body from the rubble from another attack that took place earlier this week, Synegubov said.</p>

<p>Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin reported another death in an attack on the region.</p>

<p>Moscow has pushed on with its offensive in the Donetsk region even as it tries to fight off a Ukrainian counter-assault into its own <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/ukraine-seizes-28-villages-in-russia-s-kursk-825250" target="_blank">Kursk </a>border region.</p>

<p>Ukraine is evacuating civilians from the city of Pokrovsk and its surrounding areas, about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the fighting, where officials say some 50,000 still live.</p>

<p>And in the southern city of Kherson, which was liberated in autumn 2022 but remains within reach of Russian weapons, two people died and five were wounded, according to governor Oleksandr Prokudin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India - one of the world's biggest consumers of crude oil - does not have a "political strategy" that informs its purchases, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said at a press conference in Kyiv, shortly after Prime Minister Modi met President Zelensky.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India - one of the world's biggest consumers of crude oil - does not have a "political strategy" that informs its purchases, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Friday at a press conference in Kyiv, shortly after<a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/pm-modi" target="_blank"> Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> met Ukraine leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/volodymyr-zelensky" target="_blank">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>.</p>

<p>Responding to a question about India overtaking China in the import of Russian crude - sale of which had been sanctioned by the West following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - Mr Jaishankar also pointed to the volatile nature of the global crude oil market.</p>

<p>"India is a big oil consumer... we are a big oil importer because we don't have oil. Now, it is not like there is a political strategy to buy oil... there is an oil strategy to buy oil... there is a market strategy."</p>

<p>"So the figures of where we import oil from will go up and down... it depends on the market. But definitely, I think it depends, or is decided by, a tight market... one in which big supplies, like Iran and Venezuela, who used to supply to India, are now constrained from operating freely," he said.</p>

<p>"This is a factor that needs to be taken into account," Mr Jaishankar, who has repeatedly defended India's continuing purchase of Russian crude following the war in Ukraine, responded in Kyiv.</p>

<p>"We explained to Ukraine (the current) market scenario. The fact that many producers have been sanctioned makes the market very tight," he had said earlier, in response to another question, stressing "it is in the interest of the world economy that oil prices remain reasonable and stable."</p>

<p>However, analysts this morning said global oil prices remain "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Oil-Prices-Remain-Vulnerable-to-Demand-Fluctuations.html" target="_blank">vulnerable to demand fluctuations</a>" on the back of "weak manufacturing data from Europe, Asia, and the United States".</p>

<p>In February too Mr Jaishankar - who has also called out Western nations for continuing to buy from Russia in the war's early phases - reaffirmed India's stance on buying Russian oil despite sanctions.</p>

<p>"What should we have done? In many cases Middle East suppliers gave priority to Europe because of higher prices. So either we would have had no energy... or we would have ended up paying a lot more because you (European nations) were paying more," he told German daily Handelsblatt.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar then had argued that India had "in a certain way, stabilised the (global) energy market". Indian consumers, he said, simply could not afford high prices charged by the Middle East.</p>

<p>"If no one bought crude oil from Russia, and everyone bought crude oil from other countries, the prices on the energy market would have shot up even further," he told the German publication.</p>

<p>Prior to the war in Ukraine, India rarely purchased Russian crude due to high freight costs. By 2023, though, Moscow was selling about 1.66 million barrels per day, up from less than 700,000 in 2022.</p>

<p>India - the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, became the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude since the West halted purchases and imposed sanctions against Moscow.</p>

<p>India has paid for this crude in rupees, dirhams and Chinese yuan.</p>

<p>In May, multiple sources told Reuters Reliance Industries, the operator of the world's biggest refining complex, had signed a one-year deal with Russia's Rosneft to buy at least three million barrels of oil per month, with payment to be made in roubles.</p>

<p>The payment in roubles part was seen as key as it would allow Moscow to circumvent an additional set of sanctions against payments routed through Western banks and financial institutions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 10-month-old baby in war-shattered Gaza has been paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years, the World Health Organization said on Friday, with UN agencies appealing for urgent vaccinations of every baby.</p>

<p>The type 2 virus (cVDPV2), while not inherently more dangerous than types 1 and 3, has been responsible for most outbreaks in recent years, especially in areas with low vaccination rates.</p>

<p>UN agencies have called for Israel and Gaza's dominant Palestinian group Hamas to agree to a seven-day humanitarian pause in their 10-month-old war to allow vaccination campaigns to proceed in the territory.</p>

<p>"Polio does not distinguish between Palestinian and Israeli children," the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday in a post on X.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"Delaying a humanitarian pause will increase the risk of spread among children," Philippe Lazzarini added.</p>

<p>The baby, who has lost movement in his lower left leg, is currently in stable condition, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.</p>

<p>The WHO has announced that two rounds of a polio vaccination campaign are set to begin in late August and September 2024 across the densely populated Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>With its health services widely damaged or destroyed by fighting, and raw sewage spreading amid a breakdown in sanitation infrastructure, Gaza's population is particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease.</p>

<h3><strong>Challenge of vaccinations in war zone</strong></h3>

<p>Gaza's health ministry first reported the polio case in the unvaccinated 10-month-old baby a week ago in the central city of Deir Al-Balah, an often embattled area in the war.</p>

<p>Hamas on Aug. 16 supported a U.N. request for a seven-day pause in the fighting to vaccinate Gaza children against polio, Hamas political bureau official Izzat al-Rishq said on Friday.</p>

<p>Israel, which has laid siege to Gaza since last October and whose ground offensive and bombardments have levelled much of the territory, said days later it would facilitate the transfer of polio vaccines into Gaza for around one million children.</p>

<p>The Israeli military's humanitarian unit (COGAT) said it was coordinating with Palestinians to procure 43,000 vials of vaccine - each with multiple doses - for delivery in Israel in the coming weeks for transfer to Gaza.</p>

<p>The vaccines should be sufficient for two rounds of doses for more than a million children, COGAT added.</p>

<p>As well as allowing the entry of polo specialists into Gaza, the UN has said a successful campaign would require transport for vaccines and refrigeration equipment at every step as well as conditions that would allow the campaign to reach children in every area of the rubble-clogged territory.</p>

<p>Poliomyelitis, a highly infectious virus primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis.</p>

<p>Traces of polio virus were detected last month in sewage in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, two areas in southern and central Gaza that have seen hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fighting seek shelter.</p>

<p>Children under five are particularly at risk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization said on Friday its partners like Gavi and Unicef can start buying mpox vaccines before they are approved in a bid to get inoculations to Africa faster as the continent battles an escalating outbreak of the virus.</p>

<p>Traditionally, organisations like Gavi, which helps lower-income countries buy vaccines, can only start purchasing shots once they have approval from the WHO. But the rules have been relaxed in this instance to get talks moving, as the WHO's approval is due in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Two vaccines, made by Denmark's Bavarian Nordic and Japan's KM Biologics, are already approved by regulators around the world, including the United States and Japan, and have been in widespread use for mpox since 2022.</p>

<p>Around 1.2 million people have had Bavarian Nordic's vaccine in the United States alone. The WHO is expected to grant an emergency licence to the shots in September.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghanistan's Taliban formally codified a long set of rules governing morality this week, ranging from requiring women to cover their faces and men to grow beards to banning car drivers from playing music, the Justice Ministry said.</p>

<p>The rules, promoted as in line with Islamic sharia law and to be enforced by the morality ministry, were based on a decree by the Taliban's supreme spiritual leader in 2022 and were now officially published as law, a Justice Ministry spokesman said.</p>

<p>The morality ministry, formally called the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Propagation of Virtue, has already been enforcing similar morality requirements and says it has detained thousands of people for violations. It was not immediately clear whether publication of the rules would lead to stronger enforcement.</p>

<p>The Taliban's restrictions on women and freedom of expression have drawn sharp criticism from rights groups and many foreign governments since the former insurgents resumed control of Afghanistan in 2021.</p>

<p>Western capitals, led by Washington, have said the path to formal recognition of the Taliban is largely stalled until they reverse course on women's rights and open high schools to girls.</p>

<p>The Taliban say they respect women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic law and local customs and that they are internal matters that should be addressed locally.</p>

<p>The 35-article morality law was officially enacted and published on Wednesday after being ratified by Supreme Spiritual Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, said Justice Ministry spokesperson Barakatullah Rasoli.</p>

<p>"According to this law, the Ministry (for Prevention of Vice and Propagation of Virtue) is obligated to promote good and forbid evil in accordance with Islamic Sharia," the Justice Ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The requirements include women to wear attire that fully covers their bodies and faces and bars men from shaving their beards as well as from skipping prayer and religious fasts.</p>

<p>Penalties for violations included "advice, warnings of divine punishment, verbal threats, confiscation of property, detention for one hour to three days in public jails, and any other punishment deemed appropriate," the Justice Ministry added.</p>

<p>If such measures failed to correct an individual's behaviour they would be referred to court for further action, it said.</p>

<p>"A lot of these rules were in place already but less formally and now they are being formalised I think this is a sign of what we've been seeing over the last three years which is a steady and gradual escalation of the crackdown," said Heather Barr, Associate Director of Human Rights Watch's Women's Rights Division.</p>

<p>The laws also instruct drivers of vehicles not to transport women without a male guardian. They require media to abide by sharia law and ban the publication of images containing living beings.</p>

<p>Morality ministry officials have been monitoring Afghans throughout the country for alleged offences for the past three years. The ministry said this week that in the past year it had detained over 13,000 people, though it did not break down the alleged offences or gender of the detainees. It said around half of the detentions were for 24 hours.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabon has reported its first case of mpox in a man who had returned from a trip to Uganda, its health ministry said.</p>

<p>Cases of the infectious disease, formerly known as monkeypox, have been surging in East Africa, but have also been detected in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/asia-s-first-case-of-new-monkeypox-strain-829002" target="_blank">Asia</a> and Europe.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old who lives in Gabon had "returned from a two-week trip to Uganda, which has been impacted by the epidemic", the ministry said in a statement Thursday.</p>

<p>"The patient is in a good state generally... and has been put in isolation," it added.</p>

<p>The health ministry said the country was on "maximum alert" for the virus, and it was "reinforcing its preparations against mpox coming into Gabon."</p>

<p>It added that it was also preparing a "nationwide surveillance and testing system".</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mpox-is-not-the-new-covid-says-who-6377283" target="_blank">Mpox </a>is a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals that can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in southern Russia on Friday sentenced five men to more than six years in prison each in the first convictions related to a mass anti-Israel protest last October at an airport in the predominantly Muslim Dagestan region.</p>

<p>The men, who were given sentences ranging from just over six years to nine years for engaging in rioting, did not admit guilt, the court in the Krasnodar region said. One protester was also found guilty of committing violence against a government official.</p>

<p>The trial was moved from Dagestan to Krasnodar due to the sensitivity of the case.</p>

<p>Last October hundreds of anti-Israel protesters charged an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russians-storm-airport-dagestan-after-word-of-flight-landing-from-israel-report-4526324" target="_blank">airport</a> in the city of Makhachkala where a plane from Tel Aviv had just arrived in a spate of unrest in the North Caucasus over Israel's war against the Palestinian operative group Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Video footage showed the protesters, mostly young men, waving Palestinian flags, breaking down glass doors and running through the airport shouting "Allahu Akbar" (God is greater).</p>

<p>The crowd converged on the airport after a message on a local Telegram channel urged Dagestanis to meet the "uninvited guests" in "adult fashion" and to get the plane and its passengers to turn around and fly somewhere else.</p>

<p>The channel, which was later banned by Telegram, did not use the word "Jew" but referred to the plane's passengers as being "unclean".</p>

<p>More than 20 people were injured before security forces could contain the unrest. No passengers on the plane were hurt.</p>

<p>Police arrested dozens of people, whose cases are now making their way through Russian courts.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Divers searching a sunken superyacht off Sicily recovered the body of the teenage daughter of UK tech tycoon Mike Lynch Friday, the seventh and final victim of a tragedy in which the businessman also perished.</p>

<p>Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah had been among six passengers reported missing after the "Bayesian" went down off the north coast of the Italian island in a storm early on Monday morning.</p>

<p>After Hannah's body was brought ashore on Friday, her family issued a statement describing their "unspeakable grief".</p>

<p>"The Lynch family is devastated, in shock and is being comforted and supported by family and friends," it said.</p>

<p>Search teams had recovered the bodies of four of Lynch's friends on Wednesday, and that of the entrepreneur himself on Thursday.</p>

<p>The body of a man believed to be the yacht's chef had been found a few hours after the sailing ship sank.</p>

<p>Lynch, 59, had invited friends and family onto the sailing boat to celebrate his recent acquittal in a massive US fraud case.</p>

<p>But the 56-metre (185-foot) British-flagged yacht was struck by a waterspout -- akin to a mini-tornado -- before dawn on Monday as it was anchored off Porticello, near Palermo.</p>

<p>It sank within minutes and now lies on the sea bed 50 metres down.</p>

<h3><strong>'Heartbroken'</strong></h3>

<p>Hannah had just finished her end-of-school exams and had a place to study English literature at Oxford University.</p>

<p>Friends described her as warm, loving and "charming and ferociously intelligent", according to one of the tributes issued by the family.</p>

<p>Lynch, once dubbed the British "Bill Gates", was "the most brilliant mind and (most) caring person I have ever known", said another.</p>

<p>The businessman had been acquitted on all charges in a San Francisco court in June after he was accused of an $11 billion fraud linked to the sale of his software firm Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard.</p>

<p>US lawyer Chris Morvillo, a partner at top law firm Clifford Chance who worked on the trial, also died in the sinking, along with his wife Neda.</p>

<p>Morvillo's firm Clifford Chance paid tribute to the couple, saying all were "heartbroken at the tragic passing... and still coming to terms with this terrible loss".</p>

<p>The bodies of Jonathan Bloomer, the chair of Morgan Stanley International, and his wife Judy, were also found.</p>

<p>The Bloomer family said they were suffering "unimaginable grief" for a couple who had been together for five decades.</p>

<p>"Our only comfort is that they are still together now," the family said.</p>

<p>Many questions remain about why the yacht sank, and so quickly, when other boats nearby were unaffected.</p>

<p>Italian prosecutors have opened a probe and will hold a press conference on Saturday.</p>

<p>On Thursday the head of the company which built the boat said the tragedy could have been avoided.</p>

<p>"Everything that was done reveals a very long summation of errors," said Giovanni Costantino, head of the Italian Sea Group, which includes the Perini Navi company that built Bayesian in 2008.</p>

<h3><strong>Bad weather forecast</strong></h3>

<p>He told Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper that bad weather was forecast and all the passengers should have been gathered at a pre-arranged assembly point, with all the doors and hatches closed.</p>

<p>"Instead it took on water with the guests still in the cabin. They ended up in a trap, those poor people ended up like mice in a trap," he said.</p>

<p>The Bayesian, owned by Lynch's family, boasted a 75-metre mast, the tallest aluminium sailing mast in the world, according to the Charter World website.</p>

<p>Raising the wreck would likely cost some 15 million euros and take "six to eight weeks", according to the salvage engineer who led the operation to recover the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which sank off Italy in 2012.</p>

<p>To recover the yacht, the mast could be removed on the seabed but the boat would be lifted up whole using a giant crane and a team of 40 specialist divers, South African engineer Nick Sloane told the Repubblica daily.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian inmates on Friday took staff hostage at a prison colony in the southern Volgograd region, officials said, the second such incident in a Russian jail since June.</p>

<p>"Convicts took hostage employees of the (IK-19) correctional institution. Measures are currently being taken to free the hostages. There are casualties," Russia's federal penitentiary service said in a statement.</p>

<p>Russia's investigative committee said "several prisoners" were involved.</p>

<p>Videos published on Russian social media appeared to show around four prison guards taken hostage, some covered in blood.</p>

<p>AFP could not verify those images.</p>

<p>The IK-19 prison colony is located in the town of Surovikino, around 850 kilometres (530 miles) south of Moscow.</p>

<p>The incident happened during a meeting of the prison's disciplinary commission, the federal penitentiary service added.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in June, prisoners aligned with the Islamic State (IS) group staged a seige at a jail in the southern Rostov region.</p>

<p>Russian special forces managed to kill the hostage-takers and freed the guards after an hours-long stand-off.</p>

<p>Officials provided no further information on Friday's incident, who the hostage-takers were or any demands they were making.</p>

<p>The attacks come after IS fighters in March killed 145 people at a concert hall in Moscow in the most deadly terror attack in Russia for two decades.</p>

<p>IS has repeatedly pledged to target Russia over its support of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who has waged a military campaign to quash the group in the Middle East.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heading into the glitzy final night of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, speculation was rife online about who would be the much vaunted special guest, with figures from ex Republican President George W Bush to superstar musician Beyonce and Taylor Swift in the frame.</p>

<p>It proved to be way off the mark.</p>

<p>George W Bush was put forward as a contender for the surprise spot, with "Republicans against Trump" posting a picture of Bush embracing then first lady Michelle Obama to the account's 765,000 followers on X.</p>

<p>George Bush's spokesperson Freddy Ford told John Bachman, veteran TV news anchor with Newsmax, that Bush is "definitely not" in Chicago to speak at the DNC.</p>

<p>Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, currently a US senator who has criticized former president Donald Trump, also denied it would be him.</p>

<p>"Contrary to fake news posts, I am not the surprise guest at the DNC tonight. My guess is that it will be Beyonce or Taylor Swift," Mr Romney posted on X. "So disappointing, I know!"</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Contrary to fake news posts, I am not the surprise guest at the DNC tonight. My guess is that it will be Beyoncé or Taylor Swift. So disappointing, I know!</p>
— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) <a href="https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/1826767490137161906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>However, many anti-Trump Republicans spoke at this year's DNC throughout the week, taking a stance against the former president and endorsing Kamala Harris and her <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vice-president-tim-walz-pick-set-to-star-on-day-3-of-democratic-convention-6388689">running mate Tim Walz</a> instead.</p>

<p>This list includes former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, former homeland security adviser Olivia Troye, former Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger, and even Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.</p>

<p>But Bush is perhaps one of the most prominent Republicans to publicly announce he was not supporting Trump - sparking rumors he may make a surprise appearance on Thursday.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/indian-americans-cheer-kamala-harris-but-can-she-shift-their-votes-6384029">Kamala Harris</a> accepted her party's presidential nomination on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/5-key-takeaways-from-the-democratic-national-convention-6399099">final day of the convention</a>, buoyed by a galaxy of stars, that set the stage for the grueling run-in to November 5.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Californian has edged <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-donald-trump-race-to-us-election-photo-finish-6400682">ahead by razor-thin margins</a> in polling, reversing what had started to look like a likely Trump victory against Biden before he dramatically pulled out and endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>Democratic heavy hitters, from Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton to vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, have warned that the party could still lose to Trump's Republicans if complacency creeps in.</p>

<p>Walz, a former school football coach, used a sporting analogy, saying that Democrats were "down a field goal, but we're on offense and we've got the ball."</p>

<p>Party strategists spent the week in Chicago showcasing a parade of anti-Trump Republicans, including ex-cabinet officials, a small-town mayor and a former statewide office holder.</p>

<p>"If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, you're not a Democrat, you're a patriot," former Georgia lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan said.</p>

<p>Ms Harris called Trump an "unserious" person.</p>

<p>"I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations," Harris said in her keynote speech, earning uproarious applause.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Bill Clinton took the stage on the third day of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate in the upcoming US presidential election. During his speech, Clinton, the 42nd President of the US, took a swipe at Republican rival Donald Trump, referencing his own age in a lighthearted jab.</p>

<p>"Two days ago, I turned 78, the oldest man in my family for four generations. And the only personal vanity I want to assert is I'm still younger than Donald Trump," Clinton said.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Clinton turned 78 on August 19 while Donald Trump celebrated his 78th birthday in June. So, technically Bill Clinton is younger than Trump by roughly two months.</p>

<p>For months,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/the-biden-bombshell-a-plot-twist-that-roils-trump-too-6156958"> Trump and his allies played on concerns</a> that the 81-year-old Joe Biden may no longer be fit for office. He was frequently a target of Republican mockery and scorn. Last month, Biden made the formal announcement of his exit from the US Presidential race after he faced intense scrutiny following a shaky performance in a debate against Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Bill Clinton Backs Kamala Harris, Tim Walz</strong></h3>

<p>Clinton offered strong support for Democratic Presidential nominee <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-kamala-harris-in-her-biggest-speech-yet-remembers-mother-dr-shyamala-gopalan-harris-6398395">Kamala Harris</a> and her running mate Tim Walz, saying that Harris is a capable leader to address the nation's challenges.</p>

<p>A Democratic heavy lifter, Clinton has warned that the party could still lose to Trump's Republicans if complacency creeps in.</p>

<p>"It's just a fact: Democrats know how to create jobs. And if we elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, we'll keep building a strong economy that works for everyone and run the score up much higher," he said at the event.</p>

She warned that Donald Trump will take America backward if he wins November's blockbuster election.</p>

<p>"With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past -- a chance to chart a new way forward," Harris said to huge cheers from tens of thousands of pumped-up supporters.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relentless monsoon rains and flooding have stranded nearly three million people in Bangladesh and killed two, submerging vast areas and damaging homes and infrastructure, officials from the country's disaster management ministry said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Reuters TV showed Bangladesh residents evacuating with their belongings by boat and other makeshift transportation as knee-deep water entered their homes.</p>

<p>The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) has warned that with the rains continuing, water levels could rise further over the next 24 hours, raising concern about additional flooding and displacement.</p>

<p>Road connectivity in several regions were severed, isolating communities and hampering relief efforts, disaster management and relief officials said.</p>

<p>The most affected districts in Bangladesh included Feni, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Comilla and Chittagong, where five major rivers were flowing above danger levels, the FFWC said.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen so much water in the last 20 years. Everything in my house is wrecked because the water has risen to waist level," said Mohammad Masum, a resident of Feni district.</p>

<p>An analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.</p>

<p>Late on Wednesday, students in Dhaka held protest rallies, alleging that the floods were caused by the opening of dam sluice gates in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/are-bangladesh-india-ties-in-troubled-waters-floods-devastate-bangladesh-india-india-global-828827" target="_blank">&nbsp;India.</a></p>

<p>India's foreign ministry said it was<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tripura-floods-gumti-river-bangladesh-not-correct-government-on-reports-india-dam-caused-bangladesh-floods-6391337" target="_blank"> "not correct"</a> that the floods were caused by water released from the Dumbur dam on the Gumti River in the northeastern state of Tripura.</p>

<p>"We would like to point out that the catchment areas of Gumti River that flows through India and Bangladesh have witnessed the heaviest rains of this year over the last few days," the ministry said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The flood in Bangladesh is primarily due to waters from these large catchments downstream of the dam."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tripura-floods-critical-19-dead-17-lakh-people-affected-6396548" target="_blank">In Tripura</a>, 12 people have died due to landslides and floods triggered by the incessant rain of the past three days, Suman Deb, a Indian disaster management official, told Reuters.</p>

<p>"The impact has been devastating and rescue operations are ongoing," Deb said.</p>

<p>India's Home Minister, Amit Shah, said in a post on X that the central government has rushed disaster management teams, apart from boats and helicopters, to Tripura to assist the state government in relief and rescue operations.</p>

<p>"Floods on the common rivers between India and Bangladesh are a shared problem inflicting sufferings to people on both sides, and requires close mutual cooperation towards resolving them," the foreign ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump set out Friday on the final 10-week sprint to election day, with the Democrat surging after an electrifying speech accepting the Democratic Party nomination.</p>

<p>Less than three weeks before the presidential debate between the US vice president and the Republican ex-president -- and only a month before early in-person voting begins - polls show the race for the White House is neck and neck.</p>

<p>The former senator and prosecutor leaves Chicago with the wind in her sails, having outraised Trump and erased the polling leads he was enjoying before she replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket last month.</p>

<p>But Dan Kanninen, battleground director of the Harris campaign, cautioned at a Bloomberg event on the sidelines of the convention that the race "is not fundamentally changed" and still "very, very tight."</p>

<p>"We have tremendous enthusiasm -- I think momentum is on our side -- but we now need to do something with it and engage the electorate effectively this fall," he said.</p>

<p>Harris accepted her party's presidential nomination on a glitzy final night in Chicago, buoyed by a galaxy of stars, that set the stage for the gruelling run-in to November 5.</p>

<h3><strong>Razor thin margins</strong></h3>

<p>The 59-year-old Californian has edged ahead by razor-thin margins in polling, reversing what had started to look like a likely Trump victory against Biden before he dramatically pulled out and endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>In just a month, Harris has raised a record-breaking half a billion dollars, enjoying a political honeymoon that shows little sign of ending.</p>

<p>Party leaders have cautioned that headwinds could still buffet the campaign, however.</p>

<p>These include internal protests over US policy on the Israel-Hamas war and possible shifts in polling with the expected withdrawal on Friday of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who may endorse Trump.</p>

<p>The controversial scion of America's revered Kennedy clan is planning an announcement in Arizona, while Trump is also campaigning in the state, and promising to showcase a "special guest."</p>

<p>Analysts are mixed on the effect a Kennedy exit would have.</p>

<p>He is polling in the low single digits and his embrace of conspiracy theories has made him a fringe figure.</p>

<p>However, in a very tight race, it is possible that even a few thousand votes in a crucial swing state could ultimately determine who takes the White House.</p>

<p>Democratic heavy hitters, from Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton to vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, have warned that the party could still lose to Trump's Republicans if complacency creeps in.</p>

<p>"If we see a bad poll -- and we will -- we've got to put down that phone and do something," the former first lady told the party faithful in Chicago.</p>

<p>Walz, a former school football coach, used a sporting analogy, saying that Democrats were "down a field goal, but we're on offense and we've got the ball."</p>

<h3><strong>Reaching for the centre</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has largely been singing to the choir, mobilizing his right-wing base with apocalyptic warnings about migrant criminals and painting a dark picture of a country in "decline" that only he can save.</p>

<p>Harris and her Democrats have been reaching toward the centre.</p>

<p>Party strategists spent the week in Chicago showcasing a parade of anti-Trump Republicans, including ex-cabinet officials, a small-town mayor and a former statewide officeholder.</p>

<p>"If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, you're not a Democrat, you're a patriot," former Georgia lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan said.</p>

<p>While they previously characterised Trump as a demagogue, Democrats have instead begun making fun of the Republican nominee in a manner designed to belittle him and dent his aura of invincibility.</p>

<p>Harris called him an "unserious" person.</p>

<p>Harris, who has no events announced for the weekend, heads back to Washington with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff on Friday to begin sketching out a battle plan for the next 70-plus days.</p>

<p>"I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations," Harris said in her keynote speech, earning uproarious applause.</p>

<p>"A president who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical and has common sense and always fights for the American people."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A volcanic eruption has begun again on a peninsula adjacent to Iceland's capital Reykjavik, the sixth time lava has emerged in the area in the space of a year. The Lava burst to the surface at 9:26 p.m. local time on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A volcanic eruption has begun again on a peninsula adjacent to Iceland's capital Reykjavik, the sixth time lava has emerged in the area in the space of a year.</p>

<p>Lava burst to the surface at 9:26 p.m. local time on Thursday from a fissure that's expanding northward, according to the Met Office. The crack, north of the previously damaged fishing town of Grindavik, was initially about 1.4 kilometers (0.9 miles) long, the authorities said.</p>

<p>The scenario was anticipated, with scientists warning for several weeks of activity in the area after it woke from an 800-year dormancy in 2021. There's likely more to come, with potential for the unrest to continue for the next 300 to 400 years, according to Thor Thordarson, professor in volcanology and petrology at University of Iceland.</p>

<p>"This could be <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iceland-volcano-erupts-for-5th-time-since-december-shoots-lava-over-50-metres-into-air-5776132" target="_blank">repeated over again</a> for the next months or a few years," he said by phone. "We can have many more eruptions in this particular unrest event, which has lasted since 2021."</p>

<p>Iceland is one of the world's volcanic hot spots due to its position on the mid-Atlantic ridge where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates rift apart.</p>

<p>Reykjavik, which lies about about 40 kilometers away, has been unaffected by the previous outbursts, and air traffic at nearby Keflavik international airport is not expected to be disrupted.</p>

<p>The devastation in Grindavik means the current volcanic activity is the most destructive in half a century and has thrust the north Atlantic island nation into a new era of contending with the fiery outbursts. The town has been severely damaged by the seismic activity, with deadly cracks emerging on its roads. Lava even overtook three houses in one of the five eruptions on its doorstep.</p>

<p>The previous outburst ended in mid-June, having lasted for 25 days.</p>

<p>Even as Iceland - with its 30 volcanic systems and more than 600 hot springs - is one of the most <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-much-damage-could-possible-iceland-volcano-eruption-cause-4579572" target="_blank">geologically active </a>places on earth, most eruptions have tended to happen in the wilderness. The contrast with suddenly witnessing homes burn has left the population shocked.</p>

<p>Most of Grindavik's 3,700 inhabitants have already relocated from the town previously. About 20 homes were occupied when Thursday's eruption started and their occupants are being evacuated, Hjordis Gudmundsdottir, a spokeswoman for the civil protection authority, said by phone.</p>

<p>"There is no panic and no danger," she said. "The inhabitants now know the drill and how to react."</p>

<p>Officials are evaluating how big the eruption is, she said. Lava is currently not flowing toward the town itself.</p>

<p>Iceland's government has built protective barriers around the town. Those have successfully steered lava flows away from most large-scale infrastructure. The state has also offered to buy out home owners in the volcano struck-town.</p>

<p>Still, roads and pipelines have been overrun by lava in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/volcano-erupts-again-on-iceland-peninsula-fourth-time-since-december-5253334" target="_blank">previous eruptions</a> and have had to be rebuilt. Last winter, all 30,000 inhabitants of the peninsula were without hot water for several days after molten rock overtook a pipeline.</p>

<p>Other infrastructure in the area include the Svartsengi power plant owned by HS Orka hf and a number of businesses centered around geothermal heat and power as well as Iceland's top tourist attraction, the Blue Lagoon.</p>

<p>Before the events in Reykjanes, Iceland had previously seen an eruption in inhabited areas in 1973, when part of a 5,000-person fishing town was buried under lava in the the Westman Islands, off the country's southeastern coast.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/earthquake-swarm-threat-of-volcanic-eruptions-why-iceland-is-on-the-edge-4566804" target="_blank">Fissure eruptions</a> on land, such as the current one, produce little ash and usually wreak no havoc on air travel.</p>

<p>One of the most disruptive eruptions in Iceland's recent history happened in 2010 when volcano Eyjafjallajokull in the southern part of the country released a plume of ash so vast that it grounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, resulting in the cancellation of 100,000 flights and affecting over 10 million people.</p>

<p>"Years or decades in the future, after this has stopped, we will get another unrest event similar to this one with a number of eruptions and number of seismic unrest on all the volcanic lineaments of the Reykjanes peninsula," said Thordarson at the University of Iceland.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late Queen Elizabeth II thought former US President Donald Trump was "very rude", a new biography revealed. According to Craig Brown's book, <em>A Voyage Around The Queen</em>, not only did she find Trump's behaviour problematic but also allegedly disliked his conduct.</p>

<p>Moreover, the late Queen also questioned the nature of Donald Trump's relationship with his wife, Melania, suggesting she must have had some sort of "arrangement" with him to stay married. The Queen reportedly couldn't fathom why Melania would remain married to Trump, given his behavioural patterns during their meetings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Late Queen's comments, mentioned in the newly released book, have drawn attention, particularly in the lead-up to the 2024 US Presidential Elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13758993/queen-elizabeth-donald-trump-melania-craig-brown.html">excerpt from the book</a> read, "A few weeks after President Trump's visit, for instance, she confided in one lunch guest that she found him 'very rude': she particularly disliked the way he couldn't stop looking over her shoulder, as though in search of others more interesting."</p>

<p>Donald Trump first met the Queen in 2018 when he was President. The meeting, however, was overshadowed by controversy, as his state visit to the UK was met with widespread protests. Fast-forward to the present, Trump is making another bid for the White House. And the book appears to have dealt a blow to his campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump has swiftly denied these allegations, labelling the book's author, Craig Brown, a "sleaze bag" and dismissing the claims as "totally false."</p>

<p>In an interview with the&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/MailOnline/status/1826576254541221959 ">Daily Mail</a>, he denied claims, saying, "I had a great relationship with the Queen. She liked me and I liked her."</p>

<p>He added, "We spent hours together at a state dinner. She was a fantastic woman. I think it's a shame that a sleaze bag can write an article that's totally false. In fact, I've always heard the opposite."</p>

<p>He went on to claim that he was the Queen's favourite president, saying, "I heard I was her favourite president, and you've heard that too. She would say it to a lot of people."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A juvenile humpback whale was freed Friday after it was entangled in ropes and buoys in the harbour of Australia's largest city for 22 hours.</p>

<p>Rescuers in Sydney received a call on Thursday afternoon that the whale had become entangled and raced under fading light to save it.</p>

<p>By dawn, rescuers followed the whale in an inflatable boat and used specialised equipment to hold the whale in place while they cut the debris away.</p>

<p>The whale was freed shortly before midday on Friday, and swam off to the open ocean after its 22-hour ordeal.</p>

<p>Jessica Fox, from the Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia, told AFP that efforts to save the whale were "incredible".</p>

<p>"It is not uncommon for a whale to enter Sydney Heads -- they pop their heads in time to time, but to have one entangled in Sydney Harbour is extremely rare."</p>

<p>For decades, humpback whale populations were hunted to the brink of extinction -- at one stage there were only an estimated 1,500 of the animals left in Australian waters.</p>

<p>But they are a rare conservation success story after global protections were afforded to the whales in 1965.</p>

<p>Humpback whale numbers now exceed 40,000 -- a number close to pre-whaling levels -- and the marine animal has since been removed from Australia's threatened species list.</p>

<p>"With so many more whales in the ocean and more humans in the ocean, there is going to be greater potential for conflict," Fox said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As their first birthday approaches, the triplets Gaza-native Hanane Bayouk gave birth to in Jerusalem before the war have seen their mother just once, and she fears she will "die without them".</p>

<p>The 26-year-old had to return to the Palestinian territory alone after giving birth to Najoua, Nour and Najmeh on August 24, 2023, because her Israeli travel permit had expired.</p>

<p>Bayouk received a permit to exit Gaza and give birth in annexed east Jerusalem's Al-Maqased hospital after seven years of painful IVF procedures.</p>

<p>She caught a glimpse of her children in their incubators, "barely an hour and a half", before driving back to Gaza after her permit "expired and the hospital told me to leave".</p>

<p>Bayouk was supposed to return in early October after her daughters had spent several weeks in incubators, which were in short supply in hospitals in Gaza even before the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/10-key-moments-in-israel-hamas-war-6240607" target="_blank"> Israel-Hamas war</a> erupted last October.</p>

<h3><strong>Far from the war</strong></h3>

<p>Two days after she applied for a new exit permit on October 5, Hamas commandos blasted through the Erez terminal, the only entry point from Gaza into Israel.</p>

<p>Once in Israel, the operatives carried out an unprecedented attack that left 1,198 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/gaza-death-count-climbs-to-40-000-as-ceasefire-talks-continue-in-qatar-826405" target="_blank">40,265</a> Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and operative deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead have been women or children.</p>

<p>Like Bayouk, Heba Idriss found herself surrounded by war and unable to return to Jerusalem to get her only daughter, Saida, born prematurely at the Maqased two months earlier.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old had hoped to bring her newborn back to her husband Saleh at their home in Shujaiya, in the northern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Instead, the couple has been displaced nine times by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israeli-airstrikes-target-gaza-ahead-of-ceasefire-talks-6336678" target="_blank">Israeli air strikes</a> or evacuation orders and her husband Saleh has only seen pictures of Saida.</p>

<p>"I want to see my daughter, I suffer so much from being separated from her", she said in tears.</p>

<p>Hanane Bayouk too has been forced from her home and now lives in a displacement persons' camp in the south, sharing a tent with seven of her in-laws.</p>

<p>"It drives me crazy. It took me so long to get pregnant, and now I'm crying all the time," she told AFP on one of the rare days she was able to get through on Gaza's struggling phone network.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, I think I'd like for my daughters to return to Gaza before I die because I have never kissed them, but then I get a hold of myself and tell myself it's better for them to be safe far from the war," she said.</p>

<p>Back at the Maqased, neonatal intensive care unit director Hatem Khammach says that in normal times, there would not have been space to keep Nour, Najmeh, and Najoua for so long.</p>

<h3><strong>I cry every time</strong></h3>

<p>But the number of births at the hospital has fallen sharply as Israel has stopped issuing travel permits to mothers from Gaza and slashed the number given to mothers from the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>With more checkpoints closed more often, even those with a permit struggle to access specialist treatment in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"Before the war, we had seven or eight Gaza babies in our department, which can host 30 at a time," Khammach said.</p>

<p>Since October, none have come, "and many sick people from the West Bank can't reach us".</p>

<p>But the hospital's<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/un-warns-of-unacceptable-rising-violence-against-human-aid-workers-6368664" target="_blank"> health workers </a>keep busy, like those who call Bayouk to let her speak on the phone to her three daughters.</p>

<p>"My husband can't do it. I do it and I cry every time we hang up. I'm afraid my daughters will grow up without knowing me," Bayouk said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

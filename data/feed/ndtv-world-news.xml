       <description><![CDATA[A massive gold deposit, potentially the world's largest, has been discovered in Hunan Province, Central China, containing an estimated 1,000 metric tonnes of high-quality ore.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive gold deposit in Central China is believed to contain 1,000 metric tonnes (1,100 US tonnes) of high-quality ore, according to the state media. The Geological Bureau of Hunan Province confirmed the discovery in Pingjiang County, located in the northeastern region of the province.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://english.news.cn/20241121/cc54468169bb4c8c9db21c08885dc2a5/c.html"><em>Chinese State Media</em></a>, with an estimated value of 600 billion yuan, which is approximately Rs 6,91,473 crore, this may well be the world's largest gold reserve, surpassing the 930 metric tonnes found in South Deep Mine, South Africa.</p>

<p>Preliminary explorations revealed 40 gold veins within a depth of 2 kilometres, holding about 300 metric tons of gold. Advanced 3D modelling suggests the presence of additional reserves at greater depths, possibly reaching 3 kilometres. This discovery has significant implications for China's gold industry, potentially boosting the nation's mining and economic capabilities.</p>

<p>"Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold," said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at the bureau, adding that a tonne of ore in the 2,000-meter range contained a maximum of 138 grams of gold.</p>

<p>Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, said that new ore prospecting technologies, such as 3D geological modeling, had been used at the Wangu gold field. Gold was also found during drills around the site's peripheral areas, unearthing promising prospects, Liu said.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/feature-top-ten-biggest-gold-mines-south-africa/?cf-view"><em>Mining Technology, </em></a>the largest known gold reserves in the world prior to the discovery of the Chinese gold deposit include: &nbsp;</p>

<p>1. South Deep Gold Mine - South Africa &nbsp;<br />
2. Grasberg Gold Mine - Indonesia &nbsp;<br />
3. Olimpiada Gold Mine - Russia &nbsp;<br />
4. Lihir Gold Mine - Papua New Guinea &nbsp;<br />
5. Norte Abierto Gold Mine - Chile &nbsp;<br />
6. Carlin Trend Gold Mine - USA &nbsp;<br />
7. Boddington Gold Mine - Western Australia &nbsp;<br />
8. Mponeng Gold Mine - South Africa &nbsp;<br />
9. Pueblo Viejo Gold Mine - Dominican Republic &nbsp;<br />
10. Cortez Gold Mine - USA &nbsp;</p>

<p>These mines represent the most significant natural gold reserves identified worldwide to date.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Royal New Zealand Navy vessel ran aground and sank off the coast of Samoa last month as a result of human error, a government-initiated inquiry found on Friday.</p>

<p>HMNZS Manawanui, the navy's specialist dive and hydrographic vessel, grounded on a reef on the southern side of Samoa, on Oct. 5 while conducting survey operations. All 75 crew members on board survived.</p>

<p>"The direct cause of the grounding has been determined as a series of human errors which meant the ship's autopilot was not disengaged when it should have been," the head of New Zealand's Navy Rear Admiral Gavin Golding said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>The crew did not realise the ship remained in autopilot and consequently thought its failure to respond to direction changes was the result of a thruster control failure.</p>

<p>The reasons why the crew failed to notice the error would be part of a wider inquiry expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year, Golding said.</p>

<p>A separate disciplinary process into those involved would begin once that inquiry had concluded, he added.</p>

<p>New Zealand's Navy has been struggling with a lack of resources, three of its nine ships already idle due to personnel shortages before the sinking of the Manawanui.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Reykjanes Peninsula had been inactive for 800 years before volcanic activity resumed in 2021.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA has captured a satellite image of red-hot lava oozing from Iceland's most recent volcanic eruption. The incredible shot, which also shows a large billow of smoke and gas arising from the eruption, has been snapped by OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9. The lava has flowed across major roads and closed in on the Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist destination, after erupting from a fissure in the Sundhunkur crater series on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula. This is the seventh instance of a volcanic eruption in the area in less than a year.</p>

<p>"This natural color scene [in the picture], acquired by the OLI-2 on November 24, is overlaid with an infrared signal to help distinguish the lava's heat signature," read a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153630/lava-nears-icelands-blue-lagoon" rel="noindex, nofollow">statement </a>by NASA's Earth Observatory.</p>

<p>"A plume of gas, consisting primarily of sulfur dioxide, streamed from the lava, although the eruption did not affect flights to and from Iceland," it added.</p>

<p>According to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, the eruption's activity had not decreased as quickly as was seen in previous eruptions but had steadied in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>"Eruptive activity has been steady over the last 24 hours, with lava now flowing predominantly east and southeast, towards and along the base of Fagradalsfjall," read an update, dated November 27.</p>

<p>"The lava field near Fagradalsfjall has expanded slightly but continues to thicken. Volcanic tremor has remained stable alongside eruptive activity in the vent. The rate of subsidence around Svartsengi has significantly reduced," it added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/volcano-erupts-in-iceland-seventh-time-in-a-year-7068668" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Video: Red Lava Pours Out As Volcano Erupts 7th Time In A Year In Iceland</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>What is a fissure eruption?</strong></h3>

<p>As per scientists, Iceland's current eruption is a fissure eruption. A fissure is a fracture through which a sheet of magma flows. When this fracture intersects with the surface, lava erupts onto the surface. According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cq521pw0pgjo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC </em></a>report, the Reykjanes Peninsula had been inactive for 800 years before volcanic activity resumed in 2021.</p>

<p>Volcanologists have warned that volcanic activity in Iceland had entered a new era. The country is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country. It is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a fault in the ocean floor that separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates and causes earthquakes and eruptions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jihadist fighters cut the Damascus to Aleppo highway on Thursday during an offensive that a monitor says killed around 200, including civilians hit by Russian air force strikes.</p>

<p>A day earlier, jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions launched a surprise attack on government-held areas of northern Aleppo province, triggering the fiercest fighting in years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p>

<p>The toll in ongoing battles "has risen to 182, including 102 fighters from HTS", 19 from allied factions "and 61 regime forces and allied groups", said the Observatory.</p>

<p>"Russian air strikes on the Aleppo countryside killed 19 civilians on Thursday," said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the Observatory, adding that another civilian had been killed in Syrian army shelling a day earlier.</p>

<p>Russia is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and first intervened in Syria's civil war in 2015, turning the momentum of the conflict in favour of the president, whose forces once only controlled a fifth of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HTS and its allied factions, including groups backed by neighbouring Turkey, "cut off the Damascus-Aleppo international M5 highway... in addition to controlling the junction between the M4 and M5 highways," said the Britain-based monitor.</p>

<p>"The highway has now been put out of service, after it was reopened by regime forces years ago," said the monitor, which has a network of sources inside Syria.</p>

<p>The junction of the M5 and M4 highways connects the capital and regime coastal stronghold Latakia with second city Aleppo respectively.</p>

<p>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said "more than 14,000 people - nearly half are children - have been displaced" by the violence.</p>

<p>Syria has been gripped by civil war for more than a decade, although the intensity of the conflict had decreased in recent years.</p>

<h3><strong>'Pre-empt' attack</strong></h3>

<p>Some of the clashes, which are happening in an area straddling Idlib and Aleppo provinces, are less than 10 kilometres (six miles) southwest of the outskirts of Aleppo city.</p>

<p>"This operation aims to repel the sources of fire of the criminal enemy from the frontlines," said Mohamed Bashir, who heads HTS's so-called "Salvation Government", during a press conference.</p>

<p>Analyst Nick Heras of the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy said the rebels were "trying to preempt the possibility of a Syrian military campaign in the region of Aleppo, which Russian and Syrian government airstrikes against rebel areas has been preparing for".</p>

<p>With some Turkey-backed factions joining the offensive, he said "Ankara is sending a message to both Damascus and Moscow to back down from their military efforts in northwest Syria," he said.</p>

<p>As well as Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been backed in the civil war by Iran and allied terrorist groups, including Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah.</p>

<p>A general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards was killed in Syria on Thursday during fighting between Syrian government forces and jihadists, an Iranian news agency reported.</p>

<p>Iranian ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said the deadly offensive was "part of a plan by the diabolical regime (Israel) and the US" and called for "firm and coordinated action to prevent the spread of terrorism in the region".</p>

<p>During more than two months of war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel intensified its strikes on Iran-backed groups in Syria including Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Rebel forces "are in a better position to take and seize villages than Russian-backed Syrian government forces, while the Iranians are focused on Lebanon," Heras said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Heavy losses'</strong></h3>

<p>The Syrian jihadists and their allies launched their attack the day the Lebanon-Israel truce came into effect.</p>

<p>Analyst Haid Haid said the rebels had been "planning for this offensive for quite a while".</p>

<p>But "if the rebel forces waited too long the regime would have been able to reinforce their frontlines as Hezbollah forces are no longer busy with the war in Lebanon".</p>

<p>HTS, led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria branch, controls swathes of the northwest Idlib area as well as small parts of neighbouring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent reported heavy, uninterrupted clashes east of the city of Idlib since Wednesday morning, including air strikes.</p>

<p>A military statement carried by state news agency SANA said that "armed terrorist organisations grouped under so-called 'Nusra terrorist front' present in Aleppo and Idlib provinces launched a large, broad-fronted attack" Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>It said the attack with "medium and heavy weapons targeted safe villages and towns and our military sites in those areas".</p>

<p>The army "in cooperation with friendly forces" confronted the attack "which is still continuing", inflicting "heavy losses" on the armed groups, the military statement said, without reporting army losses.</p>

<p>Syria's conflict broke out after Assad crushed anti-government protests in 2011, spiralling into a complex conflict that has drawn in foreign armies and jihadists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country's infrastructure and industry.</p>

<p>The Idlib region is subject to a ceasefire -- repeatedly violated but which had largely been holding -- brokered by Turkey and Russia after a Syrian government offensive in March 2020.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech mogul Elon Musk has revealed that his artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI, will launch a new AI-powered gaming studio to counter the 'massive corporations' pushing ideologically charged video games. Mr Musk was responding to a post by Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus where the latter expressed dissatisfaction at the current state of gaming. The billionaire said his gaming studio will "make games great again," referencing the MAGA movement, of which Mr Musk was an essential part during the US presidential election.</p>

<p>"I don't understand how game developers and game journalism got so ideologically captured. Gamers have always been trolls, anti-greedy corporations, anti-bs. Gamers have always rejected dumb manipulative bs, and can tell when someone is an outsider poser. Why lean into the bs?" wrote Mr Markus on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>Replying to the post, Mr Musk said: "Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!"</p>

<p>Earlier, the Tesla CEO also criticised the inclusion of a pronoun selection feature in an upcoming Xbox game called Avowed. "Having pronouns in a fantasy video game is utterly unacceptable," he wrote on X followed by an angry emoji.</p>

<p>Calling AI gaming the "future" of the industry, Mr Musk also reacted to a post complaining about Mcirosoft's gaming division for discriminating against Whites during the hiring process.</p>

<p>"Microsoft's gaming division is excluding whites from being hired to work on their video games. All of their new hires are unqualified queer and black people because the company's executives have an explicit mandate against "crusty old white dudes," read the post, to which Mr Musk responded by tagging Microsoft CEO Nadella: "Um, @satyanadella, this is illegal."</p>

<p>xAI managed to raise $6 billion in series B funding in May, reaching a post-money valuation of $24 billion, backed by investors that included Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. A new $5 billion fundraising round is expected soon which could double xAI's valuation to $50 billion in just six months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh has sought to pursue deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's trial in the International Criminal Court even as she faced a trial in a domestic tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity, office of the interim government chief Muhammad Yunus said here on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The Chief Adviser Yunus discussed the issue of Hasina's trial with International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim A Khan who called on him at his official Jamuna residence," an official of the chief adviser's press wing said.</p>

<p>Hasina fled to India on August 5 following widespread protests against her Awami League-led government over a controversial job quota system. Three days later, Yunus, a Nobel laureate, took over as the Chief Adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>He said Yunus, during his meeting with Khan on Wednesday, told him that Bangladesh intends to pursue the charges against Hasina and her allies particularly on charges of carrying out "massacre" during the July-August mass uprising and enforced disappearances during the past 15 years of her rule.</p>

<p>Dozens of cases are now being processed at the Internal Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh (ICT-BD) against Hasina, her cabinet colleagues, several of them being in jail or on the run at home and abroad while Dhaka sought Interpol help for her repatriation from India.</p>

<p>Yunus, earlier, said his government would also seek her return from India to stand trial.</p>

<p>The ICC prosecutor, however, said the international court would like to extend cooperation to ICT-BD, which by now, has issued an arrest warrant for Hasina and several top-ranking members of her Awami League party.</p>

<p>According to the press wing, the duo during their discussion, also discussed the Rohingya crisis and humanitarian assistance for them, the Myanmar situation alongside the prosecution and accountability of atrocities during the July-August mass movement in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Khan informed Yunus that his office had formally sought an arrest warrant for Myanmar's military government chief Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity regarding the treatment of Rohingyas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Thursday said Russia's latest attack on Ukraine shows the "urgency" of backing Kyiv, touting strong support ahead of Donald Trump taking office in January.</p>

<p>"This attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression," Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>Earlier Thursday, Russia pummelled Ukraine's energy grid with almost 200 missiles and drones in what the American president called an "outrageous" attack that left a million people without power.</p>

<p>"On this day, my message to the Ukrainian people is clear: the United States stands with you," added Biden, who has looked to shore up US support for Ukraine in his final weeks in the White House.</p>

<p>Trump is widely expected to bring a policy shift towards Ukraine, which has received almost $60 billion from Washington for its armed forces since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has promised to swiftly end the conflict by mediating a ceasefire deal between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>But his critics have warned that the incoming Republican will likely leverage US military aid to pressure Kyiv into an agreement that left it ceding occupied territory permanently or agreeing not to join NATO.</p>

<p>Trump on Wednesday named his Ukraine envoy as retired general Keith Kellogg, who co-authored a paper earlier this year calling for Washington to leverage military aid as a means of pushing for peace talks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday a landmark law that bans under-16s from social media will result in "less harm" for children.</p>

<p>The crackdown on sites like Facebook, Instagram and X, which was approved by parliament late Thursday, will lead to "better outcomes and less harm for young Australians", he told reporters.</p>

<p>The government did not expect the new law to be implemented perfectly, Albanese said, likening it to a ban on alcohol for under-18s that can sometimes be circumvented.</p>

<p>"But we know that it's the right thing to do," he said at a news conference in Canberra.</p>

<p>Platforms now have a "social responsibility" to make children's safety a priority, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>"We've got your back, is our message to Australian parents."</p>

<p>Social media firms -- which face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million) for failing to comply -- have described the law as "vague", "problematic" and "rushed".</p>

<p>The legislation will take effect after 12 months, but currently offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic piece of legislation that is unenforceable.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) on Thursday expressed solidarity with priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was arrested on charges of sedition for allegedly raising a flag on a stand displaying Bangladesh's national flag.</p>

<p>In a post on X, ISKCON, Inc. stated, "ISKCON, Inc. stands with Chinmoy Krishna Das. Our prayers to Lord Krishna for the protection of all these devotees."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was arrested on charges of sedition for allegedly raising a flag on a stand displaying Bangladesh's national flag. He was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, which denied his bail plea and remanded him in custody.</p>

<p>The arrest has sparked widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.</p>

<p>In a related development, a lawyer filed a petition seeking a ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh, labelling it a "radical organisation" that engages in activities aimed at inciting communal unrest, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina condemned the "unjust" arrest of Das and called for his immediate release.Hasina also voiced concerns about attacks on minorities and their places of worship, urging the authorities to ensure religious freedom and the safety of all communities.</p>

<p>"A senior leader of the Sanatan religious community has been unjustly arrested, and I demand his immediate release. Temples have been set ablaze in Chittagong. Previously, mosques, shrines, churches, monasteries, and homes belonging to the Ahmadiyya community have been attacked, vandalised, looted, and burned. Religious freedom and the safety of all communities must be guaranteed," Sheikh Hasina said in a statement.</p>

<p>Recently, a group of retired judges, bureaucrats, and a sitting MP sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to intervene and address the rising violence and discrimination against Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The arrest has further strained relations between the Bangladesh government and ISKCON, fuelling protests and unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin praised US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday as an experienced and intelligent politician, but said he did not believe Trump was safe after attempts on his life.</p>

<p>Donald Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania in July. In a separate incident in September, a man was charged with attempted assassination after allegedly positioning himself with a rifle at one of Trump's Florida golf courses.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters in Kazakhstan after a summit, Putin said he had been shocked by the way the US election campaign had unfolded.</p>

<p>He cited "the absolutely uncivilised methods used to battle against Trump, up to and including an assassination attempt - and more than once".</p>

<p>"By the way, in my opinion, he is not safe now," said Putin.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, in the history of the United States various incidents have happened. I think he (Trump) is intelligent and I hope he's cautious and understands this."</p>

<p>Putin, who is himself heavily protected, said he had been even more shocked though by how Trump's family and children had been criticised by political opponents during the US election campaign.</p>

<p>He called such behaviour "revolting" and said in Russia not even "bandits" would resort to such methods.</p>

<p>Talking about what he described as the Biden administration's decision to escalate the war in Ukraine by allowing Kyiv to strike Russia with Western missiles, Putin speculated that it could be a ploy to either help Trump by giving him something to roll back or a way of making his life more difficult with Russia.</p>

<p>Either way, Putin said he thought Trump would "find the solution" and said Moscow was ready for dialogue.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Satellite images obtained by Reuters on Thursday show a build-up of Chinese civilian vessels near contested Thitu Island, Manila's key outpost in the South China Sea, but a senior Philippine navy officer said they are "not a cause for concern".</p>

<p>One of the images taken by Maxar Technologies on Monday and reviewed by Reuters shows about 60 vessels, some within 2 nautical miles of Thitu, a strategically important island from which Manila monitors Chinese vessels and aircraft in the busy waterway.</p>

<p>Vice Admiral Alfonso Torres, chief of the Philippines' Western Command, said it was common for "maritime militia" ships to gather in the area. Manila, the Pentagon and foreign diplomats say such vessels work with the Chinese coast guard and navy to strengthen Beijing's presence in disputed waters.</p>

</div>

<p>Rear Admiral Roy Trinidad, Philippines Navy spokesman for the South China Sea, also said maritime militia ships were regularly in the area, adding that Manila was aware of the vessels, which he called an "illegal presence", but there was no need for alarm.</p>

<p>"It's not a cause for concern," Trinidad said. "We don't have to read every action and react to that... What is important for us is to maintain our posture."</p>

<p>Online ship trackers show that many of the vessels in the satellite photos are Chinese-registered fishing craft.</p>

</div>

<p>The Chinese defence ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. China has never confirmed it has a militia of civilian vessels.</p>

<p>The island, which the Philippines calls Pag-Asa, is Manila's biggest and most strategically important in the disputed South China Sea, which is largely claimed by China and through which billions of dollars worth of goods pass each year. A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that Beijing's expansive claims had no basis under international law.</p>

<p>The build-up comes after months of clashes and rammings between Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels and Philippines ships, particularly at the Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals.</p>

<p>Thitu is close to a Chinese naval base and runway on Subi reef, which has sometimes served as a port for large numbers of Chinese maritime militia vessels, Trinidad said.</p>

<p>"When you go in there (to Subi), when you go out, you will pass through the territorial sea of Pag-Asa," he said.</p>

<p>Regional diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, with some noting the Chinese vessels had their transponders on this week, allowing them to be tracked.</p>

<p>Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh said Beijing could be testing Manila's reactions at a moment of domestic political tension in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Embattled Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday accused President Ferdinand Marcos Jr of seeking to remove her from office, after the national police filed a formal complaint accusing her of assault and coercion.</p>

<p>"This needs to be watched in the days ahead," said Koh, of Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.</p>

<p>If the militia presence continues, Koh said, it could be that China is hoping to delay Philippine construction work on the island.</p>

<p>A new aircraft hangar is reportedly due for completion in the next few weeks, the latest in a several moves to buttress the Philippines' presence on Thitu and improve monitoring capabilities.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Benjamin NetanyahuPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel would do "everything" to stop Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon after Iran's top diplomat warned it could end its ban on developing one if Western sanctions are reimposed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel would do "everything" to stop Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon after Iran's top diplomat warned it could end its ban on developing one if Western sanctions are reimposed.</p>

<p>The renewed war of words between the Middle East foes came as Iran prepares to hold key nuclear talks with European governments on Friday which have been overshadowed by their joining with Washington to have Tehran censured by the UN atomic watchdog.</p>

<p>"I will do everything to prevent it from becoming a nuclear (power), I will use all the resources that can be used," Netanyahu told Israeli broadcaster Channel 14 in an interview.</p>

<p>Israel is the region's sole, if undeclared, nuclear-armed state. It has long made preventing any rival from matching it its top defence priority.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Tuesday that the ceasefire that went into effect in Lebanon the following day would allow Israel to focus on Iran. He did not elaborate on what action he envisaged.</p>

<p>Iran launched two missile barrages at Israel over the past year in retaliation for the killing of leaders from Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as an Iranian general.</p>

<p>Israel responded both times with limited attacks on Iran, most recently bombing several military sites on October 26.</p>

<p>Last week's chiding at the International Atomic Energy Agency prompted a defiant response from Tehran, but its officials have since signalled willingness to engage with others ahead of the return of US president-elect Donald Trump, whose last administration pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against Iran.</p>

<p><strong>- Current doctrine 'insufficient' -</strong></p>

<p>Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but according to the IAEA, it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state enriching uranium to 60 percent.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Guardian newspaper, published on the eve of Iran's talks with Britain, France and Germany, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that frustration in Tehran over unmet commitments, such as lifting sanctions, was fuelling debate over whether the country should alter its nuclear policy.</p>

<p>"We have no intention to go further than 60 percent for the time being, and this is our determination right now," he told the British daily.</p>

<p>But, he added, "there is this debate going on in Iran, and mostly among the elites... whether we should change our nuclear doctrine" as so far it has proven to be "insufficient in practice".</p>

<p>A 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers aimed to give Iran relief from crippling Western sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear programme to prevent it from developing a weapons capability.</p>

<p>Tehran has consistently denied any such ambition. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final authority in Iran's decision-making, has issued a religious decree, or fatwa, prohibiting atomic weapons.</p>

<p>Tehran's willingness to sit down with the three European governments so soon after the censure comes just weeks before Trump is set to return to the White House.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump focused on reimposing heavy sanctions on Iran following his administration's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 deal three years after it was agreed.</p>

<p>In retaliation for the US withdrawal, Tehran reduced its compliance with the deal, raising its uranium enrichment levels to 60 percent -- closer to the 90 percent required for a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Legal obligations' -</strong></p>

<p>Under the 2015 accord -- which will expire in October 2025 -- Iran's enrichment was capped at 3.67 percent.</p>

<p>Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who serves as the political deputy to Araghchi, is scheduled to represent Iran in Friday's talks.</p>

<p>He will meet beforehand with Enrique Mora, deputy secretary general of the European Union's foreign affairs arm, according to Iran's official news agency IRNA.</p>

<p>Last week, the 35-nation board of governors of the IAEA adopted a resolution proposed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States condemning Iran for its lack of cooperation on nuclear issues.</p>

<p>Iran described the move as "politically motivated" and in response announced the launch of "new advanced centrifuges" designed to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p>

<p>For Tehran, the goal of the talks on Friday is to avoid a "double disaster" scenario, in which it would face renewed pressures from both Trump and European governments, according to political analyst Mostafa Shirmohammadi.</p>

<p>He noted that Iran's support among European governments had been eroded by allegations it offered military assistance for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Iran has denied these accusations and hopes to mend relations with Europe, while also maintaining a firm stance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In the last few years, there has been a spate of military coups in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Sudan and Guinea. Military rule, long dormant in African politics, is back.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last few years, there has been a spate of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/30/mapping-africas-coups-detat-across-the-years">military coups</a> in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Sudan and Guinea. <a href="https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/">Military rule</a>, long dormant in African politics, is back.</p>

<p>Coup leaders have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guineas-suppression-protests-stokes-anger-junta-loses-shine-2023-05-25/">suppressed protest</a>, <a href="https://rsf.org/en/burkina-faso-authorities-confirm-conscription-three-missing-media-professionals-amidst-growing">gagged the media</a> and spilled much civilian blood in the name of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/01/mali-islamist-armed-groups-army-target-civilians">public safety</a>. They claim to be protecting their people from enemies both internal and external – some invented to justify their takeovers and others very real (while military regimes have arguably made <a href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violent-extremism-sahel">violent extremism worse</a>, they did not create it).</p>

<p>The generals fight with one another as much as with their enemies, leading to duelling coups in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/21/is-burkina-faso-on-the-cusp-of-another-coup">Burkina Faso</a> and a full-on civil war <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2024/09/30/elamin-calls-for-attention-aid-to-sudan/">in Sudan</a>.</p>

<p>In west Africa, soldiers have shaken up the geopolitical order, pushing away <a href="https://theconversation.com/france-has-started-withdrawing-its-troops-from-mali-what-is-it-leaving-behind-170375">France</a> and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/niger-has-cut-military-ties-with-the-us-why-this-is-bad-for-the-sahels-security-226027">United States</a>, while drawing the Russian Federation (or more precisely, <a href="https://theconversation.com/russian-flags-waved-during-nigeria-protests-why-its-a-cause-for-concern-236611">Russia-funded mercenaries</a>) closer.</p>

<p>Outside observers, and a fair number of insiders, were blindsided by these events. That's because military rule, with its drab aesthetics and Cold War trappings, seemed like a relic of the past. Explanations for its return have mostly focused on meddling outsiders, <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/iron-curtain-sahel">especially Russia</a>. Others emphasise the inherent vice of African states – the weaknesses that were there from the beginning of independence, including poverty and corruption, that made people disenchanted with democracy.</p>

<p>I'm a <a href="https://history.uchicago.edu/directory/samuel-fury-childs-daly">military historian</a>, and over the last few years I watched with alarm as the history I was writing about military dictatorships in the 1980s became current events. Military rule has deep roots, as my open-access book <a href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/93926/Daly_9781478094180_txt.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">Soldier's Paradise: Militarism in Africa After Empire</a> argues. The coups of the last few years are a return to one of independent Africa's most important political traditions: militarism.</p>

<p>Militarism, or rule by soldiers, is a form of government where military objectives blur into politics, and the values of the armed forces become the values of the state at large.</p>

<p>West Africa's recent string of coups can only be understood in the long view of postcolonial history. The military regimes of the past were brutally innovative. They made new rules, new institutions and new standards for how people should interact. They promised to make Africa an orderly and prosperous paradise. They failed, but their promises were popular.</p>

<h2>Africa's military regimes</h2>

<p><iframe aria-label="Locator map" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="600" id="datawrapper-chart-dMthR" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dMthR/1/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="" width="100%"></iframe></p>

<p>Militaries ruled by force, not consensus, but plenty of people liked their disciplinary verve. Whipping the public into shape, sometimes literally, had a real appeal to people who felt that the world had become too unruly. Independence did not always mean freedom, and soldiers' rigid ideas shaped decolonisation in ways that we're only starting to understand.</p>

<p>Long submerged by more hopeful ideological currents, militarism is now rising back to the surface of African politics. My <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/9781478059820">book</a> describes where militarism came from, and why it lasted so long.</p>

<h2>Petty and paranoid</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3876235">Between 1956 and 2001</a> there were about 80 successful coups, 108 failed ones and 139 plots across Africa south of the Sahara. <a href="https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/">Some countries</a> had many coups (Sudan has the highest, with 18 known attempts since 1950) while others had none (like Botswana). But even in places where the military wasn't in charge, the threat of a military takeover shaped how civilians governed.</p>

<p>The successful coups produced military regimes that were remarkably durable. Their leaders promised their regimes would be “transitional” or “custodial” and that they would hand back power to civilians as soon as they could.</p>

<p>Few did, and in some countries military rule lasted for decades. This could involve a graveyard-like stability where a single soldier-king ruled for an entire generation (like Burkina Faso), or constant turmoil as one junta gave way to another (like Nigeria). Military governments were petty and paranoid – each officer knew he had a line of rivals behind him waiting for their moment.</p>

<p>In these “revolutions”, as coup plotters called their takeovers, a new ideology emerged. Militarism was a coherent and relatively consistent vision for society, even though not all military regimes were the same. It had its own political values (obedience, discipline), morals (honour, bravery, respect for rank), and an economic logic (order, which they promised would bring prosperity).</p>

<p>It had a distinct aesthetic, and a vision for what Africa should look and feel like. The military's internal principles became the rules of politics at large. Officers came to believe that the training they used to make civilians into soldiers could transform their countries from the ground up. Some came to believe, ironically, that only strict discipline would bring true freedom.</p>

<p>The army officers who took power tried to remake their societies along military lines. They had utopian plans, and their ideology could not be boiled down to the big ideas of their times, like capitalism and communism. There were military regimes of the left, right and centre; radical and conservative; nativist and internationalist.</p>

<p>Militarism was a freestanding ideology, not just American liberalism, Soviet socialism or European neocolonialism dressed up in a uniform. Powerful outsiders pulled some of the strings in African politics, but not all of them, and officers were proud of the fact that they followed no one's orders but their own.</p>

<h2>Military tyranny</h2>

<p>Part of militarism's appeal was its maverick independence, and military regimes endeared themselves to the public by cutting ties with unpopular foreigners, just like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/05/france-departure-niger-failure-former-colonies">Niger</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/23/burkina-faso-ends-french-military-accord-says-will-defend-itself">Burkina Faso</a> did with France in 2023.</p>

<p>Soldiers ran their countries like they fought wars. Combat was their metaphor for politics. Their goal was to win – and they accepted that people would get hurt along the way.</p>

<p>But what did “winning” look like when the enemy was their own people? They declared war on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n09/adewale-maja-pearce/diary">indiscipline</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jsh/shae038/7686204">drugs</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108887748">crime</a>. To civilians, all of this was hard to distinguish from tyranny, and military rule felt like a long, brutal occupation.</p>

<p>No military dictatorship succeeded in making the martial utopia that soldiers promised. Other parts of government pushed back against the military's plans, and African judiciaries proved especially formidable opponents. Civil society groups fought them tooth and nail, and challenges came from abroad, especially from the African diaspora.</p>

<p>Like most revolutions that don't succeed, militarists blamed the public for not committing to their vision and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtac006">outsiders</a> for sabotaging them. They do this <a href="https://www.passblue.com/2024/10/01/special-report-burkina-fasos-harsh-words-for-the-un-but-praises-itself/">today, too</a>.</p>

<p>Today's military regimes don't seem to have the same long-term visions of their predecessors, but the longer they stay in power the more likely they are to start making plans. Despite <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/surge-military-coups-africa-threatens-human-rights-and-rule-law">all their promises</a> to return to the barracks, they don't seem to be going any time soon.</p>

<p>If we're trying to anticipate what the continent's military regimes might do next, it makes sense to look to the past. In the late 20th century, military regimes promised to make Africa into a “soldier's paradise”. That promise is part of their strategy today.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday threatened Hezbollah with an "intensive war" if the Lebanese militant group violates a day-old ceasefire.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Hezbollah Thursday with an "intensive war" if it breaches a fragile Lebanon ceasefire, which on its second day is straining under pressure from both sides.</p>

<p>Hours before, the Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah weapons facility in south Lebanon, where it said "terrorist activity was identified". Earlier it opened fire on people it said were in breach of the truce.</p>

<p>The ceasefire, which came into effect before dawn on Wednesday, seeks to end a war that has killed thousands in Lebanon and sparked mass displacements in both Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>"If necessary, I gave a directive to the (Israeli army)" to wage "an intensive war" in the event of any breach of the truce, Netanyahu said in an interview with Israeli broadcaster Channel 14.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Israeli military had said "terrorist activity was identified in a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon," adding that "the threat was thwarted" by its air force.</p>

<p>Nazih Eid, mayor of Baysariyeh in south Lebanon, told AFP a strike had hit an area of his town.</p>

<p>"They targeted a forested area not accessible to civilians," he said.</p>

<p>The deal to end the war in Lebanon was brokered by Israel's top ally the United States and France.</p>

<p>Under the agreement, Israeli troops will hold their positions but "a 60-day period will commence in which the Lebanese military and security forces will begin their deployment towards the south", a US official told reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Then, Israel should begin a phased withdrawal without a vacuum forming that Hezbollah or others could rush into, the official said.</p>

<p><strong>- Two wounded -</strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, the Lebanese army deployed across the south, where Hezbollah has long held sway and only the army and UN peacekeepers are to maintain an armed presence under the terms of the ceasefire.</p>

<p>The Israeli and Lebanese militaries have both called on residents of frontline villages to avoid returning home immediately.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Israeli fire wounded two people in a border village, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said that "over the past hour, several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire".</p>

<p>The army "opened fire toward them", the statement said, adding that the Israeli military "remains in southern Lebanon and will actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement".</p>

<p>For the most part, however, the ceasefire appeared to be holding.</p>

<p>A Lebanese army source said its forces were "conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints" south of the Litani River, without advancing into areas where Israeli forces were still present.</p>

<p>The Israeli army on Thursday announced a nighttime curfew for areas south of the river, some 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border.</p>

<p><strong>- Devastation -</strong></p>

<p>While there was joy around Lebanon that the war has ended, the country faces a long recovery.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Lebanese who fled their homes during the war have headed back to their towns and villages only to find them devastated.</p>

<p>"Despite all the destruction and the sorrow, we are happy to be back," said Umm Mohammed Bzeih, a widow who fled the southern village of Zibqin with her four children two months ago.</p>

<p>"I feel as if our souls have returned," she said, visibly exhausted as she swept up the shattered glass and rubble that carpeted the floor.</p>

<p>In the border village of Qlayaa, residents threw rice and flowers to celebrate the arrival of Lebanese soldiers.</p>

<p>The majority-Christian village is nestled in an area that is home mostly to Shiite Muslim communities.</p>

<p>Lebanon is deeply divided along political and sectarian lines, with Hezbollah long dominant among the Shiite population.</p>

<p>"We only want the Lebanese army," chanted residents of Qlayaa, as they clapped and cheered for the troops and waved the Lebanese flag.</p>

<p><strong>- Crisis -</strong></p>

<p>Even before the conflict, Lebanon had been wracked for years by political and economic crises, with World Bank figures from earlier this year indicating poverty had tripled in a decade.</p>

<p>On Thursday, there was a glimmer of hope as the NNA reported parliament would meet to elect a president on January 9, ending a two-year vacuum.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, in its first statement after the ceasefire, Hezbollah said&nbsp; its fighters would "remain in total readiness to deal with the Israeli enemy's ambitions and its attacks".</p>

<p>Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah told AFP his group was cooperating in the army's deployment to the south, adding the group had "no visible weapons or bases" in the area.</p>

<p><strong>- Scepticism -</strong></p>

<p>In northern Israel, which has come under steady attack from Hezbollah for more than a year, there was hope tinged with scepticism over whether the truce might last.</p>

<p>Nissim Ravivo, a 70-year-old in the coastal city of Nahariya near the border with Lebanon, voiced disappointment.</p>

<p>"It's a shame, we should have continued for at least another two months and finished the job," he said. "We still don't feel safe and we are not happy about it."</p>

<p>Lebanon says at least 3,961 people have been killed in the country since October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities there say.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran could end its ban on acquiring nuclear weapons if Western sanctions are reimposed, its top diplomat told The Guardian in an interview published Thursday ahead of talks on the matter.</p>

<p>Iran is set to meet with Britain, France and Germany for talks on its nuclear programme on Friday after the three governments joined with the United States to have Tehran censured by the UN atomic watchdog.</p>

<p>Last week's chiding prompted a defiant response from Tehran, but its officials have since signalled willingness to engage with others ahead of the return of US president-elect Donald Trump, whose last administration pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but according to UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state enriching uranium to 60 percent.</p>

<p>In an interview published on the eve of the talks, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned frustration in Tehran over unmet commitments, such as lifting sanctions, was fuelling debate on whether the country should alter its nuclear policy.</p>

<p>"We have no intention to go further than 60 percent for the time being, and this is our determination right now," he told Britain's The Guardian newspaper.</p>

<p>But, he added, "there is this debate going on in Iran, and mostly among the elites... whether we should change our nuclear doctrine" as so far it has proven to be "insufficient in practice".</p>

<p>The 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers aimed to give Iran relief from crippling Western sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear programme to prevent it from developing a weapons capability.</p>

<p>Tehran has consistently denied any intention of pursuing atomic weapons.</p>

<p>Tehran's willingness to sit down with the three European governments so soon after the censure comes just weeks before Trump is set to return to the White House.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump focused on reimposing heavy sanctions on Iran following his administration's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 deal three years after it was agreed.</p>

<p>In retaliation for the US withdrawal, Tehran reduced its compliance with the deal, raising its uranium enrichment levels to 60 percent -- close to the 90 percent required for a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p><strong>'Legal obligations'</strong></p>

<p>Under the 2015 accord -- which will expire in October 2025 -- Iran's enrichment was capped at 3.67 percent.</p>

<p>Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final authority in Iran's decision-making, has issued a religious decree, or fatwa, prohibiting atomic weapons.</p>

<p>Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who serves as the political deputy to Araghchi, is scheduled to represent Iran in Friday's talks.</p>

<p>He will meet beforehand with Enrique Mora, deputy secretary general of the European Union's foreign affairs arm, according to the IRNA state news agency.</p>

<p>Last week, the 35-nation board of governors of the IAEA adopted a resolution condemning Iran for its lack of cooperation on nuclear issues.</p>

<p>Iran described as "politically motivated" the resolution brought by Britain, France, Germany and the United States.</p>

<p>In response, Tehran announced the launch of "new advanced centrifuges" designed to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p>

<p>For Tehran, the goal of the talks on Friday is to avoid a "double disaster" scenario, in which it would face renewed pressures from both Trump and European nations, according to political analyst Mostafa Shirmohammadi.</p>

<p>He noted that Iran's support among European governments had been eroded by allegations it offered military assistance for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Iran has denied these accusations and hopes to mend relations with Europe, while also maintaining a firm stance.</p>

<p>The IAEA's censure resolution urged Iran to "fulfil its legal obligations" under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) ratified in 1970, which requires member states to declare and maintain their nuclear materials under IAEA supervision.</p>

<p>In response, Araghchi, who was instrumental in the nuclear negotiations in 2015, said Iran was commissioning "several thousand advanced centrifuges".</p>

<p>The head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Mohammad Eslami, said Wednesday that they had begun inserting gas into the centrifuges.</p>

<p>Centrifuges work by rapidly spinning uranium gas to increase the proportion of the fissile isotope U-235.</p>

<p>Iran's nuclear programme dates back to the late 1950s when the United States, then an ally, signed a civil cooperation agreement with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German investigators suspect a Berlin doctor of killing eight elderly patients under his care and setting fire to some of their homes to cover up his crimes, prosecutors said Thursday.</p>

<p>The unnamed suspect, 40, who worked in palliative care for a nursing service, was remanded in custody in August on suspicion of killing four women aged 72 to 94 and starting fires at their homes.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths of men and women aged between 61 and 83, they said.</p>

<p>Police in August said the man was being investigated on four counts of manslaughter, one count of arson and three counts of attempted arson.</p>

<p>The Berlin prosecutors said they were now treating the alleged killings as murder cases.</p>

<p>"The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," they said, accusing him of a "lust for murder".</p>

<p>Police in August said the man was suspected of killing four female patients in the care of his nursing service in Berlin between June 11 and July 24.</p>

<p>In one case, an 87-year-old woman was resuscitated after emergency services arrived, but died later in hospital.</p>

<p>In another, the suspect allegedly started a blaze but the fire went out.</p>

<p>"When he realised this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her flat and that nobody was answering the doorbell," police said.</p>

<p>In the four new cases, which date back to the period from June 2022 to April 2024, the suspect is accused of killing two men and two women in Berlin.</p>

<p>In one case, he is suspected of administering a cocktail of medications to a 70-year-old female patient in her apartment in Berlin's Tempelhof district and then starting a fire to cover up his crime.</p>

<p>The fire department, called by a neighbour, was able to prevent the flames from spreading to the rest of the building.</p>

<p>He is also accused of administering deadly medications to two men, aged 70 and 83, and to a 61-year-old woman.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Queensland's Liberal National Party government has introduced a contentious youth crime bill, acknowledging it will "directly discriminate" against children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>David Crisafulli, the premier, put the Queensland safer bill in place on Thursday - the first legislation of the government since its win. According to him, the legislation would "serve as a deterrence to crime. They will reduce the number of victims."</p>

<p>The legislation, dubbed "Queensland Safer," aims to increase maximum sentences for youth crimes, aligning with the party's "adult crime, adult time" election promise, as mentioned in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/28/queensland-youth-crime-laws-david-crisafulli-lnp-changes-children-life-sentences-murder" rel="noindex,nofollow">The Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>"The amendments will treat children less favourably than adults in the same circumstances and therefore directly discriminate on the basis of age, limiting their right to enjoy their right to liberty without discrimination, their right to equal protection of the law without discrimination and their right to equal and effective protection against discrimination," the statement says.</p>

<p>Based on the government's statement of compatibility with human rights, the bill will disproportionately affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, who are already overrepresented in the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Attorney General Deb Frecklington conceded that the bill may increase the number of children in state watch houses, resulting in "limitations to the protection from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment" and undermining their right to humane treatment.</p>

<p>"Watchhouses are not appropriate or humane places in which to detain children (particularly for any lengthy period of time)", he said and added that the negative impact outweighs the aims of punishment.</p>

<p>Critics argue that the legislation violates human rights, particularly the principle of detention as a last resort, which will only apply to adults. The bill also allows children as young as 10 to be sentenced to life in prison for certain offenses.</p>

<p>The legislation has received backlash from human rights organisations, lawyers, experts and also the state's human rights commissioner.</p>

<p>Queensland's human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said that the new youth crime laws - which will bring about life sentences for children "who still have their baby teeth" are evidence that the "society that has lost its way".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Griffith University criminologist William Wood is of the opinion that prison does not have a positive impact in reducing crime. "Detention and prisons don't reduce crime, they produce crime", he said, adding that prison makes children tougher.</p>

<p>It will go to a parliamentary committee for eight days before returning to parliament in December for a final vote.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin on Thursday threatened to strike "decision-making centres" in Kyiv with Russia's new hypersonic missile, hours after Moscow pummelled Ukraine's energy grid in an attack that left a million people without power.</p>

<p>Russia fired more than 90 missiles and around 100 drones during the barrage, Kyiv said, in what the Kremlin chief called a "response" to Ukrainian strikes on his territory with Western missiles.</p>

<p>The nearly three-year war has seen a sharp escalation in recent days, with both sides deploying new weapons in a bid to gain the upper hand before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.</p>

<p>"We do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial or decision-making centres, including in Kyiv," Putin told a press conference in the Kazakh capital Astana, referring to the hypersonic missile.</p>

<p>Kyiv's government district -- an area of the capital where multiple government buildings are located -- is protected with intense security, but fears for it have risen over the last week.</p>

<p>Russia last week tested its new Oreshnik ballistic missile on Ukraine, and Putin boasted on Thursday that firing several of the weapons at once would have the equivalent force of a nuclear strike, or a "meteorite" hit.</p>

<p>He earlier said the overnight barrage was a "response to continued attacks on our territory by (US) ATACMS missiles."</p>

<p>"As I have said repeatedly, there will always be a response from our side."</p>

<p>Putin also claimed Russia knew how many long-range weapons were given to Kyiv and where they were located.</p>

<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Putin's threat to strike Kyiv was a "testament to weakness" and said the West would not be perturbed by his words.</p>

<h2><strong>DESPICABLE ESCALATION</strong></h2>

<p>The fresh strikes came as Ukrainians braced for a tough winter, with much of its energy infrastructure already damaged by almost three years of war, and as Russian troops advanced in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Tensions have ratcheted up over the last few weeks as both sides look to secure an advantage on the battlefield ahead of Trump's January inauguration.</p>

<p>Putin suggested he had hopes for Trump's second term, describing the Republican on Thursday as an "intelligent person", capable of finding a "solution", without specifying what he was referring to.</p>

<p>The Russian leader spoke hours after the overnight barrage that left more than half a million subscribers in Ukraine's western Lviv region cut off from electricity.</p>

<p>Another 280,000 in the western Rivne region and 215,000 in the northwestern Volyn region also lost power, officials said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's emergency services said the Russian overnight strikes inflicted damage in 14 regions across the country, with the nation's West hard-hit.</p>

<p>Zelensky said that Russia had also fired "cluster munitions" during the attack, calling it a "very despicable escalation of Russian terrorist tactics."</p>

<p>AFP journalists in the capital Kyiv heard blasts ring out over the capital overnight as air defence systems targeted Russian drones and missiles, with locals crowding into the underground metro system for cover.</p>

<p>The energy ministry said it was the 11th massive Russian attack on Ukraine's civilian energy infrastructure this year.</p>

<p>A senior UN official, Rosemary DiCarlo, this month warned Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure may make this winter the "harshest since the start of the war".</p>

<h3><strong>PUTIN BOASTS OF NEW MISSILE</strong></h3>

<p>Since Moscow shocked the West and Kyiv by testing its new ballistic missile Oreshnik on the city of Dnipro last week, Russian officials have touted the arm's might.</p>

<p>In Astana, Putin said the Oreshnik could turn anything "into dust" and hit at a temperature comparable to "the surface of the sun." &nbsp;</p>

<p>He said Russia was "forced" to "test (the weapon) in combat conditions" after Kyiv's first strike on Russian territory using ATACMS.</p>

<p>Putin said Thursday the Oreshnik could travel "around three kilometres per second" and that its elements could reach a temperature almost "like the surface of the sun." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia also sentenced a lawyer, Dmitry Talantov, to seven years in prison for comparing Moscow's actions in Ukraine at the start of the invasion to "Nazi practises", a day after putting an invasion critic back on trial.</p>

<p>Ukraine, meanwhile, sentenced a woman in the eastern Donetsk region to 15 years in jail on high treason charges for passing sensitive military information to Russia.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Referring to Trump's decision of imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, Kimmel said, "Some say this is the dumbest thing he's come up with since Don Jr."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jimmy Kimmel in his show last night really doubted President-elect Donald Trump's grasp of economics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Whoever would have guessed that the mail-order steak salesman who declared bankruptcy six times would be so bad with money?" He took a shot at Trump's financial mismanagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Referring to Trump's decision of imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, Kimmel said, "Some say this is the dumbest thing he's come up with since Don Jr."</p>

<p>"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders", Trump had said.</p>

<p>Kimmel remarked that the countries on which these taxes are imposed - China, Canada and Mexico, do not even pay the import taxes, it is the US companies that will pay those taxes which will ultimately come down to the consumer and result in "$40 avocados". He added, "So by next year, if you want extra guacamole, it'll be cheaper to go get it."</p>

<p>He went on to further lambast Trump's tariff plans by saying the aftermath will be inflation going through the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bringing Canada into the picture, Trump took a dig at the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar as well, saying, "Poor Canada is like what did we do? I mean be honest is this because of Drake?"</p>

<p>He also pointed out the irony of some of Trump's merchandise being produced in China - a country he has repeatedly accused of having unfair trade practices and stealing jobs in America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So now if you want to purchase a tie from the Donald J.Trump collection, you better get it immediately, or it's going to cost an extra 10%," Kimmel quipped.</p>

<p>A recent investigation found that Trump's "God Bless the USA" Bibles were printed for only $3 in China and sold for $59.99 and if hand-signed by the former president, would sell for $1000. He never got around to disclosing how much he makes per sale though. Although the "Make America Great Again" are labelled as "Made In America", the origins of other products still remain murky.</p>

<p>Mexico has threatened Trump with retaliatory tariffs, while Canadian Prime Minister has had talks with the president-elect regarding the challenges.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin apologised to former German chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, saying he did not mean to scare her when he brought his pet Labrador to a meeting with her in 2007.</p>

<p>Merkel, who has a well-documented fear of the animals, recalled the tense encounter in her memoir released Tuesday, accusing Putin of inviting the pet as a "demonstration of power" and taking glee in her discomfort.</p>

<p>"I did not know that she was afraid of dogs," the Kremlin chief said Thursday at a press conference in the Kazakh capital Astana.</p>

<p>"I once again appeal to her via the media and say: 'Angela, please forgive me, I did not want to cause you any heartache.' On the contrary, I wanted to create a favourable atmosphere for our conversation," he added.</p>

<p>"If you ever -- I realise it is unlikely -- come again, I will not do it under any circumstances," Putin said.</p>

<p>Images from their 2007 meeting in the Russian city of Sochi showed Putin's black Labrador Retriever Konni sniffing around while the German leader sat in her chair, smiling nervously.</p>

<p>Merkel said of the 2007 encounter in her memoir: "I could tell from Putin's facial expressions that he was enjoying the situation."</p>

<p>Putin is known to be fond of dogs and has received them from visiting dignitaries on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>He received Konni as a gift from Sergei Shoigu, who later became his defence minister.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An Israeli airstrike on Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Qubaisi, the head of Hezbollah's missile division. The cross-border firing between Israel and Hezbollah continued as the Iran-backed militant group fired over 300 rockets towards Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Ibrahim Qubaisi, Hezbollah's commander in charge of its rocket and missile forces, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed his death, stating that Qubaisi had been a central figure in Hezbollah's missile capabilities for decades.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The airstrike followed intense cross-border clashes between Hezbollah and Israel, with the militant group launching approximately 300 rockets at northern Israeli cities including Haifa, Safed, and Nazareth. Israeli air raid sirens were triggered across the Galilee region.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In addition to Qubaisi, the IDF claimed that at least two other high-ranking Hezbollah commanders were eliminated in the strike. These leaders were involved in Hezbollah's missile operations, which have increasingly posed a threat to Israel.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Hezbollah acknowledged Qubaisi's death, releasing a statement describing him as a martyr "on the road to Jerusalem," a term they use for fighters killed by Israeli forces.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">A veteran of Hezbollah, Qubaisi joined the group in the 1980s. Over the years, he commanded various missile and rocket units, including the precision-guided missile program, and was deeply involved in Hezbollah's military strategy against Israel. He had close ties with senior military leaders within the group.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Qubaisi played a key role in Hezbollah's 2000 Mount Dov operation, which involved the abduction of three Israeli soldiers. The soldiers were later found dead, and their bodies were returned in a 2004 prisoner exchange. His involvement in that high-profile attack cemented his status within Hezbollah's military wing.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that the airstrike on the Dahiyeh suburb also killed six civilians and injured 15 others. This is part of a broader escalation that has claimed hundreds of lives in Lebanon in recent days, mostly due to Israeli airstrikes.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Tuesday's missile exchange follows a surge in violence between Israel and Hezbollah since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023. There are growing concerns that this could spiral into a full-blown war involving multiple fronts in the Middle East, drawing in Iran-backed groups from Yemen and Iraq.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Lebanon is on the brink of disaster, while US President Joe Biden urged both sides to avoid escalating the conflict.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained defiant, vowing to continue striking Hezbollah's military targets in Lebanon. "We will continue to hit Hezbollah," Netanyahu declared, stating that any home sheltering missiles would be destroyed.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[It took nearly a century to discover a total of 430 figurative Nazca geoglyphs, which offer significant insights into the ancient cultures at the Nazca Pampa.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have always been perplexed by the Nazca Lines, ancient designs etched into the southern Peruvian desert, since they were found almost a century ago. Researchers have just discovered 303 more of these enigmatic figures, adding even more enigma to the mysterious location, thanks to artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Among the recently found geoglyphs are a number of interesting patterns. While some might be easily identifiable, others might not seem to be. Researchers discovered that some of the pictures resemble killer whales with knives, cats, camels, and even in the shape of the popular Pixar robot character Wall-E. Some photos only acquire an otherworldly aspect that adds more mystery to these extremely ancient pieces of art.</p>

<p>The Nazca Lines have a purpose and meaning that have puzzled researchers for years now, dating back about 400 BC. In this respect, though the meaning of such is unknown, the recently found geoglyphs contribute to adding evidence on how just artistic and ingenious the people of Nazca were.</p>

<p>A joint effort involving scientists at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Centre in New York and Yamagata University in Japan revealed the discovery, which was published in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407652121"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></a> Through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), they were able to decipher patterns concealed beneath the sands of the Nazca Desert that had never been seen before.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2407652121">release</a>, after training the model on images of existing geoglyphs, the research team used it to look for more. They found 303 that they were able to confirm through site visits by human experts.</p>

<p>As expected, many of the lines comprising the newly found geoglyphs were faint, but the researchers could discern what they depict, mainly humans and domesticated animals, though some were abstract, such as a knife-wielding killer whale. The team plans to continue using the AI app to search for more examples of the ancient art.</p>

<p>Such a discovery is more than sure to reinvigorate interest in the Nazca Lines and encourage further research into the ancient civilisation that created them.</p>

<p><strong>What are Nazca Lines?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/knife-wielding-orca-and-alien-looking-figures-among-300-nazca-lines-discovered-in-groundbreaking-ai-study"><em>Live Science</em></a>, the Nazca Lines are a group of large human-carved geoglyphs located in a roughly 170-square-mile (440 square kilometres) area of Peru's Nazca Desert. The ancient artworks were likely created between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500 by members of the pre-Incan civilisation, known as the Nazca (or Nasca), who removed the upper layers of the desert's red-tinged surface pebbles to reveal sections of lighter soil in a wide range of different shapes and sizes. Researchers had already found around 430 Nazca Lines since the mysterious shapes were rediscovered by aeroplane passengers in the 1920s. Most of these geoglyphs were identified in the last 20 years with the help of advancements in satellite imagery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's campaign said that intelligence officials have identified that Iranian threats have "heightened in the past few months".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was briefed on Tuesday by US intelligence officials on alleged threats from Iran to assassinate him, Trump's campaign said.</p>

<p>"President Trump was briefed earlier today by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States," the campaign said in a statement.</p>

<p>The campaign said that intelligence officials have identified that Iranian threats have "heightened in the past few months" and US government officials were working to protect Trump and ensure the elections were not impacted.</p>

<p>Iran has previously denied US claims of interfering in American affairs. Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York and the ODNI did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the 2020 killing by the U.S. of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p>The defendant named Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Federal authorities are separately probing an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course in mid-September and a July 13 shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania. There has been no indication of Iranian involvement in either of those.</p>

<p>US government agencies said last week that Iranian hackers sent emails containing stolen material from the Republican former president's campaign to people involved in Democratic President Joe Biden's then re-election campaign, part of an alleged broader effort by Tehran to influence the US election.</p>

<p>Biden stepped aside as candidate in late July and was replaced by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who faces Trump in a tight race for the November 5 US elections.</p>

<p>In August, the United States accused Iran of launching cyber operations against the campaigns of both US presidential candidates. Iran denied the allegations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah announced on Wednesday the death of a commander, hours after the Israeli army said it had killed him in a strike on Beirut's southern suburbs which Lebanese authorities said killed six people.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Iran-backed group announced the death of "commander Ibrahim Mohammed Kobeissi", who was "martyred on the road to Jerusalem", the phrase Hezbollah uses to refer to fighters killed by Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Israel's army said it "eliminated Ibrahim Mohammed Kobeissi, the commander of the missile and rocket network of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation".</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said in a statement that the "Israeli enemy raid on Ghobeiri in Beirut's southern suburbs killed six people and injured 15".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Kobeissi commanded several rocket units, including a precision-guided missile unit, and was hit along with other commanders of Hezbollah's missiles and rockets force.</p>

<p>"Kobeissi was an important source of knowledge in the field of missiles and had close ties with senior Hezbollah military leaders," it said.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a media briefing that "at least two" other commanders from Kobeissi's force were also "eliminated".</p>

<p>The raid came a day after Israel said it had launched another "targeted strike" on Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Ali Karake, its third-in-command, was alive and had moved to safety after a source close to the group told AFP the strike on Monday had targeted him.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and its arch-foe Israel have been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted last October.</p>

<p>But violence has spiralled dramatically in recent days, raising fears of all-out war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is leading by 38 points among Asian American voters against her Republican challenger Donald Trump, according to the results of a poll.</p>

<p>The poll was conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, and its results were released on Tuesday. This is the first survey since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July and Vice President Harris became the Democratic Party's presidential nominee.</p>

<p>According to the poll, Harris, 59, leads 78-year-old Trump by 38 percentage points among Asian American voters, expanding Biden's 15-point lead by 23 percentage points since spring.</p>

<p>As many as 66 per cent of Asian American voters plan on voting for Harris, compared to 28 per cent who say they back former president Trump. Those who say they will support another candidate or are undecided account for six per cent.</p>

<p>In the 2024 Asian American Voter Survey (AAVS), conducted in April-May, 46 per cent of Asian American voters backed Biden, and 31 per cent supported Trump, while 23 per cent said they planned to vote for someone else or were undecided.</p>

<p>In the 2020 AAVS, which was conducted in July-September that year, 54 per cent said they planned to vote for Biden, 30 per cent for Trump, and 16 per cent for someone else or were undecided.</p>

<p>Further, Harris' favourability among Asian American voters has increased by 18 points.</p>

<p>According to the survey, 62 per cent of Asian American voters say they have a favourable opinion of Harris, compared to 35 per cent who have an unfavourable opinion of her, up from the 2024 AAVS, in which 44 per cent had a favourable view of her while 42 per cent unfavourable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, 28 per cent of Asian American voters think favourably about Trump, compared to 70 per cent who have an unfavourable opinion of him. In the 2024 AAVS, 34 per cent had a favourable view of him and 62 per cent unfavourable.</p>

<p>The polls revealed that Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, was far more popular as a vice presidential candidate than the Republican nominee for vice president, JD Vance.</p>

<p>Fifty-six per cent of Asian American voters have a favourable opinion of Walz, compared to 18 per cent who did not, and 26 per cent did not know enough to have an opinion.</p>

<p>It said that 21 per cent of Asian American voters thought favourably of Vance, compared to 58 per cent who did not and 22 per cent did not know enough to have an opinion.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight per cent of Asian American voters also said Harris' identity as a woman is "extremely" or "very" important to them, compared to 27 per cent who say the same about her identity as an Asian Indian or South Asian.</p>

<p>The polls also showed Asian American voters are far more likely to say they've been contacted by the Democratic Party than the Republican Party.</p>

<p>The presidential elections will be held in the US on November 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World leaders lined up at the United Nations on Tuesday to call on Israel to refrain from a full-scale war in Lebanon, with the organization's chief warning the situation was on the "brink."</p>

<p>The UN General Assembly, the high point of the international diplomatic calendar, comes after Lebanese authorities said Israeli strikes had killed 558 people -- 50 of them children.</p>

<p>"Full-scale war is not in anyone's interest. Even though the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible," US President Joe Biden said in his farewell address to the global body.</p>

<p>"In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security to allow the residents from both countries to return to their homes on the border safely," Biden said ahead of an emergency UN Security Council session on Lebanon planned for Wednesday.</p>

<p>Biden's remarks drew disappointment from Lebanon's foreign minister Abdullah Bou Habib who said they were "not promising" and "would not solve the Lebanese problem," as he estimated that the number of people displaced by Israel's strikes has likely soared to reach half a million.</p>

<p>"We should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said when he opened the gathering.</p>

<p>Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said his country was "not eager" for a ground invasion of Lebanon.</p>

<p>"We don't want to send our boys to fight in a foreign country," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'End this war' -</strong></p>

<p>It is unclear what progress can be made to defuse the situation in Lebanon, with efforts to broker a ceasefire in Gaza -- which Israel has relentlessly pounded since October 2023 -- coming to nothing.</p>

<p>Biden on Tuesday pushed again for an elusive ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, telling the global body it was time to "end this war."</p>

<p>Mediator Qatar accused Israel of obstructing Gaza ceasefire talks, with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani saying "there is no Israeli partner for peace" under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>But he added: "We will continue our efforts of mediation to resolve the disputes through peaceful means."</p>

<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Israel of dragging the entire region "into war."</p>

<p>"Not only children but also the UN system is dying in Gaza," Erdogan said in a scathing speech.</p>

<p>Guterres cautioned against "the possibility of transforming Lebanon (into) another Gaza," calling the situation in the Palestinian territory a "non-stop nightmare."</p>

<p>European Council President Charles Michel said that Israel had the right to exist and defend itself but without inflicting "collective punishment" on civilians living in areas targeted by its military.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran -- which backs Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza -- condemned "senseless and incomprehensible" inaction by the UN against Israel.</p>

<p>- 'Charade of hypocrisy' -</p>

<p>Responding to criticism of Israel, Danon called the General Assembly debate an "annual charade of hypocrisy."</p>

<p>"When the UN Secretary-General speaks about the release of our hostages, the UN assembly is silent, but when he speaks about the suffering in Gaza, he receives thunderous applause," Danon said.</p>

<p>Since last year's annual gathering, when Sudan's civil war and Russia's Ukraine invasion dominated, the world has faced an explosion of crises.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people and prompted a military response in Gaza that authorities say has killed at least 41,467 people.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Violence has raged across multiple fronts in the Middle East since the crisis erupted, with the conflict exposing deep divisions at the UN.</p>

<p>Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas took his seat alongside the Palestinian delegation, placed in alphabetical order in the General Assembly for the first time on Tuesday after the delegation received upgraded privileges in May.</p>

<p>At the rostrum, Jordan's King Abdullah II on Tuesday ruled out the forced displacement by Israel of Palestinians to his country, which he said would be a "war crime."</p>

<p>Ukraine was also on the agenda Tuesday with President Volodymyr Zelensky addressing a UN Security Council meeting on the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>"Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what's needed -- forcing Russia into peace," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Biden said that Russian President Vladimir "Putin's war has failed at its core aim. He set out to destroy Ukraine, but Ukraine is still free."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caroline <span class="marks8fyogb34" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Ellison</span>, who testified against her former boyfriend <span class="markz6tuthtlf" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">and</span> FTX founder Sam <span class="mark7eabvdb8a" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Bankman-Fried</span> at his <span class="mark5iekqul2j" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">crypto</span> fraud trial, was <span class="markfy66jpdo2" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">sentence</span>d Tuesday to two years in prison for her role in the case, New York prosecutors told AFP.</p>

<p>Ellison, the former CEO of cryptocurrency firm Alameda Research, received a much lighter sentence than the maximum 110 years she faced after pleading guilty to seven charges, including fraud.</p>

<p>Her defense team had argued against prison time. Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said they had not requested Judge Lewis Kaplan issue a specific sentence, instead simply suggesting he take her earlier cooperation into account.</p>

<p>Ellison served as a key witness in the trial of cryptocurrency superstar Bankman-Fried -- known by his initials "SBF" -- who was sentenced to 25 years in March for one of the largest financial fraud cases in history.</p>

<p>He is serving his sentence in prison and has appealed his conviction.</p>

<p>During her court testimony, Ellison accused Bankman-Fried of dipping into customers' funds to drive his more risky projects. He countered by attempting to pin the blame on Ellison, describing her as a bad manager.</p>

<p>A billionaire before he turned 30, Bankman-Fried had been a poster boy for the cryptocurrency boom.</p>

<p>Within the span of a few months, he had turned his small start-up FTX, first launched in 2019, into the world's second largest cryptocurrency trading platform.</p>

<p>However, as exposed by the Bankman-Fried trial, the company had used the assets deposited into FTX to perform riskier transactions via sister company Alameda Research, as well as purchase real estate and make political donations.</p>

<p>FTX imploded in November 2022, reporting more than $8 billion in debt by the time the company filed for bankruptcy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday at the United Nations that Russia can only be forced into a peace settlement, as he vowed not to negotiate on Moscow's terms to end the war.</p>

<p>Addressing a special UN Security Council session attended by a representative of Russia, Zelensky also joined the United States in pressuring Iran and North Korea for alleged military support to Russia.</p>

<p>Zelensky, on a trip in which he is presenting his "victory plan" for Ukraine, questioned the sincerity of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has suggested freezing lines of control.</p>

<p>"We know some in the world want to talk to Putin," Zelensky said, "to possibly hear from him that he's upset because we are exercising our right to defend our people."</p>

<p>Zelensky, clad in his trademark military fatigues, called such views "insanity."</p>

<p>"Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what's needed -- forcing Russia into peace," he said.</p>

<p>Zelensky said that any end to Russia's two-year-old invasion has to be based on the UN Charter, which enshrines sovereignty by member states.</p>

<p>"One day in this hall, it will surely be said that Russia's war against Ukraine has ended -- not paused, not forgotten, truly ended," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>"This will happen not because someone got tired of the war, not because someone traded something with Putin. Russia's war against Ukraine will end because the UN Charter will work."</p>

<p>Zelensky will on Thursday meet at the White House with President Joe Biden, who in an address to the United Nations urged international support for Ukraine until victory.</p>

<p>Zelensky's political positioning comes weeks ahead of a US election in which Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has described billions of dollars of US aid to Ukraine as wasteful and voiced admiration for Putin.</p>

<p>- China calls for peace push -</p>

<p>Zelensky again promised a second "peace summit" and said he was inviting both China and India, key powers that have refused to go along with Western sanctions on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, addressing the Security Council, welcomed what he described as rising pressure for diplomacy.</p>

<p>"Dialogue and negotiation are the only viable way to settle the Ukraine crisis. If day after day, peace talks cannot be launched, then misjudgment and miscalculation would build, which leads to even greater crisis," he said.</p>

<p>He insisted China was devoted to peace, saying: "China is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor are we a party to it."</p>

<p>But he spoke ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who again charged that China has been fueling Russia's military build-up through the export of items nominally for civilian use including advanced electronics and machine tools.</p>

<p>Blinken rejected suggestions that his criticism was hypocritical when the United States is arming Ukraine.</p>

<p>"There is a profound difference. Russia is the aggressor. Ukraine is the victim," Blinken said.</p>

<p>He called for the United Nations to act against both North Korea, which has ramped up military supplies to Russia, and Iran, recently accused by US intelligence of shipping short-range missiles to Russia.</p>

<p>"Support from Tehran and Pyongyang is helping Putin inflict carnage, suffering and ruin on innocent Ukrainian men, women, children," Blinken said.</p>

<p>Zelensky said of the two countries: "Russia has no legitimate reason -- none at all -- for making Iran and North Korea de facto accomplices in its criminal war in Europe, with their weapons killing us, killing Ukrainians."</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, a self-styled moderate in the cleric-run state, on Monday denied Tehran has sent weapons and criticized Moscow for its "aggression."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The gunman accused of planning to kill Donald Trump at his Florida golf course was indicted Tuesday on three additional counts, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, the US Department of Justice announced.</p>

<p>Ryan Routh, 58, was arrested on September 15 after Secret Service agents spotted him with a gun near the course where Trump was playing.</p>

<p>He has already been charged with two gun crimes in relation to the incident.</p>

<p>The new indictment was issued late Tuesday by a grand jury -- a panel of citizens with investigative powers -- in Miami, Florida, the justice department said in a statement.</p>

<p>Court documents indicated that the case was assigned at random to Judge Aileen Cannon -- a Trump appointee who stopped criminal proceedings against the former president over his retention of top-secret documents at his private residence.</p>

<p>In addition to attempted assassination of a presidential candidate, the new charges also include possession of a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime and assault on a federal officer, who court documents indicated was a Secret Service agent.</p>

<p>Routh's gun was spotted poking out from the bushes by a Secret Service agent as he scouted ahead during Trump's golf game. The agent fired on the suspect, who fled but was later apprehended.</p>

<p>A federal judge ruled on Monday that Routh should remain in custody.</p>

<p>FBI analysis of Routh's phone showed he had been in Florida since August 18, and his devices were located multiple times between that date and September 15 near Trump's golf course and his Mar-a-Lago residence, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Before being spotted by the Secret Service agent, he had spent nearly 12 hours in the vicinity of the club, according to his phone location data, the prosecution has said.</p>

<p>It was the second attempted assassination attempt on Trump this summer. The first took place on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman opened fire, killing one person and wounding Trump in the ear.</p>

<p>The candidate was otherwise unharmed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms will not immediately join the European Union's AI Pact, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The pact is a temporary measure before the bloc's AI Act comes into full effect.</p>

<p>EU lawmakers in May agreed to the act, the first-of-a-kind rules governing the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The AI Act entails that companies will be obliged to provide detailed summaries of the data used to train their artificial intelligence models.</p>

<p>Last month, the European Commission said the majority of rules of the act will start applying on Aug. 2, 2026.</p>

<p>Until the law kicks in, companies are encouraged to sign up to a voluntary AI Pact to implement key obligations of the rules.</p>

<p>"We welcome harmonised EU rules and are focusing on our compliance work under the AI Act at this time," the Meta spokesperson said, adding that the Facebook parent could join the AI Pact at a later stage.</p>

<p>The AI Act is the fifth pillar of EU legislation and would work in conjunction with the Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, Data Governance Act, and Data Act.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden gave a somber farewell address to the United Nations on Tuesday, using his own decision to drop out of the US presidential election to warn of the dangers of autocrats around the globe refusing to quit.</p>

<p>"My fellow leaders, let us never forget, some things are more important than staying in power," Biden said to applause in his final speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old exhorted world leaders to stand up for democracy in the face of spiraling turmoil and conflict, urging support for Ukraine and pushing for peace in the Middle East.</p>

<p>But with six weeks until a vote that could bring the isolationist and election-denying Donald Trump back to the White House, Biden closed his speech by drawing lessons from his own life.</p>

<p>"This summer, I faced a decision whether to seek a second term as president. It was a difficult decision. Being president has been the honor of my life, there's so much more I want to get done," Biden said.</p>

<p>"As much as I love the job, I love my country more. I decided after 50 years of public service it's time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward," he added.</p>

<p>"It's your people that matter the most."</p>

<p>SWEEP OF HISTORY</p>

<p>Biden quit the White House race in July after a disastrous TV debate against Trump fueled concerns about his mental acuity, and he has endorsed his vice president Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Countries around the world are now nervously watching the knife-edge November 5 US election amid fears that a Trump victory would mark a return of his hardline foreign policy.</p>

<p>Biden's speech marked an attempt to burnish his own legacy, while effectively urging other world leaders to protect it from being reversed by the Republican if he wins.</p>

<p>He said he'd seen a "remarkable sweep of history" during five decades of public service and, as the world reels from a series of crises, "things can get better, we should never forget that."</p>

<p>Reflecting on the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 to end his country's two decades of involvement, Biden said he thought of the US troops killed by a bomb during the pull-out "every single day."</p>

<p>The US president, who often talks about his family's Irish roots, also returned to many familiar themes from his presidency, quoting the Irish poet W.B. Yeats's line about how the "center cannot hold" while insisting it can.</p>

<p>Biden even raised a laugh from the assembled world leaders when he joked that "I know that I look like I'm only 40."</p>

<p>For all the lofty themes, Biden's speech offered few details on how to solve the foreign policy issues that either Trump or Harris will have to deal with.</p>

<p>CRISIS AND UNCERTAINTY</p>

<p>He warned against a "full-scale war" in Lebanon without saying how to avoid it, after Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah that killed at least 558 people.</p>

<p>Biden's prized goal of a ceasefire in the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas meanwhile looks further off than ever.</p>

<p>On Ukraine Biden was firmer, saying&nbsp; that "Putin's war has failed" in Ukraine and warned that Kyiv's allies "cannot grow weary" in their support.</p>

<p>He is due to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- who was in the hall at the UN to watch Biden's speech -- at the White House for talks on Thursday.</p>

<p>During his speech Biden also pushed the importance of US alliances that he has tried to bolster after the Trump years -- during which the Republican repeatedly threw long-standing US ties into question.</p>

<p>Biden held a joint event on tackling the fentanyl trade with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and was due to give a speech on climate.</p>

<p>Biden's UN swan song comes amid a wider attempt to "Trump-proof" his legacy in his last four months in power.</p>

<p>He himself noted that he "came to the presidency at another moment of crisis and uncertainty," just days after pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to try to stop lawmakers certifying Biden's election victory.</p>

<p>Trump still falsely claims he won the 2020 US presidential election and has repeatedly refused to say he would accept the result if Harris wins this time.<br />

<p>PM Modi pointed out the Quad summit is being held at a time when the world is surrounded by tensions and conflicts. "At such a time, it is important for all of humanity that the members of the Quad move forward based on shared democratic values. We are not against anybody. All of us support rules-based international order, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful resolution of all disputes," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The dispute's resolution comes nearly two years after Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion and subsequently laid off more than half of the company’s workforce.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has lost a legal fight concerning unpaid severance to a former Twitter (now X) employee, who was laid off following the billionaire's acquisition of the platform in 2022. The case, resolved through arbitration, is a significant development for thousands of ex-employees with similar grievances.<br />
<br />
According to a memo obtained by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-23/ex-twitter-worker-wins-musk-layoff-pay-fight-memo-says ">Bloomberg</a>, the dispute's resolution comes nearly two years after Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion and subsequently laid off more than half of the company's workforce. Over 2,000 former employees filed complaints, alleging they had not received adequate severance pay.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“The arbitrator awarded the full severance package to our client,” said lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan in the memo. “We are excited about this development and hope it foreshadows more good news to come.” The lawyer did not comment further or share any details regarding the arbitrator's ruling because the proceedings were private.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This legal loss follows a separate case in July, where Elon Musk's company managed to defeat a lawsuit that alleged over $500 million in severance was owed to around 6,000 employees under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Lawyer Liss-Riordan revealed that 15 cases had gone through arbitration hearings, and she expects additional rulings in the coming months. “It is our hope that if more rulings come down our way, Twitter/X will be willing to come to the table and negotiate a settlement for everyone,” she added.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Elon Musk's X is facing another legal battle in Brazil, where the Supreme Court ordered the platform to <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musks-x-fined-900-000-a-day-for-restoring-services-in-brazil-despite-ban-6604765 ">suspend service or face a daily fine</a> of over $900,000. The company was banned last month, but access was restored briefly, which the Brazilian government called a deliberate violation of the court order. X defended the restoration as “inadvertent and temporary,” but the court was unconvinced.<br />
<br />
Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes slammed X for “unlawfully, persistently and intentionally” failing to comply with judicial orders. In response, the court imposed a daily fine and ordered the telecommunications agency Anatel to ensure the platform's suspension.<br />
<br />
X has since also <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musks-x-follows-brazils-top-court-order-names-legal-representative-6614915">appointed a new legal representative</a>, Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao, in compliance with local laws. The firm had lost its legal standing in Brazil in August when it closed its offices in the country, leading the court to enforce a suspension of its services.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Supreme Court justices and federal judges on lower courts do not have to publicly disclose when they dine or stay at someone's personal residence, even one owned by a business entity, under a revised ethics rule.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Supreme Court justices and federal judges on lower courts do not have to publicly disclose when they dine or stay at someone's personal residence, even one owned by a business entity, under a revised ethics rule.</p>

<p>The amended policy was issued on Monday by the US Judicial Conference's Committee on Financial Disclosure, which sets rules followed by the nine justices and other federal judges. Critics said the move diluted ethics requirements.</p>

<p>The committee has been reviewing allegations that Justice Clarence Thomas, a member of the court's 6-3 conservative majority, improperly failed to report gifts including luxury travel from wealthy Texas businessman and Republican donor Harlan Crow.</p>

<p>"They might as well call it the Clarence Thomas exemption," said Donald Sherman, chief counsel at the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), said of the amended policy.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court has been embroiled in mounting ethics controversies, with some Democratic lawmakers and court reform advocates pointing to instances of undisclosed trips and gifts involving Clarence Thomas and some other justices. The court last year announced its first formal code of conduct governing the ethical behavior of its justices, though the policy lacked any enforcement mechanism.</p>

<p>The judiciary's rule-making body said the disclosure regulations were updated this week to "clarify" the extent to which gifts received at personal residences owned by corporate entities could be deemed "personal hospitality" that judges did not need to list on their disclosure reports.</p>

<p>Gabe Roth, who heads the advocacy group Fix the Court, said the new policy watered down stricter regulations announced last year and "twisted" the meaning of personal hospitality in ways that could result in some of the past stays by Clarence Thomas at Harlan Crow's properties being deemed exempt from disclosure.</p>

<p>Those stays include ones at Camp Topridge, a private lakeside resort in upstate New York's Adirondack Mountains owned by an entity affiliated with Harlan Crow, Topridge Holdings, as first reported by ProPublica.</p>

<p>Clarence Thomas last year said that he had been advised he did not have to report that type of "personal hospitality."</p>

<p>Lawyers for Clarence Thomas and Harlan Crow and representatives for the Supreme Court did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The disclosure committee, at the urging of Democratic US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and others, in March 2023 adopted stricter regulations that made it harder for judges to claim a personal hospitality exception.</p>

<p>Those rules stated judges still did not have to disclose gifts that include food, lodging or entertainment extended by an individual for a non-business purpose. But the regulations said the exemption did not apply to stays at commercial properties, such as hotels and resorts, and gifts of hospitality paid for by an entity or third-party other than the person providing it.</p>

<p>Under Monday's rule change, stays at a host's personal residence would not need to be disclosed if an entity, rather than a person, owns the property, as long as the residence was not regularly rented out and was not a commercial property.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ali Berri never imagined it would take almost 14 hours to reach Beirut from his home in south Lebanon after he and his family decided to flee heavy Israeli air strikes.</p>

<p>It took "from 10:00 am until midnight -- the traffic was totally jammed", said Berri, 55, who fled with his wife, son and elderly neighbour from the Tyre area on Monday.</p>

<p>The trip would normally take a couple of hours at most.</p>

<p>"We hope that the war will ease so we can return to our homes because what me and my family went through yesterday is really war," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Hundreds of families woke up Tuesday morning in a hospitality training institute turned shelter in the Bir Hassan area of Beirut's southern suburbs after arduous journeys from the country's south the day before.</p>

<p>Israeli airstrikes began pounding south Lebanon on Monday morning, sending tens of thousands fleeing their homes, according to the United Nations, while Lebanese authorities said the death count had soared to 558, including 50 children.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer saw hundreds of vehicles crawling along the highway that links southern Lebanon with the capital Beirut. Many carried families with children and the elderly, along with whatever belongings they could take.</p>

<p>Berri, a farmer and garbage truck driver, expressed hope that "associations, the state and anyone else" would help.</p>

<p>"There is real suffering," he said, putting aside a bag of bread and canned food for the family.</p>

<p><strong>'A year of war'</strong></p>

<p>Some people "spent the night on the streets, like my sisters and my wife's sisters", he added.</p>

<p>It was not the first he and his family have fled their homes, but this time was different, he said.</p>

<p>"I was displaced for around 20 days" in 2006 when Israel and Hezbollah last went to war, he said, "but that war was short, while now it is long."</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been trading near daily fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war, but the violence has spiralled dramatically in the past week.</p>

<p>"We've had a year of war and we don't know now when it will end," Berri said.</p>

<p>The Bir Hassan institute is the largest of a number of educational facilities that have opened their doors in Beirut and its surroundings to receive the displaced.</p>

<p>AFP saw families spread across three floors of one of the institute's buildings, with people resting in some rooms, while one woman was busy cleaning dust off the ground.</p>

<p>Others sat near windows looking out over the building's courtyard, or in the corners of long dark corridors.</p>

<p>Many appeared exhausted and refused to speak to journalists.</p>

<p>"The bombing intensified on Monday... everyone was leaving," said Abbas Mohammed, a football coach from the southern village of Harouf, as his young daughter played nearby.</p>

<p><strong>Hopes to return</strong></p>

<p>"After they bombed a place nearby we decided to do the same thing and we had no choice except to get on the motorbike with my wife and daughter," he told AFP, adding that the trip took seven hours.</p>

<p>Dozens of meals and bottles of water began to arrive, with scouts and volunteers from the Amal movement, a Hezbollah ally, handing them out to families.</p>

<p>Rami Najem, an Amal media official who is also with the group's emergency committee, was watching as people registered the names and needs of the displaced.</p>

<p>"Around 6,000 people came to this centre between 6:00 pm last night and 6:00 am this morning," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The displaced, some of whom had simply gathered in the streets or squares, were being distributed across several centres and given mattresses, said Najem, adding that the needs were enormous.</p>

<p>He described "basic needs just so people can sit down and sleep -- like pillows, blankets, medicine, babies' milk, nappies, food and water".</p>

<p>Zeinab Diab, 32, from the Nabatiyeh area, said she fled with her husband and four children, the youngest of whom is under a year old, from the village of Ebba "for the children's sake".</p>

<p>"Almost all the village was damaged, we didn't know where the bombing was coming from. We feel as if they are more brutal this time," she said, referring to the Israeli military.</p>

<p>"I hope at this moment to return to my village even if my home is flattened. I'll live in a tent, it's better than being displaced," she said.</p>

<p>"When you leave your home, you feel as if you are leaving your soul."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 64-year-old US woman took her own life inside a controversial suicide capsule at a Swiss woodland retreat, with police on Tuesday saying several people had been arrested.</p>

<p>The space-age looking Sarco capsule, which fills with nitrogen and causes death by hypoxia, was used on Monday outside a village near the German border.</p>

<p>The portable human-sized pod, self-operated by a button inside, has raised a host of legal and ethical questions in Switzerland. Active euthanasia is banned in the country but assisted dying has been legal for decades.</p>

<p>On the same day it was used, Switzerland's Interior Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider told lawmakers that the Sarco was "not legal".</p>

<p>Police in the northern Schaffhausen canton said several people had been taken into custody and face criminal proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>'Peaceful, fast, dignified'</strong></p>

<p>The Last Resort, an assisted dying organisation, presented the Sarco pod in Zurich in July, saying they expected it to be used for the first time within months, and saw no legal obstacle to its use in Switzerland.</p>

<p>In a statement to AFP, The Last Resort said the person who died, who was not named, was a 64-year-old woman from the midwestern United States.</p>

<p>She "had been suffering for many years from a number of serious problems associated with severe immune compromise", the statement said.</p>

<p>The death took place "under a canopy of trees, at a private forest retreat".</p>

<p>The association's co-president Florian Willet was the only other person present, and described the woman's death as "peaceful, fast and dignified", according to the statement.</p>

<p><strong>Warning given</strong></p>

<p>The cantonal public prosecutor's office "has opened criminal proceedings against several people for inducement and aiding and abetting suicide... and several people have been placed in police custody," a police statement said.</p>

<p>The public prosecutor's office had been informed by a law firm on Monday that an assisted suicide had taken place at a forest hut in Merishausen.</p>

<p>The police, the forensic emergency service and the public prosecutor's office "went to the crime scene".</p>

<p>The Sarco suicide capsule was secured and the dead body was taken away for an autopsy.</p>

<p>"We found the capsule with the lifeless person inside," said Schaffhausen's public prosecutor Peter Sticher.</p>

<p>He told Blick newspaper that several people were arrested "so that they were not colluding with each other or covering up evidence".</p>

<p>Sticher said the operators knew the risks of being arrested.</p>

<p>"We warned them in writing. We said that if they came to Schaffhausen and used Sarco, they would face criminal consequences," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Sarco: 3D-printable capsule</strong></p>

<p>The Sarco was invented by Philip Nitschke, a leading global figure in right-to-die activism.</p>

<p>The 3D-printable capsule cost more than 650,000 euros ($725,000) to research and develop in the Netherlands over 12 years. Future Sarcos could cost around 15,000 euros. The pods are reusable.</p>

<p>In a statement, Nitschke said he was "pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed to do: that is to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person's choosing".</p>

<p>To use the Sarco, the person wishing to die must first pass a psychiatric assessment.</p>

<p>The person climbs into the purple capsule, closes the lid, and is asked automated questions such as who they are, where they are and if they know what happens when they press the button.</p>

<p>In July, Nitschke explained that once the button is pressed, the amount of oxygen in the air plummets from 21 percent to 0.05 percent in less than 30 seconds.</p>

<p>The person inside quickly loses consciousness before dying within around five minutes.</p>

<p>Nitschke's Exit International organisation, which owns the Sarco, is a non-profit group funded by donations. The only cost for the user is 18 Swiss francs ($21) for the nitrogen.</p>

<p><strong>Suicide law</strong></p>

<p>In July, Willet said Switzerland was "by far the best place" for the Sarco to be used, due to its "wonderful liberal system".</p>

<p>Swiss law generally allows assisted suicide if the person commits the lethal act themselves.</p>

<p>But interior minister Baume-Schneider, taking questions in parliament on Monday, said: "The Sarco suicide capsule is not legally compliant."</p>

<p>"Firstly, it does not meet the requirements of product safety law and therefore cannot be placed on the market. Secondly, the corresponding use of nitrogen is not compatible with the purpose article of the Chemicals Act," she said.</p>

<p>Fiona Stewart, who is on The Last Resort's advisory board, said the group was acting on legal advice, which "since 2021 has consistently found that the use of Sarco in Switzerland would be lawful".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The apparently pristine Gerardmer lake in the Vosges mountains of eastern France conceals a bleak legacy of 20th-century conflict -- dozens of tonnes of unexploded ordnance from the two world wars.</p>

<p>The lake 660 metres (2,170 feet) above sea level is a popular summer bathing spot and is sometimes also tapped for drinking water for the picturesque local town.</p>

<p>Gerardmer's mayor Stessy Speissmann-Mozas started asking questions about the water safety after the Odysseus 3.1 environmental group said samples taken from the lake showed high levels of TNT explosive, as well as metals like iron, titanium and lead.</p>

<p>The group said it found artillery shells in the mud at the bottom of the lake. Some were "gutted, allowing the explosive they contained to escape", Odysseus 3.1's founder Lionel Rard said in a documentary broadcast by the France 5 channel in May.</p>

<p>Samples sent to a German lab showed TNT levels among "the highest ever measured by that team", as well as metal concentrations above legal limits.</p>

<p><strong>'Stick all this in the lake'</strong></p>

<p>The mayor has said the government should pay for a more detailled study of the risks from the munitions that were initially dumped in Gerardmer by the French army. As a theatre of multiple conflicts over the past century and more, France is particularly afflicted by unexploded ordnance.</p>

<p>Most dates back to the world wars but shells are still found from the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, noted Charlotte Nihart of Robin des Bois (Robin Hood), an association that has charted unexploded bombs across France.</p>

<p>Unexploded ordnance is involved in around 10 deaths nationwide every year.</p>

<p>During the wars, retreating armies would dump munitions in lakes to stop enemy forces getting them, Nihart said.</p>

<p>In Gerardmer, disposal drives started in 1977 after a man was burned by a phosphorous shell. They continued through to 1994, removing explosives up to 10 metres below the lake surface.</p>

<p>"They took out 120 tonnes of munitions, made up of almost 100,000 individual pieces of different types from 1914-18 and 1939-45," said Pierre Imbert, an assistant to the mayor and former local fire chief and diver.</p>

<p>Disposal teams brought each explosive to the surface, where they could remove the detonator.</p>

<p>"Then they went and blew it up at the end of the lake," Imbert recalled.</p>

<p>Photos he has kept from the disposal campaigns show everything from "handmade grenades from World War I, more recent things from World War II, and even a little axe".</p>

<p>Officials called a halt to the ordnance disposal due to the difficulty of working further from the shore and deeper under the mud of the lake bed, the regional authority told Robin des Bois.</p>

<p>The region estimated that around 70 tonnes remain at the bottom of Gerardmer.</p>

<p>"There's no way of evaluating the quantity of munitions still sunk in the mud" up to 30 metres below the surface, Imbert said.</p>

<p><strong>'Decontaminate everything'</strong></p>

<p>Since 1945, some of the munitions have moved around in the lake currents.</p>

<p>The state should "decontaminate everything around the edge" of the lake, said Aurelie Mathieu, head of the Vosges region's AKM eco-tourism association.</p>

<p>But the regional authority is refusing to act on the sole basis of the Odysseus 3.1 analysis.</p>

<p>"Neither the ARS (regional health agency) nor Anses (national health and safety agency) were involved in this investigation and we have no details of the methods used to collect and analyse samples," it told AFP.</p>

<p>Samples were taken by state agencies in February and analysed by "several French and German labs", it added.</p>

<p>"Initial results confirmed the conclusions of previous campaigns -- no concerning levels were detected" in the lake water, the regional authority said.</p>

<p>"No health risk has been identified" either for drinking the water or for swimming in it, it added.</p>

<p>One company has put in a bid to map the ordnance still lying at the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>It would cost "almost 300,000 euros ($334,000)", mayor Speissman-Mozas said.</p>

<p>He is interested in the offer, as long as the national government pays.</p>

<p>"It's the French army who put all these munitions here," he reasoned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Israel faces a critical juncture in its history with its war on two fronts - with Hamas and Hezbollah - the country's envoy to India has said all its actions are driven by the objective of rooting out radicalism.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Israel faces a critical juncture in its history with its war on two fronts - with Hamas and Hezbollah - the country's envoy to India has said it has been attacked more than any other nation in modern times and all its actions are driven by the objective of rooting out radicalism and establishing peace and stability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging, exclusive interview with NDTV on Tuesday, Israeli Ambassador Reuven Azar was also asked about the pager and walkie-talkie explosions in Lebanon, for which Israel is being blamed. He answered that war has a hybrid nature now and, given the attacks on it, Israel has to be in a situation where it not only has to defend itself, but also be able to "surprise its enemy".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Azar also spoke about the support Israel has received from the US and India, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York on Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Attacked Like No Other'</strong></p>

<p>To a question on the pager and handheld radio explosions across Lebanon last week, in which at least 37 people were killed and thousands injured and a Mossad hand has been suspected, the ambassador said, "In the past, there used to be either wars against conventional armies or fights against terrorism, but I think that, today, war has a hybrid nature. We have seen it in Israel because we have been attacked like no other country in the history of modern times. We have been attacked not only with rockets and missiles but there have also been cyberattacks; we have been attacked from the air, from the sea, from the land, from tunnels..."</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, you have to create a situation in which you can not only defend yourself but also be able to surprise your enemy. I won't go into details of what Israel is doing or not doing, but the bottom line is that if we want to achieve stability, we have to show these terrorists that are using uncoventional and unethical and immoral ways of fighting, that we can also surprise them," he warned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Civilian Casualties?</strong></p>

<p>Israel has announced that it has shifted its focus to the northern front with Lebanon and its overnight strikes on the south of the country killed over 550 people, including 50 children. Israel also struck over 1,500 suspected Hezbollah sites around the country as part of what it called "Operation Northern Arrows".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement that Lebanese people should not become "human shields" for Hezbollah and the high civilian casualties in Gaza and Lebanon, Mr Azar said most of the 1,700 military targets that Israel targeted in southern Lebanon in the past 48 hours were "embedded" in the homes of civilians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What Hezbollah has done in the past few years is a double war crime. They have been embedding their missiles inside the homes of people to conceal them from Israel and they have been firing indiscriminately at civilians in northern Israel from these installations. So what Israel had to do is meticulously gather intelligence about these locations over a few years and, fortunately we have been able to target and destroy thousands of missiles that were in those areas," he said.</p>

<p>The ambassador claimed that some of the families that were living there did not evacuate on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(This was) despite the fact that we called them over the phone, we intercepted radio communications... we tried every way possible to take them out of harm's way. Despite that, &nbsp;yes, there were some civilians that were killed as well. But when you look at the magnitude of this - 1,700 military targets in 48 hours - you will see that, actually, this has been very successful; because at the end of the day, when you compare the damage that would be caused from these missiles to Israeli civilians to the price that the people have to pay, it's a relatively low price," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Azar said every loss of life is tragic and claimed that Israel does whatever is possible to take civilians out of harm's way. "Fortunately, today, thousands and tens of thousands of civilians from South Lebanon have been evacuated, and that's a very important thing. We will continue to put pressure on Hezbollah," he asserted.</p>

<p><strong>'War Can Be Stopped Right Now'</strong></p>

<p>The ambassador said Israel is not interested in war and claimed that the country has been trying to - along with the US - find a diplomatic solution despite Hezbollah firing 8,300 rockets "in an unprovoked way" at Israel in the last 11 months. He said that if Hezbollah respects an earlier UN resolution and moves away from the border, there will be a ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our civilians will be able to go back to their homes and we can stop the war now. But if Hezbollah continues to be stubborn and continues to fire at Israel and continues to refuse to implement the UN Security Council resolution, this war will continue," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On protests in Israel over 700 Israeli defence personnel having lost their lives, Mr Azar insisted that there is "wall-to-wall" consensus in his country that it has to deal with "security threats" in the Gaza Strip and the north of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Israel has to go back to a normal life and we cannot do that when we have a threat of imminent attack by terrorists. Now, of course, this has a cost. And yes, there are people that are not satisfied, especially the families that have hostages still in the Gaza Strip. So we will have to deal with the dilemma and we will have to solve the situation because we cannot surrender to Hamas and we are trying to get into a deal that is actually sponsored by the United States and by the Security Council. But, as the spokesperson of the White House has said, Hamas is refusing this deal and therefore we will have to be persistent... we have to create a situation in which these terrorist organisations will no longer attack Israel in the future," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'India Has Suffered Too'</strong></p>

<p>Mr Azar said that the fact that India abstained from a UN General Assembly Resolution demanding that Israel bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory shows that the country supports a realistic solution.</p>

<p>To a question on whether India can play a peacemaker, the ambassador said, "We appreciate very much the support of India since October 7 (the day of the Hamas attacks last year) and the fact that India condemned the attacks and supported the right for self-defence. I think that the voting of India in the General Assembly is testament that they are following a path of supporting a realistic solution and not something that is completely detached from reality," he said.</p>

<p>"If we want to see a situation in which the Palestinians rule themselves - this is something that Israel wants to see as well, not just India - we will have to work together to defeat the terrorists and also encourage the more pragmatic and moderate forces within Palestinian society. We will have to fight radicalism in West Asia because this is actually the source of the instability we are seeing around us. And India knows that very well because you have been suffering from that kind of radicalism around you," he added.</p>

<p>On PM Modi's meeting with Palestinian President Abbas in which he expressed concern over the situation in Gaza and called for an end to hostilities, the ambassador said, "We also want to see an end to the hostilities. We are a peace-loving country. We are a democracy. We thrive because we maintain periods of stability. And we need the help of our friends in order to restore that stabilty. And it's going to be up to India to decide to what extent it wants to be involved."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said that Israel and other "pragmatic countries" can be a corridor between India and Europe once peace prevails.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Broad Support&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The ambassador said there is broad support for Israel in the US and Vice President Kamala Harris has not said she will limit assistance to the country if she is elected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Actually, 80% of American people support Israel and its right to defend itself. And this happens both on the Republican and Democratic sides. We enjoy overwhelming support in Congress, and we saw that when Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the United States and gave his fourth speech in Congress - the foreign leader who gave the most number of speeches before both houses of Congress. So I think that our situation in the United States is solid, and I am confident that we'll find a way to cooperate with any American administration that will be elected in &nbsp;November," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

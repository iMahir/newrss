       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will be on a visit to the United States from September 21 to September 23 has a packed schedule. From the Quad Summit and UN General Assembly session, to holding multiple bilateral and courtesy meetings. He is also scheduled to meet top CEOs and business leaders and will also address the Indian community at a diaspora event in New York.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Prime Minister's visit, former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he will be meeting PM Modi during his visit. The US goes to polls on November 5 and Mr Trump is currently campaigning across the United States.</p>

<p>Though Mr Trump has claimed that there will be a meeting between the two leaders, the Ministry of External Affairs today did not announce it as part of the Prime Minister's itinerary.</p>

<p>When asked if PM Modi and Donald Trump will meet, the foreign ministry spokesperson said, "Many meetings are being fixed and the process is ongoing. At this moment we can't confirm any specific meet. We are looking at it from various angles. If and When meetings are fixed and confirmed with any leader, we will update you all."</p>

<p>While campaigning in Michigan on Tuesday, Donald Trump said he would meet PM Modi during his visit to the United States at the end of this week. He described Prime Minister Modi as "A fantastic man".</p>

<p>"He (PM Modi) happens to be coming to meet me next week, and (Prime Minister) Modi, he's fantastic. I mean, fantastic man. A lot of these leaders are fantastic," Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>Speaking about Indians, Mr Trump said, "These people are the sharpest people," but India imposes heavy tariffs on imports, "they are a very big abuser of tariffs."</p>

<p>"They're not a little bit backwards...You know the expression, they're at the top of their game, and they use it against us. India is very tough. Brazil is very tough, China is the toughest of all, but we were taking care of China with the tariffs," he said.</p>

<p>The United States is going to polls on November 5 and postal voting has begun in several states. Donald Trump, who is the Republican candidate and is seeking a second term in the White House, is up against Democrat candidate Kamala Harris, who is seeking her first term as President. Ms Harris is the current Vice President of the United States.</p>

<p>The most recent electoral polls suggest that Kamala Harris, who is of Indian heritage, is leading Donald Trump.</p>

<p>A new poll released today shows Kamala Harris with significant leads over Donald Trump in swing-states Pennsylvania and Michigan, two "blue wall" battlegrounds seen as key to winning the White House in November.</p>

<p>In the most latest poll of likely voters, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump 51 per cent to 45 per cent in Pennsylvania, and tops him 50-45 per cent in Michigan, two states in the post-industrial Rust Belt in the American Midwest and Northeast.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Greece has witnessed a remarkable 37 per cent surge in property purchases by Indian investors between July and August.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece has witnessed a remarkable 37 per cent surge in property purchases by Indian investors between July and August. This flurry of activity is driven by Indian buyers eager to secure permanent residency under Greece's Golden Visa Programme before significant regulatory changes took effect on September 1.</p>

<p>Launched in 2013, Greece's Golden Visa programme offers residency permits in exchange for property investments, making it an attractive option for non-EU citizens. Its initial €250,000 (Rs 2.2 crore) threshold was one of Europe's lowest, drawing significant investment and boosting Greece's real estate market.</p>

<p>However, the surge in demand pushed up property prices, particularly in high-demand areas like Athens, Thessaloniki, Mykonos and Santorini. To address this, the Greek government raised the investment threshold to €800,000 (approx Rs 7 crore) for properties in these regions, effective September 1 2024.</p>

<p>Sanjay Sachdev, Global Marketing Director of Leptos Estates, noted an "unprecedented rush" of Indian homebuyers in recent months. "Many investors purchased under-construction projects with handover periods of six-twelve months," said Sanjay Sachdev, as per <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/wealthy-indians-investing-in-uae-european-realty-for-lifestyle-returns-12398091.html">MoneyControl</a>.</p>

<p>Many invested in properties under construction, with completion timelines of six to twelve months. Leptos Estates reported selling out its available residential stock in Greece due to this surge.<br />
<br />
<strong>Effective September 2024, the revised Golden Visa programme seeks to:</strong><br />
<br />
- Temper rapid price increases<br />
<br />
- Promote equitable development<br />
<br />
- Direct investment towards less saturated areas<br />
<br />
<strong>The appeal of Greece's Golden Visa Programme for Indian investors</strong></p>

<p>- Greece offers attractive rental yields of 3-5 per cent annually, making property investments financially rewarding.</p>

<p>- Property values in Greece have been increasing at an impressive rate of 10 per cent year-on-year, with significant growth following the pandemic.</p>

<p>- Investors gain access to high-quality healthcare, education, and the opportunity to establish businesses within the EU.</p>

<p>Before the rule changes, Indian investors gravitated towards popular Greek islands like Paros, Crete, and Santorini for property purchases.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US court's summons to the Indian government over Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun's civil suit, alleging a plot to murder him, was "completely unwarranted", the Ministry of External Affairs has said. In a news briefing this afternoon, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri was asked about the summons by the US District Court for Southern District of New York.</p>

<p>The summons names Government of India, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, R&amp;AW agent Vikram Yadav, and Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta and seeks a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>"When these issues were first brought to our attention, we took action. There's a high-level committee engaged (in this matter)," the Foreign Secretary said.&nbsp;He said this was a "completely unwarranted case". "I invite your attention to the person who filed this," Mr Misri said, adding that&nbsp;Pannun's "antecedent is well-known" and that he is from an unlawful organisation. Pannun heads the radical Sikhs for Justice and is known to put out incendiary speeches and threats against Indian leaders and institutions. New Delhi designated him a terrorist in 2020.</p>

<p>In November, the UK newspaper Financial Times reported that the US had thwarted a plot to kill Pannun, who holds dual citizenship in the US and Canada. Officials in the Joe Biden administration later confirmed this.</p>

<p>In its first response, the External Affairs Ministry said it is a "matter of concern" and stressed that India has launched a high-level probe.</p>

<p>"As regards the case against an individual that has been filed in a US court, allegedly linking him to an Indian official, this is a matter of concern. We have said that this is also contrary to government policy," then MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.</p>

<p>In May this year, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said India is investigating the matter, but stressed that it would not impact the "upward trajectory" of India-US ties.</p>

<p>"The United States brought to our attention certain information in good faith because we also believe some of it has implications for our own system," he said in an interview to news agency PTI.</p>

<p>"We are investigating it. But I do not think the fundamental course of the upward trajectory of India-US is impacted by this at all," he said.</p>

<p>US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti has told NDTV that this matter will not affect India-US ties.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The study showed that coupled with air pollution, high temperatures as well as metabolic disorders, fuelled a significant rise in global cases and deaths due to stroke in the last three decades.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, a study on Thursday showed that ambient particulate matter air pollution is a top risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage -- a type of brain stroke -- at par with smoking. The study, led by an international team of researchers from India, the US, New Zealand, Brazil, and UAE showed that air pollution contributed to 14 per cent of the death and disability caused by this serious stroke subtype.</p>

<p>The study showed that coupled with air pollution, high temperatures as well as metabolic disorders, fuelled a significant rise in global cases and deaths due to stroke in the last three decades.</p>

<p>The number of people worldwide having a new stroke rose to 11.9 million in 2021 -- up by 70 per cent since 1990. Stroke-related deaths rose to 7.3 million -- up by 44 per cent since 1990.</p>

<p>The study identified 23 modifiable risk factors responsible for 84 per cent of the stroke burden in 2021.</p>

<p>In 2021, the five leading global risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood pressure, particulate matter air pollution, smoking, high LDL cholesterol, and household air pollution, with considerable variation by age, sex, and location.</p>

<p>It also showed substantial progress made in reducing the global stroke burden by reducing particulate matter air pollution (20 per cent), and smoking (13 per cent).</p>

<p>"With 84 per cent of the stroke burden linked to 23 modifiable risk factors there are tremendous opportunities to alter the trajectory of stroke risk for the next generation. Given that ambient air pollution is reciprocally linked with ambient temperature and climate change, the importance of urgent climate actions and measures to reduce air pollution cannot be overestimated," said co-author Dr Catherine O. Johnson, Lead Research Scientist at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).</p>

<p>While stroke is now the third leading cause of death worldwide (after ischaemic heart disease and Covid-19), the condition is highly preventable and treatable.</p>

<p>The researchers called for identifying sustainable ways to work with communities to take action to prevent and control modifiable risk factors such as high blood sugar and a diet high in sugar-sweetened drinks. There is a critical need for interventions focused on obesity and metabolic syndromes, Johnson said.</p>

<p>They also called for measures such as clean air zones and public smoking bans, which have been successful.</p>

<p>The findings based on the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) showed that more than three-quarters of those affected by strokes live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>

<p>The study also found that worldwide, the overall amount of disability, illness, and early death -- a measurement known as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) -- lost to stroke increased by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2021, rising from around 121.4 million years of healthy life lost in 1990 to 160.5 million years in 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTuber MrBeast has been named in a lawsuit claiming participants in his $5 million jackpot game show were exploited. Contestants say they were subjected to unfair treatment and sexual harassment while participating in what has been billed as the world's biggest live game show. Papers filed in a Los Angeles court on Monday allege contestants were not paid proper wages, and were not given meal breaks or appropriate rest.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs are identified only as contestants 1-5 in the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit filed against Amazon Alternative LLC and Jimmy Donaldson's (MrBeast's) production company, MRB2024 LLC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The suit seeks payment of all wages owed, an injunction forbidding the labor actions alleged and certification of the suit as a class-action complaint.</p>

<p>"Defendant production companies and Amazon shamelessly exploited the labor of... people who served as contestants on the forthcoming $100 million MrBeast-Amazon production 'Beast Games,' which Amazon promotes as the world's largest live game show with the biggest single prize in the history of television," the suit states. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The entertainment value of the show "arises directly from the physical and emotional labor of the contestants who compete under pressure-cooker conditions for life-changing prize money, with one person purportedly to win $5 million in the end," the suit alleges.</p>

<p>There was no immediate response from MrBeast to an AFP inquiry. Amazon declined to comment.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/mrbeast-and-his-co-host-ava-kris-tyson-break-silence-on-grooming-allegations-6184652">MrBeast</a> is one of the most successful YouTubers of all time, with more than 300 million subscribers.</p>

<p>His output includes contests and challenges with sometimes high-value prizes for participants.</p>

<p>As well as an extensive online presence, he has also founded philanthropic ventures.</p>

<p>In 2023, Time magazine named him one of the world's most influential people. In the same year, Forbes put his net worth at around half a billion dollars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While the motivation of the assailant remained unclear, Japanese officials have urged increased security around Japanese schools in China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's prime minister demanded an explanation from Beijing on Thursday about the fatal stabbing of a Japanese schoolboy in Shenzhen and urged China to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens. Beijing responded by expressing condolences for the killing, calling it an isolated incident that "could happen in any country". While the motivation of the assailant remained unclear, Japanese officials have urged increased security around Japanese schools in China.</p>

<p>"For now, we will strongly urge China to provide an explanation about the facts of what happened. Since it's been more than a day since the incident happened, we expect them to offer an explanation as soon as possible," Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, calling the attack "extremely despicable".</p>

<p>"A case like this must not be repeated. We will strongly call on China to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens and prevent a recurrence, while at the same time, doing everything doable in our capacity as the government," Kishida told reporters.</p>

<p>Police in Shenzhen said a man had attacked a minor on Wednesday morning and the child was rushed to hospital. The suspect, a 44-year-old man, was seized, they said.</p>

<p>Japanese media reported that the boy was a 10-year-old Japanese national living in the southern Chinese city, and was attacked near a Japanese school.</p>

<p>Beijing on Thursday expressed "regret and sadness" over the "unfortunate incident".</p>

<p>"We mourn the passing of the boy and express our condolences to his family," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular press conference.</p>

<p>Asked if the incident was isolated, Lin said that according to "the current understanding of the situation, this is an individual case".</p>

<p>"Similar cases could happen in any country," he told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Late Wednesday, before the boy died, Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Masataka Okano summoned Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao to convey "serious concerns" over the attack.</p>

<p>Okano "strongly urged that security be strengthened, including around Japanese schools throughout China", Japan's foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>In June, a Japanese mother and child were injured in another knife attack in Suzhou near Shanghai, which China's foreign ministry described at the time as an "isolated incident".</p>

<p>A 55-year-old Chinese woman died attempting to stop the assailant and was honoured for her actions by the local government after her death.</p>

<p>It remained unclear if the latest incident was politically motivated.</p>

<p>It happened on the anniversary of the "Mukden incident" or "Manchurian incident" in 1931 in the lead-up to World War II.</p>

<p>An explosion on a railway was used by Japanese soldiers as a pretext to occupy the city of Mukden, now called Shenyang, and invade the wider region.</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry also did not comment when asked at a regular briefing about the significance of the date, which state media said was marked on Wednesday with air raid sirens in multiple cities.</p>

<p>Relations have worsened in recent years as China takes a more assertive stance in territorial disputes in the region, and as Japan boosts security ties with the United States and its allies.</p>

<p>China last year banned Japanese seafood imports after Japan began releasing into the Pacific treated waste water from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant.</p>

<p>After the release began, bricks and eggs were thrown at Japanese schools and consulates. Businesses in Japan were also inundated with nuisance calls from Chinese numbers.</p>

<p>A Chinese aircraft carrier this week sailed between two Japanese islands near Taiwan, the first such intrusion into Japanese contiguous waters, a zone within 24 nautical miles of its coast.</p>

<p>Government spokesman Hiroshi Moriya called the incident "totally unacceptable from the perspective of the security environment of Japan and the region".</p>

<p>"We have expressed our serious concerns to the Chinese side through diplomatic channels," he said.</p>

<p>China said the passage, which came less than a month after the first confirmed incursion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese surveillance aircraft, complied with international law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The black hole resides at the heart of a galaxy about 7.5 billion light-years from Earth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two mighty beams of energy have been detected shooting in opposite directions from a supermassive black hole inside a distant galaxy - the largest such jets ever spotted, extending about 140 times the diameter of our vast Milky Way galaxy. The black hole resides at the heart of a galaxy about 7.5 billion light-years from Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). Because of the time it takes for light to travel, looking across great distances is peering back in time, with these observations dating to when the universe was less than half its current age.</p>

<p>Black holes are extraordinarily dense objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape. Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have a large black hole at their core. Some of these shoot jets of high-energy particles and magnetic fields into space from their two poles as they devour material such as gas, dust and stars falling into them due to their immense gravitational strength.</p>

<p>The two jet structures documented in the new study - using the LOFAR (Low-Frequency Array) radio telescope, a network of antennas centered in the Netherlands - extend 23 million light-years from end to end.</p>

<p>These super-heated jets, caused by the violent events around the black hole, are comprised of subatomic particles called electrons and positrons, and magnetic fields, moving at nearly the speed of light.</p>

<p>The researchers have nicknamed these two jets Porphyrion (pronounced poor-FEER-ee-ahn), named after a giant from ancient Greek mythology. Porphyrion is about 30% longer than the previous record-holder for such jets.</p>

<p>"Jet systems like Porphyrion appear to be among the most energetic spectacles that have occurred in the universe since the Big Bang," said Caltech astrophysicist Martijn Oei, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, referring to the event that initiated the universe about 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

<p>"The general understanding is that jets are formed when magnetized material falls onto a rotating black hole," added astrophysicist and study co-author Martin Hardcastle of the University of Hertfordshire in England. "They need to be sustained by a continued infall of matter into the black hole, something of the order of one solar mass (the mass of the sun) a year of material."</p>

<p>Such jets, not visible to the naked eye, start out small and grow over time.</p>

<p>"We've known for a while that black holes can generate these jets. But what is interesting is that to generate a large structure like this, the jets must stay on for a long time - about a billion years," Hardcastle said.</p>

<p>The Porphyrion jets reach far beyond their home galaxy, with an energetic output equivalent to trillions of stars like the sun.</p>

<p>"That is equivalent to the energy released during the most cataclysmic cosmic collisions: for example, those that occur when two galaxy clusters, each sometimes containing thousands of galaxies, merge together," Oei said.</p>

<p>"The fact that it extends so far from its parent black hole means that it may be carrying energy, particles and magnetic fields into the voids in the cosmic web, the gaps between groups and filaments of galaxies which we know make up the large-scale structure of the universe. This may help us to understand the ubiquitous magnetic fields in the present-day universe," Hardcastle said.</p>

<p>Such jets could heat up gas in interstellar space, shutting down the formation of new stars that requires cold clouds of gas, and could damage habitable planets, the researchers said.</p>

<p>The Milky Way's supermassive black hole, in its current quiescent state, does not have such jets.</p>

<p>"The key finding is that jets from black holes can, if circumstances are right, become as large as the universe's major cosmic structures - galaxy clusters, cosmic filaments, cosmic voids," Oei said. "This means that individual black holes can have a sphere of influence that extends way beyond the galaxy in which they reside."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli security services said on Thursday they had arrested an Israeli citizen on suspicion of involvement in an Iranian-backed assassination plot targeting prominent people including the prime minister.</p>

<p>It said the person was a businessman with connections in Turkey who had attended at least two meetings in Iran to discuss the possibility of assassinating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant or the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency.</p>

<p>The arrest took place last month, according to a joint statement by Shin Bet and the Israeli police that highlighted the intelligence war running alongside the escalating conflict on Israel's border with southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Last week, Shin Bet uncovered what it said was a plot by the Lebanese group Hezbollah to assassinate a former senior defence official, who was subsequently identified as the former army Chief of Staff and Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon.</p>

<p>The announcement of the arrest came a day after Hezbollah was hit for a second day running by a sophisticated attack that detonated communications equipment remotely, killing at least 20 people and wounding more than 450.</p>

<p>Israel has not commented directly on the attack but multiple security sources have said it was undertaken by Israel's spy agency Mossad.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The upcoming Quad Summit in Delaware will show that the four-nation grouping is more strategically aligned and relevant than ever before, the White House has said.</p>

<p>QUAD, comprising Australia, Japan, India and the US, is an initiative of President Joe Biden. In the first 100 days of his presidency, Biden convened a virtual leadership summit of the QUAD countries in 2020.</p>

<p>Since then QUAD leaders have been holding an annual summit on a rotation basis.</p>

<p>"We believe you'll see... that the Quad is more strategically aligned and more relevant than ever before," John Kirby, White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Director told reporters at a news conference here on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Kriby's comments came ahead of President Biden's hosting of the other three QUAD leaders from Australia, India, and Japan in Wilmington, Delaware on Saturday.</p>

<p>It was India's turn to host the Quad Summit. But following a request from Washington, India agreed to host the Summit next year.</p>

<p>Biden will host the fourth ‘Quad Leaders Summit' in Wilmington, Delaware, on September 21.</p>

<p>Kirby said the current Quad Summit will be the first time that the US has hosted foreign leaders in Wilmington, the president's hometown.</p>

<p>"And he's very excited about that, about showing them a place and a community that shapes so much of the public servant and the leader that he became. It's also a reflection of his belief that like politics, foreign policy is also personal," he said.</p>

<p>Kirby said Biden will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese individually, and later in a plenary.</p>

<p>Kirby said over the last more than three years, Biden has made it a priority to invest in rebuilding America's network of alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>"So think about AUKUS, for instance, or the trilateral Camp David summit with Japan and South Korea or the first ever US-Japan-Philippines Leaders' Summit in April," he said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi will pay a three-day visit to the US beginning September 21 to attend the annual Quad Summit and address the ‘Summit of the Future' at the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>He will also address a gathering of the Indian community in New York on September 22 during his three-day visit.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since Hezbollah has reduced the use of mobile phones by its forces because Israel can easily detect and target them, pagers have increasingly become the preferred messaging device within the group.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The alleged Israeli attack on members of Hezbollah via their pagers is another ominous development propelling the Middle East towards a full-scale regional war. It leaves Hezbollah with little option but to retaliate with the full support of the Iran-led “axis of resistance”. The sophistication and impact of targeting the pagers is unprecedented. The attack resulted in at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html">11 deaths</a>, including some of Hezbollah's fighters, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/hundreds-of-hezbollah-members-hurt-in-lebanon-after-pagers-explode">up to 3,000 people</a> wounded.</p>

<p>The main aim of the attack, which US officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-pagers-explosives.html">have reportedly said</a> was carried out by Israel, was intended to disrupt Hezbollah's means of communication and its command and control system in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Since Hezbollah has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/">reduced the use of mobile phones</a> by its forces because Israel can easily detect and target them, pagers have increasingly become the preferred messaging device within the group.</p>

<p>The attack may have also been designed to cause panic within the group and among the Lebanese public, many of whom <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/support-hezbollah-growing-lebanon">do not support Hezbollah</a>, given the political divisions in the country.</p>

<p>Since Hamas' October 7 attacks on southern Israel, the Israeli leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said it is <a href="https://www.afr.com/world/middle-east/israel-approves-battle-plans-for-hezbollah-edging-closer-to-war-20240619-p5jn3v">determined</a> to remove the threat of Hezbollah, which has operated in solidarity with Hamas.</p>

<p>Hours before the pager attack, Netanyahu's government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/israel-war-goals-netanyahu-hamas-gaza-palestine">clarified</a> that Israel's war goals would expand to include a return of the tens of thousands of residents to their homes in northern Israel, which they have fled due to constant rocket fire from Hezbollah. Israel's defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said the only way to do this was through military action.</p>

<p>The simultaneous pager explosions on Tuesday, then, may be a prelude to an all-out Israeli offensive against Hezbollah.</p>

<h2><strong>The consequences of war with Hezbollah</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah has already declared it will retaliate. What form this will take remains to be seen. The group has a massive military capability to not only pound northern Israel with drones and missiles but also attack other parts of the Jewish state, including heavily populated cities such as Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Hezbollah showed this capability in its 2006 war with Israel. The war lasted 34 days, during which <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-to-air-new-footage-on-raid-that-sparked-2006-lebanon-war/">165 Israelis were killed</a> (121 IDF soldiers and 44 civilians) and Israel's economy and tourist industry were markedly damaged. Hezbollah and Lebanese losses were far greater, with at least 1,100 deaths. However, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/opinion/15iht-edsaikal.2491556.html">failed to destroy or incapacitate</a> the group.</p>

<p>Any successful retaliatory attack on Israel's cities could result in serious civilian casualties, giving Israel a further pretext to pursue its long-held aim of destroying Hezbollah and punishing its main backer, the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

<p>In a wider conflict, the United States is committed to defending Israel, while Iran would support Hezbollah in whatever way necessary. If Israeli and US leaders think Iran will continue to refrain from any action that could propel it into war with Israel and the US, they are mistaken.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is a central piece in the regime's national and regional security paradigm. Tehran has invested heavily in the group, along with other regional affiliates – Iraqi militias, the Yemeni Houthis and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, in particular. The aim of this “axis of resistance” has been to build a strong deterrent against Israel and the US.</p>

<p>Ever since its foundation 45 years ago, the Iranian regime has viewed Israel and its main backer, the US, as an existential threat, just as Israel has regarded Iran in the same way. For this, the regime has reoriented its foreign relations towards America's major adversaries, especially Russia and China. <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/02/united-against-america-russia-iran-military-cooperation-is-a-looming-threat?lang=en">Russo-Iranian military cooperation</a> has grown so strong, in fact, that Moscow will have little hesitation in backing Iran and its affiliates in any war.</p>

<p>Tehran is fully cognisant of Israel's nuclear prowess. To guard against it, Iran has developed its own nuclear program to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/iran-president-nuclear-bomb.html">threshold level</a> of developing a weapon. Iranian leaders may have also gained Russia's assurances it would help defend Iran should Israel resort to the use of its nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is important to remember that after nearly a year of demolishing Gaza and devastating its inhabitants, Israel has not been able to wipe out Hamas.</p>

<p>Its own actions speak to this. It has constantly forced Gazans to relocate so IDF soldiers can operate in areas they had previously declared to be cleared of fighters.</p>

<p>The task of defeating Hezbollah and its backers would be a far greater objective to achieve. It carries the serious risk of a war that all parties have been saying that they do not want, yet all are preparing for.</p>

<p>The pager attack is just the latest in a string of operations that keeps imperilling any chances of a permanent Gaza ceasefire that could stabilise the region and contribute to the causes of peace rather than war.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Meta has announced third-party augmented reality (AR) filters will no longer be available on its apps as of January 2025. This means more than two million user-made filters offered across WhatsApp, Facebook and, most notably, Instagram will disappear]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Meta <a href="https://spark.meta.com/blog/meta-spark-announcement">has announced</a> third-party augmented reality (AR) filters will no longer be available on its apps as of January 2025. This means more than <a href="https://spark.meta.com/blog/introducing-spark-ar-creator-awards">two million</a> user-made filters offered across WhatsApp, Facebook and, most notably, Instagram will disappear.</p>

<p>Filters have become a mainstay feature on Instagram. The most viral of these – which often involve beautifying the user's appearance – are created by users themselves via the <a href="https://spark.meta.com/">Meta Spark Studio</a>.</p>

<p>But the use of beautifying AR filters has long been connected to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01296612.2021.2013065">worsened mental health and body image problems</a> in young women.</p>

<p>In theory, the removal of the vast majority of Instagram filters should signal a turning point for unrealistic beauty standards. However, the removal comes far too late, and the move is more likely to instead push filter use underground.</p>

<p>Much like the newly announced <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-teen-accounts-on-instagram-are-a-welcome-step-but-real-peace-of-mind-requires-more-239290">teen accounts</a> for Instagram, retracting and altering technologies years after the use has been encouraged offers little more than a band-aid approach.</p>

<h2>Filters are popular – so why remove them?</h2>

<p>Meta rarely volunteers information about technologies and business practises beyond what is absolutely necessary. This case is no different. Meta has previously demonstrated it is unmotivated by user harm, even when its own leaked <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">internal research indicates</a> the use of Instagram and filters contributes to worse mental health for young women.</p>

<p>So, why wait until now to remove a popular (but controversial) technology?</p>

<p>Officially, <a href="https://spark.meta.com/learn/FAQ/Meta-spark-update/">Meta states</a> it intends to “prioritise investments in other company priorities”.</p>

<p>Most likely, AR filters are yet another casualty of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In April, Meta pledged to invest between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/technology/meta-profit-stock-ai.html">US$35–40 billion</a> in the technology, and is pulling AR technology in-house.</p>

<p>Filters will not be going away altogether on Instagram. First-party filters created by Meta will continue to be available. The offering of filters available on Instagram's official account (140 at present) is insignificant compared to the library of millions of filters created by third-parties.</p>

<p>Instagram's official filters also offer less diverse types of AR experiences, and its account does not feature any beautifying filters.</p>

<h2>The end of beauty filters? Not quite</h2>

<p>Meta removed filters once before in 2019, though the <a href="https://www.mic.com/impact/instagram-plastic-surgery-filters-will-be-removed-says-spark-ar-statement-19255566">ban</a> only applied to “surgery” filters and was reversed at <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/29/mark_zuckerberg_filters_teens/">Mark Zuckerburg's request</a> after a fleeting implementation.</p>

<p>Informally named for their ability to mimic the effects of cosmetic surgery, surgery filters are the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/1472586X.2024.2341296">most popular type</a> of Instagram filter.</p>

<p>They are also the most controversial, with users seeking surgery and “<a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JSM-12-2020-0506/full/html">tweakments</a>” to mimic their filtered image. In my research, I found when analysing the design of the beautifying Instagram filters, 87% of the filters sampled shrank the user's nose and 90% made the user's lips larger.</p>

<p>The removal of third party filters will see these types of sophisticated and realistic beautifying filters gone from Meta platforms.</p>

<p>However, this is hardly cause for celebration. When <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680777.2022.2129414">analysing the media coverage</a> of the first filter ban, we found users were upset with surgery filters being removed and intended to find ways to access them regardless.</p>

<p>Now, after having access to AR filters on Instagram for seven years, users are even more habituated to their presence. They also have many more alternatives to access a version of the technology inside another app. This is of concern for a few reasons.</p>

<h2>Watermarking and photo literacy</h2>

<p>When posting with a filter on Instagram, a watermark that links to the filter and its creator appears on the image.</p>

<p>This watermark is important to assist users in determining whether someone's appearance is altered or not. Some users get around the watermarking by downloading their filtered photo, and re-uploading it so their filtered appearance is more difficult to detect.</p>

<p>By removing popular beauty filters from Instagram, this “covert” practice will become the default way for users to post with these filters on the platform.</p>

<p>Forcing users into covert filter use adds another thorn to the already prickly case of visual literacy.</p>

<p>Young women and girls feel inadequate compared to edited and filtered images online (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305120965155">including their own</a>).</p>

<p>Some newer TikTok filters, such as the viral “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/13/1069649/hyper-realistic-beauty-filters-bold-glamour/">Bold Glamour</a>” filter, use AI technology (AI-AR) which merges the user's face with the beauty filter, trained on a database of “ideal” images.</p>

<p>By contrast, standard AR filters overlay a set design (akin to a mask) and contort the user's features to match. The result of these new AI-AR filters is a hyper-realistic, and yet totally unachievable beauty standard.</p>

<p>The removal of beauty filters on Instagram will not stop their use. Instead, it will drive users to other platforms to access filters. Like Bold Glamour, these filters will be more sophisticated and harder to detect when they are re-posted cross platform, without the benefit of having the watermark indicator.</p>

<p>Only 34% of Australian adults feel confident in their <a href="https://apo.org.au/node/327239">media literacy skills</a>. Those with less developed digital <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1051144X.2021.1902041">visual literacies</a> increasingly find it difficult to ascertain the difference between edited and unedited images. Add to this the rapid increase in generative AI images, and we are entering <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1051144X.2022.2053819">unprecedented territory</a>.</p>

<p>While the removal of beautifying filters at a more pivotal time may have been meaningful, the genie is out of the bottle. By Instagram removing its already hugely popular beautifying filters now (and the watermarking that goes along with it), the problems associated with filter use on Instagram will not go away, but simply become harder to manage.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>Alexis Lorenze does not have health insurance in California. Now, she is being transferred to a private hospital in Los Angeles for specialised care, said a fundraiser raising money for her treatment.</p>

<p>In response to the 23-year-old's deteriorating condition, VSRF has sent Registered Nurse Angela Wulbrecht and a team of trusted doctors to assist with her care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alexis Lorenze has been using the social media platform TikTok to detail her medical journey. Disturbing images and videos shared by Ms Lorenze reveal the severity of her alleged vaccine reaction. The visuals show her with swollen eyes and forehead, severe black-purplish bruising covering her face and body and red, inflamed skin.</p>

<p>According to Ms Lorenze, she first sought treatment at the hospital for a blood disorder and underwent a blood transfusion. While the transfusion provided some relief, she alleges it did not fully resolve her symptoms. While the transfusion initially showed promise, doctors allegedly advised her to update her vaccinations for the treatment to be fully effective.</p>

<p>After receiving the vaccines, she claimed she experienced severe reactions. The family alleges that the hospital's actions led to the sudden deterioration of Ms Lorenze's health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Artillery shells sold by Indian arms makers have been diverted by European customers to Ukraine and New Delhi has not intervened to stop the trade despite protests from Moscow.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artillery shells sold by Indian arms makers have been diverted by European customers to Ukraine and New Delhi has not intervened to stop the trade despite protests from Moscow, according to eleven Indian and European government and defence industry officials, as well as a Reuters analysis of commercially available customs data.</p>

<p>The transfer of munitions to support Ukraine's defence against Russia has occurred for more than a year, according to the sources and the customs data. Indian arms export regulations limit the use of weaponry to the declared purchaser, who risks future sales being terminated if unauthorised transfers occur.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has raised the issue on at least two occasions, including during a July meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Indian counterpart, three Indian officials said.</p>

<p>Details of the ammunition transfers are reported by Reuters for the first time.</p>

<p>The foreign and defence ministries of Russia and India did not respond to questions. In January, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a news conference that India had not sent or sold artillery shells to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Two Indian government and two defence industry sources told Reuters that Delhi produced only a very small amount of the ammunition being used by Ukraine, with one official estimating that it was under 1% of the total arms imported by Kyiv since the war. The news agency couldn't determine if the munitions were resold or donated to Kyiv by the European customers.</p>

<p>Among the European countries sending Indian munitions to Ukraine are Italy and the Czech Republic, which is leading an initiative to supply Kyiv with artillery shells from outside the European Union, according to a Spanish and a senior Indian official, as well as a former top executive at Yantra India, a state-owned company whose munitions are being used by Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Indian official said that Delhi was monitoring the situation. But, along with a defence industry executive with direct knowledge of the transfers, he said India had not taken any action to throttle the supply to Europe. Like most of the 20 people interviewed by Reuters, they spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian, Italian, Spanish and Czech defence ministries did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Delhi and Washington, Ukraine's main security backer, have recently strengthened defence and diplomatic cooperation against the backdrop of a rising China, which both regard as their main rival.</p>

<p>India also has warm ties with Russia, its primary arms supplier for decades, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refused to join the Western-led sanctions regime against Moscow.</p>

<p>But Delhi, long the world's largest weapons importer, also sees the lengthy war in Europe as an opportunity to develop its nascent arms export sector, according to six Indian sources familiar with official thinking.</p>

<p>Ukraine, which is battling to contain a Russian offensive toward the eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk, has a dire shortage of artillery ammunition.</p>

<p>The White House declined to comment and the U.S. State Department referred questions on Delhi's arms exports to the Indian government.</p>

<p>India exported just over $3 billion of arms between 2018 and 2023, according to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute think-tank.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said at an Aug. 30 conference that defence exports surpassed $2.5 billion in the last fiscal year and that Delhi wanted to increase that to about $6 billion by 2029.</p>

<p>Commercially available customs records show that in the two years before the February 2022 invasion, three major Indian ammunition makers - Yantra, Munitions India and Kalyani Strategic Systems - exported just $2.8 million in munitions components to Italy and the Czech Republic, as well as Spain and Slovenia, where defence contractors have invested heavily in supply chains for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Between February 2022 and July 2024, the figure had increased to $135.25 million, the data show, including completed munitions, which India began exporting to the four nations.</p>

<p>Arzan Tarapore, an India defence expert at Stanford University, said that Delhi's push to expand its arms exports was a major factor in the transfer of its arms to Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Probably in the sudden recent expansion, some instances of end-user violations have occurred."</p>

<p><strong>Discreet Deliveries</strong></p>

<p>Unlisted Italian defence contractor Meccanica per l'Elettronica e Servomeccanismi (MES) was among the companies sending Indian-made shells to Ukraine, said the former top Yantra official.</p>

<p>MES is Yantra's biggest foreign client. The executive said the Rome-based company buys empty shells from India and fills them with explosives.</p>

<p>Several Western firms had explosive filling capabilities but lack the manufacturing capacity to mass produce artillery shells, the executive said.</p>

<p>Yantra said in its 2022-23 annual report that it had agreed a deal with an unnamed Italian client to set up a manufacturing line for L15A1 shells, which the former Yantra executive identified as MES.</p>

<p>MES and Yantra India did not respond to emails seeking comment.</p>

<p>Customs data indicate that Yantra shipped $35 million worth of empty 155mm L15A1 shells to MES between February 2022 and July 2024.</p>

<p>Customs records also show that in February 2024, U.K.-based arms company Dince Hill - whose board includes a top MES executive - exported $6.7 million in ammunition from Italy to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Among the exports were 155mm L15A1 shells, which the customs declaration said were manufactured by MES for Ukraine's Defence Ministry and supplied for "promoting the defense capability and mobilization readiness of Ukraine."</p>

<p>Dince Hill did not respond to an email seeking comment. Its new owner, Rome-based Effequattro Consulting, could not be reached.</p>

<p>In another instance, Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente shared on social media in May an end user agreement signed by a Czech defence official that authorised the transfer of 120mm and 125mm ammunition shells from Munitions India to arms dealer Czech Defence Systems.</p>

<p>Pro-Palestinian activists had alleged that the Borkum, a vessel carrying Indian-made arms which had stopped in a Spanish port, was carrying the weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported in May the final destination was actually Ukraine. A Spanish official and another source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that Kyiv was the end user. Munitions India and CDS did not respond to questions.</p>

<p>Customs records dated March 27 show Munitions India had shipped 10,000 rounds of 120mm and 125mm mortar shells, worth more than $9 million, from Chennai to CDS.</p>

<p><strong>Friendly Fire</strong></p>

<p>Russia, which supplies more than 60% of Delhi's arms imports, is a valued partner for India. In July, PM Modi chose Moscow for his first bilateral international trip since being elected to a third term.</p>

<p>At another meeting that month in Kazakhstan between top Indian diplomat Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Lavrov, the Russian minister pressed his counterpart about Indian munitions being used by Ukrainians and complained that some were made by state-owned Indian companies, according to an Indian official with direct knowledge of the encounter.</p>

<p>The official did not share Jaishankar's response.</p>

<p>Walter Ladwig, a South Asia security expert at King's College London, said the diversion of a relatively small amount of ammunition was geopolitically useful for Delhi.</p>

<p>"It allows India to show partners in the West that it is not 'on Russia's side' in the Russia-Ukraine conflict," he said, adding that Moscow held little leverage over Delhi's decisions.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese firm Icom said Thursday that it had stopped producing the model of radios reportedly used in recent blasts in Lebanon around 10 years ago.</p>

<p>"The IC-V82 is a handheld radio that was produced and exported, including to the Middle East, from 2004 to October 2014. It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company," Icom said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The production of the batteries needed to operate the main unit has also been discontinued, and a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company," it said.</p>

<p>It added that products for overseas markets are sold exclusively through its authorized distributors, and that its export programme is based on Japanese security trade control regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of our radios are manufactured at our production subsidiary, Wakayama Icom Inc., in Wakayama Prefecture, under a strict management system... so no parts other than those specified by our company are used in a product. In addition, all of our radios are manufactured at the same factory, and we do not manufacture them overseas," the statement said.</p>

<p>In the second wave of device explosions in as many days, 20 people died and more than 450 were wounded on Wednesday in Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, officials said.</p>

<p>A source close to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hezbollah-israel-war-soon-32-killed-as-walkie-talkies-pagers-explode-across-lebanon-6598300#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Hezbollah said walkie-talkies used by its members blew up</a> in its Beirut stronghold, with state media reporting similar blasts in south and east Lebanon.</p>

<p>They came a day after the simultaneous explosion of hundreds of paging devices used by Hezbollah killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded up to 2,800 others across Lebanon, in an unprecedented attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>There was no comment from Israel. The White House warned all sides against "an escalation of any kind".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK man accidentally fatally stabbed himself while trying to separate two frozen burgers with a knife, in a freak accident that initially puzzled police, a court heard. Barry Griffiths, 57, died after accidentally plunging the blade into his abdomen at his home in Powys, Wales, in July last year, according to the report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/24591665.powys-man-stabbed-death-separating-frozen-burgers/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Western Telegraph</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Griffiths, who lived alone and was described as "very private", had been dead for several days before a welfare check led police to discover his body, with blood splattered throughout his kitchen and bedroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His phone, wallet, and computer were left untouched, and there were no signs of a struggle in his apartment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police found Mr Griffiths fully clothed on his bed with no evidence of an assault. It was only after discovering uncooked burger patties that detectives pieced together what had occurred, the court was told.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The bottom drawer of the freezer had been left open and pulled forward in a position to access food items," Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Rees said.</p>

<p>"On the work surface in the kitchen adjacent to the fridge freezer were two uncooked burgers, a knife and a tea towel," he continued.</p>

<p>"The wound to the abdomen would have been approximately the height of the work surface. My hypothesis at that stage was that Mr Griffiths was attempting to separate frozen burgers using a knife."</p>

<p>A medical examiner concluded that Mr Griffiths- who had limited use of one arm due to a stroke- most likely died from an accident injury rather than suicide.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The attack targeted Hezbollah operatives by planting explosive devices inside hand-held pagers and walkie-talkies. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">At least 32 people were killed and more than 3,250 injured as walkie-talkies and pagers used by Hezbollah members blew up across Lebanon in the last two days. Walkie-talkies used by Iran-backed Hezbollah members blew up in its Beirut stronghold on Wednesday, killing at least 20 people and injuring more than 450 others. The explosions came a day after thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, killing 12 people, including two children, and injuring about 2,800.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The mass <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israels-unit-8200-in-spotlight-after-hezbollah-pager-attacks-in-lebanon-6596001 ">pager and walkie-talkie attack</a> against Hezbollah in Lebanon has now drawn attention to Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence arm, allegedly involved in planning the operation.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a Western security source, Unit 8200 played a role in the development stage of the operation, which was over a year in the making. The source revealed that the unit was responsible for testing how to insert explosive material within the manufacturing process.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Unit 8200: Israel's Elite Intelligence Unit</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Unit 8200 is a highly specialised military group that develops and operates intelligence-gathering tools, comparable to the US National Security Agency. The unit's activities range from cyber defence to “technological attacks and strikes.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unit 8200 develops and operates advanced surveillance tools and cyber defence systems and is credited with high-profile operations. It played a key role in the Stuxnet virus attack from 2005 to 2010, which damaged Iranian nuclear centrifuges. In 2017, it was allegedly behind a cyberattack on Lebanon's state telecom company, Ogero, disrupting communications. The unit also contributed to thwarting an ISIS plot in 2018, helping to prevent a planned attack on a civilian airliner travelling from Australia to the UAE.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Former military intelligence official Yossi Kuperwasser praised Unit 8200's expertise, saying its members are “the best and brightest personnel in the Israeli military,” as per Reuters.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unit 8200 is also a crucial feeder into Israel's booming tech industry, with many of its alumni going on to found successful cybersecurity and tech companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Avi Shua, a graduate of Unit 8200 iand co-founder of the unicorn Orca Security, praised the group's work culture, which promotes innovative problem-solving and independent thinking.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the unit has recently come under scrutiny for its inability to predict Hamas' attack on southern Israel in October. This failure led to the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chief-of-israels-elite-intelligence-group-unit-8200-quits-heres-why-6553802 ">resignation of its commander</a>, who admitted he had not fulfilled his mission.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite the recent Hezbollah bomb allegations, Israeli military officials have remained silent. Neither the IDF nor the Prime Minister's office, which oversees Mossad, has confirmed the involvement of Unit 8200.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 32 people and injuring thousands more.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/walkie-talkies-explode-in-hezbollahs-beirut-stronghold-day-after-pager-blasts-6595278">pagers and walkie-talkies</a> used by Hezbollah members detonated across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 32 people and injuring thousands more. This attack has sparked multiple theories about how these devices were sabotaged. While the exact <a href="http:// https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pagers-then-walkie-talkies-how-devices-were-weaponised-against-hezbollah-6596167">mechanism behind the explosions</a> is still being investigated, a few theories have emerged.</p>

<p>Much of the debate centres around the idea that the pagers were tampered with, causing their batteries to overheat and explode. According to Lebanese Telecommunications Minister Johnny Corm, this overheating indicated "foul play". However, cybersecurity expert Robert Graham quickly dismissed this theory, arguing that making batteries do more than burn is implausible. Instead, he suggested the far more likely explanation that someone bribed the factories involved to insert explosives into the devices, Bloomberg reported.</p>

<h2><strong>What happened?</strong></h2>

<p>The first wave of explosions occurred on Tuesday when pagers used by the Iran-backed terror group detonated across Lebanon. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with casualties, leading to the establishment of a field hospital in Tyre. These explosions came shortly after Israel announced a strategic expansion in its military actions against Hezbollah. On Wednesday, a second wave of explosions involving Hezbollah walkie-talkies caused further chaos.</p>

<h2><strong>Theory 1: Explosives planted in devices</strong></h2>

<p>According to Lebanese security sources and reports by Reuters, a new batch of 5,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah from Taiwan-based manufacturer Gold Apollo had been compromised. Israeli spy intelligence agency Mossad is suspected of embedding small explosive devices within these devices. The explosives, reportedly as small as 3 grams, were hidden in such a way that they went undetected by Hezbollah for months. The detonation mechanism is believed to be activated remotely via a coded message sent to the pagers. These explosives, experts say, were impossible to detect through regular scanners.</p>

<p>The attack on the walkie-talkies, believed to have been purchased around the same time, has been linked to a similar sabotage operation. These devices, labelled as ICOM and reportedly made in Japan, are thought to have been tampered with at the production level, possibly by Mossad. The walkie-talkie explosions are less well-documented, but it is suggested that the same coded message method could have been used to activate the embedded explosives.</p>

<h2><strong>Theory 2: Supply chain compromised</strong></h2>

<p>Another theory is the tampering of the supply chain. Security experts suggest that Israeli intelligence may have gained access to the devices long before they reached Hezbollah. The pagers were identified as Gold Apollo AR-924 models, but further investigation revealed they were manufactured by BAC Consulting in Hungary, a company with licensing rights to use the Gold Apollo brand. This raises the possibility that the sabotage took place during the manufacturing or distribution stages, providing Israel an opportunity to install explosive materials without detection.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has since stated that the devices were part of a shipment recently imported, implying the tampering occurred before the pagers arrived in Lebanon.</p>

<h2><strong>Theory 3: Remote activation via message</strong></h2>

<p>Another central theory is that the pagers and walkie-talkies were remotely detonated using an electronic signal or radio frequency, rather than physical tampering. Mark Montgomery, a retired admiral and executive director of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, suggested that the explosions may have been triggered by a radio frequency or electronic signal. "I suspect it was an intentional physical defect enabled by cyber or a radio frequency signal," he told Bloomberg.</p>

<p>The detonation appears to have been triggered by a coded message, according to a report from the New York Times. The pagers simultaneously received what appeared to be an internal communication from Hezbollah leadership, which, upon opening, activated the explosives hidden within the devices. Videos circulating on social media supposedly show individuals looking at their pagers moments before the explosions occurred.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is responsible?</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack and has vowed retaliation. The timing of the explosions, which followed Israel's announcement of extended military operations along the Lebanon border, has fuelled speculation that this was a deliberate move by Mossad. However, Israel has not commented on the matter officially. Further investigation is ongoing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US court has summoned the Indian government after Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun filed a civil lawsuit, alleging a plot to murder him. The summons by the US District Court for Southern District of New York names Government of India, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, R&amp;AW agent Vikram Yadav, and Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta. The summons asks New Delhi and those named to file a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>The Centre is yet to respond to the summons. Pannu's X handle, on which he shared a copy of the summons, has been withheld.</p>

<p>In November, the UK newspaper Financial Times reported that the US had thwarted a plot to kill Pannun, who heads the radical outfit, Sikhs for Justice, and holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. Officials in the Joe Biden administration later confirmed this.</p>

<p>In its first response, the External Affairs Ministry said it is a "matter of concern" and stressed that India has launched a high-level probe.</p>

<p>"As regards the case against an individual that has been filed in a US court, allegedly linking him to an Indian official, this is a matter of concern. We have said that this is also contrary to government policy," then MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.</p>

<p>In May this year, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said India is investigating the matter, but stressed that it would not impact the "upward trajectory" of India-US ties.</p>

<p>"The United States brought to our attention certain information in good faith because we also believe some of it has implications for our own system," he said in an interview to news agency PTI.</p>

<p>"We are investigating it. But I do not think the fundamental course of the upward trajectory of India-US is impacted by this at all," he said.</p>

<p>US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti has told NDTV that this matter will not affect India-US ties.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon has blamed Israel for the sabotage of thousands of pagers that caused them to explode, killing several people and wounding thousands, in an apparent bid to weaken the Islamist militant group Hezbollah. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack, which came after almost a year of cross-border rocket fire between the two sides in a second front to the war in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>United Nations, government and tech-industry officials were left scratching their heads over how the co-ordinated series of blasts had been carried out, though veterans of Israel's intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet have opened up about assassinations in the past - some of which required high levels of technical or operational ingenuity.</p>

<h3><strong>Deadly Phone Call</strong></h3>

<p>Shin Bet used a mobile phone secretly fitted with explosives to kill Yahya Ayyash, a master bombmaker from Hamas nicknamed "the Engineer," in Gaza in 1996. A Palestinian go-between gave Ayyash the phone to receive a call from his father. When Israeli eavesdroppers verified it was Ayyash's voice on the line, the phone was remotely detonated, causing a lethal head injury.</p>

<h3><strong>Neck Poison</strong></h3>

<p>In retaliation for a series of Hamas suicide bombings in 1997, then first-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the killing of the Palestinian Islamist group's politburo chief, Khaled Mashaal, in the Jordanian capital of Amman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two undercover Mossad officers sprayed poison onto Meshaal's nape as he left his car for an appointment, with one of them opening a pre-shaken can of Coca-Cola to provide an innocent explanation for the rogue liquid. The plan failed because Meshaal's daughter ran after him, prompting an aide to turn around and notice the would-be assassins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were captured by Jordanian police, and repatriated only after Israel provided an antidote to save Meshaal's life.</p>

<h3><strong>Fake Tourists</strong></h3>

<p>Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, an international arms procurer for Hamas, was found dead in his Dubai hotel room in 2010. Emirati authorities initially deemed it death by natural causes but re-opened the case after the Gaza-based Palestinian group accused Israel of killing him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subsequent investigation uncovered CCTV footage of a Mossad hit team, using cloned European passports and posing as tennis-playing tourists, businesspeople, or hotel staff, surveilling Mabhouh and converging on his hotel room. An autopsy determined that Mabhouh had been sedated and smothered.</p>

<h3><strong>Traffic Blasts</strong></h3>

<p>Between 2010 and 2020, about half a dozen Iranian nuclear scientists were killed or wounded in gun attacks or explosions that authorities blamed on Israel. Most of them were caused by magnetized bombs that had been attached to vehicles by passing motorcyclists, according to Iranian state media reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel hasn't confirmed it was behind any of the strikes, though its officials acknowledged being locked in a shadow war with Iran. A former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would later claim responsibility for a similar assassination in the Iranian capital in 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>Satellite Sniper</strong></h3>

<p>Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's chief nuclear scientist, was shot dead while driving in a convoy on the outskirts of Tehran in 2020. Some Iranian media reports said Israel used a satellite-controlled sniper rifle mounted on the back of a pick-up truck and equipped with AI face recognition. Israel didn't confirm the killing, though Netanyahu had previously identified Fakhrizadeh as head of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program, saying: "Remember his name."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK bank, Starling Bank, has issued a warning about a new wave of scams that use artificial intelligence to replicate people's voices. Fraudsters can create convincing voice clones from just a few seconds of audio, often found in online videos, the bank said in a press release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The online-only lender said that these scams are highly effective, with millions of people potentially at risk. The bank's survey found that over a quarter of respondents had been targeted by such scams in the past year, and many were unaware of the threat, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/tech/ai-voice-cloning-scam-warning/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>"People regularly post content online which has recordings of their voice, without ever imagining it's making them more vulnerable to fraudsters," Lisa Grahame, chief information security officer at Starling Bank, said in the press release.</p>

<p>According to the survey, 46% of respondents weren't aware that such scams existed, and that 8% would send over as much money as requested by a friend or family member, even if they thought the call seemed strange.</p>

<p>To protect themselves, people are advised to establish a "safe phrase" with their loved ones. This unique phrase can be used to verify identity during phone calls. The bank advised against sharing the safe phrase over text, which could make it easier for scammers to find out, but, if shared in this day, the message should be deleted once the other person has seen it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As AI technology continues to advance, concerns about its potential for misuse are growing. The creators of ChatGPT, and OpenAI, have even acknowledged the risks associated with voice replication tools.<br />

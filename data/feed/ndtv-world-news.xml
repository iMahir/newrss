       <description><![CDATA[A Secret Service agent, assigned to Barack Obama's detail, was recently fired after he landed in hot water for allegedly bringing a lover to the former US President's beachfront property in Hawaii.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Secret Service agent, assigned to Barack Obama's detail, was recently fired after he landed in hot water for allegedly bringing a lover to the former US President's beachfront property in Hawaii, according to a new memoir by the law enforcement officer's former girlfriend.</p>

<p>In “Undercover Heartbreak: a Memoir of Trust and Trauma,” Koryeah Dwanyen detailed a series of potential security lapses on the former agent's part while he was trying to woo her, including a time when he sent her photos of the house and even suggested a tour of the mansion when the Obamas weren't home, according to ABC News.</p>

<h2><strong>Allegations</strong></h2>

<p>“No one will know. If anything, I'm the one who could get in trouble," the agent, who was given the pseudonym “Dale" in the book, allegedly told Ms Dwanyen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“No one will know. If anything, I'm the one who could get in trouble,” says the agent in the memoir, where he is given the pseudonym “Dale.”</p>

<p>As per the ABC report, the incident happened in 2022, while the agent was assigned to protect the former President. As per Ms Dwanyen's book, the agent even tried to get her to fool around in the former first lady Michelle Obama's bathroom.</p>

<p>“We should have sex in Michelle [Obama]'s bathroom, like a mile-high club,” the book, self-published on October 28, claimed he said.</p>

<p>As per the memoir, Ms Dwanyen was vacationing in Martha's Vineyard in 2022 when she met 'Dale', who was assigned to the security detail of the Obama family. At the time, he reportedly told the woman that he was divorced and had been for nearly a decade. She later found out that the agent was still married, according to the book.</p>

<p>Later, during an interview with ABC, Dwanyen said, “There were major red flags -- breaches of trust and of his job."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Acting on her concern, Ms Dwanyen said, she sent an email to the agent's boss -- whom she had met "several times" in Hawaii --outlining her concerns about “breaches of trust and of his job”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The secret service agent's boss took the matter seriously and started an investigation. “They realized that not only had ‘Dale' shared photos of the Obamas' house, but he had also brought me there,” Ms Dwanyen wrote in the book.</p>

<p>It was also found that the agent had allegedly also taken photos of “pictures of Alicia Keys' house, Steven Spielberg's boats, Melinda Gates, Tyler Perry and Amal Clooney.” He has also shared background information on former vice president Mike Pence, who he had allegedly been assigned to during the Trump Administration, she said.</p>

<p>According to Ms Dwanyen, 'Dale' shared some “personal tidbits" with her which "he should not have" about the people he was protecting. "I knew their code names. I knew what day Orange Theory was, what day [Michelle Obama] had private tennis lessons and when her personal trainer came...Things that I should not have been privy to as a civilian," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Agent Fired</strong></h3>

<p>After the allegations surfaced, the Secret Service launched an internal investigation following which the agent was fired for alleged violations of fundamental regulations.</p>

<p>“On Nov. 6, 2022, a Secret Service agent involved in protective functions brought an individual who did not have authorized access into a protectee's residence without permission," Anthony Guglielmi, the agency's chief of communications, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/memoir-obama-secret-service-breached-security/story?id=115753131" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">ABC</a> News.</p>

<p>"As soon as the Secret Service became aware of the incident, the agent involved was immediately suspended and after a full investigation, terminated," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guglielmi stressed that the US Secret Service's top priority is ensuring the safety and security of its protectees, "and any actions that compromise this commitment are addressed with the utmost seriousness."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who would have thought that the viral blue-eyed tea seller would one day demand Rs 1 crore (around Rs 30 lakh Indian rupees) on Shark Tank Pakistan for a five per cent equity in his cafe called Cafe Chai Wala?</p>

<p>Dressed in a swanky black suit, Arshad Khan walked through the doors of Shark Tank Pakistan with his business partner Kazim Hasan. On the show, he talked about his acclaim and urged the judges to invest in his business.</p>

<p>He said, "I had never left Islamabad before that. A lot of people advised me to start my own cafe. I had always wanted my own cafe, even when I was working at somebody else's dhaba."</p>

<p>His first cafe took a sad turn when the pandemic hit in 2020 but he relaunched it again in October of the same year, and has been profiting off it. Surprisingly he also has two operational cafes in Pakistan. They also have three outlets operating in England functioning in a franchise model which yields him 35,000 Pakistani rupees for five per cent royalty.</p>

<p>He added that he wanted to open more such profitable outlets all across the world and showed his vision for expansion. He justified his expansion in London citing his strategy to tap into the South Asian diaspora and also to phase in Pakistani culture abroad.</p>

<p>The cafe's design spells Pakistani motifs and elements, borrowing from street aesthetics which makes it unique.</p>

<p>Two sharks - Junaid Iqbal and Faisal Aftab appreciated Khan's ideas but rejected the deal specifying lack of insight in the hospitality industry. However, Shark Rabeel Warraich offered Khan and Kazim 1 crore rupees for 24 per cent in equity but finally they got a double shark deal with an addition of Romanna Dada for the same amount. Another shark, Usman Bashir offered a deal to join in with the other two sharks for a combined equity of 30 per cent.</p>

<p>Regardless, after some back and forth, they settled for the previous double-shark-deal of 1 crore for an equity of 25 per cent.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The sweeping mandate to the left coalition underlines widening support for his leftist policies, giving him the power to push through his plans to fight poverty and graft in the island nation struggling to emerge from the worst financial crisis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake-led National People's Power (NPP) party achieved a landslide victory on Friday in the snap parliamentary election. The sweeping mandate to Mr Dissanayake's coalition underlines widening support for his leftist policies, giving him the power to push through his plans to fight poverty and graft in the island nation struggling to emerge from the worst financial crisis since its independence from the British in 1948.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old leader had announced the parliamentary polls shortly after his election as president in September. His leftist coalition's victory marks a significant shift in Sri Lankan politics as the South Asian nation grapples with the aftermath of the mass protests that ousted former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Snap Poll Results</strong></h2>

<p>In the previous parliament, NPP had just three seats, but after Friday's landslide victory, it got a two-thirds majority in the 225-member house. The Rajapaksa family's Podujana Peramuna party, whose cohort of brothers gave Sri Lanka two presidents during a dozen years in power and had 145 seats in the outgoing legislature, was virtually wiped out, winning just three seats.</p>

<p>The NPP secured almost 62 per cent or almost 7 million votes, up from the 42 per cent Mr Dissanayake won in September. This indicates that the new President has drawn more widespread support including from minorities. The party dominated the Jaffna electoral district – the heartland of the nation's Tamil minority.</p>

<p>Dissanayake dissolved parliament on September 24 to clear the way for the general election, days after the Marxist-leaning leader was elected president on a platform for change. The election became necessary as Dissanayake had just three lawmakers in the outgoing parliament - whose five-year term was due to end in August 2025 - and needed a fresh mandate to push his policies.</p>

<p>Voters directly elect 196 members to parliament from 22 constituencies under a proportional representation system. The remaining 29 seats will be allocated according to the island-wide proportional vote obtained by each party.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>New Challenges Ahead</strong></h3>

<p>In Sri Lanka, the president wields executive power, but Mr Dissanayake still required a parliamentary majority to appoint a fully-fledged cabinet to deliver on key promises to cut taxes, support local businesses, and fight poverty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A nation of 22 million, Sri Lanka was crushed by a 2022 economic crisis triggered by a severe shortage of foreign currency that pushed it into a sovereign default and caused its economy to shrink by 7.3 per cent in 2022 and 2.3 per cent last year. Boosted by a USD 2.9 billion bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the economy has begun a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living is still a critical issue for many, especially the poor.</p>

<p>Now, with more control over the government, the new president will face the challenge of steering the island nation towards economic recovery while also addressing the pressing issues of inflation and the cost of living.</p>

<p>He promised to slash taxes and introduce stronger welfare support for millions of poor people. He also aims to tweak targets set by the IMF to rein in income tax and free up funds to invest in welfare for the millions hit hardest by the crisis. However, investors worry his desire to revisit the terms of the IMF bailout could delay future disbursements, making it harder for Sri Lanka to hit a key primary surplus target of 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 as set by the IMF.</p>

<p>"The president has a huge mandate now to carry through the reforms but also huge expectations from the people," a report by Reuters quoted Bhavani Fonseka, a researcher at Colombo's Centre for Policy Alternatives, as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is unprecedented, we haven't seen this kind of victory before. People voted for a change," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the President said any changes to the contours of the IMF programme would be undertaken in consultation with the fund and that he is committed to ensuring repayment of debt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new government is also expected to face talent issues, as the coalition has few leaders with governance and policy-making experience.</p>

<p>Moreover, while he was in opposition, Mr Dissanayake had argued against the massive powers of the executive presidency and its links to abuse of power. Now, with a two-thirds majority, the President can begin the process of abolishing the executive presidency, although analysts say that is not a pressing concern and is unlikely to be a priority.</p>

<h3><strong>What Does Dissanayake's Victory Mean For India?</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Dissanayake is the leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a party that had historically kept distance from India. JVP was also one of the parties that vehemently opposed the Indo-Lanka accord of 1987, signed by Sri Lanka's then-president JR Jayewardene and India's Rajiv Gandhi. The party spearheaded an insurrection to oppose Indian influence over Sri Lanka after the signing of the accord, which was put down by the administration.</p>

<p>However, despite his party's stance against India, Mr Dissanayake has expressed a desire to engage with India and maintain cordial relations. In September, during an interview with The Monocle, a global affairs and lifestyle magazine, Mr Dissanayake said he wants to avoid being "sandwiched" between India and China but recognises each as a "valued partner".</p>

<p>The former grassroots leader made it clear he intends to steer clear of geopolitical rumblings in South Asia or the Indian Ocean region. "There are many power camps within a multipolar system... but we won't be part of that geopolitical fight, nor will we be aligned with any party. We also don't want to be sandwiched, especially between China and India. Both are valued friends and we expect them to become closer partners," he said.&nbsp;<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office on Friday apologised for a "mistake" in the organisation of its Diwali reception at 10 Downing Street after some British Hindus objected to non-vegetarian food and alcohol being served at the gathering.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office on Friday apologised for a “mistake” in the organisation of its Diwali reception at 10 Downing Street after some British Hindus objected to non-vegetarian food and alcohol being served at the gathering.</p>

<p>While the statement did not make a direct reference to the menu, a spokesperson for Starmer's office said the team acknowledged the strength of feeling on the issue and assured the community that it would not be repeated in future.</p>

<p>“The Prime Minister was pleased to welcome a range of communities celebrating Diwali to a reception in Downing Street,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>

<p>“He paid tribute to the huge contribution the British Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities make to our country and how the government is driven by the shared values of hard work, ambition and aspiration. A mistake was made in the organisation of the event," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"We understand the strength of feeling on this issue and so would apologise to the community and assure them it will not happen again,” the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The statement came a day after British Indian Conservative Party MP Shivani Raja issued a formal letter to Starmer expressing concerns over the reception not being “in keeping with the customs of many Hindus”.</p>

<p>“I feel it speaks poorly against the organisation of this year's event – with a disappointing lack of knowledge of the customs and traditions that many British citizens hold dear,” reads her letter posted on social media.</p>

<p>“As a practising Hindu representing thousands of Hindus within my own constituency of Leicester East, I have been deeply saddened to hear that this year's festivities were overshadowed in the greatest Office of State by negativity, as a result of this oversight,” said the first-time Tory member of Parliament elected in July from the city of Leicester.</p>

<p>The Opposition MP went on to offer her “assistance and guidance” to the Labour Party government for all future Hindu celebrations to ensure they are celebrated in a “respectful manner”.</p>

<p>The Downing Street event held on October 29 marked the first Diwali reception since Labour was elected to government in the general election four months ago. It brought together British Indian community leaders, professionals and parliamentarians. However, community organisation Insight UK questioned the “appalling lack of understanding” of the spiritual aspect of the Hindu festival and a few others pointed out that greater consultation is required ahead of such religious events after reports emerged of meat and alcohol being served at the gathering.</p>

<p>The reception has been held regularly over the years at Downing Street and insiders indicated Starmer was keen to follow in the footsteps of Rishi Sunak as the first British Hindu Prime Minister of Britain and light candles on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street to mark Diwali.</p>

<p>“We value and respect your heritage and traditions, and recognise the strength of our shared values and the celebration of Diwali – a time of coming together, of abundance, and welcome,” read excerpts released from Starmer's address at the event.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noticing the rotors of an Apache helicopter making unusual movements at a military training area in the UK, maintenance staff decided to check and were surprised to find two soldiers having sex inside. The British soldiers were reportedly drunk at the time.</p>

<p>The ground staff had finished servicing the highly armed Apache chopper, worth 8.5 million euros and equipped with 30mm cannon and Hellfire missiles, during their night time routine work when the up and down swaying of the rotors caught their attention, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/two-drunk-air-corps-soldiers-34105619">Mirror</a>.&nbsp;They even heard strange noises coming from the helicopter and when they decided to look what was causing them, they found two soldiers, half naked, squeezed into the rear cockpit of the helicopter engaged in sexual activity in a drunken state, say media reports. While the man was dressed in his army uniform, the woman was in civilian attire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both the soldiers were asked to come out of the helicopter and get dressed, according to a report to the Military Aviation Authority. "It became apparent that the rear cockpit was occupied by two people engaged in sexual intercourse. Both were naked from the waist down - the male in uniform, the female in civilian attire," said the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They were ordered to exit the cockpit and get dressed. Both parties were serving soldiers. Both showed symptoms of intoxication," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the chopper they were caught in belonged to Army Air Corps' 653 Squadron, they were part of a different army unit. They were detained till their parent unit and the chain of command of 653 Squadron arrived at the spot, said the Military Aviation Authority report.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/31702339/solders-caught-apache-chopper-romp/">the Sun</a>, the incident happened back in 2016 at the Otterburn range in Northumberland. However, it has become public recently due to a technical glitch. Air Crew were reportedly later asked to make sure the choppers were locked and secure in future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump did not lose a minute to assemble his new cabinet ministers, but that has received quite extreme reactions. The structure of Trump 2.0 White House has left leaders "stunned" and "appalled", with some of his choices even rubbing Republicans the wrong way. George Conway, a lawyer and activist said that Trump's nominations, "would arguably have been the worst in American history".</p>

<h2><strong>Tulsi Gabbard - Director of National Intelligence</strong></h2>

<p>Trump's decision to nominate Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence has raised concerns among national security experts. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, lacks formal intelligence experience, sparking worries about her ability to lead the intelligence community.</p>

<p>Her background is marked by a significant shift in political allegiance, having run for president in the Democratic primaries in 2020, only to leave the party in 2022 and endorse Trump. This drastic change has led some to question her suitability for the role.</p>

<p>Gabbard's experience includes serving on the House Committee on Homeland Security for two years, but she has never held a senior government position or worked directly in intelligence. Her anti-interventionist stance, advocating for US non-involvement in global conflicts, has also been at odds with the US Intelligence Community's decisions.</p>

<p>The nomination has been met with scepticism from some members of Congress, including Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, who expressed her dismay on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Not only is [Gabbard] ill-prepared and unqualified, but she traffics in conspiracy theories and cosies up to dictators like Bashar-al Assad and Vladimir Putin," Spanberg said.</p>

<p>Jamie Metzl, a former Clinton administration official said, "If you are part of a foreign government, even an allied government, are you really going to want to share your most important intelligence with the United States government, recognizing that there are people who are at central nodes in our government who are so sympathetic to our adversaries?" he asked. "It's really concerning."</p>

<p>With Gabbard's unconventional background and shifting political loyalties, concerns about her ability to effectively lead the intelligence community remain.</p>

<h3><strong>Matt Gaetz - Attorney General</strong></h3>

<p>Matt Gaetz, a U.S. congressman from Florida since 2017, has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for attorney general, sparking controversy due to pending allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gaetz resigned from his House seat just hours after Trump's announcement on Wednesday, amid a scheduled House Ethics Committee vote on releasing the results of an extensive investigation into these allegations, which Gaetz denies.</p>

<p>As attorney general, Gaetz would oversee the Justice Department, which has been investigating him for years on sex trafficking and obstruction of justice allegations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Gaetz was informed last year that he wouldn't face charges, but the House ethics investigation remains ongoing.</p>

<p>The nomination caught fellow Republicans off guard, with CNN reporting an "audible gasp" from House Republicans during a closed-door meeting when the news broke.</p>

<p>"I was shocked at the nomination," Senator Susan Collins said when she first heard about the announcement.</p>

<p>Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said, "Do you think he's a serious candidate? Not as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>Gaetz's appointment has raised concerns, given the serious allegations against him and the significant role of the attorney general in leading the Justice Department. Trump's decision to nominate Gaetz highlights the contentious nature of his cabinet selections following his presidential election victory against Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services has sparked widespread criticism due to Kennedy's history of promoting debunked health-related conspiracy theories, particularly his anti-vaccine stance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a member of one of America's most prominent political families, being the son of late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, his views have drawn significant attention.</p>

<p>He is anti-vaccination and has claimed vaccines are linked to autism, despite evidence disproving this claim. He advocates for removing fluoride from public drinking water, contrary to CDC recommendations that highlight its benefits in preventing cavities and promoting oral health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also supports the consumption of raw milk and the use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, both of which have been disputed by health experts. Kennedy has also made unusual claims about his own health, including having a brain worm which "ate a portion of it and then died".</p>

<p>Public Citizen, a non-profit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group, said, "Robert F Kennedy Jr is a clear and present danger to the nation's health. He shouldn't be allowed in the building at the department of health and human services (HHS), let alone be placed in charge of the nation's public health agency."</p>

<p>These views have raised concerns about Kennedy's potential impact on the nation's health policies, especially considering his plans to tackle America's substance abuse crisis, an issue he has personal experience with, as he was addicted to heroin for 14 years during his youth.</p>

<h3><strong>Pete Hegseth - Defense Secretary</strong></h3>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host, as his Secretary of Defense, despite Hegseth's past criticism of Trump's foreign policy and military stances during the 2016 campaign. Hegseth had called Trump's foreign policy views "shallow" but later became a strong supporter.</p>

<p>Hegseth's nomination is notable, given his unconventional background for the role. He has served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, earning several awards, including the Bronze Star Medal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, his views on certain issues may raise concerns. For instance, Hegseth opposes women serving in combat roles, arguing it lowers military standards and effectiveness. "Women shouldn't be in combat at all. They're life-givers, not life-takers. I know a lot of wonderful soldiers, female soldiers, who have served, who are great. But they shouldn't be in my infantry battalion," he told Ben Shapiro, a conservative political commentator in an interview.</p>

<p>He supports troops accused or convicted of war crimes and has advocated for their pardon. He also wants to fire senior officers who support "woke policies".</p>

<p>Given these stances, Hegseth may face a challenging confirmation process in the Senate. His nomination has already sparked controversy, highlighting the need for careful consideration of his qualifications and views.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He is the least qualified person in history of the job," said a former defence official from Trump's administration.</p>

<p>As a Fox News personality, Hegseth has been vocal about his opinions, but as Secretary of Defense, his decisions would have far-reaching implications for national security.<br />

</div>

<p>If you're looking for an insight that helps explain what happened in the US Presidential election and why it happened, consider this observation from a key player in US politics: “There is a difference between what offends people and what affects them.”</p>

<p>Donald Trump offends people as if it were a religion. His constant lying offends; his cruelty offends; his racism offends; his misogyny offends; his open contempt for “losers” offends; his lack of remorse offends; his vanity offends; his affinity for chaos offends; his admiration for dictators offends; his vow for retribution and revenge against the “enemies of the people” (anyone who has crossed him or might cross him) offends; his promise to begin “mass deportation” of “25 million” illegal immigrants on Day 1 offends; his vow to upend world trade by imposing a 20% tariff on all goods and 60% on Chinese goods offends; his promise to “protect women whether they like it or not” offends; his commitment to dismiss climate change and pursue a “drill, baby, drill” energy policy offends; his commitment to end Obamacare offends. The list is endless.</p>

<h2><strong>It's Trump's World...</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, Trump is the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote, and the MAGA movement has given him unfettered power by securing both the Senate and the House. The US Supreme Court is already aligned with him 6-3 and has effectively granted him virtual immunity from any presidential acts. Project 2025 has a blueprint ready to fulfil his promise to crush the “Deep State” (i.e., federal officials committed to the Constitution and the rule of law) and replace up to 50,000 federal employees with loyalists. The independence of the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department will be under threat. All of this has been clear as daylight since Trump announced his re-run in December 2022.</p>

<p>But Trump won because he successfully positioned himself as the Agent of Change (‘Trump will Fix It'), addressing the issues that affect his core voter base—62% of Americans without a college degree. These voters, who typically show little interest in politics but are deeply focused on improving their material well-being and preserving their cultural values, were key to his success.</p>

<p>And what affects them? Some of the most important issues include rising costs over the last four years: grocery prices up 20%, rents up 40%. There are also concerns about men's self-image: girls outperforming boys in school and college, the #MeToo movement, and college-educated women seeing the highest increases in income and status. Then there is what many perceive as the imposition of ‘Wokeism': it's not just about accepting the full rights and recognition of the LGBTQ community, but also about children having the right to change their gender before adulthood.</p>

<h2><strong>The Fear Of Immigrants</strong></h2>

<p>In some cases, there are deeply held beliefs based on fear and misinformation. I know a Texas-based psychotherapist whose patient confided that she was afraid to go out at night due to fear of immigrants, even though she employs a migrant—likely an undocumented worker—as a housekeeper. Another patient believes Trump was sent by God and that the opposition party was sent by the Devil. Neither patient suffers from psychosis; these are culturally sanctioned beliefs, according to the therapist.</p>

<p>Finally, there are outright misconceptions—such as the belief that tariffs won't raise the cost of household goods, or that Trump's first term, with no new wars, proves he could end the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts immediately upon taking office. There is also the notion that the mass deportation of illegal immigrants would not cripple industries that rely heavily on immigrant labour, like the US meat industry. According to The Economist, roughly half of the labour on US farms is undocumented.</p>

<p>This same Texas-based psychotherapist couldn't believe his eyes when he saw a massive billboard in rural Texas proclaiming, “Born in New York, Thinks Like a Texan.” That's the story Trump sold to voters. And in politics—especially electoral politics—perception is reality.</p>

<h2><strong>Is There Really A Tectonic Shift?</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, even in the face of what some view as an impending apocalypse for the Democratic Party, it's important to note that Trump's win in the popular vote was narrow: 75.8 million votes (50.2%) to Kamala Harris's 72.8 million votes (48.2%), with nearly all votes counted. In 2016, Biden led Trump by 7 million votes. But credit where it's due—Trump won the popular vote by actively pursuing it, rallying supporters in New York and California, even though those blue states' electoral college votes were never in play for him. This effort came in the final weeks of the campaign when conventional wisdom would suggest focusing on the seven key swing states.</p>

<p>How true is the talk of a tectonic shift in the vote and the creation of a new Republican social coalition? It is true that the identity that moved the non-White vote to Trump was their working-class, non-college-educated identity. These voters believed that Trump would do a better job of bringing back jobs lost to Mexico, addressing their affordability crisis, preserving their conservative cultural values, and securing their legal immigrant status by deporting illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>None of this should have come as a surprise. Pre-election polls from <em>The New York Times </em>found a surprising affinity between Trump's views and those of Latinos and Black voters. Four out of ten Hispanic voters and one out of five Black voters had a favourable impression of Trump. A majority of them sympathized with his “America First” foreign policy. Only 20% of Hispanic voters and 26% of Black voters felt that the economic conditions were good or excellent. Median weekly wages for full-time Black workers had risen steeply during Trump's presidency but essentially stagnated under Biden.</p>

<p>However, in absolute numbers, the shift in the non-White vote has not been as significant as it is often portrayed, as columnist Thomas Edsall points out in the <em>NYT</em>. “Roughly six in ten Hispanics voted for Joe Biden; five in ten for Kamala Harris. Nine out of ten Black voters chose Biden; eight in ten for Harris. More than four-fifths of Trump's votes came from White voters.”</p>

<p>Trump won because he has excellent political instincts and because people know exactly what he stands for. His views on trade and immigration were shaped years before he entered politics. “I believe very strongly in tariffs,” he told a journalist in 1989. “America is being ripped off.” In his 2000 book,&nbsp;<em>The America We Deserve</em>, he wrote that “our current laxness toward illegal immigration shows a recklessness and disregard for those who live here legally.”</p>

<h2><strong>Rich-Poor Divide</strong></h2>

<p>What is particularly disturbing for the Democratic Party is that this election has reinforced the post-2012 electoral reality: the less well-off are siding with Trump, while the college-educated, coastal elites are aligned with the Democrats. With White Americans comprising 67% of the population and 62% of Americans lacking a college degree, the Democrats will need to look beyond conventional politicians—those who twist and turn their positions to conform, always erring on the side of caution—to lead the fightback.</p>

<p>Yet, as we all know, Trump can be his own worst enemy. He is entirely transactional. For him, loyalty is always one-way. His insecurity prevents him from sharing the limelight with anyone else. His vanity leaves him vulnerable to manipulation. Not surprisingly, he is not the best judge of character, and his loyalists continue to cycle through a revolving door.</p>

<h2><strong>Team Trump, 2.0</strong></h2>

<p>The quote at the beginning of this column is from Kellyanne Conway, the Republican pollster who worked with Trump from 2013 and managed his 2016 campaign. She later joined the first Trump administration but left amid a public feud with her teenage daughter in August 2020, who lambasted her personally and politically and even threatened legal separation.</p>

<p>Conway is not the only person who was once with Trump but is no longer. Steve Bannon, Trump's chief ideologue and speechwriter, is not in the fold anymore. In his place is Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies. Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been replaced by Don Jr., who is now in charge of conducting the “loyalty test” for anyone seeking to join the administration. John Kelly, Trump's longest-serving Chief of Staff who called him a “fascist,” has been replaced by Susie Wiles, Trump's campaign manager. Wiles is known for her discipline and focus on facilitating whatever catches Trump's fancy. The big question is: how long will she last?</p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em>—which Trump both loathes and loves to read—has come in for criticism for suggesting that Trump will be a “lame duck” president, given that the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits a third presidential term. Critics accused the paper of sour grapes. However, in an unintended way, the paper has highlighted Trump's main dilemma: what legacy does he want to leave behind? He has mined the deep divide and distrust of Washington in US society to become the most dominant figure in American politics for the past decade. Does he now pivot to statesmanship and attempt to unite the country? Or does he pander to his MAGA base and give full rein to his thirst for revenge?</p>

<h2><strong>Rein Of Uncertainty</strong></h2>

<p>The early signs are ominous. Trump's nomination of the highly controversial Congressman Matt Gaetz, who is under investigation for ethics violations, as Attorney General has even alarmed <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. “He's a nominee for those who want the law used for political revenge, and it won't end well,” the paper warned.</p>

<p>Similarly, the case of <em>Fox News </em>host Pete Hegseth, who has been outspoken against the Pentagon's “woke” policies regarding racial and transgender equity, and the appointment of former Democratic presidential contender Tulsi Gabbard, now a Trump loyalist, as Director of National Intelligence, raise further concerns. Gabbard has shown no evidence of expertise in intelligence. No one should be surprised by this turn of events.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lankan President <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sri-lanka-election-results-president-anura-dissanayakes-national-peoples-power-party-wins-parliamentary-majority-7023890">Anura Kumara Dissanayake</a>'s leftist coalition, the National People's Power (NPP), secured a decisive victory in snap legislative elections, with voters rejecting establishment parties widely criticised for sparking an economic crisis. The election results, released Friday, showed overwhelming support for Mr Dissanayake's anti-corruption platform and promise to recover assets lost due to corruption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The self-avowed Marxist called for swift parliamentary polls to consolidate backing for his reform agenda. Friday results showed his decision paid off, with the NPP capturing at least 123 seats in the 225-member parliament, with projections suggesting further gains. Early tallies showed the NPP with 62 per cent of the vote, far ahead of opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party, which trailed with just 18 per cent.<br />
<br />
<strong>Here are some facts about Anura Kumara Dissanayake:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Anura Kumara Dissanayake was born on November 24, 1968, in Thambuththegama, Sri Lanka, into a working-class family. His father was a labourer, and his mother a housewife. Mr Dissanayake was involved in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party during his school years and was the first student from the college chosen for admission into the university.</li>
	<li>He studied at the University of Peradeniya before leaving due to threats during the political unrest of the 1987-1989 JVP insurrection. Mr Dissanayake later graduated from the University of Kelaniya with a degree in physical science in 1995.</li>
	<li>Mr Dissanayake rapidly rose through the ranks of the JVP. By 1995, he was appointed the National Organiser of the Socialist Students Association and joined the JVP's Central Working Committee. By 1998, he secured a position in the JVP's Politburo. This was significant as the JVP re-entered mainstream politics under Somawansa Amarasinghe, initially supporting President Chandrika Kumaratunga's government before eventually criticising it over various issues.</li>
	<li>In 2004, Mr Dissanayake was appointed as a cabinet minister in President Chandrika Kumaratunga's government. He handled portfolios like agriculture, livestock, land, and irrigation. A year later, Mr Dissanayake and other JVP ministers resigned in protest against a joint agreement between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE for tsunami relief coordination.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Dissanayake became the leader of the JVP in 2014, succeeding Somawansa Amarasinghe. He ran as the JVP's presidential candidate in 2019, securing third place with 3 per cent of the vote. He again announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential elections under the banner of the National People's Power (NPP), a leftist coalition he built. He made a remarkable comeback, winning 42.31 per cent of the vote in the first round and 55.89 per cent in the second round.</li>
	<li>Anura Kumara Dissanayake was inaugurated as president on September 23. He is a Marxist politician who made history by becoming the country's first president from a third party. He has been a vocal critic of Sri Lanka's economic policies, particularly those that he views as necessary to the country's working class. He strongly opposed the IMF's conditions for a $2.9 billion bailout, advocating for a renegotiation of terms, tax reductions like the Pay-As-You-Earn tax, and the elimination of VAT on essential goods.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Saudi capital Riyadh gets ready to host the Conference of the Parties (COP16) of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Dr Osama Faqeeha, Deputy Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, has praised India's efforts on combating land degradation and drought.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Faqeeha, who is also an advisor to the UNCCD COP16 Presidency, in an email interview, mentioned the "success stories" from Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. "For instance, in Rajasthan's Lapodia village, the revival of traditional water harvesting systems has not only raised water tables but also regenerated degraded grasslands, inspiring over 50 neighbouring villages to adopt similar practices," he said.</p>

<p>Lapodia village today stands out like a green oasis in Rajasthan. This village, with a little over 300 households is just two hours from state capital Jaipur, transformed itself into a drought-proof village mostly through the revival of traditional water-harvesting structures.</p>

<p>Highlighting another Indian success story, Dr Faqeeha spoke about "the remarkable transformation achieved by Renuka Bio Farms in Andhra Pradesh's Tirupati district". "It shows how combining traditional wisdom with modern techniques can convert barren wetland into thriving agro-ecological systems".</p>

<p>&nbsp;"These stories demonstrate the transformative power of local initiatives in combating land degradation. These initiatives exemplify exactly what we hope to showcase and amplify at COP16 in Riyadh - practical, community-driven solutions that can be adapted and replicated globally," he said.</p>

<p>Highlighting similarities between Saudi and Indian desert region of Rajasthan, the Saudi minister emphasised &nbsp;on creating natural opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The arid climate challenges we face in Saudi Arabia share many similarities with regions like Rajasthan. In Saudi Arabia we are focusing on utilizing renewable water resources, leveraging water conservation practices, and pursuing ambitious rural development programmes."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"Successful initiatives like the Ghandivan project in Jaipur, which has transformed barren wasteland into a thriving ecosystem through community-driven efforts, offer valuable insights that can be adapted across different regions."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He added that Riyadh will create platforms for sharing such experiences and best practices to benefit countries, regions, and the planet at COP16.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Saudi's primary goals for the presidency of COP16, Dr Faqeeha stated that the focused is on raising awareness of the impact of land degradation, drought, and desertification. "The scale of our challenge is stark: globally, we lose land equivalent to four football fields every second, amounting to 100 million hectares annually."</p>

<p>"COP16 in Riyadh represents a crucial turning point in our global response to land degradation and drought. By bringing together stakeholders from across sectors and generations, we will catalyse a new era of environmental action characterised by concrete commitments, innovative solutions, and meaningful collaboration."</p>

<p>The Conference of the Parties (COP16) of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will take place in Riyadh from 2 to 13 December 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost everyone in India is now vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, former chief scientist of the World Health Organisation Dr Soumya Swaminathan has said, underscoring the urgent need for cross-ministerial and international collaboration to address its effects on health, gender and economic stability in the country.</p>

<p>Swaminathan pointed to women and children as especially vulnerable to these climate-driven health risks.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI on the sidelines of global climate talks COP29 here in Azerbaijan's capital, Swaminathan called for a concerted approach, saying, "practically everyone in India is now vulnerable to climate change impacts, from extreme heat to vector-borne diseases. Addressing this requires close cooperation."</p>

<p>"We know that climate change has disproportionate impacts on women and children," she explained, noting how women, particularly in rural areas, face increased health risks due to continued reliance on solid fuels for cooking.</p>

<p>She emphasised that "access to clean energy for everyone is a priority."</p>

<p>This, she argued, would not only reduce health risks associated with indoor air pollution but also lessen India's carbon footprint, marking a crucial step toward sustainable development.</p>

<p>Climate-related health risks in India are varied, ranging from immediate effects such as respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, to long-term issues like malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural cycles.</p>

<p>Swaminathan noted that more than 80 per cent of India's population is now exposed to these risks, emphasizing that "everybody is now vulnerable," from rural farmers to urban migrants.</p>

<p>She highlighted the specific challenges faced by the urban poor, especially migrants who live in peri-urban areas with inadequate housing and sanitation, which exposes them to greater risks during floods and extreme weather events.</p>

<p>With health as a central theme, Swaminathan stressed the benefits of green public transportation, an initiative she described as a "win-win solution."</p>

<p>"Carbon-neutral public transport will not only reduce air pollution but also promote physical activity and thereby improve health," she said, adding that reducing pollution would positively impact public health by curbing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>She also highlighted that India's urban centres are hotspots for these health issues due to dense populations and high pollution levels.</p>

<p>Swaminathan called for policies that integrate both health and climate objectives, stressing that this approach can drive development while building resilience against climate risks.</p>

<p>"If we do that kind of analysis, we can invest in actions that promote both development and reduce our carbon footprint," she noted, advocating for policies that prioritise "development with a climate-resilient focus."</p>

<p>Examples of such integrated actions include promoting clean cooking fuels, improving access to safe drinking water, and investing in infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather.</p>

<p>Dr Swaminathan went further to advocate for a gendered approach to climate policy, urging policymakers to "put a spotlight on women but also the poorest communities."</p>

<p>She argued that gender equity and social equity are essential to effective climate policy, explaining that "by taking a gendered perspective in all policies, we can ensure more inclusive and effective climate action."</p>

<p>Swaminathan called for greater research on climate impacts that are gender-specific, noting that this data would help policymakers create more targeted, meaningful interventions.</p>

<p>The economic costs of climate-driven health impacts are also severe.</p>

<p>Swaminathan pointed to recent studies indicating that climate-related air pollution alone costs the global economy trillions of dollars annually, affecting productivity, agriculture, and even tourism.</p>

<p>"If you look at the GDP loss and workplace productivity lost due to air pollution, it's enormous - in the trillions," she said. This, she argued, makes climate action not just a moral imperative but an economic necessity.</p>

<p>Addressing air pollution as a cross-border issue, Swaminathan noted that pollution does not recognise borders, making it crucial for India and other nations to engage in global collaborations.</p>

<p>"Air pollution today is the single largest risk factor to health," she said, adding "It's not a problem one country can solve on its own."</p>

<p>She referenced the Our Common Air (OCA) Commission, a global effort she is part of, which has been working with international bodies like WHO and UNEP to promote global standards and monitoring mechanisms for air quality.</p>

<p>"We need a system where every country has air quality monitors and updates its data, including on super pollutants like methane and black carbon," Swaminathan said, adding that these pollutants are highly dangerous yet often overlooked.</p>

<p>Swaminathan further explained the value of local data, which she argued would give a more accurate picture of pollution's impact on different regions of India.</p>

<p>"Policymakers want to see data from their own regions; it makes the issue real for them and helps design local solutions," she said.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the invisible nature of pollution's health impacts, Swaminathan commented, "When the air pollution is visible, people recognize it as a problem, but often it's invisible, and people become accustomed to it."</p>

<p>She stressed that while death rates from pollution-related illnesses are often discussed, policymakers should focus on the widespread chronic illnesses caused by poor air quality.</p>

<p>"It's not only about death - it's about chronic ill health that impacts quality of life and productivity," she said, pointing out that young children and the elderly are especially vulnerable.</p>

<p>For Swaminathan, tackling climate change is fundamentally linked to India's development goals.</p>

<p>"For us, development is still a key priority," she asserted. While India has made strides in increasing access to electricity and clean water, she stressed that much work remains, especially in rural areas where communities lack basic infrastructure.</p>

<p>Her vision for India's climate adaptation involves not only mitigating health risks but also ensuring that development initiatives - from housing to sanitation - are climate-resilient.</p>

<p>Swaminathan expressed optimism about India's potential to lead in climate adaptation through innovation, global cooperation, and commitment to sustainable development goals.</p>

<p>She pointed to Indian cities as potential leaders in air quality initiatives and green infrastructure, stating that "India can be a model for sustainable urbanization if we prioritize both development and environmental health."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Aid Access, the leading supplier of abortion pills by mail in the US, received over 5,000 requests in less than 12 hours.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's been a massive rise in the demand for abortion pills in the United States after Donald Trump's re-election to the White House. It stems from fears that under Trump 2.0, the country may face unprecedented restrictions as far as reproductive care is concerned.</p>

<p>Aid Access, the leading supplier of abortion pills by mail in the US, received over 5,000 requests in less than 12 hours. “I can see all the new requests ticking in as we're talking,” founder Rebecca&nbsp;Gomperts told <a href="http://https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/abortion-pills-hormones-trump " rel="nofollow,noindex">the Guardian</a>. “We've never seen this before.”</p>

<p>For Ms Gomperts, this wave of demand was not unexpected. Aid Access has established a streamlined system where physicians in abortion-legal states prescribe and ship pills to those in states with bans. Still, the sheer volume on Wednesday was huge. “We have an extremely streamlined process... but it's much more [than usual],” Ms Gomperts remarked.</p>

<p>Similar trends were observed across the country. Telehealth services like Wisp saw a 300 per cent increase in requests for emergency contraception, while Plan C, an abortion pill finder site, experienced a 625 per cent surge in traffic. “People are trying to plan for the reproductive apocalypse that we anticipate will be happening under a Trump presidency,” said Elisa Wells, co-founder of Plan C.</p>

<p>Women's health providers also experienced a dramatic rise in demand for emergency contraception. Wisp tripled its daily sales of Plan B by mid-morning Wednesday, with bulk orders increasing from 30 per cent of monthly sales to nearly 90 per cent in a single day. Similarly, Winx, another telehealth service, reported selling six times more doses of Plan B by Wednesday afternoon than in the previous week.</p>

<p>Transgender healthcare providers also faced a deluge of requests. Dr Crystal Beal, founder of QueerDoc, received an influx of inquiries from trans patients worried about access to hormone therapy. QueerDoc received more patient messages in one day than it typically would in a week. “Some of it is ‘How can I safeguard my access to medication?'” Ms Beal shared, citing concerns about the potential rollback of trans healthcare rights under Trump's administration. QueerDoc is now advising patients to stockpile hormone medications within the bounds of state laws and insurance limits.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's stance on abortion has oscillated, but his judicial appointments have consistently called for abortion restrictions, particularly in conservative states. Despite his campaign promise not to impose a nationwide abortion ban, experts say there are indirect ways his administration could restrict access.</p>

<p>A focus is likely on abortion pills, which accounted for 63 per cent of abortions in 2023. Measures could include stricter FDA rules requiring in-person dispensing or legal challenges under the 1873 Comstock Act, which could target pill distribution.</p>

<p>Although state-level decisions remain important, Trump's previous stance and actions, like appointing justices to overturn Roe v Wade, are&nbsp;a cause of concern.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Musk said in the filing that the company "has attempted to starve competitors of AI talent by aggressively recruiting employees with offers of lavish compensation and is on track to spend $1.5 billion on personnel for just 1,500 employees."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk is ramping up his feud with Sam Altman, alleging in a court filing that OpenAI is trying to corner the market for generative artificial intelligence and sacrificing safety in a race to get ahead.</p>

<p>In a revised version of a lawsuit he filed in August, Musk highlighted antitrust concerns about OpenAI's journey from its nonprofit roots in 2015 - when he and Altman worked together as founders - to its current effort to restructure as a for-profit company following billions of dollars in outside investment by Microsoft and others.</p>

<p>Musk, who launched his xAI startup last year, said OpenAI has now abandoned all pretence of proceeding as a charity to benefit humanity with a focus on openness and safety as it tries to complete its restructuring under a two-year deadline.</p>

<p>"Microsoft and OpenAI, apparently unsatisfied with their monopoly, or near so, in generative artificial intelligence ("AI") are now actively trying to eliminate competitors, such as xAI, by extracting promises from investors not to fund them," lawyers for the billionaire wrote in the amended complaint filed late Thursday in federal court in Oakland, California.</p>

<p>OpenAI didn't immediately respond outside regular business hours to a request for comment. In October, it called Musk's federal suit - which followed a state-court suit that Musk dropped - the latest bid in an "increasingly blusterous campaign to harass OpenAI for his own competitive advantage."</p>

<p>The revised suit lists 26 legal claims and runs 107 pages, compared with 15 claims in the 83-page original complaint.</p>

<p>Thursday's filing adds California Attorney General Rob Bonta as a defendant. The company is in early talks with Bonta's office over the process to change its corporate structure, Bloomberg News reported this month.</p>

<p>Representatives of Bonta's office didn't immediately respond outside regular business hours to a request for comment.</p>

<p>To back up his claim that OpenAI is becoming more anticompetitive, Musk said in the filing that the company "has attempted to starve competitors of AI talent by aggressively recruiting employees with offers of lavish compensation and is on track to spend $1.5 billion on personnel for just 1,500 employees."</p>

<p>Musk also expressed concern that OpenAI has "started to contract with the Department of Defence" and removed a clause from its usage policies banning the use of its technology for "activity that has a high risk of physical harm" such as "weapons development" or "military and warfare."</p>

<p>According to the filing, "droves" of security researchers are resigning in protest, or being forced out, and safety teams have been dissolved, "all to make way for 'security' personnel whose real job is to facilitate military contracting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[55 small, rural escapes around the world, earned a spot in the 2024 edition of UN Tourisms "Best Tourism Villages."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a year of travel that was marked largely by overtourism protests in Barcelona, Oaxaca and Venice draws to a close, the appeal of offbeat vacations continues to grow.</p>

<p>To wit, consider these spots you've likely never heard of: secluded Graciosa Island on the Azores, the remote fishing village Roches Noires in northeastern Mauritius, or mountainous Wukirsari, Indonesia, 270 miles east of Jakarta. They're among the 55 small, rural escapes around the world that earned a spot in the 2024 edition of UN Tourism's “Best Tourism Villages.” The list of winning destinations, previewed exclusively by Bloomberg News, was released on Nov. 14 at the organization's Executive Council meeting in Cartagena, Colombia.</p>

<p>The initiative, started in 2021, aims to raise awareness of lesser-known places worth visiting—and also reward responsible tourism management. Put simply, these destinations are using visitation funds in a way that boosts their cultural practices, preserves biodiversity and improves quality of life for locals. Each village also counts fewer than 15,000 inhabitants and maintains traditional activities such as agriculture and fishing.</p>

<p>“The Best Tourism Villages initiative not only recognizes the remarkable achievements of these villages but also highlights the transformative power of tourism,” says UN Tourism Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili.</p>

<p>Among this year's worthy escapes are rural villages in Panama and Guatemala, two countries appearing on the list for the first time. Panama's historic northern port of Portobelo, for example, draws smaller crowds despite its tranquil Caribbean beaches and significant colonial past. But it also stood out because tourism there helps fund cultural heritage preservation activities for youth through the Bahía de Portobelo Foundation, as well as coral reef restoration projects.</p>

<p>Appearing on this coveted list can lead to increased visitation from higher-spending travelers, too. For instance, in Aragon, Spain, the village of Alquezar's mountain trekking, canyoning and hiking used to draw mostly visitors from France and Spain, but since its win in 2022, international visitors from Japan and China have vacationed there, according to Alquezar Mayor Ana Blasco Castillo. Sandra Carvao, who helps develop rural tourism as a director at UN Tourism, sees this as one of the major pluses of the Best Tourism Villages initiative, in addition to diverting travelers from major hot spots. “It's really to make sure that the sector can benefit places which wouldn't necessarily be top of your mind,” she says.</p>

<p>This year's winners were selected from 260 nominations that UN Tourism received from more than 60 member countries. We highlighted five that are easily accessible.</p>

<p><strong>Splugen, Switzerland</strong></p>

<p>Splugen, in the Swiss Alps near the Italian border, is smaller in size as a ski getaway than, say, the busier and glitzy St. Moritz just an hour-and-a-half scenic drive east. But that's exactly the draw: It's a quieter winter sports vacation destination that doubles as an under-the-radar spot in the spring and summer, with access to crystal clear lakes and Beverin Regional Nature Park. Splügen became part of this protected area in 2020, joining more than 10 communities living here who've committed to play a part in preserving it. Next year boutique property Speluca Brewery Hotel is set to open; its design makes use of formerly abandoned spaces on the village's outskirts, including an old barn and a former hotel from the 1960s, plus new structures that will reflect the village's traditional timber aesthetic. Splügen's communities want to attract more year-round visitors as well, whom they expect once the future Rheinwald Resort AG project is completed, featuring a mix of rooms and a campsite for long-term stays.</p>

<p><strong>San Rafael de la Laguna, Ecuador</strong></p>

<p>San Rafael de la Laguna serves as a reminder of Ecuador's outsize natural riches—sitting in the foothills of the Andes, just under a two-hour drive north of Quito. It's close to Imbakucha, or the lake of the gods, also commonly known as Lago San Pablo. You can hop on guided tours to spot herons and ducks from traditional boats made from totora reeds, a local aquatic plant growing abundantly in the area. Cycling enthusiasts will find routes that traverse the Otavalo Valley, and the village also celebrates vibrant Indigenous rooted festivals. The Pawkar Raymi marks the start of the agricultural season in early March, in alignment with the spring equinox, and the Inti Raymi celebrates the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. Expect plenty of community events for both, including traditional Andean music and dance. If you're more into hands-on experiences, craft workshops teach you to make baskets, trays and hats out of totora reeds.</p>

<p><strong>Gharb Suhayl, Egypt</strong></p>

<p>If you're set on visiting the Grand Egyptian Museum in 2025, it would be worth including a stop in Aswan, south of Giza. From there, hop on a 30-minute boat ride south to reach the peaceful, ancient Nubian village of Gharb Suhayl, set on the banks of the Nile. Beyond its brightly painted homes in blue, yellow and ocher, you'll find striking art murals, said to give the area the feel of a living outdoor museum. You're likely to be invited into a Nubian family's home to learn about the way of life, and you could also spend time shopping in souks for crafts, jewelry and spices. A handful of luxury tour operators, such as Black Tomato, offer stops in Aswan, continuing down the Nile to Abu Simbel.</p>

<p><strong>Pissouri, Cyprus</strong></p>

<p>On Cyprus' rugged southwestern coast, Pissouri offers a quieter alternative to resort town Limassol, which lies just a 30-minute drive east. You'll have your pick of outdoor activities in Pissouri, including the Cape Astrot hiking trail, tucked along gigantic rock formations, for jaw-dropping vistas over a turquoise bay and its pebble sand beach. The agricultural village's cobblestoned square is lined with local tavernas where you can dine on Cypriot meze—small plates of local cheeses, olives, seafood and grilled meats, as well as dips. For a deeper dive into Pissouri's heritage, get a guided tour at G Theophamous Winery on the history of Pissouri's Sultanina grape and winemaking traditions. To draw more visitors in the future, this small agricultural village is working on an accessible hiking trail for disabled travelers, as well as a House of Halloumi Museum— named after Cyprus' signature cheese—that will showcase this region's dairy products.</p>

<p><strong>Uaxactún, Guatemala</strong></p>

<p>Most people head to Tikal National Park and unknowingly bypass Uaxactún, an ancient Mayan historical site located just a 30-minute drive north. But it counts uncrowded forest trails where you can observe the area's temples, including a ceremonial complex, stelae and an astronomy observatory that the Maya once used to mark celestial events. Uaxactún was at its peak from 600 A.D. to 900 A.D., when it was an important center for art and astronomy. In March the eponymous village celebrates the spring equinox festival through sacred ceremonies at the site that include chants, fires and drumming. Inquire about a craftmaking workshop with local women's group Brisas de la Selva Maya, where you'll learn to make necklaces and bracelets from forest-sourced elements such as seeds, mushrooms and flowers.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Passengers will experience two sunrises on this record-breaking journey, made possible by specially designed Airbus A350 aircraft.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long-haul flights have become a common feature of contemporary travel, with trips lasting ten to fifteen hours now being accepted as normal. The 17-hour journey from Perth to London and well-known destinations like Dubai or New York for city vacations no longer seem unusual.</p>

<p>However, Australian airline Qantas, one of the leading airlines in the world, is trying to revolutionise long-haul air travel with its bold Project Sunrise, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/14/longest-flight-world-passengers-see-two-sunrises-set-take-off-2026-21992081/"><em>The Metro</em></a>. The airline plans to introduce nonstop flights from Sydney to London and New York, which will cover 19 to 22 hours of distance. These ultra-long-haul flights aim to reduce travel time by up to four hours compared to current options.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.qantas.com/au/en/about-us/our-company/fleet/new-fleet/project-sunrise.html">project </a>is named after the kind of experience that its passengers will have to undergo: that of seeing two sunrises in a row, breaking the world record of the longest commercial flight currently held by Singapore Airlines. It is this route from Singapore to New York, which was not met 18 hours long.</p>

<p>While saving time is appealing, spending nearly a full day in the air presents a significant challenge for travelers. Qantas initiated <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.qantas.com/au/en/about-us/our-company/fleet/new-fleet/project-sunrise.html">Project Sunrise</a> discussions in 2017, collaborating with Boeing and Airbus to develop ultra-long-range versions of their widebody aircraft.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges faced by the aviation industry in recent years, Qantas remains committed to pushing the boundaries of air travel. The first flights under Project Sunrise are expected to take off in 2026, marking a new milestone in aviation history.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2024/10/29/inside-project-sunrise-bold-qantas-plan-to-bring-australia-closer/"><em> Forbes,</em></a> Vanessa Hudson, who took over as Qantas CEO last fall, spoke at an event in a hangar at LAX to celebrate Qantas and the upcoming Project Sunrise non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York. She said that the project speaks to 'Australians hunger to fly point to point.' The upcoming long flights, she said, "are a great way for Australians to break out and see the world on the A350."</p>

<p>As a Qantas website put it, "Our fleet of specially designed Airbus A350s [will]overcome the tyranny of distance, with the ability to travel between Australia and almost any city in the world." Qantas is assuring potential flyers that research and design will make the flights comfortable and safe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three women formerly employed by Harrods have accused the brother of its late boss Mohamed Al-Fayed of sexual violence, following hundreds of similar claims against the former owner of the luxury London store, the BBC reported Thursday.</p>

<p>They say the late Salah Fayed assaulted them during the period when he jointly owned the department store with his brother, the broadcaster said.</p>

<p>The women alleged they were abused in London, the south of France and Monaco between 1989 and 1997.</p>

<p>The report follows a slew of claims in recent weeks by hundreds of women against the Egyptian former Harrods and Fulham Football Club owner Mohamed Al-Fayed of sexual assault including rape.</p>

<p>Salah Fayed died in 2010 and Mohamed Al-Fayed died last year aged 94.</p>

<p>One of the three women behind the most recent accusations, named Helen, who waived her right to anonymity, told the BBC that she had been working for the retailer for two years when Mohamed Al-Fayed raped her in 1989 during a business trip in Dubai.</p>

<p>He then offered her a personal assistant job with his brother Salah, who she said went on to drug her and rape her while she was unconscious.</p>

<p>Mohamed Al-Fayed "shared me with his brother," she said.</p>

<p>She said he had stayed silent about the experience, having signed a non-disclosure agreement, a document the BBC reported having seen.</p>

<p>The second woman said Salah Fayed abused her during a trip to Monaco, while the third woman, who was hired at the age of 19 in 1997, said she was sexually assaulted in his Monaco apartment.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, Harrods said it "supports the bravery of these women in coming forward" and encourages survivors "to come forward and make their claims" to the company, which is offering compensation and counselling support.</p>

<p>"We also hope that they are looking at every appropriate avenue to them in their pursuit of justice, whether that be Harrods, the police or the Fayed family and estate," the company said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the New York Times published the claims of a victim accusing another brother of Mohamed Al-Fayed, Ali, aged 80, of knowing about the "trafficking" of women.</p>

<p>Allegations have mounted since the airing of a BBC documentary in September that detailed multiple claims of rape and sexual assault by Mohamed Al-Fayed.</p>

<p>The Justice for Harrods Survivors group said it had received more than 420 inquiries, mainly related to the store but also regarding Fulham Football Club, the Ritz Hotel in Paris and other Fayed entities.</p>

<p>London's Metropolitan Police said earlier this month that it was "actively reviewing 21 allegations reported to the Metropolitan Police prior to Mohamed Al-Fayed's passing... to determine if any additional investigative steps are available or there are things we could have done better."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US overweight and obese population will rise significantly in the next quarter century if current trends continue, and new weight-loss treatments won't be sufficient to stem the tide, researchers said.</p>

<p>Nearly 260 million Americans will be overweight or obese by 2050, straining the health-care system and boosting medical costs, according to a study published Thursday in The Lancet medical journal. Rates among adult men will rise to 81% from 76% in 2021, and to 82% from 73% among women.</p>

<p>While medical institutions have been slow to recognize obesity as a disease, it raises the risk for a variety of dangerous, pervasive health outcomes, including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The success of weight-loss drugs shouldn't be allowed to overshadow the need for measures — such as promotion of healthy diet and exercise — that are crucial to slowing the growth of the crisis, said Marie Ng, a co-author of the study.</p>

<p>“All of these factors combined have contributed to the continuous rise in obesity prevalence over the past three decades,” said Ng, who's an affiliate associate professor at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. “If these drivers persist, the obesity crisis will likely continue to worsen.”</p>

<p>Obesity and overweight are both defined by body-mass index, a measure calculated using both height and weight. People with obesity are more severely affected than overweight people.</p>

<p>GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk A/S's Wegovy and Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Zepbound have been shown to help patients safely shed pounds while decreasing some associated health risks. Use of the drugs has been hampered by insufficient supplies and spotty insurance coverage, along with costs of about $1,000 a month for the injections.</p>

<p>“Equitable access is very important if we're to leverage this medication,” Ng said in an interview. Uncertainty remains about the implications of long-term use of the drugs in large populations, she said.</p>

<p>US obesity rates doubled over the three decades ending in 2021, fueled by factors such as growing availability of high-calorie foods, sedentary lifestyles and decreasing access to healthy foods, particularly in lower-income communities, Ng said. About one in five children and at least one in three adolescents are expected to be living with obesity in 2050, according to the study.</p>

<p>While Southern states are expected to remain among those most affected, the biggest gains in men by 2050 are expected in Colorado and New Mexico, and in Kansas and Colorado for women, according to the study. No particular region is exempt from the anticipated increases, Ng said.</p>

<p>Obesity is “an issue not just for one particular state,” she said, “but the whole nation.”</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's vision for education revolves around a single goal: to rid America's schools of perceived "wokeness" and "left-wing indoctrination".</p>

<p>The president-elect wants to keep transgender athletes out of girls' sports. He wants to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and structural racism. He wants to abolish diversity and inclusion offices.</p>

<p>Throughout his campaign, the Republican depicted schools as a political battleground to be won back from the left. Now that he's won the White House, he plans to use federal money as leverage to advance his vision of education across the nation.</p>

<p>Trump's education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.</p>

<p>On his first day in office, Trump has repeatedly said he will cut money to "any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children".</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Trump said he would "not give one penny" to schools with vaccine or mask requirements.</p>

<p>He said it would be done through executive action, though even some of his supporters say he lacks the authority to make such swift and sweeping changes.</p>

<p>Trump's opponents say his vision of America's schools is warped by politics - that the type of liberal indoctrination he rails against is a fiction. They say his proposals will undermine public education and hurt the students who need schools' services the most.</p>

<p>"It's fear-based, non-factual information, and I would call it propaganda," said Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president for Education Trust, a research and advocacy organization. "There is no evidence that students are being taught to question their sexuality in schools. There is no evidence that our American education system is full of maniacs."</p>

<p>Trump's platform calls for "massive funding preferences" for states and schools that end teacher tenure, enact universal school choice programmes and allow parents to elect school principals.</p>

<p>Perhaps his most ambitious promise is to shut down the US Education Department entirely, a goal of conservative politicians for decades, saying it has been infiltrated by "radicals".</p>

<p>America's public K-12 schools get about 14 per cent of their revenue from the federal government, mainly from programs targeting low-income students and special education. The vast majority of schools' money comes from local taxes and state governments.</p>

<p>Colleges rely more heavily on federal money, especially the grants and loans the government gives students to pay for tuition.</p>

<p>Trump's strongest tool to put schools' money on the line is his authority to enforce civil rights - the Education Department has the power to cut federal funding to schools and colleges that fail to follow civil rights laws.</p>

<p>The president can't immediately revoke money from large numbers of districts, but if he targets a few through civil rights inquiries, others are likely to fall in line, said Bob Eitel, president of the conservative Defence of Freedom Institute and an education official during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>That authority could be used to go after schools and colleges that have diversity and inclusion offices or those accused of antisemitism, Eitel said.</p>

<p>"This is not a Day One loss of funding," Eitel said, referencing Trump's campaign promise. "But at the end of the day, the president will get his way on this issue, because I do think that there are some real legal issues."</p>

<p>Trump also has hinted at potential legislation to deliver some of his promises, including fining universities over diversity initiatives.</p>

<p>To get colleges to shutter diversity programs - which Trump says amount to discrimination - he said he "will advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment".</p>

<p>His platform also calls for a new, free online university called the American Academy, to be paid for by "taxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments".</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump occasionally threatened to cut money from schools that defied him, including those slow to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic and colleges he accused of curbing free speech.</p>

<p>Most of the threats came to nothing, though he succeeded in getting Congress to add a tax on wealthy university endowments, and his Education Department made sweeping changes to rules around campus sexual assault.</p>

<p>Universities hope their relationship with the administration won't be as antagonistic as Trump's rhetoric suggests.</p>

<p>"Education has been an easy target during the campaign season," said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents. "But a partnership between higher education and the administration is going to be better for the country than an attack on education."</p>

<p>Trump's threats of severe penalties seem to contradict another of his education pillars - the extraction of the federal government from schools. In closing the Education Department, Trump said he would return "all education work and needs back to the states".</p>

<p>"We're going to end education coming out of Washington, DC," Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are "free from political meddling".</p>

<p>Rather than letting states and schools decide their stance on polarising issues, Trump is proposing blanket bans that align with his vision.</p>

<p>Taking a neutral stance and letting states decide wouldn't deliver Trump's campaign promises, said Max Eden, a senior fellow at AEI, a conservative think tank. For example, Trump plans to rescind guidance from President Joe Biden's administration that extended Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students. And Trump would go further, promising a nationwide ban on transgender women in women's sports.</p>

<p>"Trump ran on getting boys out of girls' sports. He didn't run on letting boys play in girls' sports in blue states if they want to," Eden said.</p>

<p>Trump also wants a say in school curriculum, vowing to fight for "patriotic" education. He promised to reinstate his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2021 to promote patriotic education. The panel created a report that called progressivism a "challenge to American principles" alongside fascism.</p>

<p>Adding to that effort, Trump is proposing a new credentialing body to certify teachers "who embrace patriotic values".</p>

<p>Few of his biggest education goals can be accomplished quickly, and many would require new action from Congress or federal processes that usually take months.</p>

<p>More immediately, he plans to nullify executive orders issued by Biden, including one promoting racial equity across the federal government. He's also expected to work quickly to revoke or rewrite Biden's Title IX rules, though finalizing those changes would require a lengthier rulemaking process.</p>

<p>Trump hasn't detailed his plans for student loans, though he has called Biden's cancellation proposals illegal and unfair.</p>

<p>Most of Biden's signature education initiatives have been paused by courts amid legal challenges, including a proposal for widespread loan cancellation and a more generous loan repayment plan. Those plans could be revoked or rewritten once Trump takes office.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Tesla showcased its Optimus humanoid robot, a Chinese company unveiled its new high-speed four-legged quadruped robot. Also known as robot wolves, it can easily jump, climb and back-flip through difficult terrain at fast speeds. Unlike its predecessors, the four-legged Lynx robot, introduced by Deep Robotics, moves around on all-terrain wheels instead of solid feet, giving the impression that its design was influenced by both conventional robotic mechanisms and quad bikes.</p>

<p>The company posted a video on its YouTube account, demonstrating the Lynx's capabilities, including its ability to traverse tough, rocky, and unstable terrain both uphill and downhill. The video shows the lynx climbing on a rock that is 80 cm above the ground and navigating up and downhill slopes at 50-degree inclines in a wooded environment.</p>

<p>"Teams working on emergency searches or for site exploration commonly face challenges such as insufficient site data and risks to their safety. That's where these robots can provide valuable assistance," said Wei Tang, head of algorithm engineering at Deep Robotics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company's flagship product series, comprising the X20 and X30 models, has been utilised in public rescue operations, exploration, and security inspection.</p>

<p>An experiment conducted in 2023 showed the X20 could perform search and inspection duties in challenging environments, including in the aftermath of an earthquake. The four-legged robots successfully retrieved explosive and combustible objects and rescued humans in simulated emergency search scenarios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The robot wolves were displayed at the China Airshow in Zhuhai. The robots were praised by onlookers, who even dubbed them the "Perfect Child of a Terminator."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US space agency NASA has partnered with Microsoft to develop an easier-to-access and user-friendly Artificial Intelligence-based chatbot that can help people decode scientific data about Earth.</p>

<p>The new Earth Copilot can answer people “through plain language queries” ranging from monitoring wildfires to tracking climate change -- transforming how people interact with Earth's data.</p>

<p>NASA IMPACT worked with Microsoft to Earth Copilot to simplify access to data and encourage a wider range of users to interact with its Earth Science data.</p>

<p>The AI model leverages Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and comes with advanced AI capabilities that will transform how people can search, discover and analyse NASA's complex geospatial data, which so far has been accessible only to a limited number of researchers and scientists.</p>

<p>“NASA's repository of geospatial data contains key insights on everything from climate and air quality to urban planning and disaster response -- but its scale and complexity make it difficult to parse. With Earth Copilot, they're making it easier than ever for anyone to access that data,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO at Microsoft, in a post on X.</p>

<p>Earth Copilot also democratises access to space-borne data, enabling users -- from researchers to climate scientists to teachers to policymakers -- to engage with NASA's science data.</p>

<p>Researchers can now spend less time on data retrieval and more on analysis and discovery. It can help climate scientists quickly access historical data to study trends, while agricultural experts can gain insights into soil moisture levels to improve crop management.</p>

<p>Educators and teachers can use real-world examples to engage students in Earth Science, and policymakers can leverage the data to make informed decisions on critical issues like climate change, urban development, and disaster preparedness.</p>

<p>“We've designed the system to handle complex queries and large datasets efficiently, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need without getting bogged down by technical complexities,” said Juan Carlos Lopez, former NASA engineer and current Azure Specialist at Microsoft.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US vice president Al Gore believes a second Donald Trump term in the White House may have little impact on the "momentum" of the world's fight against climate change.</p>

<p>The return of Trump, who has pledged to pull the United States from the Paris agreement for a second time, has cast a pall over UN COP29 climate talks in Baku this week.</p>

<p>But Gore echoed statements from President Joe Biden's climate team who sought to remind other countries that global action survived Trump's first presidency.</p>

<p>"We've been through this before," Gore told reporters Thursday ahead of Friday's release of the latest data findings from Climate TRACE, an independent tracker of global emissions he co-founded.</p>

<p>"He tried one time before and the world continued to reduce emissions even during his four years as president the last time," he said.</p>

<p>"There is so much more momentum that even a new Trump administration is not going to be able to slow it down much. I hope I'm right about that," he said.</p>

<p>The Nobel Peace Prize laureate said market forces were "giving us a tailwind", with renewable energy getting cheaper and increasingly used to generate electricity.</p>

<p>"Many people around the world are not simply waiting with bated breath to see what the United States is going to do, they're moving on their own," he said.</p>

<p>While a US retreat from its commitments "would not be a good thing", Gore said, "I think the progress is likely to continue, regardless."</p>

<p>Climate TRACE's new data showed Friday that greenhouse gas emissions rose 0.7 percent in 2023 and will likely increase by 0.48 percent this year.</p>

<p>The group, which uses artificial intelligence to analyse satellite images from around the planet, said it now has inventories for every state and province in the world as well as over 9,000 urban areas.</p>

<p><strong>'Petrostates have seized control'</strong></p>

<p>The former US vice president had singled out the emissions of the United Arab Emirates when he presented Climate TRACE data at last year's COP28 conference hosted by the oil power.</p>

<p>This year, Gore showed slides of the 200 largest emissions sites in COP29 host Azerbaijan, a country whose economy is highly dependent on oil and gas production and exports.</p>

<p>Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev hailed oil and gas as a "gift of God" when he addressed fellow leaders at COP29 on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"It's unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree," Gore said Thursday.</p>

<p>While the Dubai summit produced a global agreement on "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, the follow-up commitment "has been very weak" and the issue "is hardly even mentioned" at COP29, he said.</p>

<p>"I have to think that one of the reasons for that is that the petrostates have too much control over the process," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

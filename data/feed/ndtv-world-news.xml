       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prior to its relaunch as an electric-only brand, luxury car manufacturer Jaguar announced its 'new era ' by unveiling its new logo and branding. The new logo of the Tata Motors-owned British vehicle maker on Tuesday revealed a new bespoke logo, written as JaGUar, alongside a new prancing "leaper" cat design and marketing slogans like ‘delete ordinary', ‘live vivid' and ‘copy nothing'.</p>

<p>The new logo emphasized the brand's posh English pronunciation “Jag-you-are" instead of the American “Jag-wahr." The company said the new branding "seamlessly blended upper and lower case characters in visual harmony."</p>

<p>The 102-year-old luxury automaker announced its transition to electric vehicles in 2021. The brand is reportedly set to launch three new electric cars by 2026 after it took new cars off-sale over a year ago to focus on reinventing itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This is a reimagining that recaptures the essence of Jaguar, returning it to the values that once made it so loved, but making it relevant for a contemporary audience,” said Gerry McGovern, Jaguar Land Rover's chief creative officer, in a press release.</p>

<p>As per a report by Car and Driver, the pouncing cat logo called 'the Leaper', which has adorned Jaguar cars for decades, is being eliminated in favour of the badge.</p>

<p>Jaguar's Managing Director Rawdon Glover called the rebranding as the "biggest step change" in the company's history.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="1129" src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7264565952707497986" title="Embedded post" width="504"></iframe></p>

<p>"A new era begins for Jaguar. This is an incredibly exciting time for the whole team. To re-imagine such a globally renowned brand really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Today, Jaguar unveils its new brand identity, recapturing its ethos to "Copy Nothing" that can trace its roots back to the words of our founder, Sir William Lyons," he posted on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How the new branding will look on the cars will be unveiled at a Miami Art Week event on December 2.</p>

<p>"Watch out for the global unveiling of the first physical manifestation of our brand reinvention in Miami on December 2, where Jaguar will champion true originality, as a creator and advocate of artistic expression, in all its forms," Mr Glover said.</p>

<p>However, the social media reactions to the rebranding have not been very reassuring. Replying to the relaunch video posted by Jaguar on X, one internet user wrote: “Umm where are the cars in this ad? Is this for fashion?” To this, the brand replied, “Think of this as a declaration of intent.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another user wrote, "Jaguar took a year off for this? This is how companies fail." Replying to this, the brand said, "This is not the end. This is the new beginning."</p>

<p>Tesla chief Elon Musk also joined the cacophony to express his confusion over the rebranding and wrote: “Do you sell cars?” To this, Jaguar's official X account responded: "Yes. We'd love to show you. Join us for a cuppa in Miami on 2nd December?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as Google, the internet giant, stored the world's information, it kept a lid on its internal communications - telling employees to destroy messages and not use certain words - to avoid antitrust suits, claimed a report.</p>

<p>The company has been deploying such strategies since 2008, when it faced antitrust scrutiny over an advertising deal with its then-rival Yahoo and sent out a confidential memo to its employees, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/google-antitrust-employee-messages.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">New York Times report</a> said.</p>

<p>"Google said employees should refrain from speculation and sarcasm and think twice before writing one another about hot topics," said the report, adding that the employees were asked to not comment before they have "all the facts".</p>

<p>The technology, said the Times, was tweaked, too. "The setting for the company's instant messaging tool was changed to "off the record." An incautious phrase would be wiped the next day," it said.</p>

<p>"How Google developed this distrustful culture was pieced together from hundreds of documents and exhibits, as well as witness testimony, in three antitrust trials against the Silicon Valley company over the last year," said the report.</p>

<p>The testimony showed that Google took numerous steps to keep a lid on internal communication, it said.</p>

<p>"It encouraged employees to put 'attorney-client privileged' on documents and to always add a Google lawyer to the list of recipients, even if no legal questions were involved and the lawyer never responded," said the report.</p>

<p>Companies anticipating litigation are required to preserve documents, mandate the US laws. "But Google exempted instant messaging from automatic legal holds. If workers were involved in a lawsuit, it was up to them to turn their chat history on. From the evidence in the trials, few did," the report said.</p>

<p>Google has faced the broadest criticism for its actions, with the judges in all three antitrust cases chastising the company for its communications practices, said the report.</p>

<p>"Judge James Donato of the US District Court for the Northern District of California, who presided over the Epic (2020 Epic Games) case, said that there was 'an ingrained systemic culture of suppression of relevant evidence within Google' and that the company's behavior was 'a frontal assault on the fair administration of justice,'" the report said.</p>

<p>In another case involving the company's advertising technology, a district court judge in Virginia remarked that Google's document retention policies were designed in a way that an "awful lot of evidence has likely been destroyed".</p>

<p>Google produced 13 times as many emails as the average company per employee did before it was a decade old, Kent Walker, Google's top lawyer, testified in the Epic trial, said the report. Google felt overwhelmed, he said, and it was clear to the company that things would only become worse if changes weren't made, the report said quoting him.</p>

<p>The 2008 memo that said chat messages would be automatically purged was signed by Mr. Walker and Bill Coughran, an engineering executive.</p>

<p>Mr Walker, said the report, was asked to explain Google's behaviour to the judge. He denied that there was "a culture of concealment" but said one problem was Googlers unsure of the meaning of certain words, the report said.</p>

<p>"Last year, Google changed its procedures. The default became saving everything, including chats. Employees on litigation holds can no longer turn chat history off," the report said further.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A strike using US-made missiles has sparked concerns of a Russian retaliation that could expand the conflict's scope.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's recent strike inside Russia using US-made missiles has raised fears of Russian retaliation through "hybrid warfare." This strategy combines cyberattacks, sabotage, disinformation, and even physical violence to destabilise opponents, according to a report by The Guardian.</p>

<p>Hybrid warfare aims to cause disruption, interfere with military supplies, and put pressure on Ukraine's allies by blurring traditional battle lines. Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, emphasised how Moscow is increasingly using these strategies to escalate tensions from Ukraine to Europe and beyond.</p>

<p>The news report further mentions that in the past, Russia has been connected to sabotage attempts, election-related disinformation campaigns, and hacking campaigns. Cyberattacks from Estonia and drone-related arrests in Norway close to vital infrastructure are examples of incidents. Global security is complicated by hybrid warfare.</p>

<p>"What is new about attacks seen in recent years is their speed, scale and intensity, facilitated by rapid technological change and global interconnectivity," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_156338.htm">Nato said in June.</a> "Counter-hybrid support teams" would provide assistance, but it was primarily up to individual countries to protect themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Emerging Signs of Hybrid Warfare in the North and Baltic Seas</strong></p>

<p>In April, Estonia and other Baltic states warned that widespread GPS jamming increased the threat of an aviation accident. The disturbance to location services was blamed on Russian "hybrid activity" in the region, Estonia said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The disruption led Finnish carrier Finnair to suspend flights to the Estonian city of Tartu, near the Russian border.&nbsp;The airline's pilots had noticed an increase in interference since 2022, including the airspace close to Russia's Kaliningrad region on the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p><strong>Border trouble</strong></p>

<p>Russia has also created alarm by starting disputes over borders in the Baltic Sea. Moscow published a resolution this year which showed it planned to unilaterally change its maritime frontiers with Finland and Lithuania from 2025.</p>

<p>Russian border guards in May removed buoys from the Narva River which showed the border with Estonia, officials in Tallinn said. The disappearance of the markers was part of a "broader pattern" by Moscow to use "tools related to the border to create fear and anxiety", Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said.<br />

<p>Among the mourners at the private service at St Mary's Church in Amersham, just outside London, were Payne's former bandmates Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson.</p>

<p>Payne was found dead on October 16 after falling from the balcony of his third-floor room at the Casa Sur Hotel in the Argentinian capital. He died from "multiple traumas" and "internal and external haemorrhaging", a post-mortem examination found. Investigators have said he was alone at the time of his death and appeared to have been "going through an episode of substance abuse".</p>

<p>In a short statement following his death, Payne's family said: "We are heartbroken. Liam will forever live in our hearts and we'll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul."</p>

<p>One Direction said they had been "completely devastated" by his death.</p>

<p>Payne was born and raised in Wolverhampton, in central England. He is survived by his parents, two sisters and a son with Cheryl Tweedy. He shot to stardom as a teenager alongside Mr Styles, Mr Horan, Mr Tomlinson and Mr Malik after they formed the band 'One Direction' on the hit UK talent show "The X Factor" 14 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>After forming in 2010, the band went on to release an album of radio-ready songs each year in time for the holiday shopping season and became one of the highest-grossing live acts in the world. In 2016, after Mr Malik left, the group said it was on an indefinite hiatus but not splitting up.</p>

<p>Payne's first solo single "Strip That Down" peaked at number three on the UK charts and number 10 on the US Billboard top songs list. His last solo work, a single called "Teardrops", was released in March, with a second album promised at the time.</p>

<p>In recent years he had spoken publicly about struggles with substance abuse and coping with fame from an early age.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India and Guyana on Wednesday agreed to ramp up cooperation in areas of defence, trade, energy, pharmaceutical and agriculture as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Guyanese President Mohamed Irfaan Ali held extensive bilateral talks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and Guyana on Wednesday firmed up 10 agreements to shore up cooperation in a range of key sectors such as hydrocarbons, digital payment systems, pharmaceutical and defence following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Guyanese President Mohamed Irfaan Ali.</p>

<p>In his media statement, PM Modi said Guyana will play an important role in India's energy security and a blueprint for long-term partnership in the sector will be prepared.</p>

<p>"The visit of an Indian Prime Minister to Guyana after 56 years is an important milestone in our relations. I have had a deep personal bond with Guyana," he said while recalling his visit as a common citizen to the South American country about 24 years back.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister arrived here last night from the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, where he attended the G20 summit.</p>

<p>One of the MoUs will provide for the possibility for deployment of India's UPI (Unified Payments Interface)&nbsp; digital payments system in Guyana.</p>

<p>"In today's meeting, we have identified many new initiatives to strengthen our cooperation. We will continue to make efforts to increase our mutual trade and economic cooperation," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India will continue to contribute to the capacity building of Guyana's military through scholarships and training.</p>

<p>"Close cooperation in the field of defence is a symbol of our deep mutual trust. I am happy that this year India has supplied two Dornier aircraft to Guyana," he said.</p>

<p>The agreements signed between the two sides will provide for cooperation in a vast range of areas, including hydrocarbons, agriculture, medicines, digital payment systems, culture and digital transformation.</p>

<p>In his remarks, PM Modi said India has made a significant contribution to the skill development and capacity building of the people of Guyana as per their needs.</p>

<p>The two sides also agreed to expand cooperation in the agriculture sector.</p>

<p>"With the millet seeds provided by India last year, we were able to contribute to increasing the food security of Guyana as well as the entire region," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>"Similarly, we will also cooperate in increasing the cultivation of rice milling, sugarcane, corn, soya and other crops," he said.</p>

<p>In the talks, the Indian side also agreed to set up a Jan Aushadhi Kendra in Guyana.</p>

<p>"Along with increasing pharma exports, we will also work on building Jan Aushadhi Kendra in Guyana. India has been contributing as a reliable partner in the infrastructure development of Guyana," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>The two leaders also deliberated on regional and global issues.</p>

<p>"We also discussed many global and regional issues. India and Guyana agree that all problems should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>"We are unanimous that reform in global institutions is the need of the hour. Climate Justice is a priority issue for both of us. We will continue to work together on all issues," he said.</p>

<p>On his part, President Ali said PM Modi's visit to Guyana represents a significant milestone in enhancing cooperation between the two nations.</p>

<p>He praised Prime Minister Modi, calling him a 'champion among leaders' for his impactful leadership and contribution to the developing world.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Prime Minister Modi. It is our greatest honour to have you here. You are a champion among leaders. You have led incredibly," President Ali said during a joint press statement with PM Modi.</p>

<p>He lauded PM Modi's governance style, noting its relevance and adoption in Guyana and other nations.</p>

<p>"You have shown the light to the developing world, and you have created development metrics and a framework that many are adopting in their own country. And much of it is relevant to us here in Guyana," he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[London has topped a definitive ranking of the World's Best Cities 2025 released on Wednesday for the tenth year in a row, even as Indian cities failed to make the cut based on the criteria of perception and perception.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>London has topped a definitive ranking of the World's Best Cities 2025 released on Wednesday for the tenth year in a row, followed closely by New York and Paris, even as Indian cities failed to make the cut based on the criteria of perception and performance.</p>

<p>The annual rankings produced by Resonance Consultancy in partnership with Ipsos are an analysis of large urban regions around the world that are leading in aspects most important to attracting workforce, visitors, and businesses.</p>

<p>The 2025 report marks a first in incorporating perception-based data by surveying more than 22,000 people in 31 countries for the first time - the results of which also demonstrate that people all over the world still very much aspire to live, visit, and work in the world's largest cities.</p>

<p>"Mumbai and Delhi are just outside of the top 100; those cities in the Asia Pacific context are in the top but at a global scale don't make the top 100," Chris Fair, President &amp; CEO of Resonance Consultancy, told PTI in response to a question at the launch of the report in London.</p>

<p>"Mumbai and Delhi have some particular strengths, but they have some particular weaknesses from a livability perspective relative to these other cities and a livability perspective as well. But in our Asia-Pacific report in February, they are in the top 20," he said.</p>

<p>The World's Best Cities ranking is drawn up on "livability", or the physical sense of a city based on the quality of its natural and built environments; "lovability", or the quality of life in terms of culture, dining and nightlife; and "prosperity", or the human capital of a city and the support it receives to thrive. The goal is to create the most comprehensive and holistic approach to measuring and benchmarking both the perception and performance of the cities.</p>

<p>"London continues to set the bar for what a truly great city should be," said Laura Citron, CEO of London &amp; Partners, the UK capital's growth agency.</p>

<p>"Our iconic attractions, world-class financial sector, and fast-growing tech industry are proof of our city's strength. But it's the diversity of our people and ideas that drives the innovation, opportunities, and progress that shape our future. No city embodies this quite like London," she said.</p>

<p>After London (UK), New York (US), Paris (France), Tokyo (Japan), Singapore, Rome (Italy), Madrid (Spain), Barcelona (Spain), Berlin (Germany) and Sydney (Australia) complete the top 10.</p>

<p>While the United States is in the lead with 36 cities in the Top 100, Canada comes in a distant second with six cities and Cape Town and Rio de Janeiro make a mark as new entrants to the 2025 ranking.</p>

<p>"The phrase 'perception is reality' is often used when developing reputation management strategies for companies, but the same holds true for destinations. By merging the top-of-mind destinations where people tell us they want to live, work, and visit with the rigorous evaluation of places that Resonance has been conducting for nearly a decade, we have created a more comprehensive evaluation of cities and can better advise destinations on how to strengthen their reputation," said Jason McGrath, Executive Vice President at Ipsos.</p>

<p>The overall World's Best Cities rankings are determined by analysing public perception, combined with a wide range of factors that have demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with attracting prime-age population (aged 25-44), visitor expenditure, and/or business formation. The key takeaway from the latest analysis is the strength and resilience of some of the world's large cities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>KP law, the firm representing about 2,000 claimants, said "women who have been diagnosed with life-changing and life-limiting cancers were exposed to asbestos contained within the company's talcum powder".</p>

<p>In response Erik Haas, J&amp;J's worldwide vice president of litigation, said "Johnson &amp; Johnson takes the issue of talc safety incredibly seriously and always has".</p>

<p>Haas added that J&amp;J's own analysis found an absence of asbestos contamination in its products and said "independent science makes clear that talc is not associated with the risk of ovarian cancer nor mesothelioma".</p>

<p>J&amp;J has until the end of the year to respond to a letter sent on behalf of KP Law's clients, following which documents will be filed in the UK's High Court.</p>

<p>The law firm is representing predominantly women regarding the case, and says it has been contacted by thousands more, adding that some have died of their cancers.</p>

<p>Lawyers claim that the US-based corporation knew "as early as the 1970s that asbestos in its talc products was dangerous but failed to warn consumers and carried on producing and selling the products in the UK until as recently as 2022".</p>

<p>J&amp;J said that Kenvue, its former consumer-health division that it separated out in 2023, is responsible for "any alleged talc liability that arises outside the US or Canada".</p>

<p>Kenvue did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP . &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>SETTLED CLAIMS</strong></h2>

<p>However, in September, J&amp;J increased its offer to settle talc claims relating to ovarian cancer in the US to around $8 billion to be paid over 25 years.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the company agreed to pay $700 million to settle allegations it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based power products in North America.</p>

<p>The company did not admit wrongdoing in its settlement but withdrew the product from the North American market in 2020.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization's cancer agency in July classified talc as "probably carcinogenic" for humans.</p>

<p>A summary of studies published in 2020 covering 250,000 women in the United States did not find a statistical link between the use of talc on the genitals and the risk of ovarian cancer.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council push to call for a ceasefire in Gaza that Washington said would have emboldened Hamas.</p>

<p>The resolution demanded "an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire" in the war between Israel and the Palestinian group, along with "the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages."</p>

<p>But the wording angered Israel, with a senior US official warning ahead of the vote that the resolution had "the potential only to buoy Hamas, which will have no reason to come to the negotiating table."</p>

<p>Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon said "The resolution being considered by the Security Council today is nothing short of a betrayal."</p>

<p>"For us, it has to be a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages," said Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the United Nations. "It has been our principal position from the beginning and it still remains."</p>

<p>The war was triggered by the assault on Israel by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, a stunning cross-border raid that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death toll from the resulting war had reached 43,985 people, the majority civilians. The United Nations considers the figures reliable.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized during the October 7 attack, 97 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Almost all of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war, which has caused a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

<p><strong>- Gaza 'will haunt' -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Since the beginning of the conflict, the Security Council has struggled to speak with one voice, as the United States used its veto power several times, although Russia and China have as well.</p>

<p>"China kept demanding 'stronger language'," said the US official who also claimed that Russia had been "pulling strings" with the countries responsible for pushing the latest resolution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The few resolutions that the United States did allow to pass by abstaining stopped short of calling for an unconditional and permanent ceasefire.</p>

<p>In March, the council called for a temporary ceasefire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, but this appeal was ignored by the warring parties.</p>

<p>And in June, the 15-member body pledged support for a US resolution that laid out a multi-stage ceasefire and hostage release plan that ultimately went nowhere.</p>

<p>"We regret that the Council could have incorporated compromise language the UK put forward to bridge the existing gaps... With that language, This resolution should have been adopted," Wood, the US envoy, said following the vote.</p>

<p>Some diplomats have expressed optimism that following Donald Trump's election win on November 5, President Joe Biden might be more flexible in his few remaining weeks in power.</p>

<p>They hoped for a repeat of December 2016 when then-president Barack Obama's second term was finishing and the council passed a resolution calling for a halt to Israeli settlement building in the occupied territories, a first since 1979.</p>

<p>The United States refrained from using its veto then, a break from traditional US support for Israel on the sensitive issue of settlements.</p>

<p>The resolution vetoed on Wednesday calls for "safe and unhindered entry of humanitarian assistance at scale," including in besieged northern Gaza, and denounces any attempt to starve the Palestinians.</p>

<p>The Palestinian delegation at the United Nations has suggested the text did not go far enough.</p>

<p>"Gaza's fate will haunt the world for generations to come," Ambassador Riyad Mansour warned.</p>

<p>He said the only course of action for the Security Council is to call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire under Chapter 7 of the UN charter.</p>

<p>That chapter allows the council to take steps to enforce its resolutions, such as sanctions, but the latest text made no reference to this option.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's armed forces fired British cruise missiles at military targets inside Russia for the first time, a Western official familiar with the matter said, as the 1,000-day conflict enters a new phase.</p>

<p>The UK approved the use of Storm Shadow missiles in response to Russia deploying North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine, a move the British government considered to be an escalation, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue dominated the Group of 20 leaders' summit in Brazil this week after US President Joe Biden gave the go-ahead for Ukraine to fire long-range ATACMS missiles at Russian targets. But Starmer didn't publicly back the move, despite long being seen as an advocate, leading to questions about whether his government would allow the use of British-made Storm Shadows.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has long called for Western governments to bolster military support, including allowing the use of long-range missiles to hit targets in Russia that are crucial to Vladimir Putin's war effort.</p>

<p>Storm Shadow debris was found in Russia's Kursk region to the north of Ukraine and two missiles were intercepted over Yeysk, a Black Sea port in the southern Krasnodar region, according to the Telegram channel Rybar, which has connections to the army and more than 1.3 million subscribers. The information couldn't be independently verified.</p>

<p>US Treasuries pared declines after the latest missile launch was announced.</p>

<p>It comes a day after the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine had used Western-supplied ATACMS for the first time to strike a military facility inside Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Wednesday that the agency did not consider Iran's Parchin site "a nuclear facility" after Israel claimed it hit Tehran's nuclear programme in a strike last month.</p>

<p>"We don't have any information that would confirm (the) presence of nuclear material" in Parchin, even though the site "could have been involved in the past in some activities," Grossi told reporters&nbsp;in Vienna.</p>

<p>"But as far as the IAEA is concerned, we do not see this as a nuclear facility," he said.</p>

<p>"I leave it to those military decision makers to judge and characterise places," he added.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel's late October attack on Iran damaged "a component" of the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Image Posted On X By @TheGoodISIS" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/famt62ko_iran-top-secret-nuclear-site-parchin-taleghan-twitter_625x300_20_November_24.jpg" title="Image Posted On X By @TheGoodISIS" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>Image Posted On X By @TheGoodISIS</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>"It has been published that a certain component of their nuclear programme was hit in this attack," Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament.</p>

<p>"The programme itself and its ability to operate here have not yet been thwarted," he added.</p>

<p>US news portal Axios reported that the attack on Iran had "destroyed an active<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israeli-military-destroys-top-secret-iranian-nuclear-weapons-lab-report-7033453" target="_blank"> top secret nuclear weapons research facility</a> in Parchin", quoting unidentified US and Israeli officials.</p>

<p>The site is some 50 kilometres (31 miles) southeast of Tehran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly accused Iran of wanting to acquire an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has denied.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice (DoJ) reportedly wants the court to order Alphabet Inc. to sell off the Chrome browser to dismantle the monopoly Google has over the internet search market and related advertising.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet Inc.'s Google might have to sell Chrome, the world's most widely used browser. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) reportedly wants the court to order Alphabet Inc. to sell off the browser to dismantle the monopoly Google has over the internet search market and related advertising. Google, meanwhile, said that if it is forced to sell Chrome, the move would harm its consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, the Department of Justice filed papers in the court saying it was considering enforcing "structural remedies" to prevent Google from using some of its products. On Wednesday, the antitrust enforcers will propose the measure to a judge, according to a report by Bloomberg.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chrome holds almost 90 per cent share of the global search engine market as of October, according to StatCounter. Moreover, it controls about 61 per cent of the US market.</p>

<h2><strong>Case Against Google's Monopoly</strong></h2>

<p>The DoJ brought the case against Google during US president-elect Donald Trump's first four-year term. In a landmark ruling in August, Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google operates an online search monopoly and has been considering what remedies or penalties to impose.</p>

<p>Since then, prosecutors have suggested several potential ways forward in the case, including ending billions of dollars with exclusive agreements that Google has with Apple and other companies to remain the default search engine on their tablets and smartphones, and divesting parts of its business, such as its Android operating system.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the DoJ is likely to go ahead with several of those proposals, including one that requires Google to divest its Chrome browser. The antitrust officials, along with states that have joined the case, are also planning to recommend that federal judge Amit Mehta impose data licensing requirements on Google, the Bloomberg reported quoting sources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Should a sale proceed, Chrome would be worth "at least USD 15 - USD 20 billion, given it has over 3 billion monthly active users," according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mercury.bloomberg.com/news/SN5JQ9DWRGG000" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Bloomberg </a>Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Google's Response</strong></h3>

<p>Google has called the proposal 'radical' and said it would harm its consumers and businesses in the US and also shake American competitiveness in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Previously, the company has denied operating a monopoly in the online search market. Responding to the DoJ's filing in October, Google has said that "splitting off" parts of its business like Chrome or Android would "break them".</p>

<p>"Breaking them off would change their business models, raise the cost of devices, and undermine Android and Google Play in their robust competition with Apple's iPhone and App Store," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4g193qezno" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">BBC </a>quoted the company as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, Google is reportedly planning an appeal after US District Judge Amit Mehta makes his final ruling by August 2025. The company will have a chance to make its proposal in December.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[During his presidential election campaign, Trump proposed a 60 per cent tariff on goods from China -- and a tariff of up to 20 per cent on every other US import.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China is trying to improve ties with India in an attempt to ease pressure from the incoming Trump administration, the head of a top India-centric US business advocacy and strategic group said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>During his presidential election campaign, Trump proposed a 60 per cent tariff on goods from China -- and a tariff of up to 20 per cent on every other US import.</p>

<p>Mukesh Aghi, president of the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), said: "So, we are seeing an early impact of the Trump administration coming in that has created pressure on China to ease dealing with India. So that's why border patrolling has been agreed upon. Direct flights have been agreed upon."</p>

<p>"They will also issue more visas to Chinese coming to India. You are seeing the impact of Trump coming in having a positive impact on the India-China relationship," he further said.</p>

<p>Last month, India announced that it had reached an agreement with China on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, in a breakthrough in ending the over four-year-long military standoff.</p>

<p>"The calculation on the part of the Chinese was that Trump was coming in. The relationship with the US will get stressful. So, why have multiple fronts of this stressful relationship? 'Let's at least ease the partnership or potential relationship with India itself'," Aghi told PTI in an interview.</p>

<p>India is likely to play an important role in Trump's "America First" policy by offering a place for secure sourcing while the new administration plans to move manufacturing away from China and create jobs in the US, he added.</p>

<p>"Efforts by the Trump administration to put in tariffs so it can put pressure on companies to move manufacturing back to the US, it's not going to happen overnight. It took almost 40 years for manufacturing to move out of the US. The challenge we have is we don't have enough skills. We don't have enough manpower to help us from that perspective. So, the transition will take time," Aghi said.</p>

<p>"That's where India can play a pivotal role by saying, 'Yes, we'll help you move manufacturing back to the US but we will also manufacture a lot of these components in India' and they become part of the global supply chain. It helps you because you're not dependent geopolitically on a risk factor in China but you depend on a friend. I see the concept of secure sourcing becoming much more pivotal and stronger than outsourcing or friend-shoring itself," the USISPF boss added.</p>

<p>"You will see India's role becoming much more pivotal as you look at building America first. At the same time, Atmanirbhar Bharat also within that supply chain becomes very critical," he said.</p>

<p>Aghi also claimed that corporate America was "very happy" with the election results.</p>

<p>"They feel Trump understands how challenging it is to run and grow businesses. He will hopefully bring the taxes down for corporations, which will help them to become much more profitable and grow the business itself. The corporate community welcomes the new administration, which is the Trump administration," he said.</p>

<p>"The market has gone up. What's interesting is also that the dollar has become stronger. That shows the confidence in the incoming administration by corporate America," Aghi said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on the impact of the elections on the India-US relationship, the business leader said it was not just dependent on administrations.</p>

<p>"It is dependent on the geopolitical alignment between the two countries. It's dependent on economics. It's dependent on trade. It's dependent on people to people. When you look at geopolitics, India-US is aligned, especially with China itself," he said.</p>

<p>"We are seeing a tremendous amount of activities taking place between the two countries, under the umbrella of Quad with Japan and Australia. On the trade side, you have USD 200 billion in trade, which is expected to keep growing. On the technology side, what we're seeing is Indians are building a lot of US technology in India itself. The global capability centres are generating a substantial amount of IP (intellectual property) for US companies," said the USISPF chief.</p>

<p>Aghi also said the five million Indian-Americans generated almost 6 per cent of the US's GDP while only being 1 per cent of the population.</p>

<p>"The Trump administration will come in looking at how you create jobs in the US. That's where India has to play a very strong role by saying, 'Yes, we will support the US plus one strategy'. Will that interfere with India's strategy of Atmanirbhar Bharat? No. I think both can coexist and support each other for mutual success," he noted.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Titled "Basic Principles of State Policy on Nuclear Deterrence", Vladimir Putin approved changes to the nuclear doctrine on Tuesday, chilling rules by which the country would now use its atomic arsenal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The big change in the doctrine now says that an attack from a non-nuclear state backed by a nuclear state will be viewed by Russia as a joint attack on it.</p>

<p>Although the new changes were proposed in September, the document was approved only on Tuesday - which was coincidentally the 1,000th day of the Russo-Ukrainian War.</p>

<p>This development took place after the Biden administration had made a significant policy change, allowing Ukraine to use US-made ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time.</p>

<p>This decision came just two months before President Joe Biden hands over power to Donald Trump, who has expressed scepticism about US military aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Now, even a large attack with missiles, drones or aircraft could be met with a nuclear response. The nuclear doctrine will also be extended to Russia's close ally Belarus.</p>

<p>Moreover, any attack from a state which is a member of a coalition would be seen as aggression from the entire group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons earlier, Ukraine has dismissed it as "nuclear sabre-rattling" to discourage its allies from providing support.</p>

<p>However, Sergey Lavrov, Russia's Foreign Minister has said that "we strongly are in favour of doing everything to not allow nuclear war to happen".</p>

<p>Russia has signed a declaration at the G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro along with the other countries, about which Lavrov said, "clearly said we want to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons".</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that the doctrine should go through a "deep analysis" and that it is a "very important text".</p>

<p>On the other hand, Matthew Miller said, "I'm unfortunately not surprised by the comments the Kremlin has made around the publication of this new, revised document," and that since the start of the war, Russia has tried to "coerce and intimidate both Ukraine and other countries around the world through irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behaviour."</p>

<p>Tatiana Stanovaya, a political scientist, of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center, said, "the current situation offers Putin a significant temptation to escalate" and that Putin offers the West two choices "'Do you want a nuclear war? You will have it,' or 'Let's end this war on Russia's terms,'" she posted on X.<br />

<p>The US president-elect, Donald Trump, recently appointed tech billionaire Elon Musk and biotech investor Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the new DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) in his second administration.</p>

<p>On their selection, Trump said that the “two wonderful Americans” shall “dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies” through the newly formed department. However, Trump made it clear that the pair would act in an advisory capacity and that the DOGE would not be an official government department.</p>

<p>With this announcement, Trump created a seemingly important role for his ‘buddy' Musk, who supported him with his time and money during the presidential campaign. Ramaswamy ran as a Republican candidate for President earlier this year against Trump, before dropping out and endorsing him. Since his re-election, Trump has been busy naming his core team with his loyalists, overriding concerns about impartiality and conflicting interests.</p>

<p>Both Musk and Ramaswamy have companies with ongoing government contracts. Even as advisors, they will have occasions to further their business interests directly or indirectly, and this will not attract US government conflict of interest laws.</p>

<p>Both Republican and Democratic presidents have in the past adopted different approaches to make the government efficient and to cut spending. In fact, a similar attempt was made in Trump 1.0, with the OAI (Office of American Innovation) set up under his son-in-law Jared Kushner to “make government operate like a business”. However, the OAI saw little success.</p>

<h2><strong>What Exactly Is DOGE?</strong></h2>

<p>The concept of DOGE was suggested by Trump in early September during the election campaign. At one of the meetings, Trump said that in 2022, “fraud and improper payments alone cost taxpayers an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars”. Then, just days after his win, Trump declared that Musk and Ramaswamy would work with the White House and Office of Management &amp; Budget to tackle "massive waste and fraud" in $6.5 trillion of annual government spending.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the official composition and functioning of the newly announced DOGE, or about its funding. Since it won't be a government department, it will not require the US Congress's approval for its creation.</p>

<p>Trump expects Musk and Ramaswamy's work to conclude by no later than July 4, 2026, which will also be the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. On November 14, an X account for DOGE said that the group was ‘‘accepting resumes from super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting". In a separate post, Musk said "compensation is zero”.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why Many Are Sceptical</strong></h2>

<p>The eventual goal of DOGE is to rationalise federal operations and cut significant government spending by at least $2 trillion, which would mean substantial reductions across all programmes, including essential services like Social Security and Medicare, potentially antagonising millions of voters. However, experts are sceptical about DOGE's success.</p>

<p>“The chances of DOGE succeeding are slim because of several reasons. The bureaucracy is too entrenched for any major gains in reducing the federal workforce; in any case, their salaries are a very small part of the budget,” says Uma Purushothaman, Associate Professor, US Studies, School of International Studies, JNU. DOGE can provide recommendations to the White House but actually lacks direct authority to make spending cuts or regulatory changes. “The US Constitution gives Congress 'the power of the purse'. This means that any change or reduction in allocation will have to go through Congress, where Trump has a very slim majority,” says Purushothaman. “And it is quite possible that some Republicans in both houses might not want to support some of these reforms,” she adds.</p>

<h2><strong>Castles In The Air?</strong></h2>

<p>Instead of comparing the DOGE experiment with other past presidents' similar initiatives that were largely unsuccessful, it would be better to compare it with the OAI conceived during Trump's first term.</p>

<p>The OAI was a part of the White House office lasting from 2017 until 2021. Under the leadership of Kushner, the group was to be the link between the American technology industry and the Trump administration. It was supposed to reform the federal bureaucracy with “new thinking and real change” to tackle the country's hardest problems. From workforce shortages and infrastructure challenges to reforming prisons and addressing the opioid crisis, the tasks were enormous.</p>

<p>However, other than carrying out IT modernisation in the government and organising the CEO summit, attended by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, IBM's Ginni Rometty and more, there isn't much to report about it. The OAI definitely received flak for influencing Trump's government policies. The office was silently closed during the transition after President Joe Biden took charge in 2021. Would DOGE meet the same fate?</p>

<p>“The DOGE's aims are too ambitious, whether in terms of money or time. It is unlikely that DOGE will succeed at this scale or within this time frame. Yes, it will probably suffer the same fate as the Office of American Innovation, especially if the next administration is a Democratic one,” says Purushothaman.</p>

<p>The DOGE epitomises yet another exploratory method of governance in the US – one where businessmen would apply their corporate experiences to resolve public sector issues. Whether this will lead to any meaningful changes or remain largely symbolic, only time will tell. Until then, the world can't dodge the DOGE stories.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Rajan Hooda, an Indian-origin researcher from the University of Chicago, has proposed a groundbreaking theory on how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Egyptian pyramids, iconic ancient masonry structures, have long fascinated people with their immense size and intricate design. For centuries, the question "How did the Egyptians build the pyramids?" has remained one of history's greatest unsolved mysteries. Now, Rajan Hooda, an Indian-origin researcher from the University of Chicago, claims to have cracked the code behind the construction of these colossal monuments. His breakthrough comes after over 50 years of dedicated research into the methods used by the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>In his new research paper, Hooda introduces the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.htpwb.com/"><em>'Theory of The Conjoint Solution and The Shrinking Dual L Notch Ramps'</em></a>, a revolutionary approach that offers unprecedented insight into the ancient pyramids' construction methodology. The 20-page research paper not only proposes a new method of construction but also provides what Mr Hooda asserts is irrefutable evidence for this ancient engineering feat.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/fv11u8d8_egyptian-pyramids_625x300_20_November_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Mr Hooda remembers being captivated as an eight-year-old when he first heard of 'one of the great mysteries in the history of mankind-a puzzle unsolved for the past 4500 Years'. He describes his work as "a labour of love and persistence that took me more than 50 years until I was finally able to put the last painstaking pieces of this immense three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle into place."</p>

<p>Calling the prevailing ideas structurally untenable, such as the use of an exterior ramp that was larger than the pyramid or a complex interior tunnel ramp, Mr Hooda's 'L Notch Ramp' is built like a cut-out notch within the footprint of each layer of stones. He theorises that the pyramid was constructed like a "layer cake," comprising of 210 layers of stones. As he explains, "when the lowest layer of stones was completed, a small portion in one corner was left incomplete to create a small rising ramp from the ground to the top of the first layer-a height of 4.5 feet. This ramp was now used to transport stones needed to build the second layer. Like before, a small part of the second layer was left incomplete to extend the existing ramp from the top of the first layer to the top of the second layer of stones.</p>

<p>This was now used to transport stones to build the third layer. This process was repeated 209 times till the pyramid was finished. Then, starting from the top, the highest level of the ramp was removed, and the missing stones of level 209 were put into place to finish this level. This reverse process of ramp removal and placement of missing stones was repeated 209 times, ending with the lowest level being completed last." Because the ramp used is neither an exterior ramp nor an interior one, he calls it the 'L Notch Ramp' since it is built like a cut-out notch within the footprint of each layer of stones.</p>

<p>"The Egyptians would have constructed Dual L Notch Ramps for efficiency, one for taking stones up and a smaller one for workers descending after delivering stones. This method solves the riddle of ramp logistics, and since the 2 ramps were finally removed, there was no evidence left of how the pyramids were built-which is why it remained an enduring mystery for millennia," Hooda said in a news release.</p>

<p>Hooda's findings could finally provide answers to the puzzle of how the massive stone blocks were moved and assembled with remarkable precision, shedding new light on one of humanity's most enduring architectural marvels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indigenous "<em>Haka</em>" chants boomed across New Zealand's capital Wellington, as tens of thousands of people rallied against a bill that critics say would alter the core of the nation's founding treaty and dilute the rights of Maori people. The <em>Hikoi mo te Tiriti </em>march began ten days ago in the country's far north, where bare-chested men draped in traditional feather cloaks along with horse riders waving the red, white and black Maori flags, marched towards the capital in one of the country's biggest protests in recent decades.</p>

<p>The hikoi march culminated outside New Zealand's Parliament on Tuesday, where an estimated 35,000 people demonstrated, calling for lawmakers to reject the Treaty Principles Bill-- introduced by the libertarian ACT New Zealand party earlier this month. The bill reportedly seeks to redefine the Treaty of Waitangi - an agreement between the British and many, but not all, Maori tribes in 1840 that covers issues including land and cultural rights.</p>

<p>Although the legislation has almost no chance of passing as most parties in the island nation have committed to voting it down, its mere introduction has triggered a political upheaval in the country and reignited a debate on Indigenous rights.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Maoris And Their History In New Zealand</strong></h2>

<p>The Maoris are considered the original settlers of the two large islands now known as New Zealand. They reportedly came from East Polynesia 1300s on canoe voyages and settled on the then-uninhabited islands. Over centuries, they developed their own distinct culture and language. As of today, they are spread throughout New Zealand as part of different tribes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Maoris called the two islands where they resided Aotearoa. British colonisers, who took control of the islands in 1840 under the treaty, renamed it &nbsp;New Zealand. New Zealand gained independence from the Britishers in 1947.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Treaty of Waitangi</strong></h3>

<p>As the British Crown took control of New Zealand, it signed the Treaty of Waitangi (also called <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> or just <em>Te Tiriti</em>)-- the founding document with around 500 Maori chiefs, or rangatira.</p>

<p>As per a report by Al Jazeera, the document was originally presented as a measure to resolve differences between the Maori and the British. However, the English and te reo versions of the treaty feature some stark differences, because of which Maoris reportedly continued to suffer injustice in New Zealand even after independence.</p>

<p>As per the reo Maori version of the treaty, Maori chiefs have "rangatiratanga" or &nbsp;"self-determination", which gives Maori people the right to govern themselves. However, the English translation says Maori chiefs "cede to Her Majesty the Queen of England absolutely and without reservation all the rights and powers of Sovereignty", according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/19/tens-of-thousands-protest-new-zealand-maori-rights-bill" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a> report.</p>

<p>However, the English version does give Maoris "full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries". Despite that, by the time New Zealand gained independence, 90 per cent of Maori land was reportedly taken by the British Crown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1975, the government formed the Waitangi Tribunal, a permanent body to adjudicate treaty matters. The tribunal reportedly tried to remedy treaty breaches and navigate differences between the treaty's two texts.</p>

<h3><strong>The Treaty Principles Bill</strong></h3>

<p>As per the official data, currently, there are 978,246 Maori in New Zealand, constituting around 19 per cent of the nation's 5.3 million population. The Te Pati Maori, or the Maori Party, represents them in Parliament and holds six of the 123 seats there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MP David Seymour, who is a Maori himself, introduced the Treaty Principles Bill in Parliament. He is a member of the ACT Party, a minor partner in New Zealand's coalition government.&nbsp;Mr Seymour has long railed against affirmative action policies designed to help Maori.</p>

<p>As per Mr Seymour's party, the Treaty of Waitangi has been misinterpreted for decades leading to the formation of a dual system for New Zealanders, where Maori are given special treatment. The Treaty Principles Bill seeks to end the "division by race", by giving specific definitions to the treaty's principles. These principles would then be applied to all New Zealanders, whether Maori or not.</p>

<p>Incumbent Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has voiced his opposition to Seymour's bill, meaning it is all but doomed to fail when it comes to a parliamentary vote. But former conservative prime minister Jenny Shipley said just putting it forward threatened to "divide New Zealand in a way that I haven't lived through in my adult life".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Why Is The Bill Controversial?</strong></h3>

<p>After the bill was presented for debate in parliament last week, 22-year-old Maori Party MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke ripped it in half and launched into a haka. The visuals of her demonstrations were widely shared on social media sparking one of the largest Maori demonstrations in New Zealand's recent history. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Many critics of the bill -- including some of New Zealand's most respected lawyers -- see it as an attempt to strip long-agreed rights from the country's Maori population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not the best way to have a conversation. We will not accept unilateral change to a treaty that involves two parties," Ngira Simmonds, a key advisor to New Zealand's Maori queen, told news agency AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is a better way," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has gifted North Korea dozens of animals, including a lion and two bears, as a sign of friendship between Moscow and Pyongyang, Russian officials said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The two countries have deepened political, military and cultural ties amid Russia's offensive on Ukraine, with Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un repeatedly professing their personal camaraderie.</p>

<p>"An African lion, two brown bears, two domestic yaks, five white cockatoos, 25 pheasants of various species and 40 mandarin ducks were transferred from the Moscow Zoo to the Pyongyang Zoo," Russia's natural resources ministry said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>It posted a video of the animals in cargo boxes being unloaded off a government plane, and another of the lion in its new enclosure at the Pyongyang Zoo.</p>

<p>Putin previously gifted Kim 24 purebred horses, known to be Kim's favourite, while Kim sent Putin a pair of local dogs.</p>

<p>The two countries, both under heavy Western sanctions, signed a mutual defence pact earlier this year that obligates them to provide immediate military assistance if the other is invaded.</p>

<p>Western capitals, as well as Ukraine and South Korea, say North Korea has recently deployed more than 10,000 of its troops to Russia, to be sent into combat against Kyiv's forces.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today met his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun for bilateral talks in Vientiane, Lao PDR. The two leaders met for the first time since the military disengagement in Ladakh. At the meeting Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told Mr Dong that "Galwan-type incidents must be avoided".</p>

<p>They reviewed the situation at the Line of Actual Control and the disengagement in areas where the two sides were in a standoff for more than four years.</p>

<p>The meeting took place on the sidelines of a conclave of the 10-nation ASEAN grouping.</p>

<p>Indian and Chinese militaries had completed the disengagement exercise in last two friction points at Demchok and Depsang late last month. Regular patrolling by troops of both sides also resumed in the two areas after a gap of almost four-and-a-half years.</p>

<p>The military standoff in the upper Himalayan region of Ladakh were mainly in five regions along the Line of Actual Control or LAC - Galwan, Pangong, Gogra Hot Springs, Depsang, and Demchok.</p>

<p>Ties between India and China had taken a severe hit and had come to an abrupt halt after the military clash in Galwan Valley in June 2020. It took four years of diplomatic and military-level talks between both sides to finally come to an agreement to reinstate the status quo to what it was before the stand-off in 2020. The agreement to disengage finally happened on October 21 this year and both militaries completed the process to move back to pre-2020 status by October 31.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh began his three-day visit to Laos on Wednesday, primarily to attend a meeting of the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus, which is a platform comprising the 10-nation ASEAN and its eight dialogue partners - India, China, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the United States.</p>

<p>Laos is hosting the meeting in its capacity as the current Chair of the forum.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India, projected to house 350 million children by 2050, must navigate critical challenges like extreme climate and environmental hazards to ensure their well-being and rights, according to a new UNICEF report.</p>

<p>It underlined that although India will see a decline of 106 million children compared to today, it will still account for 15 per cent of the global child population, sharing this responsibility with China, Nigeria, and Pakistan.</p>

<p>UNICEF's flagship State of the World's Children 2024 report, The Future of Children in a Changing World, was launched in New Delhi on Wednesday, spotlighting three global megatrends, demographic shifts, climate crises, and frontier technologies that are set to reshape the lives of children by 2050.</p>

<p>The report was unveiled by Cynthia McCaffrey, UNICEF India Representative, alongside Suruchi Bhadwal of The Energy Research Institute (TERI), UNICEF Youth Advocate Kartik Verma.</p>

<p>The report pointed out that by the 2050s, children will face dramatically increased exposure to extreme climate and environmental hazards and nearly eight times more children are expected to be exposed to extreme heatwaves compared to the 2000s.</p>

<p>This escalation of the climate and environmental crisis is compounded by the fact that more children will be living in today's interpretation of lower-income countries, particularly in Africa, where resources to tackle these challenges may be limited without significant, strategic investments.</p>

<p>The report underscored that India, projected to house 350 million children by 2050, must navigate critical challenges to ensure their well-being and rights. Although India will see a decline of 106 million children compared to today, it will still account for 15% of the global child population, sharing this responsibility with China, Nigeria, and Pakistan.</p>

<p>"Decisions made today will shape the world our children inherit," said McCaffrey. "Placing children and their rights at the centre of strategies and policies is essential for building a prosperous, sustainable future," she said.</p>

<p>With nearly one billion children worldwide already exposed to high-risk climate hazards, India ranks 26th in the Children's Climate Risk Index.</p>

<p>Indian children face acute risks from extreme heat, floods, and air pollution, particularly in rural and low-income communities.</p>

<p>The report predicts that climate crises will disproportionately impact their health, education, and access to essential resources like water.</p>

<p>Bhadwal emphasised the urgent need for climate action: "Children are vulnerable to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. By involving them as active agents of change, we can address these challenges collectively." Frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, hold both promise and peril for children.</p>

<p>However, the digital divide remains stark, with only 26% of people in low-income countries connected to the internet, compared to over 95% in high-income countries.</p>

<p>The report called for inclusive technological advancements to bridge this gap and ensure safe, equitable access for children.</p>

<p>The report outlines the need for India to prioritise investments in health, education, skilling, and sustainable urban infrastructure.</p>

<p>Nearly half of India's population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050, necessitating child-friendly and climate-resilient urban planning.</p>

<p>Kartik Verma, who represented UNICEF India at COP29, highlighted the importance of climate education: "Climate change is a child rights crisis. Empowering children with knowledge and tools can make them part of the solution." The report's launch coincided with World Children's Day, marked by illuminating iconic monuments across India, including Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate, and Qutub Minar, in UNICEF's signature blue.</p>

<p>The #GoBlue campaign reinforced the importance of inclusion, equality, and non-discrimination for every child.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, has been a vital instrument for exploring the universe for over three decades. Commonly referred to as HST or Hubble, the telescope is celebrated among space enthusiasts for its remarkable contributions to astronomy. However, many may not be aware that the telescope is named after Edwin Powell Hubble, a pioneering American astronomer. Edwin Hubble's groundbreaking work in the early 20th century laid the foundation for modern cosmology, including the discovery of the universe's expansion. His legacy lives on through this iconic instrument, which continues to provide a unique window to the universe.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://science.nasa.gov/people/edwin-hubble">NASA,</a> like the Hubble Space Telescope, Edwin Hubble's discoveries transformed the frontier of scientific knowledge. His work took us beyond the Milky Way and placed us in an ever-expanding universe with a myriad of galaxies beyond our own.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who was Edwin Powell Hubble?</strong></p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://science.nasa.gov/people/edwin-hubble">NASA</a>, born on November 20, 1889, in Marshfield, Missouri, Hubble spent his youth honing athletic skills in basketball, football, baseball, track, and boxing, while mentally feeding his curiosity through science fiction novels. Hubble's innate fascination with the world around him foretold a lifetime of exploration. He entered the University of Chicago in 1906 as an undergraduate, earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics and astronomy. He briefly deviated from his path of exploration, largely fuelled by his father's expectations, to study law at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. But his deep longing to pursue a career in the sciences outweighed his father's visions, and Hubble switched gears and obtained a Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Chicago in 1914, setting his focus on the heavens.</p>

<p>The famous British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking wrote in his book <em>A Brief History of Time </em>that Hubble's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://esahubble.org/about/history/the_scientist_behind_the_name/"><em>"discovery that the Universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century."&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Seeing the Cosmos Through a New Lens</strong></p>

<p>Destined for the cosmos, Hubble's journey led him to Mount Wilson Observatory in California and the 100-inch Hooker Telescope, the world's largest at the time. Hubble used the 100-inch telescope to observe faint, fuzzy, cloud-like patches of light broadly labelled nebulae. His observations brought these fuzzy patches into focus and, in the process, transformed the field of cosmology.</p>

<p>Hubble used his uniquevantage point to compare galaxies with one another by studying their physical properties. Focusing on the visual appearances of galaxies, Hubble devised what is now the most influential system for classifying them: the Hubble Classification Scheme.</p>

<p><strong>No Nobel Prize for an astronomer</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://esahubble.org/about/history/the_scientist_behind_the_name/"><em>esahubble.org,</em></a> during his life, Hubble had tried to obtain the Nobel Prize, even hiring a publicity agent to promote his cause in the late 1940s, but all the effort was in vain as there was no category for astronomy. Hubble died in 1953 while preparing for several nights of observations, his last great ambition unfulfilled.</p>

<p>He would have been thrilled had he known that the Space Telescope is named after him, so that astronomers can continue to "hope to find something we had not expected", as he said in 1948 during a BBC broadcast in London.</p>]]></content:encoded>

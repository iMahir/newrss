       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said "India supports dialogue and diplomacy... and not war" as he spoke at a closed-door plenary session of the BRICS Summit in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr Modi - who on Tuesday told Russia's Vladimir Putin, whose country is at war with Ukraine, that "all conflict can be solved with dialogue" - today told the bloc there are multiple challenges facing BRICS members and the world at large, and called for action on those fronts instead.</p>

<p>"Preventing inflation... ensuring food, energy, health, and water security... these are matters of priority for all countries in the world. And, in this era of technology, new challenges have emerged, like misinformation (spread online) and cyber frauds like deepfakes..."</p>

<p>"At such a time, there are high expectations of the BRICS grouping and I believe that we, as a diverse and inclusive platform, can play a positive role in all these areas," the PM said.</p>

<p>"In this regard, our approach must remain people centric. We have to tell the world BRICS is not divisive and that we support dialogue and diplomacy, and not war ..." Mr Modi said.</p>

<p>As an example, the Prime Minister pointed to the pandemic and how BRICS nations worked together, and said, "Just as we were able to overcome a challenge like Covid together, we can create new opportunities to ensure a secure, strong, and prosperous future..."</p>

<p>The global war on terrorism - a particular focus of the Modi government - was also flagged.</p>

<p>"In order to counter terrorism and terror-financing, we need the single-minded and firm support of all... there is no place for double standards on this serious matter," Mr Modi asserted.</p>

<p>"We need to take active steps to stop radicalisation of youth in our countries."</p>

<p>On the introduction of new member-nations - Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates - Mr Modi said, "India is ready to welcome new nations as 'partner countries'."</p>

<p>"In this regard all decisions should be taken by consensus," he said, adding, however, that "the views of BRICS founding members should be respected."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi also expressed gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin for hosting the BRICS Summit in Kazan and for his leadership of the bloc over the past 12 months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The event has sparked global outrage and heightened tensions between the two nations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The video of an Israeli missile striking a residential building in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday is going viral across various social media platforms amid ongoing clashes between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/video/shocking-moment-israeli-missile-brings-down-entire-building-in-beirut/"><em>The New York Post,</em></a> the multi-story building was reportedly located in the Tayouneh neighbourhood, next to Horsh Beirut, a city park. The viral video of the incident showed that the impact of the missile attack was so catastrophic that it caused the entire structure to collapse instantly within a few seconds.</p>

<p>About 40 minutes prior to this missile attack, an Israeli military spokesperson had issued a social media post in Arabic alerting residents in and around two buildings on the southern suburbs of Beirut to leave the area.</p>

<p>The incident has sparked widespread outrage around the world. Local authorities and emergency services were immediately dispatched to the scene to assess the damage and provide assistance to any affected individuals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement said on Tuesday there would be no negotiations while fighting continued with Israel, and it claimed sole responsibility for a drone attack on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday home.</p>

<p>The group "takes full and sole responsibility" for targeting Netanyahu's house, Mohammad Afif, head of the Iranian-backed operator group's media office, told a press conference in the southern suburbs of Beirut.</p>

<p>"If our hands didn't reach you the previous time, then days, nights, and the battlefield are still between us," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HSBC Holdings Plc, which was founded by a Scotsman more than 150-years ago, named Pam Kaur the first female chief financial officer in its history.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old brings a long focus on auditing, risks, and compliance across almost four decades of banking career spanning various global lenders. She joined HSBC in April 2013 as internal audit head, coming aboard shortly after the bank admitted to anti-money laundering and sanctions violations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Justice department.</p>

<p>Ms Kaur, who was educated at Punjab University in India, takes on her new role at a challenging time as interest rates fall and amid geopolitical tensions in key markets, including China and Hong Kong. The bank on Tuesday unveiled a broad restructuring across different business lines and geographies as newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Georges Elhedery embarks on ambitious cost cuts.</p>

<p>HSBC will have to find a way to shave off $2 billion in costs in order to sustain a key measure of the bank's profits, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.</p>

<p>"We had a strong bench of internal and external candidates to choose from and Pam was the exceptional candidate to recommend to the board," said Elhedery, who was elevated from CFO, in a statement.</p>

<p>Shares of HSBC slipped 0.4% at 1:03 p.m. in London.</p>

<p>With the promotion, Ms Kaur becomes one of the most senior women in banking across Europe. She had been seen as a front-runner for the role, ahead of other candidates including Greg Guyett, head of global banking and markets, Willard McLane, group head of strategy and corporate development, and Kavita Mahtani, the CFO of HSBC's Europe and Western Markets, Bloomberg previously reported.</p>

<p>Before joining HSBC, she also held compliance and audit roles at Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG. Ms Kaur has served on HSBC's group executive committee for more than a decade and was named head of wholesale market and credit risk in 2019.</p>

<p>Her remuneration as CFO will consist an annual base salary of 803,000 pounds ($1.04 million), a fixed pay allowance of 1,085,000 pounds and a pension allowance of 80,300 pounds.</p>

<p>She's eligible to be considered for discretionary variable pay that consists of an annual incentive award up to 215% of base salary, and a long-term incentive award up to 320% of base salary.</p>

<p>"We are welcome to see more and more woman leadership in the market, especially for multi-national financial institutions," said Melissa Fung, a partner at Deloitte LLP. "This also echoes with the enhancement of board diversity policy under the Corporate Governance Code suggested by HKEX."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A polio vaccination campaign in north Gaza has been postponed due to Israeli bombardments, mass displacement and lack of access, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>This final phase, due to begin on Wednesday, aimed to vaccinate more than 119,000 children in the Palestinian enclave under siege for over a year in response to militant group Hamas' attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>"The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure, continue to jeopardize people's safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate," the UN agency said in a statement, reiterating its call for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>The polio campaign began on Sept. 1 after the WHO confirmed in August that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>Delays in a second dose for children could jeopardise efforts to halt transmission. "This could also lead to further spread of poliovirus in the Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries, with the risk of more children being paralysed," the agency said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency called for a temporary truce to allow departures from areas of north Gaza, where it said "people are just waiting to die" after three weeks of Israeli attacks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in Russia to attend the BRICS summit, will hold his first bilateral meeting today with Chinese President Xi Jinping since the 2020 Galwan clash. The two leaders will meet in the city of Kazan, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had announced yesterday.</p>

<p>"I can confirm that there will be a bilateral meeting held between Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping tomorrow on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit," said Mr Misri. The BRICS is a grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>

<p>The bilateral marks another upturn in the India-China ties after a consensus between the two countries on patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control.</p>

<p>The two leaders, who arrived in Kazan on Tuesday to participate in the BRICS summit, had brief interactions only twice since the 2020 clash -- on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali in 2022 and the BRICS summit in Johannesburg in 2023.</p>

<p>PM Modi met Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian yesterday at the summit and emphasised the need for peace in West Asia. He also held bilateral talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin and said the Russia-Ukraine conflict should be resolved in a peaceful manner.</p>

<h3><b>First India-China Bilateral Since 2020</b></h3>

<p>The bilateral meeting between PM Modi and Xi Jinping will be the first since the 2020 face-off between the troops of the two countries.</p>

<p>Indian and Chinese troops had clashed in the Galwan Valley in June 2020, sparking a major standoff along the Line of Actual Control. Both sides had sustained casualties and ties between the two nations had soured.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-delhi-can-play-a-part-iran-president-meets-pm-modi-over-west-asia-crisis-6851024">"Delhi Can Play A Part": Iran President Meets PM Modi Over West Asia Crisis</a></p>

<p>The two sides held a series of military and diplomatic talks in the last couple of years, after which the troops disengaged from a number of friction points. In the latest breakthrough that is expected to lower tensions, the two countries this week reached a patrolling deal along the Line of Actual Control.</p>

<p>After the deal, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said at the NDTV World Summit, Indian and Chinese soldiers would be able to patrol the border area in the way they did before the 2020 face-off.</p>

<p>Mr Misri the immediate focus of patrolling deal will be on disengagement and they will take up the issue of de-escalation and de-induction of troops at an appropriate time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[One recent New York Times/Siena poll that set off alarm bells said Harris has only 78 percent Black support, compared to approximately 90 percent for President Joe Biden when he defeated Trump four years ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marching bands blared as students and alumni mingled during the homecoming parade at Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington where <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-absolutely-ready-for-first-woman-president-kamala-harris-6853027">Kamala Harris</a> graduated four decades ago.</p>

<p>The cutthroat US presidential election is likely to be won on the thinnest of margins, and polls showing gains by Republican Donald Trump among traditionally Democratic Black voters, particularly men, have made headlines.</p>

<p>One recent New York Times/Siena poll that set off alarm bells said Harris has only 78 percent Black support, compared to approximately 90 percent for President Joe Biden when he defeated Trump four years ago.</p>

<p>So, Harris will be counting on the enthusiasm of Black voters at cultural lynchpins like Howard -- one of a network of HBCUs, or historically black colleges and universities, that emerged during the decades of racial segregation and continue to exert powerful influence.</p>

<p>The Democrat may even use Howard's campus as her election night headquarters, according to NBC News.</p>

<p>Certainly, the homecoming festivities last weekend indicated strong support for Howard's most famous living graduate, as vendors sold campaign merchandise and visitors took photos with cutouts of the vice president.</p>

<p>Kacy Haynes, up from Louisiana to visit his son, said he "hadn't really heard a lot of the support" for Trump.</p>

<p>And while the Trump campaign has made inroads into the Black electorate, particularly among men, that support shouldn't be overstated, analysts say.</p>

<p>Michael Strawbridge, assistant professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis, pointed to research that shows unflagging Black support for the Democratic Party, adding that he didn't think Republicans are "winning over anyone who isn't already on their side."</p>

<p>He also cautioned against polls that sometimes only include small subsets of Black voters.</p>

<p>"The real issue for many Black Americans is not Democrat or Republican.... The real threat among Black voters is them not voting on Election Day at all and feeling that they're not being appealed to and supported by either party," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>Barber shops vs HBCUs</strong></p>

<p>Trump may not be welcome at HBCUs but he is finding fertile turf in male-orientated circles, like the barber shop he visited last week in New York's Bronx borough. The event in the mostly Latino and Black neighborhood of Castle Hill was broadcast by right-wing TV network Fox News.</p>

<p>"You guys are the same as me. It's the same stuff. We were born the same way. I grew up in Queens and all of that," said the former president, who grew up in the borough's upscale Jamaica Estates community, and inherited a fortune from his father.</p>

<p>Strawbridge said such sporadic appeals to minority voters "come across as very opportunistic."</p>

<p>For Harris, the HBCU connections are especially useful in the pre-election period which coincides with campus homecomings -- a tradition in which alumni return for an autumn football game, parade and other celebrations.</p>

<p>The festivities are particularly pronounced at HBCUs like Howard, where Harris, who is half Black and half Indian-American, graduated in 1986.</p>

<p>Kalyssa Gillespie, a third-year Howard student said on a practical level Harris "doesn't really have to cater to us, because she already has our vote."</p>

<p>But, she said, Harris's efforts show "that she cares, that she will come back and give to her community instead of forgetting about where she came from."</p>

<p>As Election Day approaches, Harris has tried to spread her net further.</p>

<p>She chatted with popular radio host Charlamagne tha God and launched a new economic plan specifically to court African American males.</p>

<p>Last weekend, she visited Black churches in Georgia, including a Baptist megachurch near Atlanta.</p>

<p>Appealing to Black churches, HBCUs and Black sororities, which serve organizational roles in the Black community, is "crucial to a campaign that wants to get Black folks to the polls," Strawbridge said.</p>

<p>Confirming Harris's strong pull, visiting Howard parent Haynes said the only good things he had heard about Trump were "based off of his legacy as a businessman."</p>

<p>"But in those same breaths (were) the comments and the concerns of the past things that went on," including the ex-president's "behavior, stance on minorities, LGBTQ -- just all of the different demographics" he has offended.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Senior aides of Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, including his national security advisor Nathalie Drouin, shared confidential information about India - and claiming 'interference' in Ottawa's affairs - to a US paper, a Canadian publication said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two senior aides of Canada Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/justin-trudeau" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a>, one of whom is his national security advisor, Nathalie Drouin, shared confidential information about India - and claimed Delhi 'interference' in Ottawa's affairs - to a United States newspaper, a Canadian publication reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>The information was provided days before Canadian federal police alleged - as Mr Trudeau has in the past, but without concrete evidence - that "agents" of the Indian government work with criminal gangs to "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-bishnoi-gang-canada-bishnoi-gang-linked-to-indian-government-agents-canada-cops-big-claim-6792233" target="_blank">target South Asians... specifically pro-Khalistani elements</a>" in that country.</p>

<p>Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Mike Duhene and his deputy, Brigitte Gauvin, told reporters they believed Indian government "agents" had ties with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, and were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/hardeep-singh-nijjar" target="_blank">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Canadian citizen, in June last year, as well as case of "extortion, intimidation, and coercion".</p>

<p>India had strongly rejected what it called "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38417" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>" and underlined that since allegations were first made - by Mr Trudeau in September last year - the Canadian government "has not shared a shred of evidence with the Government of India, despite many requests..."</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-we-had-said-no-evidence-whatsoever-india-on-justin-trudeaus-deposition-6806506#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">"As We Said, No Evidence...": India On Justin Trudeau's Deposition</a></p>

<p>That sentiment was underlined last week after Mr Trudeau told a Commission of Inquiry he had only intel-based speculation and no "proof" when he linked "agents" of Delhi to Nijjar's killing.</p>

<h3><strong>Canada Officials, US Paper Met?</strong></h3>

<p>Canada newspaper <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-federal-officials-provided-secret-information-about-india-to/" target="_blank">The Globe and Mail</a> said its sources had spoken of Ms Drouin and David Morrison, the Deputy Minister of Global Affairs, briefing the Washington Post on various aspects of India's 'interference', including involvement in the September 2023 killing of another Sikh leader, Sukhdool Gill, a gangster from Punjab's Moga linked to the Khalistani terror movement.</p>

<p>Gill was killed two days after Mr Trudeau first accused India in the Nijjar killing.</p>

<p>Spokespersons for Ms Drouin and Mr Morrison have claimed no information was shared, but spoke of an unsealed United States indictment from November 2023. According to The Globe and Mail, this, however, did not name Gill or the other Canadian targeted for assassination.</p>

<p>The Post, sources told the Canadian publication, was instructed not to report anything till Mr Duheme and Ms Gauvin held that press conference. The Post eventually did so citing 'Canadian officials' who claimed to have linked Gill's murder to India, although the federal police did not.</p>

<p>In their presser Mr Duheme and Ms Gauvin claimed to have evidence - none was presented citing ongoing investigation - that some Indian diplomatic staff work with organised crime elements to "collect - through questionable and illegal means - information on Canadian citizens... (that is fed to criminal organisations) that would then take violent actions..."</p>

<p>Hours after the police officers' press conference Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters and doubled down on charges against the Indian government.</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil..." he declared.</p>

<h3><strong>India, Canada Expel Diplomats</strong></h3>

<p>His government also named High Commissioner Sanjay Verma as one of the six 'persons of interest' in this affair, triggering further fury from Delhi, which retaliated by ejecting Canada's High Commissioner and five of his staff. On the expulsions (the second tit-for-tat round), Delhi said, "Sanjay Verma is India's senior-most serving diplomat", and slammed a "strategy of smearing India for political gains".</p>

<p>Canadian authorities investigating Nijjar's killing have arrested four people so far, and Mr Duheme said last week that 30 others, including those with alleged links to the Indian government. were charged.</p>

<p><strong>Trudeau's Political Future</strong></p>

<p>Mr Trudeau's allegations coincide with sliding support and tanking popularity; this month he survived a second parliamentary confidence vote in as many weeks before the 2025 election.</p>

<p>Ties between Ottawa and Delhi have plummeted since Mr Trudeau's allegations broke, with his critics in India accusing him of pandering to Khalistani terrorist vote banks in that country.</p>

<p>In May, Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said that Justin Trudeau, by allowing political space to Khalistani separatist elements, had indicated the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/canada-showing-its-vote-bank-is-more-powerful-than-its-rule-of-law-s-jaishankar-5631952" target="_blank">terrorists' votes were more important than the rule of law</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar underlined his assessment this week at the NDTV World Summit and criticised the Canadian government for "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-justin-trudeau-doubles-down-on-charges-after-india-canada-diplomatic-showdown-6791322#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll" target="_blank">double standards</a>", referring to apparent differences between how Ottawa treats other nations' diplomats on its soil and the "license' it allows its representatives in India.</p>

<h3><strong>US' Position</strong></h3>

<p>The US has been discreet since the row erupted in September last year and has only emphasised the need for cooperation between the two countries, an appeal it made again last week.</p>

<p>The United States - which is conducting an inquiry about an ex-Indian spy linked to a murder-for-hire attempt targeting Gurpatwant Pannun, whom India considers a Khalistani terrorist - called for Delhi and Ottawa to work together, and said that charges need to be viewed "very seriously".</p>

<p>Nijjar - the mastermind behind banned terror outfit Khalistan Tiger Force - was on Delhi's list of 'most wanted' terrorists for multiple crimes, including the murder of Hindu priest in Punjab. Anti-terror agency NIA had offered a Rs 10 lakh reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Scores of migrants from Sierra Leone travel to Lebanon every year for work, intending to support families back home.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not far from Beirut's heavily bombed southern suburbs, Jaiatu Koroma and her five-month-old daughter have taken refuge along with dozens of women from Sierra Leone in a dilapidated warehouse turned shelter.</p>

<p>After Israeli forces began heavily striking Lebanon around a month ago, Koroma, 21, from Freetown, said she strapped her young child to her back and fled her home in south Beirut, initially sleeping "in the streets".</p>

<p>She eventually was taken to the volunteer-run shelter -- an old concrete structure on the outskirts of Beirut now filled with mattresses, bed covers and hastily packed suitcases, as well as a donated baby crib and change table.</p>

<p>Wearing a red beanie, she expressed gratitude that she and her baby were now getting "food, water", nappies and a place to sleep.</p>

<p>A year of deadly cross-border exchanges between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah over the Gaza conflict escalated to all-out war on September 23, with Israel heavily striking Hezbollah strongholds in south and east Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>The bombardment has sent more than one million people fleeing, according to Lebanese authorities, with at least 2,546 people killed in a year of violence, more than half of them in the past month.</p>

<p>At the graffitied building -- an empty venue called The Shelter, usually hired out for events -- women sat on mattresses talking, resting, praying or doing each other's hair.</p>

<p>Others carried laundry in plastic tubs to and from a washing area, where lines of brightly coloured clothes were hung up to dry in a dark, damp room.</p>

<p><strong>Kafala system</strong></p>

<p>"I want to return to my country," said Koroma, as the sound of chatter echoed around the derelict space.</p>

<p>She said she worked for months but her employment agent took her earnings and she got "nothing", adding that the agent also had her passport.</p>

<p>Jaward Gbondema Borniea from the Sierra Leone consulate in Beirut said that "a huge number of our citizens... have been stranded".</p>

<p>Scores of migrants from Sierra Leone travel to Lebanon every year for work, with the aim of supporting families back home.</p>

<p>Migrant workers are employed under Lebanon's controversial "kafala" sponsorship system, which rights groups have repeatedly said facilitates exploitation, with persistent reports of abuse, unpaid wages and long work hours.</p>

<p>Borniea said the consulate was working to provide emergency travel documents for the most vulnerable, and collaborating with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to facilitate repatriations.</p>

<p>Mathieu Luciano, the IOM's head of office in Beirut, said the United Nations agency had received "15,000 requests from migrants and their embassies for return assistance", including 1,300 who hail from Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>The UN agency estimates that "approximately 17,500 migrants... have been displaced" by the war, Luciano told AFP, out of around 180,000 migrants residing in Lebanon before the crisis.</p>

<p>Dea Hage Chahine, among a handful of volunteers running the warehouse shelter, said that "when we started 21 days ago, we hosted 60 women. We are at 175 now."</p>

<p>"We're working non-stop," she said, adding that some of the women require medical or psychological assistance.</p>

<p>"The hardest thing is... the number of women coming in every day is increasing".</p>

<p><strong>'Second-class humans'</strong></p>

<p>The volunteer said she secured the space after finding women camped outside the Sierra Leone consulate, who had later been kicked out of a government shelter to make way for Lebanese families.</p>

<p>The volunteers have set up a kitchen, subscribed to a patchy power generator system, installed some lights and arranged water deliveries for washing and showering.</p>

<p>They are also running an online fundraising campaign to help cover the women's journeys home and associated expenses, Hage Chahine said, noting many "don't have their passports".</p>

<p>She blamed the kafala system and an "inherited education of racism" for the lack of support for migrant workers, saying they were often treated as "second-class humans".</p>

<p>Among those hoping to leave is Susan Baimda, 37, who said she came to the shelter two weeks earlier "because of the fighting".</p>

<p>"The situation is very rough," said Baimda, but in the shelter, "it's very fine now."</p>

<p>"Everybody is taking care of us," she added as she and others helped prepare large quantities of pasta salad for dinner.</p>

<p>She has four children back home in Freetown, and has only seen them via video call since she came to Lebanon three years ago.</p>

<p>"Let me go back to them" and "to our country", she said.</p>

<p>"We are tired of the fighting... we want to save (our) lives," Baimda added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday "now is the time" to end the conflict in Gaza, and urged Israel to avoid further escalation with Iran.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday "now is the time" to end the conflict in Gaza, and urged Israel to avoid further escalation with Iran.</p>

<p>Israel is fighting Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and has pledged to hit back against Iran's October 1 missile strike.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, state media reported an Israeli drone strike on Tyre, after the military warned residents of parts of the coastal city to flee ahead of operations targeting Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The warning sparked a new exodus from the once vibrant city, which is perched on the Mediterranean coast, and AFPTV footage showed a plume of thick black smoke rising from the city after the strike.</p>

<p>"The situation is very bad, we're evacuating people," said Mortada Mhanna, who heads Tyre's disaster management unit.</p>

<p>"You could say that the entire city of Tyre is being evacuated," said Bilal Kashmar, the unit's media officer.</p>

<p>Blinken's visit to the region is his 11th since the start of the war in Gaza and his first since Israel-Hezbollah violence escalated to all-out war late last month.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 42,718 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>"Since October 7 a year ago, Israel has achieved most of its strategic objectives when it comes to Gaza... Now is the time to turn those successes into enduring, strategic success," Blinken said as he left Israel, following meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials.</p>

<p>On aid to Gaza, Blinken said he saw "progress being made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made and, most critically, it needs to be sustained".</p>

<p>Of Israel's pledge to retaliate for Iran's October 1 missile attack, the US top diplomat said: "It's also very important that Israel respond in ways that do not create greater escalation."</p>

<p>After Israel, Blinken will visit Saudi Arabia, which has put on hold talks towards a normalisation deal with Israel until a Palestinian state is created.</p>

<p>The US diplomat urged Israel to seize what he described as an "incredible opportunity" to move towards a deal with Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Previous US efforts to end the Gaza war and contain the regional fallout have failed, as did a bid spearheaded by President Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to secure a temporary ceasefire in Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>Hostages still in Gaza</strong></p>

<p>In his meeting with Netanyahu on Tuesday, Blinken urged his ally to seize on the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza to work towards a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Sinwar was the architect of the October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Hailing his killing, Netanyahu said it did not mean the war was over, though he added that it could be the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>The militants also took 251 hostages back into Gaza. Ninety-seven are still being held there, including 34 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>During his meeting with the Israeli premier in Jerusalem, Blinken "underscored the need to capitalise" on the death of Sinwar, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>This would be done by "securing the release of all hostages and ending the conflict in Gaza in a way that provides lasting security for Israelis and Palestinians alike", he added.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told Blinken that Sinwar's death "could have a positive impact on the return of the hostages", according to a statement from the prime minister's office.</p>

<p>Blinken also pressed for more aid to be allowed into besieged Gaza as concerns rise for tens of thousands of civilians trapped by fighting in the hard-to-reach north.</p>

<p>Israel launched a major air and ground assault in northern Gaza this month, vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in the area.</p>

<p>The only medical facility still partially functioning in the targeted area has "no medicine or medical supplies", warned Kamal Adwan Hospital director Hossam Abu Safia.</p>

<p>"People are being killed in the streets, and we can't help them. Bodies are lying on the streets."</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah heir</strong></p>

<p>After nearly a year of war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel shifted its focus to Lebanon in late September, vowing to secure its northern border under fire from Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israel ramped up its air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds around the country and sent in ground troops late last month, in a war that has killed at least 1,552 people since September 23, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Hezbollah kept up its attacks on Israel Wednesday, saying it had fired rockets at an Israeli military intelligence base in the suburbs of commercial hub Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Israeli army said it had killed the Hezbollah cleric tipped to succeed the group's slain leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike three weeks ago.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has not issued a statement confirming Hashem Safieddine's death, but a high-level source close to the group had said that the militant leader had been out of contact since the strikes.</p>

<p>"We have reached Nasrallah, his replacement and most of Hezbollah's senior leadership", Israeli army chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a statement.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Israeli military again struck the southern suburbs of Beirut, a once densely populated bastion of Hezbollah, after issuing new calls for residents to evacuate the area.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old Sikh woman was found dead inside a walk-in oven of the Walmart store's bakery department in Canada's Halifax city, according to media reports.</p>

<p>Halifax Regional Police (HRP) said they were called to a sudden death at the Walmart at 6990 Mumford Road around 9:30 pm on Saturday.</p>

<p>According to police, the woman, who has not been identified, was employed at the store.</p>

<p>Her body was found in a walk-in oven, police said.</p>

<p>The Maritime Sikh Society confirmed to CTV News that she was a member of their community.</p>

<p>“It's very sad for us, for her family as well, because she came for a better future and she lost her life,” said Anmolpreet Singh, with the Maritime Sikh Society.</p>

<p>She had recently moved to Canada from India, The Globe and Mail newspaper said.</p>

<p>The store has remained closed since Saturday night while the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>HRP Constable Martin Cromwell said police were aware of online speculation about the woman's cause of death.</p>

<p>“The investigation is complex,” said Cromwell.</p>

<p>“We understand the public is involved, and we just wanted to encourage the public to be patient with our investigation and be mindful that there are family members and coworkers involved.” Cromwell said Halifax police were coordinating with the appropriate agencies to help with the investigation.</p>

<p>“We urge the public to be mindful of sharing speculative information on social media,” HRP said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the province's labour department said a stop-work order has been issued for the bakery and “one piece of equipment” at the Walmart store.</p>

<p>“It is important to note that the investigation has not yet reached a point where the cause and manner of death have been confirmed,” HRP said.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia's medical examiner is working to determine the cause of death, and the province's Department of Health and Safety is taking part in the investigation.</p>

<p>Walk-in ovens, also referred to as cabinet or batch ovens, allow for curing, drying or baking in batches using wheeled racks or carts. They are often found in large-volume bakeries in places such as supermarkets.</p>

<p>In a statement, Walmart Canada said the company is heartbroken and their thoughts are with the woman's family.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/hrlt7l28_spy_625x300_23_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>On a blustery, cold January day in 2011 in Lahore, a CIA contractor and former US Special Forces operative was driving through a busy street when two motorcyclists who allegedly attempted to rob him—or that is what he claimed—were shot and killed by him. In the ensuing chaos, he hit another car, got caught and was promptly charged with murder. You might think this was a minor incident, but Washington didn't.</p>

<p>Raymond Davis was hardly a big fish in the CIA pond, yet the Obama administration threw a diplomatic tantrum generally typical of a superpower. Diplomatic relations and the $2 billion in annual aid to Pakistan were frozen. The US falsely claimed Davis was a diplomat, deserving immunity. Pakistan's investigation showed he was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative and therefore wasn't covered by diplomatic immunity. Initially, it refused to back down despite the political heat.</p>

<p>In the end, after a 50-day standoff, Davis was whisked back to the US, but not before $2.34 million of blood money exchanged hands, reportedly compensating the victims' families. He later wrote about this cloak-and-dagger saga in his 2016 book&nbsp;<i>The Contractor: How I Landed in Pakistan's Deadliest Jail and Then Escaped</i>, revealing how the CIA operates when things get messy.</p>

<h2><strong>CIA's Long Arms</strong></h2>

<p>The Raymond Davis affair revealed how deeply the CIA was operating in Pakistan's backyard, raising public anger about America's covert meddling in a country it called an "ally" in the war on terror. The Pakistanis felt betrayed by their trusted ally.</p>

<p>This brings us to the present: the CIA, the agency behind countless covert operations all around the world, lectures India on cooperating with Canada over Hardeep Singh Nijjar's assassination. It's as if the US forgot it's been running around the world in the shadows since the CIA's inception in 1947, toppling governments, orchestrating coups, and assassinating foreign leaders—all in the name of national interest. But let's not dwell on the hypocrisy or "double standards", as India's foreign minister S. Jaishankar put it in a recent interview with&nbsp;<i>NDTV</i>. He didn't hold back in calling out Canada's double standards and pointed out how it is quick to gather intel through its diplomats on foreign soil but becomes very protective when it comes to limiting similar activities by diplomats from other nations on its own turf.</p>

<p>Indeed, while Canada plays the victim, it conveniently turns a blind eye to the unchecked privileges its own diplomats enjoy in India. Jaishankar, ever direct, put it plainly: "Double standards is a very mild word for it." His pointed remark wasn't just a dig at Canada's hypocrisy but also an indictment of the wider Western duplicity.</p>

<p>Take the recent case of the US charging former Indian intelligence agent Vikas Yadav with being involved in a plot to assassinate Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York. Now, imagine if the tables were turned. Would the US sit quietly? Absolutely not. By now, Washington would have launched a full-scale diplomatic offensive to bring its man home, just like it did in the above-mentioned case of Davis. And if this led to a potential diplomatic row, so be it. The hypocrisy is so obvious.</p>

<h2><strong>West's Unquestioned Hypocrisy</strong></h2>

<p>In the murky realm of espionage, agencies like the CIA, Mossad and MI6 have always played by their own rules, causing diplomatic rifts, regime changes and the occasional assassinations. But when the tables turn, if at all, well, it's all about the rule of law and international cooperation. I do not suggest the Indian spy agency RAW is doing what the likes of CIA, Mossad and MI6 have been doing for decades without being questioned by anyone. The US, for instance, never lectured Israel for Mossad's countless extraterritorial activities overseas. India is cooperating with the US in the Vikas Yadav case. It wants to cooperate with Canada in its investigation of Hardeep Singh Nijjar's murder upon receipt of credible evidence.</p>

<p>Jaishankar's view isn't just an Indian perspective—countries across the Global South, and even some in the West, are getting increasingly fed up with the blatant foreign policy double standards.</p>

<h2><strong>'Ajax' To 'Condor', CIA's Myriad Assassination Plots</strong></h2>

<p>The US government's own report on assassination plots involving foreign leaders reveals some shocking truths about the CIA's covert operations overseas. The report&nbsp;<i>Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders</i>&nbsp;wasn't fully declassified and released until July 23, 2002. The report, also known as the Church Committee report, investigated alleged CIA assassination plots against foreign leaders, including Cuba's Fidel Castro and Congo's Patrice Lumumba. The report also mentions other foreign leaders who were targeted for assassination, although their names were not disclosed.</p>

<p>Despite the White House's efforts to bury the report, the Church Committee conducted a thorough investigation into the CIA's assassination plots. It confirmed the CIA's involvement in these plots and recommended legislation to prohibit assassinations. The reports also raised important questions about the ethics and legality of targeted killings, which remain relevant today. And yet, the CIA often disregards its rule books and ethical standards.</p>

<p>Some of its notable plots were&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Operation Ajax (1953)</strong>: Successfully overthrew Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, consolidating Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's power. This was a joint operation between the CIA and Britain's MI6.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Bay of Pigs Invasion (1961): </strong>Failed to overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro, resulting in embarrassment to the US and loss of life.</li>
	<li><strong>Operation Condor (1970s-1980s):</strong> Supported Latin American dictatorships in eliminating leftist opposition, leading to human rights abuses.</li>
</ul>

<p>In more recent times, the CIA's extraterritorial actions in the Middle East, especially during the ‘War on Terror', have had long-term destabilising effects. US drone strikes, covert actions in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have sometimes led to increased radicalisation. While these operations are aimed at counterterrorism, the resulting instability often fuels new cycles of violence and anti-American sentiment.</p>

<h2><strong>Mossad's Misdemeanours</strong></h2>

<p>Many experts in the West are bracing for a fiery Israeli strike on Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 missile attack. But here's the catch—it may not come from the skies at all. Instead of sending jets and missiles, Israel could very well stick to its trusted playbook: cyberattacks or political assassinations. After all, these methods have proven highly effective in the past, often executed with the help of local assets within Iran. So, while everyone waits for a military show of force, Israel might be quietly sharpening its digital knives or preparing for another covert strike that leaves no fingerprints but sends a very loud message.</p>

<p>It is widely believed, and not disputed by Israel, that Mossad has been actively involved in covert operations inside Iran for years, particularly targeting Iran's nuclear programme. One might recall the cyberattack using the Stuxnet virus, which disrupted uranium enrichment in 2010. In 2018, Mossad is believed to have stolen 55,000 pages of documents and 183 CDs from Iran's nuclear archives, revealing the country's nuclear programme details.</p>

<p>However, Mossad's most high-profile and controversial actions have been the assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists. These operations are believed to be part of a broader Israeli strategy to delay or dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities, which Israel sees as an existential threat. Between 2010 and 2012, at least five Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated in Tehran in a series of precision attacks that many attributed to Mossad. Israel has not commented on them. The most notable method involved motorcyclists attaching magnetic bombs to the victims' cars during busy commutes. The victims included Majid Shahriari, a key figure in Iran's nuclear research, and Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a prominent scientist at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility. These killings sent shockwaves through Iran's scientific community, severely damaging its nuclear programme and provoking outrage from Tehran, which accused Israel and the West of orchestrating the murders.</p>

<h2><strong>The Strikes On Iran's Nuclear Ambitions</strong></h2>

<p>The most striking assassination occurred in 2020 when Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, considered the father of Iran's nuclear weapons programme, was killed in a highly sophisticated operation. Reports suggested the use of a satellite-controlled machine gun to eliminate Fakhrizadeh near Tehran. This assassination was a major blow to Iran's nuclear ambitions. Mossad's operations inside Iran demonstrate the agency's deep penetration into the country and its relentless efforts to undermine Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>Iranian secret agents have also been active against Israel, with the Israeli government successfully foiling Iranian plots to assassinate Israelis in Israel, Cyprus and elsewhere.</p>

<h2><strong>MI6 And Its Legacy Spy Network</strong></h2>

<p>The United Kingdom, as the original colonial power, practically wrote the book on covert operations. MI6, founded in 1909 as the Empire's main Secret Intelligence Service, was tasked with protecting British interests worldwide—sometimes by any means necessary. One of its most infamous escapades was its role in the 1953 coup against Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, a man who dared to nationalise Iran's oil, threatening Britain's golden pipeline. As mentioned above, the MI6 teamed up with the CIA for Operation Ajax, toppling Mossadegh and reinstalling the Shah, whose authoritarian reign would last until the 1979 revolution.</p>

<p>In more recent times, especially during the early 2000s, MI6 found itself embroiled in another scandal, this time involving Libya. Partnering again with the CIA, MI6 was accused of helping to render Libyan dissidents back to Gaddafi's regime, where they were tortured. The most prominent case was that of Abdel Hakim Belhaj, an opposition leader kidnapped and sent to Libya allegedly with MI6's help. After years of legal battles, Belhaj won an apology from Prime Minister Theresa May in 2018.</p>

<h2><strong>India's RAW Power</strong></h2>

<p>India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was established in 1968 as the nation's primary external intelligence agency. While RAW has gained significant prominence within the global intelligence community, its capabilities still trail behind those of the CIA, Mossad, and MI6. With a reported budget of around $700 million, RAW operates on a fraction of the resources available to the CIA, whose budget hovers between $18-20 billion. Its main mandate is national security, with a sharp focus on counterterrorism—disrupting terror outfits, cutting off funding to extremists, and monitoring state enemies abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, RAW does not operate with unchecked power. Its operations are governed by strict directives from the Indian government and, at least on paper, must adhere to Indian laws. While RAW plays a crucial role in safeguarding the nation, it is by no means a rogue agency; it works within the limits of its mandate, with each mission requiring government approval.</p>

<p>From the CIA's colossal resources and Mossad's precision strikes to MI6's legacy of colonial espionage and RAW's rising influence, these agencies navigate the murky waters of international politics and&nbsp;diplomacy.&nbsp;Yet, they remain indispensable tools of statecraft in an increasingly complex world.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Kami Viswanathan discussed the importance of “increasing the representation” of women in the logistics and supply chain sector]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"There is a lot more work to be done," said Kami Viswanathan, President of FedEx for the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent and Africa, as she addressed the challenges women face in traditionally male-dominated fields like logistics. Speaking at the NDTV World Summit, where the theme "Women Shaping the Future" resonated deeply, she highlighted FedEx's commitment to building a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. "Currently, 36 per cent of our board comprises women, and we have 26 per cent women across management globally," she said.</p>

<p>As India strives to become a $5 trillion economy, the contribution of women will be vital in achieving this ambitious goal. Today, women-led businesses are thriving across various sectors, including technology, healthcare, education and e-commerce. The panel discussion at the summit showcased how women are breaking barriers and setting new benchmarks.</p>

<p>Kami Viswanathan discussed the importance of "increasing the representation" of women in logistics and supply chains, saying that "includes changing preconceptions and biases."</p>

<p>She pointed out the critical issue of high middle management drop-off rates among women due to societal expectations around caregiving. She said, "Typically, we see a drop-off in women's participation due to added responsibilities and societal expectations around child care, elder care and so forth."</p>

<p>The panel also included Preeti Bajaj, CEO and MD of Luminous Power Technologies, who shared her insights on fostering an inclusive environment in the energy sector. Ms Bajaj highlighted that her senior leadership team comprises 33 per cent women and stressed the need for equity in access to opportunities. "The first A is access, equity of access to opportunities."</p>

<p>"Make sure that you're intentional about the calibre of women and they're getting equal representations on recruitment lists and that we are able to address the biases sometimes that come in," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The second bit is ambition," Preeti Bajaj said, adding, "Women have to aspire to field roles to get to senior leadership roles."</p>

<p>Ms Bajaj also articulated a call to action for women in the energy sector, declaring, "This is a revolutionary time in energy. We should be part of it so that we are part of the 2047 Viksit Bharat, so to speak," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Padmaja Ruparel, Co-Founder of IAN Group, reflected on her early days in the field. "When I started life in this field, there wasn't anybody, and that was the fun of it," she said. She emphasised how her journey involved a lot of "adaptation, education and evolution," which she believed was tied to a woman's intuition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an early-stage investor, Padmaja Ruparel stressed the importance of entrepreneurs. She said, "I can't be an investor if there are no entrepreneurs." However, she pointed out the troubling reality of India's women entrepreneurs, describing the growth as "very abysmal," with only 14.7 per cent of funding going to women in 2022, dropping further to 9.7 per cent in 2023. She found this decline "not encouraging."</p>

<p>Throughout the discussion, Kami Viswanathan stressed FedEx's commitment to building a culture of "diversity, equity and inclusion". "Our DEI Council sets priorities and tracks progress," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"And we have a program called 'Walk in Someone Else's Shoes' that helps build empathy for people of different diverse backgrounds and so forth. I think there is a lot more to be done. It's an ongoing journey for us," Kami Viswanathan added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American businessman Darwin Deason's La Jolla estate, ‘The Sandcastle', has been listed for $108 million, a potential record-breaking price for San Diego County real estate. If sold at the asking price, it would surpass the current record of $44 million, held by billionaire Egon Durban, who bought a Del Mar oceanfront property earlier this year.<br />
<br />
Mr Deason's estate spans nearly 13,000 square feet and features stone columns, balconies and a private elevated beach. The interior is inspired by old-world Europe, with gold accents, marble floors and mosaics. The guest house is modelled after Versailles's Le Petit Trianon. The billionaire, who founded Affiliated Computer Services and sold it to Xerox for over $6 billion in 2009, purchased the estate and a neighbouring parcel for $26 million that same year. He has since invested an estimated $60 million into its construction.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr Deason enlisted renowned designer Timothy Corrigan, who has designed for Hollywood elites and royalty, to craft the interiors. Designed with French elegance and inspired by the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, the estate features custom-made furnishings, a dining room that seats 16 and a nautically themed bar. The grounds include a pool, fitness centre and a beachfront boathouse with slate roof tiles imported from China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Deason also brought in $40,000 of imported sand to match Augusta National Golf Club's signature white shade. “Everyone who watches the golf tournament knows it is a spectacular shade of white,” he told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/a-billionaire-built-a-cliffside-version-of-versailles-now-its-asking-108-million-848fbaaa?mod=real-estate_lead_story" rel="nofollow,noindex">The Wall Street Journal</a>, which first reported the listing. The property also includes two natural caves at its base.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the lavish design, Mr Deason, a Dallas-based businessman, says he doesn't use the property as much as his other homes. “In the history of La Jolla, there has never been and will never be another property built on the waterfront like The Sandcastle due to the present oceanfront construction standards established by the State of California,” agents Brett Dickinson and Ross Clark from Compass said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge instructed Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, to turn over valuables and his luxury Manhattan apartment on Tuesday to two election workers he was found to have defamed.</p>

<p>In December 2023, a federal jury in Washington ordered him to pay $148 million to Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea "Shaye" Moss for repeatedly making false claims that they engaged in 2020 election fraud.</p>

<p>Mr Giuliani was found liable in 2023 by US District Judge Beryl Howell of defaming Freeman and Moss, both Fulton County poll workers, with his 2020 election lies on behalf of former president Trump.</p>

<p>An eight-person federal jury awarded Freeman and Moss more than $16 million each for defamation, $20 million each for emotional distress and $75 million in punitive damages.</p>

<p>Mr Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December 2023 over the order.</p>

<p>"Defendant is ordered... to transfer all personal property specified in the list below... including cash accounts, jewelry and valuables, a legal claim for unpaid attorneys' fees, and his interest in his Madison Avenue co-op apartment," according to a Manhattan court filing.</p>

<p>Mr Giuliani has seven days to make the transfer to a receivership under the control of Freeman and Moss, it said.</p>

<p>The former mayor of New York, who led Trump's legal efforts to overturn the results of the election, posted a video of Freeman and Moss that falsely accused them of engaging in fraud during ballot counting and made numerous other baseless claims about them.</p>

<p>Freeman and Moss, who are Black, told the jury during the defamation trial that Mr Giuliani's false accusations had upended their lives and made them the target of racist threats.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India and China have decided to bury the hatchet, almost and for now. As a result, there will be a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping today on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. In a major breakthrough that can potentially end the over four-year-long military standoff, the two neighbours have reached an agreement on patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh "leading to disengagement."</p>

<p>While the militaries of the two nations had already pulled back from four of six friction points in eastern Ladakh, including the Galwan Valley, the site of a violent clash in June 2020, the latest pact pertains to patrolling in Depsang and Demchok areas. With this, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar confirmed that the agreement on border patrols signalled that "the disengagement process with China has been completed".</p>

<h2><strong>A Long-Drawn Conflict</strong></h2>

<p>The two formidable military forces have been locked in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation since May 2020, with New Delhi making it clear that there cannot be any normalcy in the bilateral relationship till the situation is not restored to pre-2020 status at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Galwan incident of June 15, 2020, which was the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades and the deadliest since the 1962 war, resulted in India losing 20 soldiers and the PLA losing as many as 40 personnel, even though China has acknowledged only four casualties.</p>

<p>This has been a major inflexion point in Indian policy towards China as well as the wider geopolitical churn shaping the Indo-Pacific. New Delhi dramatically recalibrated its ties with Beijing across a full range of sectors and mobilised at a national level to take the China challenge head-on. From foreign policy to economy, from infrastructure to people-to-people engagement, a re-appraisal was undertaken and a recalibration was the result. China's belligerence was met with an unprecedented Indian resoluteness as a whole-of-government approach exemplified a newfound willingness in New Delhi to not shy away from taking difficult decisions.</p>

<h2><strong>India Is More Prepared Now</strong></h2>

<p>And it is this resolve by New Delhi that seems to have paid off with the agreement on disengagement. There are lots of issues that remain shrouded in secrecy and will only reveal themselves once the details of the new pact are out. As India looks for a return to status quo ante, the massive infrastructure that China has created along the border with India is unlikely to disappear any time soon. What has happened, as a result, however, is that India has managed to get its act together on the infrastructure front as well. So, unlike the pre-May 2020 period, Indian logistical presence along the border is much stronger, and, hopefully, there won't be any let up in its building up of its own infrastructure on its side of the border.</p>

<p>The other issue is related to how China is perceived in India now. Whatever the diplomatese, the reality remains that trust in Beijing, which was already low, seems to have completely disappeared not only in the Indian political establishment but also in the society at large. It is for China now to rebuild that trust, not through its words but by its actions. Repeated violations of agreements have now led to a new reality where any new pact with China will struggle to regain legitimacy in the eyes of ordinary Indians, making the job of Indian diplomats even harder. After all, there was an attempt to create a 'Wuhan spirit' after the Doklam debacle, only to lead to Galwan!</p>

<h2><strong>Can China Accept India As A Peer?</strong></h2>

<p>Moreover, while the latest agreement can be the starting point for rebuilding confidence between the two neighbours, the border problem is a manifestation of a wider issue facing Sino-Indian relations. The two rising powers are now structural rivals, and the inability of China to accept India as a peer or to be sensitive to New Delhi's core security concerns has been at the heart of deteriorating ties between the two Asian giants. This latest agreement does nothing to alter that reality.</p>

<p>For Indians at large, the question still remains whether China indeed wants to move towards a lasting solution to the boundary dispute, or whether this is another tactical attempt at buying time as both China and India continue their ascent in the global interstate hierarchy. Nonetheless, what is clear is that New Delhi's resolve in frontally challenging China's expansionism has paid off. Even as India would be engaging with China after the latest agreement, it would be worth remembering that there is no substitute for building inherent capacity and leveraging external partnerships to effectively manage a potentially malevolent China.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump has threatened to upend NATO, cut a quick deal with Russia over Ukraine and impose trade tariffs if he wins November's presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European nations are nervously eyeing the nail-biting US election that will bring the radically different approach of either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris to the White House.</p>

<p>Trump has threatened to upend NATO, cut a quick deal with Russia over Ukraine and impose trade tariffs if he wins November's presidential election.</p>

<p>Harris has stressed the importance of NATO and decried Trump's tariffs as a hidden sales tax.</p>

<p>It is no secret that most European officials would prefer the more predictable Democratic vice president rather than the volatile Republican take the reins at such a perilous moment.</p>

<p>Ahead of the ballot, here are some of the biggest worries for Europe:</p>

<p><strong>NATO</strong></p>

<p>Trump unleashed a firestorm on the campaign trail by saying he would encourage Russia to do "whatever the hell" it wants with NATO members not spending enough on defence.</p>

<p>The broadside was the latest from the ex-reality TV star to rattle the alliance that has underpinned Europe's security for 75 years.</p>

<p>Having already weathered four years of Trump in charge, NATO diplomats insist the nightmare prospect of Washington pulling out remains distant.</p>

<p>To head off his criticism, European nations have played up their increased defence spending since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>This year 23 of NATO's 32 members are set to hit the target of 2 percent of GDP -- up from three a decade ago.</p>

<p>"It's a Trumpian way of doing business, it's the way he says it, but it's a totally reasonable message on the necessity for Europe to do more," said one European diplomat.</p>

<p>If Harris wins, the tone towards NATO is set to be notably warmer. She has echoed President Joe Biden's pledge to stand strong with US allies.</p>

<p>But even under Harris, European countries expect major pressure to keep increasing defence spending.</p>

<p>And as the United States increasingly focuses on its rivalry with China, there is a sense that either way Europe will have to take more responsibility for its security in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine</strong></p>

<p>While European officials are hopeful they could talk Trump down from undermining NATO, there are more questions swirling over US backing for Ukraine.</p>

<p>The United States and EU nations have given the bulk of support for Kyiv in a fight many in Europe see as an existential struggle for the continent's security.</p>

<p>While European countries combined have provided some $130 billion, Washington alone has come up with $90 billion, according to a tracker from the Kiel Institute.</p>

<p>Former president Trump has cast doubt on US help for Ukraine and insists he could do a deal with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to end the war in one day.</p>

<p>European officials say that should Trump pull the plug they would try to keep Ukraine afloat, but that would likely only keep Kyiv going until it was forced to accept a deal.</p>

<p>"But I'm not sure Trump will withdraw. He could call Putin, not get the deal he wants and decide to fully support Ukraine, said one diplomat. "You never know with him."</p>

<p>Like Biden, Harris has pledged to maintain Washington's firm backing for Kyiv.</p>

<p>But European diplomats say that she likely will not be as personally invested as Biden, and as the war drags on into a third year calls to end it somehow will grow.</p>

<p><strong>Trade</strong></p>

<p>The EU believes this time it will be battle-ready if Trump wins and follows through on threats to impose tariffs on imports to the United States.</p>

<p>The European Commission, the EU's executive arm in charge of trade policy, has set up a team to ready plans for a Harris or Trump win.</p>

<p>"The EU is much better prepared for another Trump administration," an EU diplomat said.</p>

<p>The team is however preparing for different scenarios and "unlike last time, we have various trade tools", the diplomat said.</p>

<p>There has been much talk of a "list" of US products the EU could slap tariffs on, but European officials and diplomats insist this would be a last-resort measure.</p>

<p>The first test for the EU and the United States under any new administration will be in March, when a truce relating to US steel and aluminium tariffs expires.</p>

<p>Trump in 2018 slapped high duties on steel and aluminium coming from many countries, sweeping up EU exports in the process. When Biden came to power, he kept the tariffs in place but granted suspensions for EU exporters.</p>

<p>Brussels fears Trump will impose higher tariffs while Harris, although unlikely to be soft, would maintain "dialogue in good faith", the EU diplomat said.</p>

<p>"There'll be a continued focus on trying to find those areas of cooperation, trying to avoid unnecessary conflict under a Harris administration," said Greta Peisch, a former General Counsel for the US Trade Representative.</p>

<p>Peisch, now a partner at US law firm Wiley, told AFP Harris would represent a "continuation" of Biden's administration, noting that under Trump, it could be more complicated.</p>

<p>"I think that there were areas of cooperation, but in the Trump administration, there was also more of a willingness to be confrontational on trade issues."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The giant arthropod ‘Arthropleura', which roamed the Earth over 300 million years ago, combined traits of millipedes and centipedes, new fossils have revealed. These fossils, from juvenile specimens, were found in France and have finally solved a nearly 200-year-old mystery about the creature's head structure. It also offers fresh insights into its lifestyle and evolutionary relationships.</p>

<p>Arthropods, a diverse group of invertebrates, are known for their segmented bodies, jointed legs and exoskeletons. This group includes insects, crustaceans, and arachnids, but Arthropleura holds a particularly important place in history as the largest arthropod ever to live on Earth.</p>

<p>First discovered in Great Britain in 1854, fossils of Arthropleura showed that adults could reach a massive 8.5 feet in length. However, until now, no fossils with preserved heads were found, making it difficult to determine whether Arthropleura was a predator like centipedes or a detritivore like modern millipedes.</p>

<p>This recent discovery, detailed in the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp6362 " rel="nofollow,noindex">Science Advances</a>&nbsp;on October 9, is considered a breakthrough. Using advanced scanning techniques such as micro-computed tomography and synchrotron imagery, researchers analysed the fossils encased in stone without damaging them. The scans revealed intricate details, including antennae, mandibles, eyes and feeding structures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Dr Greg Edgecombe, a palaeontologist at London's Natural History Museum, “Millipedes and centipedes are actually each other's closest relative,” a point illustrated by the features found in the Arthropleura fossils.</p>

<p>The findings suggest that Arthropleura likely wasn't a predator. With no venom fangs or specialised predatory legs, the creature probably lived a lifestyle similar to modern detritus-eating millipedes. “They were probably more like the detritus-eating millipedes alive today,” Mr Edgecombe added.</p>

<p>The creature's stalked eyes – more commonly seen in aquatic arthropods like crabs – raise the possibility that it may have lived a partially amphibious life. “Today, stalked eyes are a typical feature of aquatic arthropods like crabs or shrimps,” explained Mickael Lheritier, lead author of the study. Future discoveries, particularly of its respiratory system, could further shed light on Arthropleura's connection to water, he said.</p>

<p>James C. Lamsdell, a geology professor at West Virginia University, praised the discovery, noting that these “remarkable findings” offer a new understanding of this long-extinct giant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Thousands of artists including ABBA singer Bjorn Ulvaeus, Hollywood actress Julianne Moore and Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro have signed a statement warning about the unlicensed use of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Some 11,500 stars of music, literature, screen and stage had put their names to the&nbsp;statement by Tuesday, as fears mount over tech companies using existing creative works to train up AI models without permission from their original creators.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"The unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted," says the brief statement.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">In Hollywood, studios have been experimenting with AI in recent years, from bringing late movie stars back using realistic "digital replicas," to using computer-generated background figures to reduce the number of actors needed for battle scenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Similar fears have gripped other creative industries.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The statement was organized by British composer and former AI executive Ed Newton-Rex, the Guardian reported.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Newton-Rex told the newspaper that generative AI companies including his former employer Stability AI were using copyrighted contented to train their models without paying the original creators.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"When AI companies call this 'training data,' they dehumanize it. What we're talking about is people's work -- their writing, their art, their music," he said.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Last year, authors including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and George RR Martin sued OpenAI for "systematic theft on a mass scale."</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Hollywood stars including Pedro Pascal, Jane Fonda and Mark Hamill last month backed a sweeping AI safety bill in California that was ultimately vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Other artists have chosen to collaborate with AI.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Facebook owner Meta last week announced that Hollywood actor Casey Affleck and horror studio Blumhouse were partnering to test its AI movie generating software by making a series of short films.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Among other famous signatories to Monday's statement were Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, author James Patterson and actor Kevin Bacon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ivanka Trump took her 13-year-old daughter, Arabella, along with her friends to the Taylor Swift concert in Miami, despite her father, Donald Trump, once publicly declaring he hated the 14-time Grammy Award-winner.</p>

<p>The singer's Eras Tour was in Miami at the Hard Rock Stadium over the weekend. Among the famous names in the crowd was Ivanka “to see one of her daughter's favourite artists,” sources told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://pagesix.com/2024/10/22/entertainment/ivanka-trump-takes-daughter-to-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-in-miami/" rel="nofollow,noindex">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>Their outing comes weeks after Swift endorsed US Vice President and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for the November 5 US presidential election, prompting Donald Trump to issue a statement on social media that read, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”</p>

<p>Arabella, who celebrates her birthday in July, earlier showed her love for Swift through a theme-based birthday cake decorated with lyrics from the 2014 single Blank Space -- 'Boys only want love if it's torture.'</p>

<p>Earlier, Ivanka shared a few photographs from her daughter's birthday party on Instagram. In one of the images, she wrote, "Best cake for my favourite Swiftie”.</p>

<p>On September 11, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/shell-pay-for-it-says-donald-trump-after-taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-6542169">Swift extended support to Harris</a> in a lengthy post on Instagram. "I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," she wrote, adding that Harris is "steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos."</p>

<p>In her viral post, she also called out the fake AI image of herself endorsing Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me' falsely endorsing Donald Trump's presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI and the dangers of spreading misinformation," she said.</p>

<p>Swift signed off her post as “Childless cat lady”, taking a dig at Trump's running mate JD Vance. Her endorsement post came after Trump and Harris' presidential debate last month.</p>

<p>Responding to Swift's support for Harris, Trump said in an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-taylor-swift-endorsing-harris-just-question-time" rel="nofollow,noindex">Fox &amp; Friends</a>, "I was not a Taylor Swift fan... It was just a question of time... But she's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the climate crisis deepens, scientists have been pondering ways to cool the planet. A new study proposes to spray millions of tonnes of diamond dust in the Earth's upper atmosphere every year to cool it down. The study, published in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL110575" rel="nofollow,noindex">Geophysical Research Letters</a> journal, was conducted by a multi-institutional team of climatologists, meteorologists and Earth scientists. The team found evidence based on 3D climate models that compared aerosols that may be utilised to cool the planet.</p>

<p>Prior studies suggested that Earth was at or nearing its tipping point, causing significant changes to global weather patterns. With time, the planet will continue to grow warmer.</p>

<p>Experts, therefore, have argued the only solution to this issue is cooling the planet. Among other suggestions, scientists have also advised deploying millions of devices to pull carbon from the air that could later be sequestered.</p>

<p>However, a problem with this idea is that if the Earth has already reached its tipping point, simply removing carbon from the air won't help. Scientists will have to look out for ways to not just put a brake on warming but also to actively cool down the planet, Phys.org reported.</p>

<p>The latest proposed solution is injecting aerosols into the atmosphere. It will reflect heat and sunlight into the space.</p>

<p>To find a solution, the team of researchers in their latest study tried to look for material that could best serve as the best medium to cool the planet.</p>

<p>For this, they came up with the idea of building a 3D climate model, showing the impact of spreading aerosols into the atmosphere. This also included effects of different aerosols such as light and heat reflection, meaning how it would eventually settle to the ground and whether these aerosols would clump together in the atmosphere, thereby retaining more heat.</p>

<p>In their study, the team modeled the impact on the Earth of injections of calcite, silicon carbide, diamond, aluminum, anatase, rutile and sulfur dioxide.</p>

<p>Ultimately, they concluded that diamond dust was the best option because its particles go on to reflect the most light and heat, besides staying aloft for a longer duration. Another positive side of it is that since they are chemically inert, they may not react to form acid rain.</p>

<p>In their study, the researchers found that the Earth could be cooled down by at least 1.6 degree Celsius in 45 years if 5 million tons of synthetic diamond dust is injected into the atmosphere. A downside, though, is that it will cost approximately $200 trillion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

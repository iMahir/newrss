       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's presidential election victory has brought optimism to India-US relations, with key appointments and initiatives signalling a stronger partnership between the two nations. Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz, Vivek Ramaswamy and Kash Patel are expected to play pivotal roles in shaping this relationship.</p>

<p>Marco Rubio</p>

<p>India is breathing a sigh of relief following Donald Trump's US election victory, thanks to his likely pick for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio. Rubio has consistently backed stronger US-India ties to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, and his pro-India and anti-Pakistan stance is music to India's ears.</p>

<p>Rubio's bill, introduced in July, aims to bolster the US-India partnership and counter China's expanding influence. He believes increasing strategic relations with New Delhi is crucial, especially given India's struggles against Communist China's aggression. The bill proposes treating India on par with US allies like Japan, Israel, and South Korea regarding technology transfers, supporting India's response to territorial threats.</p>

<p>During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US in 2023, Rubio released a statement saying, “…it is crucial that the Biden Administration, and the U.S. Congress, prioritise this incredibly important relationship. Our nations' economic and security interests overlap on many of the most pressing issues, especially the growing hostility of the Chinese Communist Party in the Himalayas and in the Indian Ocean.”</p>

<p>This potential status would solidify India-US tech and military ties. Additionally, the bill seeks to bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if found sponsoring terrorism against India. Rubio has historically been critical of Pakistan, urging former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to designate it a "country of particular concern" for religious freedom violations in 2017.</p>

<p>Overall, Trump's victory and Rubio's nomination bring optimism for India-US relations, promising a stronger, more strategic partnership.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz</p>

<p>President Trump's appointment of Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor is expected to strengthen US-India ties, particularly in defence. Waltz, a vocal China critic and co-chair of the Congressional India Caucus, has long advocated for deeper cooperation between the two nations to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His leadership may lead to expanded military cooperation, joint exercises, and enhanced sharing of defence technologies, aligning US and Indian strategic interests.</p>

<p>As a China hawk, Waltz's appointment is particularly promising for India, which has its own geopolitical concerns about China's growing aggression. Waltz's criticism of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also aligns with India's concerns. Overall, Waltz's appointment is expected to enhance US-India cooperation in both security and economic spheres.</p>

<p>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy</p>

<p>The Department of Government Efficiency, co-led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is set to revolutionise the US government's inner workings by slashing bureaucracy and streamlining operations. While this initiative isn't directly linked to foreign policy, it could have a ripple effect, making it easier for Indian businesses to operate in the US and vice versa, thus boosting US-India economic cooperation.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump begins his second term, strengthening US-India relations remains a top priority, with a sharp focus on countering China's growing influence and expanding bilateral partnerships in key areas like defence, trade, and technology. The foundation for this cooperation was laid during Trump's first term, with significant developments in strategic cooperation and shared geopolitical goals.</p>

<p>With the US Congress set to confirm the electoral results on January 6, 2025, and the presidential inauguration scheduled for January 20, 2025, India can expect a strengthened partnership with the United States under Trump's second term.</p>

<p>Kash Patel</p>

<p>Apart from the cabinet, there is also Kashyap "Kash" Patel who majorly lost out on an important role - CIA chief. It has now been bagged by John Ratcliffe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Kash Patel being in the administration could have significant implications. He is an Indian-origin American attorney and as a loyalist to Trump, Patel's appointment may strengthen ties between the two nations, particularly in counter-terrorism efforts.</p>

<p>His personal experience as an immigrant has shaped his views on immigration, leading him to back Donald Trump's tough stance on the issue. Patel advocates for securing borders while still allowing lawful immigration, striking a balance between national security and economic needs. This nuanced approach reflects his background as the son of Indian immigrants and his own journey to becoming a key figure in Trump's administration.</p>

<p>As Trump begins his second term, strengthening US-India relations remains a top priority, focusing on countering China's influence and expanding bilateral partnerships in defence, trade, and technology. With key appointments and initiatives in place, India can expect a strengthened partnership with the United States.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Republicans in the US Senate picked John Thune as the chamber's new leader Wednesday as lawmakers scrambling to prepare for President-elect Donald Trump's new administration rejected his camp's favored candidate.</p>

<p>Thune, who already holds a junior leadership position, bested John Cornyn of Texas in a run-off to replace outgoing party leader Mitch McConnell, having already seen off Florida's Rick Scott, who was seen as most aligned with Trump.</p>

<p>"This Republican team is united behind President Trump's agenda, and our work starts today," Thune, who represents South Dakota, said in a brief statement.</p>

<p>The Senate -- the upper chamber of Congress -- jealously guards its independence and institutional authority, and its leadership election was seen as a clue into how much leeway members intend to give Trump.</p>

<p>Cornyn had the longer history in the chamber, while Thune was always seen as most aligned with the traditionalist wing of the party led by McConnell.</p>

<p>Trump insiders had preferred Scott, an ardent loyalist who had promised to do the president-elect's bidding.</p>

<p>Trump's allies campaigned aggressively against Thune and Cornyn, pressuring individual senators in a push that has sparked a backlash -- but Trump was wary of Scott's unpopularity and did not publicly endorse him.</p>

<p>Trump threw down a challenge Sunday to any prospective leader, demanding that they allow "recess appointments" -- the naming of cabinet members while the Senate is adjourned, bypassing the body's normal confirmation process.</p>

<p>Thune -- along with the others -- passed Trump's loyalty test by replying that he was open to the idea.</p>

<p>Scott's cheerleaders -- a group that includes tech billionaire and Trump confidant Elon Musk, and far-right media personality Tucker Carlson -- questioned Thune's commitment to the incoming president, dredging up past opposition.</p>

<p><strong>Decisive win</strong></p>

<p>Trump is expected to further test lawmakers with a series of controversial moves, not least pardoning many of the people convicted of crimes related to the 2021 storming of the Capitol.</p>

<p>Other members have winced at the Republican president-elect's plans for steep, across-the-board import tariffs, although most are behind his tax cut extension -- which is expected to add significantly to the national debt.</p>

<p>The House and the Senate kicked off their frantic "lame-duck" session on Tuesday.</p>

<p>California is still counting ballots, but Republicans are widely expected to keep the House, handing the party total control of Washington after they claimed the Senate and White House last week.</p>

<p>The top priority for both parties in both chambers is funding the government to keep federal agencies open after December 20, with Republicans mulling a stop-gap measure that would keep the lights on into March.</p>

<p>The entire House of Representatives -- Democrats as well as Republicans -- gets to vote on the speaker, meaning Mike Johnson has to wait until the new Congress convenes in January to find out if he can hang on to the gavel.</p>

<p>"Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate, it's true. It was a decisive win across the nation," Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The American people want us to implement and deliver that America First agenda."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden welcomed Donald Trump back to the White House on Wednesday, in a show of civility to a bitter rival who failed to extend him the same courtesy four years ago.</p>

<p>The US president and president-elect shook hands in front of a roaring fire in the Oval Office as they pledged a smooth transition -- a stark contrast to Trump's refusal to recognize his 2020 defeat.</p>

<p>"Welcome back," Biden, 81, said as he congratulated the 78-year-old Trump and offered brief opening remarks to the man he has repeatedly slammed as a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>Biden, who dropped out of the election in July but saw his successor Kamala Harris lose to Trump last week, said he was "looking forward to having a smooth transition" and pledged to do "everything we can to make sure you're accommodated."</p>

<p>As the two presidents with a combined age of 159 years shook hands, Biden appeared to look down while Trump leaned forward and looked him in the eyes.</p>

<p>Trump riled up a mob that attacked the US Capitol in 2021 and ran a brutal and divisive election campaign this year -- but sought to strike a gracious tone on his return visit to the White House.</p>

<p>"Politics is tough, and in many cases it's not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I appreciate it very much," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump added that the transfer of power would be "smooth as you can get" -- despite the fact that his transition team has not yet signed some key legal documents ahead of his inauguration as president on January 20.</p>

<p><strong>No Melania</strong></p>

<p>Absent from the occasion was incoming first lady Melania Trump, who was a shadowy presence on the campaign trail and spent much of Trump's first term away from the White House.</p>

<p>Outgoing First Lady Jill Biden joined Biden in welcoming Trump and "gave Mr. Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for Mrs Trump," the White House said.</p>

<p>The only other people in the room for talks after the handshake were Biden's chief of staff Jeff Zients and Trump's incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, the White House said.</p>

<p>Biden was expected to push during the meeting for Trump to continue US support for Ukraine's fight against Russia, which the Republican has called into question.</p>

<p>Biden's Oval Office invitation restored a presidential transition tradition that Trump tore up when he lost the 2020 election, refusing to sit down with Biden or even attend the inauguration.</p>

<p>But by the time Trump took his last flight from the White House lawn on January 20, 2021, he had also been repudiated by many in his own party for having stoked the assault on the Capitol.</p>

<p>That period of disgrace soon evaporated, however, as Republicans returned to Trump's side, recognizing the billionaire's unique electoral power at the head of his right-wing movement.</p>

<p><strong>Third term?</strong></p>

<p>Trump enters his second term with a near total grip on his party and is expected to take both chambers of Congress -- while the Democrats are in disarray.</p>

<p>Ahead of the White House visit, Trump addressed Republicans from the House of Representatives at a Washington hotel.</p>

<p>An ebullient Trump suggested that he could even be open to a third term in office -- which would violate the US constitution.</p>

<p>"I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's good, we got to figure something else,'" he said, drawing some laughter.</p>

<p>Former reality TV star Trump, who has promised to be a "dictator on day one," is moving quickly to fill out his administration, picking a host of ultra-loyalists.</p>

<p>He was accompanied at the meeting with Republicans by the world's richest man Elon Musk, whom he named on Tuesday as head of a new group aimed at slashing government spending.</p>

<p>He also nominated Fox News host and army veteran Pete Hegseth as his incoming defense secretary. An opponent of so-called "woke" ideology in the armed forces, Hegseth has little experience similar to managing the world's most powerful military.</p>

<p>Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem -- an ally who famously wrote about shooting her dog because it did not respond to training -- as head of the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A fresh draft of a UN climate deal released Wednesday offers wide-ranging options to raise funding for poorer countries, signalling that tough negotiations remain at the COP29 talks in Baku.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fresh draft of a UN climate deal released Wednesday offers wide-ranging options to raise funding for poorer countries, signalling that tough negotiations remain at the COP29 talks in Baku.</p>

<p>Landing a new agreement to boost money for climate action in developing countries is the top priority of negotiators at the summit in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>But it is deeply contentious, and consensus has eluded negotiators from nearly 200 nations for the better part of a year.</p>

<p>Most developing countries favour an annual commitment from wealthy countries of at least $1.3 trillion, according to the latest draft of the long-sought climate finance pact.</p>

<p>This figure is more than 10 times the $100 billion annually that a small pool of developed countries -- among them the United States, the European Union and Japan -- currently pay.</p>

<p>Some donors are reluctant to promise large new amounts of public money from their budgets at a time when they face economic and political pressure at home.</p>

<p>"It is their responsibility to convince their electorate," a key negotiator from a developing country told AFP.</p>

<p>An earlier version of the draft was rejected outright by developing countries, which considered the proposed terms weighted too heavily toward wealthy nations.</p>

<p><strong>Three options&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Fresh submissions were called, and the new document summarises three broad positions.</p>

<p>The first argues that rich, industrialised nations most responsible for climate change to date pay from their budgets.</p>

<p>The second option calls for other countries to share the burden, a key demand of developed countries, while the third puts forward a mix of the two.</p>

<p>A bloc of least-developed nations, mostly from Africa, are asking for $220 billion while small-island states at threat from rising seas want $39 billion.</p>

<p>Brazil's environment minister, Marina Silva, said "there is a convergence that these resources must be in the order of trillions" in public and private money.</p>

<p>Another Brazilian official, Andre Correa do Lago, criticised the negotiating tactics of richer nations.</p>

<p>"We think that the discussion was diverted by developed countries instead of responding as they should by the rules of negotiation that are taking place," he told reporters.</p>

<p>Friederike Roder from Global Citizen, a non-government organisation, said the draft proposes "more concrete options" for an agreement on a total amount and "specific objectives" for the poorest and most vulnerable nations.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, this search for precision stops there. The proposals aimed at clearly defining what constitutes climate finance, and ensuring close and transparent monitoring, remain insufficient," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The latest 34-page draft reflects all the options on the table, said David Waskow, director at the World Resources Institute, a think tank.</p>

<p>"Negotiators now need to work to boil it down to some key decisions for the ministers to wrestle with next week," he said.</p>

<p>COP29 runs until November 22 but climate talks often run into overtime.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump thanked President Joe Biden for pledging a smooth transfer of power as the victorious Republican made a historic return visit to the White House on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Politics is tough, and in many cases it's not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I appreciate it very much," Trump said after the two men shook hands in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, added that the transition would be "smooth as you can get."</p>

<p>Biden greeted Trump in front of a roaring fire, offering him congratulations and saying: "Welcome back."</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Biden invited his sworn rival to the White House -- despite the fact that Trump, who refused to admit his 2020 election loss, never afforded Biden the same courtesy.</p>

<p>Biden, who dropped out of the election in July but saw his successor Kamala Harris lose to Trump last week, said he was "looking forward to having a smooth transition."</p>

<p>"We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, (have) what you need," he told Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Triumphant Trump&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Their talks after the public handshake may have been a bitter pill to swallow for Biden, who branded Trump a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>Biden was expected to push during the meeting for Trump to continue US support for Ukraine's fight against Russia, which the Republican has called into question.</p>

<p>Ahead of the White House visit, Trump addressed Republicans from the House of Representatives at a Washington hotel near the Capitol, which a mob of his supporters marched in 2021 to try to reverse his election loss.</p>

<p>An ebullient Trump suggested that he could even be open to a third term in office -- which would violate the US constitution.</p>

<p>"I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's good, we got to figure something else,'" he said, drawing some laughter.</p>

<p>Trump's party looks set to take both chambers of Congress and consolidate his extraordinary comeback.</p>

<p>He was accompanied at the meeting with Republicans by the world's richest man Elon Musk, whom he named on Tuesday as head of a new group aimed at slashing government spending.</p>

<p>Trump has launched a flurry of nominations as he moves swiftly to name his administration.</p>

<p><strong>Picking his team</strong></p>

<p>Biden's Oval Office invitation restored a presidential transition tradition that Trump tore up when he lost the 2020 election, refusing to sit down with Biden or even attend the inauguration.</p>

<p>Then-president Barack Obama had welcomed Trump to the White House when the tycoon won the 2016 election.</p>

<p>But by the time Trump took his last Marine One flight from the White House lawn on January 20, 2021, he had also been repudiated by many in his own party for having stoked the assault on the Capitol.</p>

<p>That period of disgrace soon evaporated, however, as Republicans returned to Trump's side, recognizing his unique electoral power at the head of his right-wing movement.</p>

<p>Trump enters his second term with a near total grip on his party and the Democrats in disarray.</p>

<p>He has spent the week since the election at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida assembling his top team, as the world watches to see how closely he sticks to his pledges of isolationism, mass deportations and sweeping tariffs.</p>

<p>Trump named Space X, Tesla and X boss Musk, and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead a "Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE')" -- a tongue-in-cheek reference to an internet meme and cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Trump is moving quickly to fill out his administration, picking a host of ultra-loyalists.</p>

<p>Trump nominated Fox News host and army veteran Pete Hegseth as his incoming defense secretary. An outspoken opponent of so-called "woke" ideology in the armed forces, Hegseth has little experience similar to managing the mammoth US military budget and bureaucracy.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has tasked Elon Musk with setting up a panel to streamline the US government. Although the president-elect has said little about how this group would operate, Musk has previously set an ambitious goal of cutting $2 trillion of spending.</p>

<p>Here is how this new panel, which will be headed up by Musk, the world's richest person, and former Republican Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, might work.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES MUSK WANT TO CUT?</strong></p>

<p>Musk said at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in October that the federal budget could be reduced by "at least" $2 trillion. Discretionary spending, including defense spending, is estimated to total $1.9 trillion out of $6.75 trillion in total federal outlays for fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office, suggesting Musk's target would be very difficult to meet.</p>

<p>Musk, whose companies include the electric vehicle maker Tesla and commercial space company SpaceX, has a deep knowledge of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon, agencies he has extensive contracts with for rockets, satellites and other space operations.</p>

<p>He has also tussled with regulators within the Department of Transportation, including the Federal Aviation Administration, which has a say in his company's rocket launches, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is investigating autonomous driving functions in his cars.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy, who founded pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences, has worked with the Food and Drug Administration, an agency he has previously called "corrupt". On social media site X in 2023 he added that "Countless FDA regulations and actions are hypocritical, harmful &amp; unconstitutional."</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAVE MUSK AND TRUMP SAID ABOUT THE PANEL?</strong></p>

<p>Trump in a statement on Tuesday said the panel would "provide advice and guidance from outside of government," on slimming down the government, cutting regulations, reducing spending and restructuring federal agencies.</p>

<p>Trump wants to abolish the Department of Education, and leave states in control of schooling, and decimate what he terms the "deep state" - career federal employees he says are clandestinely pursuing their own agendas.</p>

<p>Trump and Musk have suggested the panel will be able to make dramatic cuts, but generally speaking large budgetary actions are the remit of Congress. They can take advice from outside panels like the proposed efficiency panel, or disregard it.</p>

<p>In an effort to be transparent, Musk said the panel will post its "actions" for public comment.</p>

<p>"Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!" he said on X.</p>

<p>He also mentioned a list of "dumb" spending, which he noted would be "extremely entertaining".</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS THE PRECEDENT FOR THE EFFICIENCY PANEL?</strong></p>

<p>Former President Ronald Reagan announced in February 1982 that he would form a group of private sector experts to recommend ways to eliminate inefficiency and waste. That June, he issued an executive order forming the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control in the Federal Government, which became known as the Grace Commission for its chairman J. Peter Grace, the former CEO of W.R. Grace and Co.</p>

<p>Grace raised money to fund the effort through a foundation. About 150 business leaders volunteered their time on an executive committee that oversaw 36 Grace Commission task forces, which reviewed agencies or functions.</p>

<p>The Commission issued a report in January 1984 with some 2,500 recommendations, and the various task forces came out with reports as well.</p>

<p>"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented," the Reagan Library said.</p>

<p>In March 2017, Trump signed an executive order that aimed to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of federal agencies and to "eliminate or reorganize unnecessary federal agencies." It directed each federal agency to submit a proposed plan to reorganize. He also signed a separate executive order to place "regulatory reform" task forces and officers within federal agencies.</p>

<p>Trump also tried to kill at least 19 agencies but was unsuccessful during his first term. He called for eliminating the Overseas Private Investment Corporation that helps spur private investment in foreign development projects and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He also tried to cut funding for Amtrak, subsidies for rural airline service and the Special Olympics.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT EXPERIENCE DOES MUSK HAVE WITH COST CUTTING?</strong></p>

<p>After Musk bought the social media app Twitter, he laid off roughly 3,700 employees, or half its workforce, as advertisers pulled spending. Hundreds more employees subsequently resigned. He later renamed the social media site "X", but its valuation has shrunk dramatically under Musk's ownership.</p>

<p>Musk has had much greater success in space. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket slashed launch costs with its reusability, sprouting new satellite markets and giving rise to the company's fast-growing Starlink constellation, which has disrupted the established satellite communications industry and helped shape modern military strategies and turned SpaceX into a major defense contractor.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE RULES FOR A PANEL LIKE THIS?</strong></p>

<p>The committee would likely operate under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, a 1972 law ensuring panels provide advice that is prompt, objective and open to the public. It also mandates cost controls and record keeping requirements that apply to the roughly 1,000 committees with some 60,000 members advising the President and the executive branch at any given time.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, who has recently been elected for a second term as President of the United States, has told House Republicans that he might consider a constitution-breaking third term in office. President-elect Trump, who has a penchant for making controversial statements, said "I suspect I won't be running again unless you (supporters) say otherwise".</p>

<p>During his speech to fellow Republicans elected to the House of Representatives, Mr Trump said, "I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's good, we got to figure something else'." His statement at a hotel in Washington DC ahead of his meeting with President Joe Biden was cheered by his supporters.</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that there are provisions in place in the US Constitution which restricts a US President from standing for re-election for a third term, but how safe are those safeguards? Here's a look at whether Donald Trump can run again for presidency in 2028.</p>

<p>The 22nd Amendment of the United States Constitution stops any President from running for a third term, so if Donald Trump wants to seek a third term, he will first have to scrap that amendment. Doing so is a daunting task as it requires the President to garner an overwhelming amount of support from Congress as well as state legislatures. This is something that Trump is unlikely to be able to achieve.</p>

<p>According to an article in US-based news website <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vox.com/politics/383616/trump-third-term-constitution-22nd-amendment" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Vox</a>, which interviewed a law professor from Stanford University who specialises in constitutional interpretation, a question about the possibility of such a Constitutional amendment was asked. His reply was clear - "No, there are none. This will be his last run for President," the law professor said.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT IS THE 22nd AMENDMENT?</strong></h2>

<p>The 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution says that a President can have two terms in office and no further. It is applicable to Presidents, both in consecutive and non-consecutive terms.</p>

<p>According to Section 1 of the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term."</p>

<p>While Section 2 states that "This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress."</p>

<h3><strong>HISTORY OF THE 22nd AMENDMENT</strong></h3>

<p>The provision to restrict US Presidents strictly to a maximum of two terms first came into force in 1951, when both Republicans and Democrats had demanded for such a provision to be in place. This was because former US President Franklin D Roosevelt was elected to the highest office for an unprecedented four times. In 1945, he had died in office during his fourth term.</p>

<p>Though Roosevelt was the only President to be elected more than two times, American lawmakers from both parties had decided that the presidential terms must have a ceiling limit, and hence the 22nd Amendment came into force, restricting all Presidents then on to a maximum of two terms.</p>

<p>Since US's first President and founding father George Washington had served for a maximum of two terms, both parties agreed that this was the legacy to be followed.</p>

<h3><strong>CAN AN AMENDMENT IN THE US CONSTITUTION BE REPEALED?</strong></h3>

<p>The checks and balances in place to ensure that an Amendment to the Constitution is not easily repealed are watertight. It dissuades and discourages amendments from being scrapped or repealed. However, it is not impossible.</p>

<p>In order to do so, a bill for such order would have to be agreed to by two-thirds majority (67 per cent) of both the House and the Senate. The House of Representatives has 435 members, of which 290 must vote for such a revocation. Similarly, in the Senate, which has 100 members, 67 must agree with it. That is not all. Should a bill be passed by the House and the Senate, it then goes to each of the states - which need to pass it with a three-fourths majority, and since the United States of America are 50 states, 38 of them would have to agree to it.</p>

<p>It is safe to assume that to cross all three hurdles would be highly unlikely for Donald Trump.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Our latest annual stocktake shows the world is on track to reach a new record: 37.4 billion tonnes of CO emitted from fossil fuels in 2024. This is an increase of 0.8% from the previous year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from fossil fuels continue to increase, year on year. This sobering reality will be presented to world leaders at the international climate conference COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>Our latest annual stocktake shows the world is on track to reach a new record: 37.4 billion tonnes of CO₂ emitted from fossil fuels in 2024. This is an increase of 0.8% from the previous year.</p>

<p>Adopting renewable energy and electric vehicles is helping reduce emissions in 22 countries. But it's not enough to compensate for ongoing global growth in fossil fuels.</p>

<p>There were also signs in 2023 suggesting natural systems may struggle to capture and store as much CO₂ in the future as they have in the past. While humanity is tackling deforestation and the growth in fossil CO₂ emissions is slowing, the need to reach an immediate peak and decline in global emissions has never been so acute.</p>

<h3><br />
The Global Carbon Project</h3>

<p>The Global Carbon Budget is an annual planetary account of carbon sources and sinks, which soak up carbon dioxide and remove it from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We include anthropogenic sources from human activities such as burning fossil fuels or making cement as well as natural sources such as bushfires.</p>

<p>When it comes to CO₂ sinks, we consider all the ways carbon may be taken out of the atmosphere. This includes plants using CO₂ to grow and CO₂ being absorbed by the ocean. Some of this happens naturally and some is being actively encouraged by human activity.</p>

<p>Putting all the available data on sources and sinks together each year is a huge international effort involving 86 research organisations, including Australia's CSIRO. We also use computer models and statistical approaches to fill out the remaining months to the end of the year.</p>

<h3><br />
Fossil fuel emissions up</h3>

<p>This year's growth in carbon emissions from fossil fuels is mainly from fossil gas and oil, rather than coal.</p>

<p>Fossil gas carbon emissions grew by 2.4%, signalling a return to the strong long-term growth rates observed before the COVID pandemic. Gas emissions grew in most large countries, but declined across the European Union.</p>

<p>Oil carbon emissions grew by 0.9% overall, pushed up by a rise in emissions from international aviation and from India.</p>

<p>The rebound in international air travel pushed aviation carbon emissions up 13.5% in 2024, although it's still 3.5% below the pre-COVID 2019 level.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, oil emissions from the United States and China are declining. It's possible oil emissions have peaked in China, driven by growth in electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Coal carbon emissions went up by 0.2%, with strong growth in India, small growth in China, a moderate decline in the US, and a large decline in the European Union. Coal use in the US is now at its lowest level in 120 years.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom closed its last coal power plant in 2024, 142 years after the first one was opened. With strong growth in wind energy replacing coal, the UK CO₂ emissions have almost been cut in half since 1990.</p>

<h3><br />
Changing land use</h3>

<p>Carbon emissions also come from land clearing and degradation. But some of that CO₂ can be taken up again by planting trees. So we need to examine both sources and sinks on land.</p>

<p>Global net CO₂ emissions from land use change averaged 4.1 billion tonnes a year over the past decade (2014-23). This year is likely to be slightly higher than average with 4.2 billion tonnes, due to drought and fires in the Amazon. That amount represents about 10% of all emissions from human activities, the rest owing to fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Importantly, total carbon emissions - the sum of fossil fuel emissions and land-use change emissions - have largely plateaued over the past decade, but are still projected to reach a record of just over 41 billion tonnes in 2024.</p>

<p>The plateau in 2014-23 follows a decade of significant growth in total emissions of 2% per year on average between 2004 and 2013. This shows humanity is tackling deforestation and the growth of fossil CO₂ emissions is slowing. However, this is not enough to put global emissions on a downward trajectory.</p>

<h3><br />
More countries are cutting emissions - but many more to go</h3>

<p>Fossil CO₂ emissions decreased in 22 countries as their economies grew. These countries are mainly from the European Union, along with the United States. Together they represent 23% of global fossil CO₂ emissions over the past decade (2014-23).</p>

<p>This number is up from 18 countries during the previous decade (2004-13). New countries in this list include Norway, New Zealand and South Korea.</p>

<p>In Norway, emissions from road transport declined as the share of electric vehicles in the passenger car fleet grew - the highest in the world at over 25% - and biofuels replaced fossil petrol and diesel. Even greater reductions in emissions have come from Norway's oil and gas sector, where gas turbines on offshore platforms are being upgraded to electric.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, emissions from the power sector are declining. Traditionally the country has had a high share of hydropower, supplemented with coal and natural gas. But now wind and particularly geothermal energy is driving fossil generation down.</p>

<p>We are projecting further emissions growth of 0.2% in China, albeit small and with some uncertainty (including the possibility of no growth or even slight decline). China added more solar panels in 2023 than the US did in its entire history.</p>

<h3><br />
Nature shows troubling signs</h3>

<p>In the 1960s, our activities emitted an average of 16 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year globally. About half of these emissions (8 billion tonnes) were naturally removed from the atmosphere by forests and oceans.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, emissions from human activities reached about 40 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year. Again, about half of these emissions (20 billion tonnes) were removed.</p>

<p>In the absence of these natural sinks, current warming would already be well above 2°C. But there's a limit to how much nature can help.</p>

<p>In 2023, the carbon uptake on land dropped 28% from the decadal average. Global record temperatures, drought in the Amazon and unprecedented wildfires in the forests of Canada were to blame, along with an El Nino event.</p>

<p>As climate change continues, with rising ocean temperatures and more climate extremes on land, we expect the CO₂ sinks to become less efficient. But for now, we expect last year's land sink decline will recover to a large degree as the El Nino event has subsided.</p>

<h3>Looking ahead</h3>

<p>Our latest carbon budget shows global fossil fuel emissions continue to increase, further delaying the peak in emissions. Global CO₂ emissions continue to track in the middle of the range of scenarios developed by the Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We have yet to bend the emissions curve into the 1.5-2°C warming territory of the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>This comes at a time when it's clear we need to be reducing emissions, to avoid worsening climate change.</p>

<p>We also identified some positive signs, such as the rapid adoption of renewable energy and electric cars as they become cheaper and more accessible, supporting the march toward a net-zero emissions pathway. But turning these trends into global decarbonisation requires a far greater level of ambition and action.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin struck a record high above $93,000 Wednesday as the world's biggest cryptocurrency benefits from president-elect Donald Trump's pledge to ease regulation around digital tokens.</p>

<p>The volatile asset has rocketed more than 30 percent in value since Trump won last week's US presidential election, smashing its record-high on several occasions and breaching $90,000 for the first time Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Republican said during campaigning that he planned to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world".</p>

<p>"The main catalyst for the recent surge on the price of bitcoin is the victory of Donald Trump," Alexander Londono, market analyst at ActivTrades, noted Wednesday.</p>

<p>"This is due to the fact that Trump has been an outspoken supporter of cryptocurrencies and is willing to deregulate the sector to make it more investor friendly."</p>

<p>Londono added that the rally "is based on emotions and future expectations, which may or may not become real".</p>

<p><strong>'Broader surge'</strong></p>

<p>Other cryptocurrencies are also benefiting, including Dogecoin, supported by Elon Musk, boss of Tesla.</p>

<p>Bitcoin's "rally and the broader surge across cryptocurrencies have set global markets ablaze, stirring up waves of excitement and speculation", said independent markets analyst Stephen Innes.</p>

<p>Trump on Tuesday announced that Musk, the world's richest man, will lead a new US government-efficiency group tasked with cutting federal waste.</p>

<p>Musk became a key ally to Trump during his campaign, reportedly spending over $100 million to help him win and repeatedly boosting his candidacy on X, the social platform he owns.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<p>The digital currency is created -- or "mined" -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems to validate transactions made on the blockchain.</p>

<p>The previous Trump term as president saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Trump announced in September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch a digital currency platform named World Liberty Financial.</p>

<p>But it had a faltering sales launch earlier this month, with only a fraction of its tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the election, Trump apparently became the first former president to use bitcoin in a purchase, as he bought burgers at a New York City restaurant, which hailed it as a "historic transaction".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, who has been in space since June, has put an end to swirling "rumours" about her health, saying she weighs the same as she did when she arrived at the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>The "rumours" were sparked by recent images of her "gaunt" appearance, where she looked weaker and thinner after spending at least 150 days in space, triggering concerns of rapid weight loss.</p>

<p>"...I think my body has changed a little bit but I weigh the same...," Williams, who is the Space Station Commander, told the media in a video interview that was shared by NASA.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="515" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9UMzOwlv7iM" title="NASA Astronaut Suni Williams Talks with New England Sports Network – Tuesday, November 12, 2024" width="700"></iframe></p>

<p>"There are a lot of changes that go on here... It's funny, I think there's some rumours around that I am losing weight and stuff... No, I am actually right at the same amount... we go weigh ourselves, we have a spring mass... Butch and I weigh ourselves the same way that I was when I got up here," she added.</p>

<p>Ms Williams and her fellow astronaut Barry (Butch) Willmore have been at the ISS for nearly five months. The duo had launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed flight, and arrived at the space station on June 6. They, however, faced delays, space debris threats, helium leaks and technical glitches on the Starliner spacecraft on which they travelled.</p>

<p>On August 24, NASA said it's too risky to bring the two astronauts back to Earth in the troubled new capsule, and they'll have to wait until February for a ride home with SpaceX.</p>

<p>As Ms William's images of "sunken cheeks" and a thinner physique surfaced, the astronaut said the change in appearance was due to a "fluid shift" in the body.</p>

<p>"I think things shift around quite a bit... you have a fluid shift where you know the folks in space... their heads look a bit bigger because the fluids even out along the body. But now, you know, we've been up here for a couple of months, we've been working out here. We've got a bike, we've got a treadmill and we've got weight-lifting equipment," she said.</p>

<p>"I could definitely tell that weightlifting, which is not something that I do all the time, is something that has changed me. My thighs are a little bit bigger, my body is a little bit bigger, we do a lot of squats. And just to go back to the treadmill...why... It's because we are working on our bone density in our hips and in our feet. So, I think my body has changed a little bit but I weigh the same...," she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two years ago, Jack Smith was appointed as an independent special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland and was responsible for overseeing two preexisting Justice Department criminal investigations into former president Trump, three days after]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought two cases against US President-elect Donald J Trump, is reportedly planning to complete his work and step down along with other members of his team before he can be 'fired'. Last month, Mr Trump promised to fire Mr Smith within "two seconds" once he assumed office in January.</p>

<p>Mr Smith's goal is to finish his report and leave before Mr Trump returns to power and not leave any significant part of his work for others to complete, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing sources.</p>

<p>As per the report, Mr. Smith's office is still planning on how to close the cases within the time frame. However, unforeseen circumstances - such as judicial rulings or decisions by other government officials - could alter his intended timeline.</p>

<p>President-elect Trump will be sworn in at his inauguration scheduled to be held on January 20, 2025.</p>

<h2><strong>Cases Against Trump</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Smith brought two cases against the former President, one involving classified documents Mr Trump kept after leaving office and the other involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.&nbsp;The Republican leader has, however, denied charges in both cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July, a Florida-based federal judge dismissed the documents case.&nbsp;The election interference case is ongoing in Washington but no trial date has been set, with the Justice Department still evaluating how to wind it down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, with certainty of Mr Trump returning to the Oval Office, the federal cases against him are set to end as the US Justice Department's policy has long held that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted for crimes.</p>

<p>Moreover, in July this year, the US Supreme Court ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, even after leaving office. The ruling gives no immunity to ex-presidents for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>The former President is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to obstruct an official proceeding - the session of Congress called to certify the Biden win, which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021, by a mob of his supporters.</p>

<p>The Republican is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Mr Trump also faces two state cases - in New York and Georgia. In New York, he has been convicted of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election to stop her from revealing an alleged 2006 sexual encounter.</p>

<p>In Georgia, the Republican is being charged for his efforts to subvert the 2020 results in the southern state, but this case is also likely to be frozen under the policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.</p>

<p><strong>Who's Jack Smith</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Smith is an American attorney and a former war crimes prosecutor, who has served in the United States Department of Justice. Two years ago, he was appointed as an independent special counsel by Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden's attorney general. He&nbsp;was responsible for overseeing two preexisting Justice Department criminal investigations into former president Trump, three days after the Republican leader announced his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>With Mr Trump set to be back in the Oval Office, regulations call for Mr Smith to file a report summarising his investigation and decisions, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">NYT</a> report.</p>

<p>With the new Supreme Court ruling in place, this document may go down in history as a final accounting from a prosecutor who filed extensive charges against a former president but never got his cases to trial.</p>

<p>As per the report, it is not clear how quickly he can finish his work, but he has told career prosecutors and FBI agents on his team who are not directly involved in that process that they can start planning their departures over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Though Mr Trump&nbsp;during his election campaign pledged to fire Smith,&nbsp;US presidents do not have the authority to dismiss a special counsel. However, the President-elect could name an attorney general who could do so.&nbsp;Mr Trump could also simply order the Justice Department to drop the charges.<br />

<p>Australia has taken the lead in launching the world's first social media ban for teenagers under the age of 16. Usually the word ‘ban' awakens a mob on social media waxing eloquent about democracy and freedom of choice, this time around, people are rather confused.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hesitation to not immediately oppose it makes sense, especially to those who have children. Parents are a worrisome bunch. To my mother, for instance, a missed call may as well be a signal from the universe declaring me dead. Such anxieties are exacerbated in the age of the internet, of social media, and of never-ending ‘doomscrolling'.</p>

<h2><strong>Is It Parents Or Internet?</strong></h2>

<p>It's not entirely unjustified either. A simple Google search of ‘teen dies by suicide because of social media' is enough to paint a picture of what social media brings to our children: bullying, harrassment, insecurities, peer pressure, unrealistic standards. To make matters worse, we now have chat bots. Last month, a 14-year-old boy shot himself, believing he was ‘going home' to the love of his life, an AI bot. The leaked chats between the bot and the boy indicated that the former's language may have played a part in leading the impressionable teen to take his own life. However, many on social media blamed the parents.</p>

<p>Questions were raised: Why couldn't the parents see the warning signs? Were there some underlying mental health issues? The online mob was divided. One section wanted stricter regulations for AI and chatbots. Others, who contended that AI was bound to become an integral part of our lives, pointed to the callousness of the parents, who later admitted that their teen son did look distressed at times and didn't have many friends. Both sides were right and wrong in equal measure.</p>

<p>Parenting or lifestyle magazines these days are flush with articles targeted towards parents of young adults or prepubescent children, warning them about how social media is harming their child. They have some great suggestions: limit screen time, put parental locks, invest more in offline activities or simply talk to the children. These are all good points but with little practical impact. What about when parents themselves are addicted to social media?</p>

<h2><strong>A Complicated Ban To Enforce</strong></h2>

<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said about the social media ban proposal that it was for the ‘mums and dads' who were always worried about social media. Great. But there are pitfalls too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though the proposal claims ‘parental consent' would not change this universally applicable law, it doesn't specify what happens in cases where a family of vloggers or bloggers has kids featuring in their content. The proposed law bans a child from registering on social media platforms, but all of that is meaningless if the child is being used by a parent for engagement. Such children are exploited by their parents for their social media content: bathtime, meals, family conversations, or even relatively private phases is all fair game for parents. Will Australia propose a regulation for this sector?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, it is unclear how the tech platform will regulate the ban. I was on Orkut when I was 13. Let's say social media platforms demand ID proof, can the child not provide forged documents? Let's say the platforms are asked to verify posted pictures. But what if the child never posts anything and just uses social media to consume content, in the process getting insidiously influenced by it?</p>

<p>Bans don't usually work. If anything, a banned product, in the absence of adequate enforcement, ends up becoming a guilty pleasure for most. It's the sine qua non of the great teenage rebellion. It's time lawmakers the world around understood that when formulating laws for the young.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police have arrested 215 people on suspicion of stealing 320 billion won ($228.4 million) in the biggest cryptocurrency investment scam in the country.</p>

<p>Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police said on Wednesday the arrests included the alleged mastermind of the organised crime group accused of selling 28 types of virtual tokens to about 15,000 people by promising high returns.</p>

<p>Police said the group had issued six of the 28 tokens on overseas crypto exchanges and were managing a team of market makers to push up prices. Police described the tokens as "worthless".</p>

<p>The group had set up investment consulting companies and sales teams to sell the virtual assets to people who had subscribed to a YouTube channel, the police statement said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Biden congratulated Trump on November 6 and invited him to the White House, demonstrating his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump broke two significant traditions after losing the 2020 election - declining to invite President-elect Joe Biden to the White House and skipping Biden's inauguration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, these customs will be reinstated as Trump and Biden are set to meet at the Oval Office today, marking Trump's first return to the White House since his presidency ended amidst election denialism four years ago.</p>

<p>Trump's comeback was sealed after winning all seven swing states, securing 312 electoral votes to Vice President Kamala Harris' 226, and potentially winning the popular vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a gesture of goodwill, President Biden congratulated Trump on November 6 and invited him to the White House, demonstrating his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.</p>

<p>According to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Biden's invitation stems from his belief in upholding norms and ensuring a smooth transition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She said, "It is important not just because it's important to him, but it's important to the American people. The American people deserve this. They deserve a peaceful transfer of power. They deserve a smooth transition. And that's what you're going to see."</p>

<p>The meeting's agenda will be private, but reporters will be present to capture the beginning of the discussion. National security adviser Jake Sullivan revealed that Biden and Trump will discuss domestic and foreign policy issues.</p>

<p>The two leaders have been at odds for years, with vastly differing views on key policies such as climate change, Russia, and trade. Biden has expressed concerns about Trump's impact on democracy, while Trump has criticised Biden's competence</p>

<p>This meeting signifies a return to presidential tradition, particularly after Trump's contentious departure from office. His impeachment by the House for "incitement of insurrection" following the January 6, 2021, US Capitol storming added to the tension. Today's meeting marks a step towards reconciliation and reinforces the importance of democratic norms.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British news publisher the Guardian said on Wednesday it will no longer post to X, citing "disturbing content" on the social media platform, including racism and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>The left-leaning Guardian, which has 10.7 million followers on X, becomes the first large UK media company to retreat from the platform that Elon Musk purchased in 2022.</p>

<p>Critics say Musk's hands-off approach has allowed lies and hate speech to spread on the platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>"We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere," the Guardian said in an editorial published on its website.</p>

<p>"This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism."</p>

<p>In response, Musk posted on X and said of the Guardian: "They are irrelevant."</p>

<p>Musk, who supported Donald Trump ahead of his U.S. election victory this month, has said he is defending freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Trump on Tuesday named Musk to a role aimed at creating a more efficient government.</p>

<p>The role of X and other platforms came under the spotlight in Britain this year when far-right and racist violence broke out after online posts falsely claimed that an attack in the northern English town of Southport, where three young girls were killed, was the work of an Islamist migrant.</p>

<p>Reuters was first to report last month that a British police force had quit posting on X, with several more reviewing their involvement.</p>

<p>In recent months, some British charities, health and educational establishments have said they will no longer post to X.</p>

<p>Britain's government continues to post on X but does not use it for paid communications. It does, however, advertise on Meta's Instagram and Facebook, a government source told Reuters last month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Justin Welby, who officiated at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding and led King Charles III's coronation, has faced mounting calls to step down.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the spiritual head of the global Anglican community, announced his resignation on Tuesday amid criticism over his handling of abuse allegations within the church.</p>

<p>In a statement, Welby admitted to failing to ensure a thorough investigation into claims of abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps decades ago.</p>

<p>Welby, who officiated at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and led King Charles III's coronation, faced mounting calls to step down after a recent report concluded he had not done enough to stop one of the Church's most prolific abusers, the <em>Reuters </em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Church historians and commentators noted this marks the first time an Anglican archbishop has resigned due to an abuse scandal.</p>

<p>In his resignation letter, Welby stated he must accept "personal and institutional responsibility" for the Church's lack of action on these "heinous abuses."</p>

<p>"The past few days have intensified my deep sense of shame over the Church of England's historic safeguarding failures," Welby said. "As I step down, I do so in sorrow alongside all victims and survivors of abuse."</p>

<p>Welby's decade-long tenure saw him navigating challenges over LGBTQ rights and women's ordination, which created tensions between liberal churches in the West and conservative counterparts in Africa.</p>

<p>Anglican churches in countries like Uganda and Nigeria are expected to welcome his resignation, having previously voiced a lack of confidence in him.</p>

<p>The next Archbishop will face the task of uniting the increasingly divided Anglican community and addressing a decline in church attendance, which has fallen by 20% in Britain since 2019.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed respect for Welby's decision.</p>

<p>Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, the Church's second-ranking cleric, called Welby's resignation "the right and honorable decision."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Taliban regime has appointed a young Afghan student in India, Ikramuddin Kamil, as Acting Consul at Afghanistan's Consulate in Mumbai. This is the first appointment by the Taliban - which New Delhi does not recognise - in India since it took power in Afghanistan in 2021.</p>

<p>India withdrew its diplomats from Kabul and other cities after the takeover and diplomats appointed by the previous Ashraf Ghani government in Afghanistan left India and took asylum in other countries. A lone former diplomat has stayed in India and kept the Afghanistan mission and consulates running.</p>

<p>Mr Kamil's appointment comes days after a delegation led by JP Singh, joint secretary of the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran division of the external affairs ministry visited Afghanistan and held talks with Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the acting defence minister of the Taliban, in Kabul.</p>

<p>Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, announced Mr Kamil's appointment on X on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr Kamil has studied in India for seven years, pursuing a doctorate in law from the South Asia University in Delhi on a scholarship provided by the Ministry of External Affairs. He is reportedly in Mumbai and already carrying out his duties.</p>

<p>While India has not officially reacted, sources in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Mr Kamil is being seen as an Afghanistani working for Afghans in India and not in terms of any affiliation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sources said Afghan diplomats manning the country's embassy and consulates in India have sought refuge in different Western countries and have left India. A lone former diplomat has stayed in India and kept the consulates running but, they said, the Afghan community based in India needs consular services and more staff members are required to be able to do so.</p>

<p>"A young Afghan student, who the MEA is familiar with, and who has studied in India for seven years while completing his doctorate from South Asia University on an MEA scholarship, has agreed to function as a diplomat in the Afghan Consulate. As far as his affiliation or status is concerned, for us, he is an Afghan national working for Afghans in India," a source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To a question on whether this signals that the Taliban would be recognised by India, the source said, "There is a set process for recognition of any Government and India will continue to work with the international community on this issue."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Church of England faced pressure on Wednesday to ensure people are held to account for systematically covering up allegations of abuse, one day after the Archbishop of Canterbury resigned over a church abuse scandal.</p>

<p>Justin Welby quit on Tuesday as spiritual leader of the global Anglican Church, saying he had failed to ensure a proper investigation into allegations of abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps decades ago.</p>

<p>Welby resigned after coming under pressure over a report that found failings in the handling of the case of John Smyth, a barrister who abused at least 115 children and young men before his death.</p>

<p>The report has increased pressure on others to be held accountable for safeguarding failures.</p>

<p>"We ... know that some people pretty systematically covered this up and that those people do need to be brought to account," Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, the second-most senior bishop in the Church of England, told BBC Radio.</p>

<p>Cottrell said there were lessons to be learned from the review, but that he was not referring to bishops.</p>

<p>"The church is a very, very large organisation and a very dispersed organisation. We're a place where ... thousands and thousands of people, anyone can be part of our church, so safeguarding such an organisation is a challenge."</p>

<p><strong>BISHOP FACES CALLS TO RESIGN</strong></p>

<p>The Bishop of Lincoln, Stephen Conway, who was briefed about the abuse allegations against Smyth in 2013 - the same year as Welby - is facing calls to resign. The BBC quoted an unnamed victim of Smyth as saying that Conway did not do enough when he was informed of the abuse.</p>

<p>Conway apologised on Tuesday for not rigorously pursuing Lambeth Palace, Welby's office, about the matter, saying he had done all in his authority as a bishop.</p>

<p>The review said Welby was ill-advised about the actions taken in Conway's then diocese of Ely, adding that he was incorrectly informed that a referral had been made to the police.</p>

<p>"It was my understanding that this matter was reported to the police in Cambridgeshire (in eastern England) and duly passed on to the police in Hampshire where the abuse had occurred," Conway said.</p>

<p>Asked about Welby's omissions, Cottrell said: "There have been great steps taken in the safeguarding of the church under his watch, but on this case, perhaps he relied too much on others."</p>

<p>Welby spent years trying to prevent the global Anglican communion from fracturing, often struggling to please liberals or conservatives as they fought over homosexual rights and women clergy.</p>

<p>But Archbishop Stephen Kaziimba, as the head of Uganda's Anglican Church had been rebuked by Welby for supporting a strict anti-homosexuality law in Uganda, said on Wednesday that Welby had split the Anglican communion worldwide.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

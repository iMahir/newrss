       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is deepening its relationship with India in several key areas, a senior administration official said Monday.</p>

<p>"India is a country in which we are deepening our relations within a number of keyspaces, especially as it relates to deepening our economic ties, deepening our security cooperation," State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>

<p>"The president had the opportunity to briefly see Prime Minister Modi in the margins of the G7 a couple of weeks ago," he added.</p>

<p>Patel said that he imagines there will be a number of additional areas where the two countries could continue to deepen cooperation.</p>

<p>"National Security Adviser Sullivan just had a visit to Delhi a number of weeks ago as well," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on Pakistan, Patel, though he denounced terrorism, said "ultimately, this is between India and Pakistan." "Broadly, of course, we welcome any countries making more positive relations with their neighbours. But as it relates to this specifically, I just, I don't have anything to offer," he added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An Indian-American businessman Rishi Shah, the former billionaire cofounder of Outcome Health, has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison by a US court.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-American businessman Rishi Shah, the former billionaire cofounder of Outcome Health, has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison by a US court. The saga involves a Rs 8,300 crore ($1 billion) fraud scheme that shook high-profile investors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's venture capital firm. The verdict, handed down by US District Judge Thomas Durkin, closed the lid on one of the largest corporate fraud cases in recent history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/private-equity/ex-billionaire-gets-7-1-2-years-for-defrauding-goldman-google">report</a>, Outcome Health was a brainchild of Mr Shah during his university days. Originally known as Context Media Health, the company was founded in 2006 with a vision of changing medical advertising through installing televisions at doctors' offices to stream health ads targeted at patients. Mr Shah was joined by his co-founder Shradha Agrawal, and the growth for the company became exponential as far as valuation was concerned, all in the quest to bridge the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers innovatively through ad placements.</p>

<p>By the mid-2010s, Outcome Health had emerged as a big player in the tech and healthcare investment communities. The promise of meshing cutting-edge technology into traditional healthcare marketing beckoned high-profile investors. During its meteoric rise, Outcome was securing enormous funds and clientele, placing Mr Shah as a rising star in Chicago corporate circles.</p>

<h3><strong>Lies And Deceit</strong></h3>

<p>But behind the glittering success, Outcome Health's foundations were rotting. Prosecutors said Mr Shah, 38, along with Ms Agarwal and another defendant, chief financial officer Brad Purdy, engaged in a scheme of monumental fraud against investors, clients, and lenders by misrepresenting the operational and financial health of the company. At the centre of the fraud was selling more advertising inventory than could be delivered by Outcome Health, and fabricating data to cover up the shortfall.</p>

<p>It defrauded pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk A/S and other clients about its network size and ad reach. Misleading information, combined with fraudulent data, painted a picture of exponential revenue growth that beguiled further investment or financial backing.</p>

<p>Mr Shah lived life to the fullest because the money rolling in from the inflated ad sales and financing from investors was huge. Reports exposed this spending habit, featuring exotic trips with private jets and yachts, even the purchase of a $10 million home. In 2016, Mr Shah's net worth was pegged at more than $4 billion, reflecting an amount depreciated and inflated by a raft of duplicitous accounting practices.</p>

<p>The facade began to crumble in 2017 when a media expose by the Wall Street Journal brought the fraudulent activities into light.</p>

<p>Later, a group of investors that included Goldman Sachs, Alphabet, and Governor Pritzker's firm filed lawsuits against Outcome Health, accusing the firm of fraud in its $487.5 million fundraising earlier in the year. The fundraiser had returned a $225 million dividend for Mr Shah and Ms Agarwal but left investors holding a grossly overvalued stake in a company teetering on collapse.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Legal Consequences</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Shah was indicted on more than a dozen counts of fraud and money laundering until he was convicted on these charges in April 2023. He was joined by Ms Agarwal and Mr Purdy. While the prosecutors asked for 15 years for Mr Shah and 10 years for his co-conspirators,</p>

<p>District Judge Durkin's final rulings were disparate and included a three-year sentence for Ms Agarwal in a halfway house and Mr Purdy two years and three months in prison. Aside from the criminal case, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the US has likewise filed a civil action against Mr Shah, Ms Agarwal, Mr Purdy, and former chief growth officer Ashik Desai. Mr Desai and other Outcome employees had pleaded guilty already before the jury trial.</p>

<h3><strong>Public Apology</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Shah, in ill health, spoke of remorse and accepted responsibility at sentencing. In a prepared remark he accepted his failure to ensure adequate management of the aggressive Outcome Health expansion and creating a corporate culture that led through deceptive practices. He said he was "ashamed and embarrassed" by the misconduct that brought down the company.</p>

<p>"The culture I created permissioned people on my team to think it was okay to create false data in response to a client question." he confessed.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Monday freed the head of Gaza's biggest hospital who said he was tortured during seven months in detention, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon after criticised the release as a "serious mistake".</p>

<p>Tensions over the freeing of Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammed Abu Salmiya became public almost as soon as he was sent back to Gaza with dozens of other Palestinians held since the October 7 attacks that sparked the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>The World Health Organisation expressed concern after Abu Salmiya was detained on November 23 with other hospital staff.</p>

<p>Israel's military has accused Hamas of using hospitals, including Al-Shifa, as a cover for military operations, which the operative group denies.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he had ordered the Shin Bet intelligence agency to conduct an investigation into the release and provide him with the results by Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The release of the director of Shifa Hospital is a serious mistake and a moral failure. The place of this man, under whose responsibility our abductees were murdered and held, is in prison," Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>The decision was made "without the knowledge of the political echelon," he added.</p>

<p>The agency had said earlier that it had decided on the release with the Israeli military "to free up places in detention centres".</p>

<p>It said it "opposed the release of terrorists" who had taken part in attacks on Israeli civilians "so it was decided to free several Gaza detainees who represent a lesser danger".</p>

<p>National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, a hard right member of Netanyahu's coalition, earlier called Abu Salmiya's release "with dozens of other terrorists" a "security abandonment".</p>

<p>Israeli raids and a weeks-long battle earlier this year have devastated Al-Shifa. Other clinics and medical institutions have also suffered damage, leading to condemnation from UN agencies, NGOs and foreign governments.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya said he and other prisoners were put through "severe torture" in Israeli prisons during their detention.</p>

<p>"Several inmates died in interrogation centres and were deprived of food and medicine," according to Abu Salmiya, who said his thumb was still broken.</p>

<p>"For two months no prisoner ate more than a loaf of bread a day," he added.</p>

<p>"Detainees were subjected to physical and psychological humiliation."</p>

<p>The medical chief said no charge had ever been made against him.</p>

<h3><strong>Emotional reunions&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>After crossing back to Gaza, five detainees were admitted to Al-Aqsa Hospital at Deir al-Balah and the others were sent to hospitals in Khan Yunis, a medical source said.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent at Deir al-Balah saw some detainees in emotional reunions with their families.</p>

<p>Hamas denied that it used hospitals as a shield for its operations. It called in a statement on the United Nations and countries to "stop this massacre" of prisoners in Israeli jails. It called on the International Committee of the Red Cross to "reveal the fate of thousands of Palestinian detainees" in Israel.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya was not the only top medical practitioner detained.</p>

<p>The Gaza European hospital in Khan Yunis said the head of its orthopaedic unit, Bassam Miqdad, was among those freed on Monday.</p>

<p>In May, Palestinian rights groups said a senior Al-Shifa surgeon had died in an Israeli jail after being detained. The Israeli army said it was unaware of the death.</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,900 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media platform X owner <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/elon-musk-and-shivon-zilis-welcomed-new-baby-this-year-was-never-a-secret-says-tesla-ceo-5964126" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> on Monday slammed US Vice President Kamala Harris for "lying" about former president Donald Trump's stance on abortion ban.</p>

<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Harris said that Trump, who is running against <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/supreme-court-immunity-ruling-sets-dangerous-precedent-biden-6014176" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> in the November 5 US presidential election, "would ban abortion nationwide". She also said that she and Biden will do "everything in their power to stop him and restore women's reproductive freedom."</p>

<p>Her post, however, was flagged by a community note, a fact-checking type feature on X that allows people to add context to potentially misleading posts collaboratively.</p>

<p>The community note in her post said that "President Trump has repeatedly said he will not sign a national abortion ban."</p>

<p>Musk then called out Harris and said, "When will politicians, or at least the intern who runs their account, learn that lying on this platform doesn't work anymore?"</p>

<p>The billionaire attached the screenshot of her post receiving the community note.</p>

<p>The topic of abortion ban in the US has figured prominently in the presidential campaigning between Biden, a Democrat, and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-has-some-immunity-from-prosecution-as-ex-president-us-supreme-court-6012125" target="_blank">Trump</a>, his Republican opponent.</p>

<p>Abortion regulation was placed in the hands of the US states following the country's Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning the historic Roe v. Wade ruling that had protected abortion rights nationwide.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Principal Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, Vedant Patel reiterated the country's stand on terrorism and said that they hope that any country on the planet condemns terrorism anywhere.</p>

<p>Vedant Patel was asked by a media person about where the US relations stand with India and Pakistan as India has always emphasised that terrorism and talks cannot go together with Pakistan.</p>

<p>Addressing the media briefing on Monday, the US official was responding to a question on where the US stands as a triangle between the US and India, Pakistan and India and India-US relations.</p>

<p>The reporter restated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intent and quoted that he has been trying even during his second term that India wants a good relationship with Pakistan, adding that terrorism and talks cannot go together.</p>

<p>"We would hope that any country on the face of the planet condemns terrorism anywhere," Patel said.</p>

<p>He further said that the US welcomes any countries making more positive relations with their neighbours.</p>

<p>"But ultimately this is between India and Pakistan broadly, of course, we welcome any countries making more positive relations with their neighbours. But as it relates to this specifically, I just don't have anything to offer," he said.</p>

<p>Vedant Patel emphasised that India is a country in which the US is deepening relations in a number of key spaces.</p>

<p>"India is a country in which we are deepening our relations within a number of key spaces, especially as it relates to deepening our economic ties, deepening our security cooperation," he said.</p>

<p>He further noted that US President Joe Biden had the opportunity to briefly see Prime Minister Modi in the margins of the G7 a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>"So, this is an area we will continue to cultivate this relationship," he said.</p>

<p>Further underscoring PM Modi's state visit to the US, Patel said that there will be several additional areas where the US continue to deepen cooperation.</p>

<p>"You are no stranger to the fact that we hosted India for a state visit last summer. And I imagine there will be a number of additional areas where we continue to deepen cooperation. National Security Adviser Sullivan just had a visit to Delhi a number of weeks ago as well," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's Defence Ministry said on Monday that its forces had taken control of two villages in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>It was the second day in succession that Moscow has announced the capture of new localities. Ukrainian military statements have, at least in part, denied the Russian assertion.</p>

<p>The Russian ministry said in a statement that its forces were in control of the settlement of Stepova Novoselivka in Kharkiv region, and of Novopokrovske in Donetsk region.</p>

<p>The General Staff of the Ukraine's Armed Forces, in an evening report, said its troops had repelled 17 attacks in the Kupiansk sector near Kharkiv, including by Stepova Novoselivka. It said fighting was raging near Synkivka, further west.</p>

<p>Russia has announced a string of incremental gains since capturing the city of Avdiivka in Donetsk region in February.</p>

<p>Donetsk and Kharkiv regions remain focal points along the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line in Ukraine's east and south.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian military earlier said it had repelled Russian attacks near two towns in Donetsk region -- Novooleksandrivka and Spirne, a day after Russian forces claimed control of them. The evening report said fighting continued near both localities.</p>

<p>The evening report identified the Pokrovsk front as the theatre of the fiercest fighting. Forty-four Russian assaults had been repelled in the last 24 hours, with 14 clashes still going on.</p>

<p>The military said Russia maintained a military presence across the border from Ukraine's northern Chernihiv and Sumy regions, adding that Moscow's forces were increasing the density of minefields and conducting sabotage activities.</p>

<p>That area is under scrutiny for any sign that Russia plans to open a new front to pressure Ukraine's outnumbered defenders.</p>

<p>Russia launched an assault into the border areas of the northeastern region of Kharkiv in May, opening a new front in 28-month full-scale invasion.</p>

<p>The latest Ukrainian report said Kyiv's troops controlled the area and turned back 11 Russian assaults near three towns, including Vovchansk, 5 km (3 miles) from the border.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A 51-year-old Indian American physician from the Chicago area has pleaded guilty to a federal healthcare fraud by billing Medicaid and private insurers for nonexistent services.</p>

<p>Mona Ghosh, who owns and operates Progressive Women's Healthcare, specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology services, pleaded guilty to two counts of health care fraud.</p>

<p>Each count is punishable by up to ten years in federal prison.</p>

<p>US District Judge Franklin U Valderrama has set sentencing for October 22.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors allege that Ghosh is accountable for at least $2.4 million in fraudulently obtained reimbursements.</p>

<p>She admitted in her plea agreement that she was accountable for more than $1.5 million of such fraudulently obtained reimbursements.</p>

<p>The final amount will be determined by the court at sentencing, a media release said.</p>

<p>According to court documents, from 2018 to 2022, Ghosh submitted, and caused her employees to submit, fraudulent claims to Medicaid, TRICARE, and numerous other insurers for procedures and services that were not provided or were not medically necessary, some of which were performed without patient consent.</p>

<p>Ghosh also fraudulently overstated the length and complexity of in-office and telemedicine visits and submitted claims using billing codes for which the visits did not qualify in order to seek higher reimbursement rates, her plea agreement states.</p>

<p>She admitted that she had prepared false patient medical records to support the fraudulent reimbursement claims.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 39 people have lost their lives in recent anti-government protests in Kenya against the new tax hike, reported Al Jazeera, citing the national rights watchdog.</p>

<p>The activists have geared up for a new round of protests this week in Kenya.</p>

<p>The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) announced the toll on Monday, which is almost double the figure previously disclosed by the government for those killed while demonstrating against a raft of unpopular tax increases that have now been withdrawn.</p>

<p>KNCHR records further indicated that 39 people have died and 361 have been injured "in relation to the protests countrywide", the state-funded body said in a statement, adding that the figures covered the period from June 18 to July 1, reported Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>It further stated that there had been 32 cases of "enforced or involuntary disappearances" and 627 arrests of protesters.</p>

<p>Moreover, largely peaceful anti-tax rallies, led by mostly young Gen-Z protesters, descended into shocking scenes of deadly violence last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the contentious legislation.<br />
Later, following the announcement of the vote, crowds ransacked the parliament complex in central Nairobi and it was partly set ablaze as police fired live bullets at protesters, as reported by Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>Notably, it is the most serious crisis to be confronted by the government of President William Ruto since he took office in September 2022 following a deeply divisive election in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.</p>

<p>Ruto, in a televised interview on Sunday, said that 19 people had died in the protests, but insisted that he did not have "blood on my hands" and pledged an investigation into the deaths.<br />
The KNCHR "continues to condemn in the strongest terms possible the unwarranted violence and force that was inflicted on protesters, medical personnel, lawyers, journalists and on safe spaces such as churches, medical emergency centres and ambulances," the rights body said.</p>

<p>"We maintain that the force used against the protesters was excessive and disproportionate," it added.</p>

<p>The watchdog also said that it "strongly condemns the violent and shocking acts of lawlessness that were exhibited by some of the protesters" including the parliament and other government buildings.</p>

<p>Moreover, fresh protests have been called by activists beginning Tuesday despite last week, when Ruto announced that he would not sign into law the bill containing the tax hikes.</p>

<p>Additionally, leaflets have been posted on social media with the hashtags "Occupy Everywhere", "Ruto must go" and "Reject Budgeted Corruption".</p>

<p>India has also issued an advisory for its nationals in Kenya, as protests against a tax hike turned violent, causing a rampage in the African nation.</p>

<p>The Indian Embassy in Kenya earlier advised the Indian nationals there to "exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up."</p>

<p>"In view of the prevailing tense situation, all Indians in Kenya are advised to exercise utmost caution, restrict non-essential movement and avoid the areas affected by the protests and violence till the situation clears up," the Embassy stated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea said it successfully tested a new tactical ballistic missile on Monday capable of carrying a 4.5-ton super-large warhead, official state news agency KCNA reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A day earlier, South Korea reported the launch of two ballistic missiles by North Korea and said the second likely failed soon after launch, blowing up in flight over land.</p>

<p>KCNA made no mention of the second missile.</p>

<p>It said the test of the new tactical ballistic missile, which it was named Hwasongpho-11 Da-4.5, was conducted with a simulated heavy warhead to verify flight stability and accuracy.</p>

<p>It did not elaborate on the nature of the simulated warhead.</p>

<p>The country's Missile Administration will conduct another launch of the same type of missile in July to test the "explosion power" of the super-large warhead, according to KCNA.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steve Bannon, an outspoken right-wing figure in American politics and former senior advisor to Donald Trump, reported to prison Monday to begin a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.</p>

<p>He was convicted of defying a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel that investigated the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Bannon, 70, spoke defiantly as he showed up at a federal prison in Connecticut.</p>

<p>"I'm proud of going to prison today," Bannon said, "if it's what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden."</p>

<p>Bannon and others argue that legal proceedings stemming from the January 6 insurrection against the seat of US democracy amount to political persecution designed to thwart Trump's bid for reelection in November.</p>

<p>A cluster of people waving "Trump 2024" flags greeted Bannon outside the prison, as did Marjorie Taylor Greene, a fiercely pro-Trump lawmaker from Georgia who is one of the new faces of the Republican Party tightly controlled by the former president.</p>

<p>One of the masterminds behind Trump's successful 2016 presidential campaign, Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison in October 2022, but remained free until now while appealing his conviction.</p>

<p>A federal appeals court upheld the conviction in May, and District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, revoked Bannon's bail at a court hearing early this month, ordering him to report to prison by July 1.</p>

<p>Bannon no longer works officially for Trump, but reiterated his support for him Monday and promised to use all his influence to get him back in the White House, mainly through his podcast "The War Room," which will continue to release episodes, albeit without Bannon.</p>

<p>Before reporting for prison, Bannon warned the crowd of Trump's most imminent legal threat: on July 11, a judge in New York will announce a sentence in Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election.</p>

<p>"The most important thing to remember is President Trump is going to be sentenced to prison on July 11," Bannon said.</p>

<p>Judge Juan Merchan could also opt for other punishment, such as probation.</p>

<p>Earlier on his podcast, Bannon also welcomed the strong showing of the far-right in France's first round legislative election and in other countries in European parliament voting.</p>

<p>"This is the momentum of our movement," Bannon said.</p>

<p><strong>- Pardoned -</strong></p>

<p>Bannon served in the White House as chief strategist for the first seven months of Trump's term, leaving reportedly due to conflicts with other top staffers.</p>

<p>In 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors for the construction of a border wall with Mexico.</p>

<p>While others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him.</p>

<p>On the day of the Capitol riot, as thousands of pro-Trump supporters overran the congressional building to block the certification of Biden's win over Trump, Bannon spoke by telephone with the then-president.</p>

<p>As a result, congressional investigators wanted to question Bannon about his role in those events.</p>

<p>Bannon entered prison the same day that the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court effectively delayed the possibility of Trump being tried in federal court for trying to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Bannon joins the growing list of former Trump associates who have completed or are currently serving jail time as a result of their ties to Trump.</p>

<p>Another is a former Trump economic adviser, Peter Navarro, who was also sentenced to a four-month prison term for defying a congressional subpoena to testify about January 6.</p>

<p>Others include former Trump legal fixer turned whistleblower Michael Cohen and the CFO of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg.</p>

<p>Trump has been indicted four times, but the hush money case is the only one that has actually gone to trial.</p>

<p>The other three cases -- two related to his attempts to cling to power illegally after the 2020 election and one for retaining classified documents after he left office -- are not expected to go to trial before the presidential election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia has more than doubled the cost of student visa fees for international students from $710 to $1,600, a move which will impact lakhs of Indians planning to study in this country.</p>

<p>The move has triggered outrage from student representatives who say that the price hike will drive potential students to competitors, ABC News reported on Monday.</p>

<p>From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to $1,600 from $710. The federal government said the additional revenue will help fund initiatives in education including cuts to graduate debt, financial support for apprentices, and the ongoing implementation of its migration strategy, the report said.</p>

<p>"International education is an incredibly important national asset and we need to ensure its integrity and quality," Minister for Education Jason Clare said in a statement.</p>

<p>According to the Indian High Commission in Canberra, the number of Indian students enrolled for studying in Australia is estimated at around 1,20,277 as of August 2023, making Indian students the second largest cohort of foreign students in Australia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yeganeh Soltanpour, the national president of the Council of International Students Australia, slammed the decision, noting the fee increase, combined with high deposit costs, places extra strain on international students, the ABC report said.</p>

<p>"The possibility of spending all that money only to face rejection is quite disheartening for many students. It has caused many in the student community to explore other options and competitive countries," she said.</p>

<p>Phil Honeywood, CEO of the International Education Association of Australia, told the ABC that the announcement was the "last straw" for the international education sector, which has already suffered from a slowdown in visa approvals.</p>

<p>"We are really in danger of losing a USD 48 billion a year industry," he said, adding that it will "heavily impact" on relationships with our Indo-Pacific neighbours who rely on Australia to deliver world-class qualifications to young people. He warned that this change could drive prospective students to the United Kingdom, Australia's closest competitor, which currently charges $900 for student visa fees.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Monday ordered lower courts to review a pair of Republican-backed state laws that imposed restrictions on social media companies to moderate content, sidestepping a ruling on their constitutional validity.</p>

<p>Tech industry trade groups, which welcomed the decision, had challenged the laws passed in 2021 by conservative Republican lawmakers in Florida and Texas as part of a broader pushback against perceived anti-conservative bias by major platforms such as Meta-owned Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>The companies denied that they were censoring conservative viewpoints under the guise of content moderation, as their advocates argued that the laws quashed the platforms' own First Amendment rights under the US Constitution.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court declined to rule on whether it was constitutional for states to pass such legislation, leaving the two laws in limbo as it instructed the lower courts for a thorough review.</p>

<p>Florida's measure bars social media platforms from pulling content from politicians, a law that was passed after former president Donald Trump was suspended from Twitter and Facebook in the wake of the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>In Texas, the law stops sites from pulling content based on a "viewpoint" and is also intended to thwart what conservatives see as censorship by tech platforms such as Facebook and YouTube against right-wing ideas.</p>

<p>Neither law has gone into effect due to the litigation.</p>

<p>The challenge to the laws were brought by associations representing big tech companies, the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) and NetChoice, who argue that the First Amendment allows platforms to have the freedom to handle content as they see fit.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Orwellian' -</strong></p>

<p>"We are encouraged that a majority of the court has made clear that the government cannot tilt public debate in its favored direction," CCIA president Matt Schruers said in a statement.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more Orwellian than government attempting to dictate what speech should be carried, whether it is a newspaper or a social media site."</p>

<p>The decision was also welcomed by tech advocacy groups.</p>

<p>"The government does not have the right to impose rules on how companies like Meta and Google should accomplish" platform accountability measures, said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the watchdog Free Press.</p>

<p>"These laws would have further ratcheted up the amount of hate and disinformation online while undermining both the meaning and the intent of the First Amendment," she added.</p>

<p>But other advocates cautioned that the decision must not absolve tech firms of their responsibility to address threats to public safety and democracy.</p>

<p>"Today's unanimous opinion ensures platforms can enforce their community and safety standards during a critical election year," said Nicole Gill, executive director of the watchdog Accountable Tech.</p>

<p>"But make no mistake: this is not an excuse for platforms to continue to shrug off their role in the desecration of democracy and proliferation of a myriad of societal harms."</p>

<p>Monday's decision comes after the Supreme Court last week rejected a Republican-led bid to curb government contact with social media companies to moderate their content.</p>

<p>The decision handed a win to President Joe Biden's administration and top government agencies ahead of the presidential vote in November, allowing them to continue notifying major platforms including Facebook and X about what they deem as false or hateful content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100 victims and relatives of victims of the October 7 attack by Hamas militants in Israel sued Iran, Syria and North Korea on Monday, accusing the countries of providing Hamas support and demanding at least $4 billion in damages.</p>

<p>The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by the Anti-Defamation League is the largest case against foreign countries in connection with the attack, and the first backed by a Jewish organization, the ADL said in a press release.</p>

<p>It accuses the three countries of providing financial, military and tactical support to Hamas. The US government has designed Iran, Syria and North Korea state sponsors of terrorism.</p>

<p>More than 1,200 people were killed in the attack and 250 others were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The complainants in the case include US citizens injured on October 7, as well as relatives and the estates of victims killed in the attack.</p>

<p>Israel's offensive in Gaza in response has killed nearly 38,000 people, according to Gazan health officials, and left the enclave in ruins.</p>

<p>"Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of antisemitism and terror - along with Syria and North Korea, they must be held responsible for their roles in the largest antisemitic attack since the Holocaust," ADL Chief Executive Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.</p>

<p>Iran already faced several similar lawsuits in connection with the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>The Iran, North Korea and Syria missions to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>It is common for countries accused of state-sponsored terrorism to ignore lawsuits in the US and not to honor judgments against them in US courts.</p>

<p>If the defendants are found liable, the complainants hope to tap the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which Congress created in 2015 to compensate individuals who have won judgments against state sponsors of terrorism.</p>

<p>But the fund has run low, prompting several members of Congress to introduce legislation in May that would enhance funding and guarantee annual payments to victims.</p>

<p>Monday's lawsuit seeks at least $1 billion of compensatory damages and $3 billion of punitive damages.</p>

<p>"While nothing will ever undo the unbearable pain Hamas caused our family or the brutal losses we've suffered, we hope this case will bring some sense of justice," complainant Nahar Neta, whose American-born mother Adrienne Neta was killed on October 7, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring also represents the complainants.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms was charged by EU antitrust regulators on Monday for failing to comply with landmark tech rules as they took aim at the US company's newly introduced pay or consent advertising model, already the target of privacy regulators and activists' ire.</p>

<p>The tech giant launched the no-ads subscription service for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last November, saying users who consent to be tracked get a free service which is funded by advertising revenues. Or they could pay for an ad-free service.</p>

<p>The European Commission, which acts as the EU competition enforcer, said the binary choice breaches the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA) which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech, as it sent its preliminary finding to Meta.</p>

<p>It said the binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta's social networks.</p>

<p>"We want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalised ads experience," EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.</p>

<p>Meta said its model complied with a ruling from Europe's top court.</p>

<p>"Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA. We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close," a Meta spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Meta can tweak its advertising model to stave off a fine of as much as 10% of its global annual turnover if found guilty of DMA breaches. The Commission has until March next year to wrap up its investigation.</p>

<p>Privacy activists and privacy watchdogs have also taken issue with Meta's advertising model.</p>

<p>Reuters was the first to report that the EU competition enforcer would charge Meta with non-compliance under the Digital Markets Act.</p>

<p>The charge against Meta came a week after the EU watchdog issued its first DMA charge against Apple for not complying with the new rule.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the Gaza Strip's biggest hospital said on Monday after being freed from more than seven months of detention that he had been "tortured" by Israel.</p>

<p>Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammed Abu Salmiya was among dozens of Palestinians released and returned to Gaza for treatment, according to Israeli authorities.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya said he and other prisoners were put through "severe torture" in Israeli prisons, after being detained since the October 7 cross-border attacks by Hamas.</p>

<p>"Several inmates died in interrogation centres and were deprived of food and medicine," according to Abu Salmiya, who said he still had a broken thumb.</p>

<p>"For two months no prisoner ate more than a loaf of bread a day," he added.</p>

<p>"Detainees were subjected to physical and psychological humiliation."</p>

<p>The medical chief said no charge had ever been made against him.</p>

<p>Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency said it had decided on the release with the Israeli military "to free up places in detention centres".</p>

<p>The agency said it "opposed the release of terrorists" who had taken part in attacks on Israeli civilians "so it was decided to free several Gaza detainees who represent a lesser danger".</p>

<p>However commenting on X, formerly Twitter, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called Abu Salmiya's release "with dozens of other terrorists" a "security abandonment".</p>

<p>Israeli forces detained Abu Salmiya during one of a number of raids on Al-Shifa.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional reunions</strong></p>

<p>Israel's military has accused Hamas of using hospitals in the Gaza Strip as a cover for military operations. It has raided Al-Shifa and other hospitals, and says it has found tunnels and other infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Hamas group, which has run the territory since 2007, denies the allegations.</p>

<p>Al-Shifa hospital has been reduced to rubble by successive raids since Israel launched its assault on Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attacks.</p>

<p>After crossing back to Gaza near the city of Khan Yunis, five detainees were admitted to Al-Aqsa hospital and the others were sent to hospitals in Khan Yunis, a medical source said.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent at Deir al-Balah saw some detainees in emotional reunions with their families.</p>

<p>Abu Salmiya was not the only top medical practitioner detained.</p>

<p>The Gaza European hospital in Khan Yunis said the head of its orthopaedic unit, Bassam Miqdad, was among those freed on Monday.</p>

<p>In May, Palestinian rights groups said a senior Al-Shifa surgeon had died in an Israeli jail after being detained. The Israeli army said it was unaware of the death.</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,900 people, also mostly civilians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Nepali court on Monday sentenced a man whose followers believe him to be a reincarnation of Buddha to 10 years in prison for child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Ram Bahadur Bomjan, known as "Buddha boy" by his devotees, became famous as a teenager after followers said he could meditate motionless for months without water, food or sleep.</p>

<p>He was convicted of child sexual abuse last week by the court in Nepal's southern town of Sarlahi.</p>

<p>"He has been sentenced to 10 years in jail," Sadan Adhikari, registrar at the district court, told AFP.</p>

<p>Bomjan was also fined 500,000 Nepali rupees ($3,743).</p>

<p>The 33-year-old guru has a devout following but has long been accused of physically and sexually assaulting his followers, and had been hiding from authorities for several years.</p>

<p>Nepal's Central Investigation Bureau arrested him in January at a house on the outskirts of the capital Kathmandu.</p>

<p>Police said he was caught with bundles of cash amounting to 30 million Nepali rupees and another $22,500 in foreign currency.</p>

<p>Dozens of assault complaints were filed against Bomjan in 2010.</p>

<p>He said he beat the victims because they disturbed his meditation.</p>

<p>An 18-year-old nun also accused Bomjan of raping her at a monastery in 2018.</p>

<p>Police opened another investigation against him the following year, after family members reported the disappearance of four of his devotees from one of his ashrams.</p>

<p>Before he went on the run, Bomjan still commanded a legion of followers.</p>

<p>At one point, tens of thousands of people gathered to witness his reputed miracles of meditation deep in the jungle.</p>

<p>Aged 16, Bomjan disappeared for nine months to wander the wilderness of eastern Nepal, prompting a round-the-clock vigil by Buddhist monks who prayed for his safe return.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army on Monday issued a new evacuation order for parts of Khan Yunis and Rafah in southern Gaza, with witnesses reporting that many were fleeing.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands had already left Rafah ahead of and during a ground offensive launched by Israeli troops on the southernmost city since early May.</p>

<p>The warning for Al-Qarara, Bani Suhaila and other towns in the two governorates, made on social media and in an official statement, came hours after Israel said 20 "projectiles" were fired into Israel from the Khan Yunis region.</p>

<p>The attack was claimed by the armed wing of the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. Israel had already staged air strikes in Rafah on Monday.</p>

<p>"Fear and extreme anxiety have gripped people after the evacuation order," said Bani Suhaila resident Ahmad Najjar. "There is a large displacement of residents."</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesman said "it just shows yet again, that no place is safe in Gaza, more efforts need to be made to protect civilians".</p>

<p>"It's another stop in this deadly circle of movement that the population in Gaza has to undergo on a regular basis," added the spokesman, Stephane Dujarric.</p>

<p>Since launching its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27, Israeli forces progressively moved south in the Palestinian territory, seeking to destroy Hamas battalions, though fighting has restarted in the north.</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,900 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.<br />

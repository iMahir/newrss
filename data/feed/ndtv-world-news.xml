       <description><![CDATA[Yoga Nidra practice causes many changes in brain activity, including in areas involved in regulating emotions, mind wandering, and sleep.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conscious sleep practice known as 'Yoga Nidra' has long fascinated people with its promise of improving mental and physical health. Now, Indian researchers have explored these effects by scanning brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to understand its value better. Researchers from IIT Delhi, AIIMS Delhi, and Mahajan Imaging Delhi have conducted this study, which was published in the international journal Scientific Reports, exploring the neural mechanisms underlying 'Yoga Nidra'. The study shows how 'Yoga Nidra' practice brings deep relaxation and increased awareness. It also shows that more significant brain changes occur during 'Yoga Nidra' practice in individuals with greater experience in yoga/meditation.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/show.php?id=56&amp;in_sections=Research">release</a> by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the study, titled <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63765-7"><em>"Functional connectivity changes in meditators and novices during 'Yoga Nidra' practice,"</em></a> included two groups: 30 meditators (householders with an average of 3000 hours of experience in meditation and/or yogic practices) and 31 matched novice controls. The study found that the Default Mode Network behaves differently (less connected) in experienced meditators compared to novices. This difference in brain communication patterns helps us understand how 'Yoga Nidra' modulates our brain functions, promoting a state of deep relaxation while staying aware.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/show.php?id=56&amp;in_sections=Research">The study </a>found a strong link between the amount of meditation and yoga practice participants had and the reduction in DMN connectivity during 'Yoga Nidra'. In other words, the more hours participants spent practicing meditation and yoga, the more noticeable the changes in their brain activity during 'Yoga Nidra'. These results could potentially indicate that experienced meditators have reduced mind-wandering as compared to novices, leading to changes in the DMN connectivity.</p>

<p>The researchers behind this study say 'Yoga Nidra' (YN) practice, a meditative technique originating from the ancient Indian tradition, has garnered global attention for its potential to improve psychological well-being and health. Despite the growing interest in its clinical applications, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural correlates of YN remains largely unexplored.</p>

<p>"Literally translated as "Yogic Sleep Practice," 'Yoga Nidra' practice is typically attempted in <em>Shavasana</em>, a supine position resembling the stillness of a corpse, which contrasts it from other conventional meditation practices that require a seated, upright posture, thus making it suitable for MRI-based scanning approaches," the study authors said.</p>

<p>As the researchers involved in this project have found, "Yoga Nidra practice employs audio-guided instructions that systematically guide the awareness of the participant to different parts of the body, breathing, or mantras that aim to induce a deeply relaxed state, mirroring the serenity experienced during deep sleep but with conscious awareness in contrast to the self-regulated focus typically associated with focused attention styles of meditations."</p>

<p>The practitioner remains in a state of light withdrawal of the five senses (pratyahara) with four of their senses internalised and only the hearing still connects to the instructions. The exceptional allure of this technique stems not merely from the deep relaxation and mindful awareness it provides but also as a method to progressively master entering the most profound states of meditation (samadhi).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli airstrikes on Monday killed at 492, including 35 children, in Lebanon, marking the deadliest attack on the country in nearly two decades.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/492-dead-in-israeli-strikes-on-hezbollah-strongholds-in-lebanon-6634643 ">Israeli airstrikes</a> on Monday killed at 492, including 35 children, in Lebanon, marking the deadliest attack on the country in nearly two decades. This came just days after thousands of pagers, still used in the country, exploded and killed at least 32 people and injured scores of others. Lebanon claimed Israel was behind those explosions as well.</p>

<p>Tensions between Israel and militant-group Hezbollah have escalated on unprecedented levels in the last year after Hamas' October 7 attack. Even though Hezbollah said it had nothing to do with the attack on Southern Israel, it has continued to support the militant group in Gaza where Israeli airstrikes have killed over 40,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire population. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The shadow war</strong></p>

<p>The shadow war between Israeli intelligence agencies and Hezbollah goes back over 40 years. In the early 1980s, Israel invaded Lebanon to uproot the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). While Israel achieved an initial victory by forcing the PLO to withdraw from Beirut, a disastrous event in November 1982 marked the beginning of Israel's ongoing struggle against Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one of the first major blows, a massive explosion destroyed the headquarters of Israel's internal intelligence service, Shin Bet, in the town of Tyre, killing 91 people. It was revealed to be one of the first suicide car bombings, orchestrated by militant Shia Islamists who would later go on to form Hezbollah.</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>Founded in 1983 with Iranian backing, Hezbollah quickly became one of Israel's most formidable enemies. The organisation, adept at both guerilla warfare and covert operations, continued its efforts to destabilise Israeli targets both within and outside Lebanon. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hezbollah conducted numerous attacks, including the bombings of the US and French military barracks in Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah managed to fund its operations through a vast network of supporters, including in South America, which emerged as a key aspect of the shadow war. The organisation's involvement in both legal and illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, enabled it to amass significant resources, which Israel struggled to disrupt.<br />
<br />
A prime example of Hezbollah's global reach came in the early 1990s when following the assassination of Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi by Israeli forces, the militant group retaliated by bombing the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community centre in Argentina's Buenos Aires, killing over 100 people.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spy Ops</strong></p>

<p>However, Israel's spy agency Mossad also remained relentless. Mossad, in a series of high-profile assassinations, targeted senior Hezbollah and Iranian operatives involved in planning attacks against Israel.</p>

<p>The elusive Hezbollah military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, was a particular target of Israeli intelligence. Mughniyeh, credited with masterminding several high-profile attacks, including the 1983 bombings in Lebanon, evaded capture for decades. It wasn't until 2008 that Israeli forces, along with the CIA, succeeded in killing Mughniyeh with a car bomb in Damascus.</p>

<p>Hezbollah retaliated with numerous attempts to target Israeli embassies and civilians, including the 2012 suicide bus bombing in Bulgaria that killed five Israelis.</p>

<p>This year, in July 2024, Israel successfully eliminated two high-ranking Hezbollah officials, Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. They were involved in the 1980s attacks on Israeli forces in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The shadow war has not been limited to conventional or even guerilla tactics. One of the most infamous attacks came in the form of the Stuxnet computer virus, a joint Israeli-American operation that targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010. This cyberattack, which destroyed centrifuges at Iran's Natanz facility, marked the first known instance of a cyber operation causing physical damage.</p>

<p>Most recently, Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in a new type of high-tech warfare. In September 2024, Hezbollah acknowledged that a series of attacks involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies had inflicted severe damage on the group. The operations bore the hallmarks of Mossad even though Israel has not officially claimed responsibility.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, called Israel's recent actions a “declaration of war”.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sam Altman imagines a future where AI improves various aspects of life, including personal AI teams that assist with everyday tasks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a time when the global artificial intelligence revolution is already reshaping the world as it is redefining and revolutionising industries, economies, and even daily life sooner than expected, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has said that he believes that the arrival of superintelligence is just a few thousand days away.</p>

<p>In a recent blog post, titled <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/"><em>'The Intelligence Age',</em></a> the creator of the biggest generative AI tool ChatGPT, Mr Altman, said that, "It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days! It may take longer, but I'm confident we'll get there."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reveals-his-top-strategy-for-life-without-regrets-put-a-huge-premium-on-it-6627724"><strong>Also Read | OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Reveals His Top Strategy For Life Without Regrets: "Put A Huge Premium On It"</strong></a></p>

<p>"In the next couple of decades, we will be able to do things that would have seemed like magic to our grandparents. This phenomenon is not new, but it will be newly accelerated. People have become dramatically more capable over time; we can already accomplish things now that our predecessors would have believed to be impossible," he wrote.</p>

<p>Talking about the beginning of a new age in human life, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">Mr Altman said</a>, "Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the intelligence age is paved with computation, energy, and human will."</p>

<p>The biggest question that AI has raised till now is, "Will AI replace human jobs?" And in his blog, Mr Altman tried to address this issue, saying that "many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter. If a lamplighter could see the world today, he would think the prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all around us would feel just as unimaginable."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk offered effusive praise for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in brief remarks at an awards ceremony in New York, the latest sign of cosiness between a billionaire who's trying to get Donald Trump elected and a European leader at odds with her Group of Seven allies.</p>

<p>Musk, bestowing an Atlantic Council Global Citizen Award on Meloni, said it was an honour to present the accolade to "someone who is even more beautiful on the inside than she was on the outside."</p>

<p>"She's also someone who is authentic, honest, truthful - and that can't always be said about politicians," Musk added.</p>

<p>The remarks were in keeping with the warm relationship between Musk and Meloni, whose political roots on the right align her with Trump, even as she's backed the G-7's support of Ukraine in its struggle against the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>At a festival organized by Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party in December, Musk exhorted the crowd to "make more Italians" and warned of unchecked migration while addressing Italy's birth rate, which is the lowest in Europe.</p>

<p>Meloni has refrained from backing either Trump or his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she will work closely with whoever occupies the White House, given long-standing ties between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Musk spoke, Meloni delivered an implicit rebuke to the left, lamenting the desire to "to violently erase the symbols of our civilizations in the US as in Europe."</p>

<p>"I know that we should not be ashamed to use and defend words and concepts like nation and patriotism, words that mean more than a physical place," Meloni said. "They mean a state of mind to which one belongs."</p>

<p>Meloni is in New York with leaders from more than 190 other nations for the annual high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. On Sunday, she met with Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, the chief executives of Alphabet Inc. And OpenAI Inc.</p>

<p>The choice to give a Global Citizen Award to the prime minister, and have Musk present it, has angered some former and current Atlantic Council staff, Politico reported last week, given the dissonance between their views on Ukraine and immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meloni received the award "for her strong support of the EU and becoming the first female prime minister of Italy," according to a media package distributed by the Atlantic Council.</p>

<p>Musk has business interests in Italy. He and Meloni have scheduled a closed-door meeting later this month to discuss investment opportunities in Italy's space and artificial intelligence sectors, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Italy approved a new regulatory framework in June that grants foreign space companies permission to operate in the country, a move that it expects to generate investments of about &amp;#8364;7.3 billion ($8.1 billion).</p>

<p>Italy is already serviced by Musk's Starlink, which delivers broadband internet through a global network of more than 6,000 satellites operated by his Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</p>

<p>Meloni has also expressed interest in artificial intelligence, though she sounded a note of caution about the technology in a speech to the United Nations Summit of the Future earlier Monday. She called AI a "great multiplier" but warned it could widen global imbalances.</p>

<p>"Machines will not answer this question," she said. "Politics must guarantee that artificial intelligence remains controlled by humans and keeps humans at the centre."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had said that he was going to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit here but they did not meet.</p>

<p>PM Modi's brief trip was of about 55 hours packed with activities, while Trump was in the heat of the campaign for an election six weeks away.</p>

<p>The PM was busy on Saturday with the Quad summit with President Joe Biden, and Prime Ministers Anthony Albanese of Australia and Fumio Kishida of Japan.</p>

<p>Monday was taken up entirely by PM Modi's address to the Summit of the Future and meetings with some leaders before his flight back.</p>

<p>On Sunday, he addressed the diaspora rally in a New York suburb, and he had some time later in the day for meetings.</p>

<p>But Trump was away holding his own rally in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Later Sunday, PM Modi met with Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas, Nepal's Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, and Kuwait Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid.</p>

<p>There were media speculations about another meeting: Between PM Modi and Mohammad Yunus, the de facto prime Minister of Bangladesh, on the sidelines of the United Nations Summit of the Future.</p>

<p>Some media reports said that PM Modi was snubbing him by refusing to meet.</p>

<p>Ultimately it was also a matter of timing.</p>

<p>Asked at his news conference about the meeting that wasn't to be, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said, “The Prime Minister is leaving in a few minutes from now. The chief advisor of Bangladesh is not here yet, so there hasn't been any possibility of a meeting on this occasion”.</p>

<p>Touhid Hossain, the foreign affairs adviser in the interim government of Bangladesh, spoke at the summit on Monday instead of Yunus who was listed as the speaker.</p>

<p>After meeting Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and To Lam of Vietnam on Monday, PM Modi also squeezed in two other meetings, with the Vatican's Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and Armenia's President Nikol Pashinyan.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent video of Republican Donald Trump on social media has sparked mixed reactions. The video shows Trump giving $100 to a Pennsylvania mother of three to help with her grocery bill during a campaign stop on September 23. The former U.S. President, who is running for the presidency again, also promised to lower supermarket prices if elected in November.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign team posted the video on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption, "President @realDonaldTrump helps a mom of 3 pay for her groceries."</p>

<p>In the video, Trump hands the money to the woman, saying, "Here, it's gonna go down a little. It just went down 100 bucks."</p>

<p>The woman thanks Trump, laughing along with others present. Trump then adds, "We'll do that for you from the White House, alright?" and compliments her sons, calling them "beautiful" and "perfecto."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p></p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly vowed that, if he returns to the White House, he will address inflation and reduce the cost of everyday items like groceries and gas.</p>

<p>While Trump supporters praised his actions in the comments, with some drawing comparisons to Vice President Kamala Harris, others were less impressed, calling the gesture "fake" and insincere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is more than Kamala has ever done to help any American," one user wrote, while another said, "Comrade Kamala could never do this, Trump is real &amp; genuine, Kamala is fake." "That's my president!" one user exclaimed. Another wrote, "President Trump is the people's President".</p>

<p>"Love Trump, he has been doing this his own life without cameras filming. There's so many stories of people coming out and saying he read their story in the paper and so he sent them a check to pay off their house. Gave loans to minorities when all banks refused etc," the third user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another section of the internet called the gesture "fake".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Brought grandkids to rally, and now paying a voter...fake AF!! This won't change anyone's vote," one user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another said, "Wait, he said "we'll do that for you for the White House" as in he's bribing someone for a vote? Also why did he feel the need to have this taped for posting instead of just doing it privately? I'm not impressed".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So genuine with 100 cameras on this," said a user, using sarcasm.</p>

Fears of a broader war loom large, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging civilians to evacuate affected areas. The latest Israeli onslaught displaced more than 1.10 lakh Lebanese and around 60,000 Israelis.<br />
<br />
The conflict between Israel and Lebanon goes back to 1982. To understand the current situation, we must revisit the First Lebanese War.<br />
<br />
<strong>The First Lebanese War</strong><br />
<br />
In March 1978, members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) infiltrated Israel, leading to the murder of an American tourist and the hijacking of a bus, resulting in the deaths of 34 hostages. In retaliation, Israeli forces invaded Lebanon, targeting terrorist bases. After two months, they withdrew, allowing United Nations peacekeepers to enter.<br />
<br />
Violence continued to escalate, with repeated PLO attacks and Israeli reprisals. A ceasefire brokered by the US in July 1981 quickly fell apart, as the PLO conducted 270 terrorist operations in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and along the Lebanese border, resulting in 29 Israeli deaths and over 300 injuries. At the time, an estimated 15,000 to 18,000 PLO members were stationed across Lebanon, armed with significant quantities of light and heavy weaponry.<br />
<br />
The tipping point occurred in June 1982 when a Palestinian terrorist group attempted to assassinate Israel's Ambassador to Great Britain. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched ‘Operation Peace for Galilee' on June 6, aimed at terrorists.<br />
<br />
The initial success of the Israeli operation aimed for broader objectives, including the expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon and the establishment of a peace treaty. Lebanon's President Amin Gemayel signed a treaty in 1983, but Syria intervened, forcing him to retract. Many Arab residents in southern Lebanon suffered due to the strong presence of PLO.<br />
<br />
As the IDF surrounded Beirut, civilian suffering increased due to the PLO's refusal to surrender. An agreement for a ceasefire was reached to facilitate a peaceful PLO withdrawal, but the PLO's continual demands complicated negotiations. They engaged in controlled violations of the ceasefire, seeking to provoke Israeli retaliation, while strategically positioning themselves behind civilians.<br />
<br />
Despite media scrutiny, Israel worked towards expelling the PLO from Beirut, resulting in the deployment of an international coalition to oversee their evacuation. By September 1, 1982, approximately 14,000 PLO fighters left. Among them was Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the PLO, who departed for Tunisia.<br />
<br />
The war sparked intense debate within Israel, and for the first time, there was no unified consensus for it. Prime Minister Menachem Begin eventually resigned amid public demands to end the conflict. In 1984, Israel withdrew its troops but left a token force to support the South Lebanese Army. The war cost 1,216 Israeli lives and left a lasting legacy of violence and instability in the region, highlighting ongoing challenges for the two countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lauded Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday for his "clear support" of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p>The two leaders met on the sidelines of the UN Summit of the Future to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and explore paths toward peace.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Zelensky expressed gratitude for the productive conversation.</p>

<p>"This is our third bilateral meeting this year. We are working together to strengthen cooperation across various fields," he said.</p>

<p>Highlighting the focus on bolstering interaction on international platforms, Zelensky wrote, "The main focus of our conversation was on enhancing our interaction on international platforms, particularly at the UN and G20, as well as implementing the Peace Formula and preparing for the second Peace Summit. We had a substantive discussion on the available opportunities."</p>

<p>"I am grateful for Prime Minister Modi's clear support of our sovereignty and territorial integrity," Zelensky wrote, stressing India's diplomatic stance on the conflict.</p>

<p>During their meeting, PM Modi reiterated India's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the war through diplomacy and dialogue.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Modi emphasized India's "clear, consistent, and constructive" approach, which prioritizes engagement between all stakeholders.</p>

<p>After the meeting, PM Modi shared a post on X, saying, "Met President Zelensky in New York. We are committed to implementing the outcomes of my visit to Ukraine last month to strengthen bilateral relations. Reiterated India's support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability."</p>

<p>This marked the third meeting between the leaders in just over three months. The two agreed to maintain close contact, as confirmed by the MEA.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Ukraine in August, the first by an Indian PM since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, underscored India's active engagement in promoting peace in the war-torn region.</p>

<p>Despite being seen as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, PM Modi has consistently advocated for a peaceful resolution, reaffirming India's position as a proponent of stability.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in New Zealand said Tuesday they have discovered a new species of "ghost shark", a type of fish that prowls the Pacific Ocean floor hunting prey more than a mile down.</p>

<p>The Australasian Narrow-nosed Spookfish was found living in the deep waters of Australia and New Zealand, according to scientists from Wellington-based National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).</p>

<p>The specimens were discovered during research in the Chatham Rise, an area of the Pacific which stretches around 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) east near New Zealand's South Island.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost sharks, or chimaeras, are related to sharks and rays, but are part of a group of fish whose skeletons are entirely made of cartilage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also known as spookfish, the ghost sharks have haunting black eyes and smooth, light brown, scale-free skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They feed off crustaceans at depths of up to 2,600 metres (8,530 feet) using their distinctive beak-like mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ghost sharks like this one are largely confined to the ocean floor," said research scientist Brit Finucci.</p>

<p>Finucci gave the new species its scientific name "Harriotta avia" in memory of her grandmother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Their habitat makes them hard to study and monitor, meaning we don't know a lot about their biology or threat status, but it makes discoveries like this even more exciting."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spookfish was previously thought to be part of a single globally distributed species until scientists discovered it is genetically and morphologically different to its cousins.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier, the British rock band officially announced the Asia dates for their highly anticipated <em>Music of the Spheres World Tour. </em>They are to hold three shows at DY Patil Sports Stadium in Mumbai on January 18, and 19, and a newly added performance on January 21, 2025. When ticket sales opened at noon on Sunday, fans flooded the BookMyShow website and app in hopes of snagging one of the 1.5 lakh available tickets, each concert accommodating 50,000 attendees. However, the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bookmyshow-site-crashes-seconds-before-sale-for-coldplay-mumbai-concert-begins-6622286">overwhelming traffic</a> led to a rapid sell-out, with all tickets disappearing within minutes.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing Co offered a 30% pay bump directly to striking workers, angering union leaders, as the embattled planemaker tries to overcome a debilitating strike that has shut down plants across the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>The proposal is an improvement over the initial 25% increase turned down earlier this month by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, but still less than the 40% initially sought by the union. Boeing said the terms are final and only valid until the end of September 27, ratcheting up pressure on workers to accept.</p>

<p>However, Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, said his negotiating team was blindsided by the offer and the union has no intention of putting it before rank-and-file members for a vote. Doing so on such short notice simply isn't feasible, he said in an interview.</p>

<p>"Setting up a vote for 33,000 people isn't just something you snap your fingers on," Holden said. Union leaders also want to talk to members about the offer, he said, adding: "We know already that it doesn't meet our members' needs."</p>

<p>The maneuvering has brought a harder edge to the pay negotiations. In a harsh statement posted online, IAM District 751 said that by skirting the collective bargaining process, "Boeing took it upon itself to disrespect our entire union."</p>

<p>The sparring injects new tension to talks that have been at a standstill since September 18, when two days of federal mediation yielded little progress. After workers voted almost unanimously to strike earlier this month, the local district said it intended to push for a substantially higher wage increase and for Boeing to reinstate a defined benefit pension plan for members.</p>

<p>The showdown between Boeing and workers at its main manufacturing hub is being closely watched by Wall Street and the White House as labor strife flares up in the US ahead of November's presidential election.</p>

<h2><strong>Strained Finances</strong></h2>

<p>Machinists also walked off the job on Monday at Textron Aviation, which makes Cessna Citation business jets, after rejecting a 26% contract offer over the weekend. And a potential strike by Longshoremen threatens to cripple US maritime shipping.</p>

<p>An extended walkout would worsen Boeing's already strained financial situation, after the company burned through more than $8 billion in cash in the first half as it slowed output to address quality lapses exposed by an aircraft accident in January.</p>

<p>"We heard your feedback," Boeing said in a post on its website touting the latest contract offer. "We've made significant improvements to provide more money in key areas."</p>

<p>The planemaker's shares jumped as much as 3.3% in New York. Boeing has tumbled 40% in value this year, the second-worst performance among members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>

<p>The conflict has shut down production of Boeing's cash-cow 737 Max and other jetliners, and could drain an additional $1.3 billion in cash from the company each month, according to Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies. As Boeing risks losing its investment-grade credit rating, the planemaker has begun to furlough workers and take other steps to preserve cash during the strike.</p>

<p>Senior managers, including new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg, have also agreed to take pay cuts for the duration of the furloughs.</p>

<p>The strike pits the financially ailing aerospace manufacturer against workers with a history of activism and an ax to grind with their employer. The Machinists are embittered by a 2014 agreement that cost them their pensions and locked in only modest wage increases while inflation soared earlier this decade.</p>

<h2><strong>War of Words</strong></h2>

<p>The company's latest offer includes reinstating an annual bonus that averaged around 3.7% of wages and was dropped from the initial agreement, a flash point that striking Machinists cited repeatedly in interviews. Boeing also doubled to $6,000 the bonus that workers would get if the latest deal is passed, and increased its contribution to a pension plan, which would be run by the company rather than the union.</p>

<p>Boeing has refused to meet since talks broke down last week, Holden said. The company did provide a brief overview of the latest terms Monday morning, but the two sides were still talking when Boeing went public with the offer, he said.</p>

<p>Holden said he tried again on Monday to get Boeing back to the negotiating table. "They said, 'No. The offer is the offer,'" he said.</p>

<p>As the war of words escalated, Boeing hit back with its own version of events.</p>

<p>"We have bargained in good faith with the IAM since formal negotiations began in March," Boeing said in an emailed statement late Monday. "After an unsuccessful federal mediation last week, we presented a best and final offer that made significant improvements and addresses feedback from the union and our employees. We first presented the offer to the union and then transparently shared the details with our employees."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Maky Zanganeh became a billionaire after shares of Summit Therapeutics, where she serves as co-CEO, soared following positive trial data for its promising cancer drug.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maky Zanganeh, co-CEO of Summit Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical oncology company, is now a billionaire. An Iranian immigrant, Ms Zanganeh's rise came after shares of Summit Therapeutics, under her leadership, surged 17-fold, pushing its market valuation to $17 billion, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/09/20/iranian-immigrant-becomes-billionaire-as-her-biotech-firms-stock-soars/">Forbes</a>.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old holds just under 5 per cent&nbsp;of the company's shares along with stock options. She is now worth an estimated $1.1 billion, one of only 34 self-made women billionaires in the US and one of just three in the healthcare sector.<br />
<br />
The 21-year-old company, with no approved drugs and just 130 employees, has recently caught the eye of investors due to its experimental lung cancer drug, ivonescimab. Data presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in San Diego showed the drug outperformed Merck's blockbuster Keytruda, generating massive investor interest. “The big news was that we could beat Keytruda,” Ms Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Forbes.<br />
<br />
Summit's stock nearly doubled after the announcement, peaking at $31.93 on September 13 before settling at $23.16 by September 19.<br />
<br />
Ms Zangesh was born in Tehran, Iran, to architect parents. Her life was forever altered when the Shah of Iran was overthrown in 1979. The subsequent Iran-Iraq war intensified the uncertainty. “We constantly had to face the fear of bombing,” she shared in her 2021 memoir, ‘The Magic of Normal.' When Ms Zanganeh was about 11, a friend of her father in Germany arranged for her family to obtain German visas.<br />
<br />
After many flight cancellations due to airport closures in Tehran, they eventually fled to Germany via Austria. Settling in Oldenburg, a small town in northern Germany, she learned German while her parents returned to Iran. Ms Zanganeh stayed behind, living with a friend and then an uncle, to finish high school.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh's father, seeing both of her sisters in medical school in Strasbourg, France, encouraged her to follow suit. She mastered French and pursued dentistry at the University of Strasbourg, specialising in paediatric dentistry, and graduated in 1995. However, she remained unsure about pursuing a career in dentistry. In 1997, through an Iranian friend working for US robotic surgery company, Computer Motion, Ms Zanganeh became intrigued by the industry and took on a role as the company's European coordinator, while also earning an MBA from Schiller International University.<br />
<br />
She rose quickly, becoming Computer Motion's head of Europe and the Middle East, and later, its global vice president for training and education, which led her to Santa Barbara, California. When Intuitive Surgical acquired Computer Motion in 2003, Ms Zanganeh left the company to explore new opportunities.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh then found her true calling in biotech, eventually teaming up with fellow billionaire Robert Duggan to lead Summit Therapeutics.</p>

<p>Together, Mr Duggan and Ms Zanganeh are betting big on ivonescimab. Summit licenced the drug from Hong Kong-listed Akeso in 2022 for $500 million upfront, with the potential for an additional $4.5 billion in milestone payments.<br />
<br />
Ms Zanganeh, diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 and now fully recovered, joined Summit's board later that year and was appointed co-CEO in September 2022, just months before securing the deal with Akeso.<br />
<br />
Ivonescimab's success is still in the early stages, with 20 clinical trials underway in China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli airstrikes killed at least 492 people in Lebanon, including 35 children on Monday. This marked the deadliest day of violence since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, which has now drawn in Hezbollah and escalated the conflict to its worst in nearly a year. Thousands of Lebanese families have been displaced, and the war shows no sign of abating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The conflict between the Iran-backed, Lebanon-based group and Israel is not new. The two share a bloodied history spanning over four decades.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Israel's 1982 Invasion and Hezbollah's Formation</strong></h2>

<p>The roots of Hezbollah's rise and its bloody conflict with Israel trace back to June 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon in response to attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) operating from the south. Israel's occupation reached the heart of Beirut, putting the PLO under siege and forcing its eventual withdrawal. However, Israel's continued presence, along with the atrocities committed by its allies, notably the Sabra and Shatila massacre, where 2,000 to 3,500 Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians were killed, sowed the seeds of resistance.</p>

<p>Among the groups that rose in response was Hezbollah, which was initially formed by Shia Muslim leaders with support from Iran. Representing the marginalised Shia population, Hezbollah quickly became a powerful militia, recruiting heavily from disaffected youth in Beirut's southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley.</p>

<h2><strong>1983-1985: Bloodshed and Resistance</strong></h2>

<p>Between 1982 and 1986, Hezbollah, or groups associated with it, were blamed for several attacks on foreign forces in Lebanon. The most significant of these was the October 1983 bombing of French and American military barracks in Beirut, killing over 300 peacekeepers. While claimed by the Islamic Jihad group, many believed Hezbollah was behind the attack.</p>

<p>By 1985, Hezbollah had grown in strength to force Israeli military to withdraw from much of southern Lebanon, though Israel maintained a "security zone" along the border, policed by its Christian-dominated proxy, the South Lebanon Army (SLA).</p>

<h2><strong>1992-1996: Hezbollah's Political Rise</strong></h2>

<p>Following the end of Lebanon's civil war in 1992, Hezbollah transitioned into a political player, winning eight seats in Lebanon's 128-member parliament. Over the years, its influence would only grow, both politically and militarily, especially as it provided extensive social services in Shia-dominated areas.</p>

<p>At the same time, its resistance against Israeli forces continued. In 1993, Israel launched "Operation Accountability" in retaliation for Hezbollah's attacks on northern Israel, leading to a brief but intense conflict that killed 118 Lebanese civilians. The violence escalated again in 1996 with "Operation Grapes of Wrath," as Israel attempted to push Hezbollah.</p>

<h2><strong>2000-2006: Israeli Withdrawal and the July War</strong></h2>

<p>In May 2000, Israel unilaterally withdrew from southern Lebanon after nearly two decades of occupation, a move largely attributed to Hezbollah's resistance. This victory solidified Hezbollah's status not just as a militia, but as a formidable political force within Lebanon and a symbol of Arab resistance against Israel.</p>

<p>In 2006, the simmering tensions boiled over when Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers, leading to the July War. The 34-day conflict resulted in heavy casualties: 1,200 Lebanese and 158 Israelis.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2009-2024: Regional Conflict&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>By 2009, Hezbollah was no longer just a militia or a resistance movement and had become the dominant military and political force in Lebanon. This power was further demonstrated during Syria's civil war. Starting in 2012, Hezbollah intervened on behalf of the Assad regime, a move that cost it some support among Arabs but solidified its alliance with Iran and bolstered its battlefield experience.</p>

<p>The Gaza war of 2023 drew Hezbollah back into direct confrontation with Israel. When Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel in October 2023, Hezbollah escalated the conflict, launching rocket attacks from Lebanon and suffering retaliatory strikes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passenger, on board a Brazilian flight, had to be handcuffed and strapped to her seat after she repeatedly screamed that the aircraft was on fire. The unidentified woman, who was reportedly drunk, caused panic among passengers when she started shouting that the Azul Airlines flight from Recife, Brazil, was doomed to crash.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In footage shared by the NY Post, flight attendants were seen rushing to calm the woman, who continued yelling and resisting their attempts to restrain her. Despite efforts to subdue her with handcuffs, the passenger swatted away at the staff and continued to scream about an imaginary fire. The situation escalated as she was eventually moved to the plane's galley, where crew members finally managed to hold her down.</p>

After the three-hour flight landed at Viracopos Airport, the unruly passenger was arrested by authorities, according to Brazilian media reports.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Azul Airlines later issued a statement confirming the incident, “An undisciplined customer was immobilised during the journey, as she was a risk to the crew and other customers,” the airline said. “This company follows the highest safety standards and regulations of national and international authorities. In addition, we periodically conduct training with staff at airports, including aircrews and pilots, in order to prepare them to deal with disruptive customers.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier, an EasyJet flight bound for Kos International Airport in Greece was forced to make an <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-easyjet-flight-forced-to-make-emergency-landing-after-drunk-passenger-causes-chaos-mid-air-6503079">unexpected emergency landing</a> at Munich International Airport after a reportedly intoxicated passenger sparked midair chaos. The trouble began two hours into the scheduled four-hour flight from London Gatwick Airport.</p>

<p>The traveller berated the Captain and sparked midair chaos, which led German police to escort him off the plane. Authorities took the passenger into custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, known for its involvement in sex trafficking, drug dealing, and human smuggling, has infiltrated New York City amidst a surge in migrants.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The feared Venezuelan criminal organisation, Tren de Aragua, which is known for its involvement in sex trafficking, human smuggling, and drug dealing, has infiltrated New York City, according to <em>The New York Post. </em>The influential surge of the gang coincides with an influx of migrants within the last two years.</p>

<p>The Tren de Aragua has not been around for long, but it is terrorising the inhabitants with armed members riding mopeds. They have had involvements in illegal gun sales, and the armed outfit even manages to function right under the noses of security guards at private shelters. The gang also runs prostitution rings in neighbourhoods most severely affected by the influx of migrants.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/23/us-news/how-tren-de-aragua-used-nyc-migrant-shelters-to-build-a-criminal-empire-hiding-in-plain-sight/"><em>NYPost </em></a>reported that the gang is also selling Tussi, or "pink cocaine," a deadly mixture of fentanyl, complicating the list of dangers from which they operate. Tren de Aragua's explosive growth tends to overwhelm not only ordinary New Yorkers but the police force of the city as well. The racket's actions appear to have diminished the safety of the residents, which is a vital challenge to the law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>“Not every migrant is here to commit crimes; not every migrant is a gang member,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/23/us-news/how-tren-de-aragua-used-nyc-migrant-shelters-to-build-a-criminal-empire-hiding-in-plain-sight/"><em>The Post.</em></a> “But these TDA guys hide very well in plain sight in the migrant community.</p>

<p>“We aren't looking to grab the food delivery guy, but these guys go so far as to wear Uber Eats clothing and [use] the delivery bags while they're out there committing their crimes,” the chief told <em>The Post.</em> “When we do arrest them, they are very eager to talk about the crime they have committed.</p>

<p>The gang, whose name means “train from Aragua” (a state in north-central Venezuela) in Spanish, now runs citywide theft and robbery crews that have terrorised neighbourhoods.<br />
<br />
<strong>Police Emphasise That Venezuelan Gang Has Not Taken Control of the City</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, reacting to the popular narrative about gangs having "taken over" the city, Aurora Police Department Chief <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/aurora-police-deny-tren-de-aragua-gang-has-taken-over-city-presser">Todd Chamberlain has said</a>, "I can tell you right now, gangs are not in control of the city of Aurora. If you walk away with anything, that's what I will say. Are there gangs in the city of Aurora? Yes. There are. Are there gangs in most major cities throughout the United States? 100% there are."</p>

<p>"This is not an immigration issue. It's a crime issue," said chief Chamberlain during the press conference. "That is for the federal [government]. The immigration aspect is for the federal, it's for what they focus on. It's what they've done. It's what comes out of federal government. It comes out of the White House."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While some platforms offer users the choice to opt out of data sharing for AI training, it's important to note that publicly posted content can still be accessed by third parties.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several major social media platforms are using user data to enhance their artificial intelligence capabilities. OpenAI, for instance, has admitted to using copyrighted materials to develop ChatGPT. LinkedIn is another example, employing user resumes to refine its AI models. Even Snapchat has acknowledged using user selfies to personalize ads, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/tech/social-media-ai-data-opt-out/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>These platforms are leveraging a wealth of conversational data from social media posts, including slang and real-time events. However, many users may feel uncomfortable with their personal information being used to train these AI systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>David Ogiste, founder of Nobody's Cafe, expressed concerns about the lack of transparency regarding data usage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Right now, there is a lot of fear being created around AI, some of it well-founded and some based in science fiction, so it's on these platforms to be very open about how they will and won't use our data to help alleviate some of the reactions that this type of news brings - which for me, it doesn't feel like that has been done yet," Mr Ogiste told CNN. He emphasized the need for platforms to be more open about their practices and provide clear opt-out options.</p>

<p>While some platforms offer users the choice to opt out of data sharing for AI training, it's important to note that publicly posted content can still be accessed by third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Here's a breakdown of how major social media platforms handle user data for AI:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: Offers an opt-out option for AI training data, but previous training may have already occurred.</li>
	<li><strong>X (formerly Twitter):</strong> Requires users to opt-out if they don't want their posts used to train Grok.</li>
	<li><strong>Snapchat: </strong>Uses selfies for AI-generated ads but allows users to opt-out.</li>
	<li><strong>Reddit: </strong>Shares public user data with third parties for AI training, but private content is not shared.</li>
	<li><strong>Meta: </strong>Uses public Facebook and Instagram data for AI training, but private messages are not used.</li>
</ul>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Monetary Fund said it's looking forward to working with Sri Lanka's newly elected leftist president, including on the latest review of the country's $3 billion bailout package.</p>

<p>"We will discuss the timing of the third review of the IMF-supported program with the new administration as soon as practicable," the organization said in a statement after President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was sworn into office on Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We look forward to working together with President Dissanayake and his team towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery since entering one of its worst economic crises in 2022," the IMF added.</p>

<p>Dissanayake had campaigned on a promise to reopen negotiations with the IMF on the country's big loan program. It came with deeply unpopular tax hikes and spending cuts that made the cost-of-living crisis a top issue for voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reviewing the debt plan, though, risks delaying additional loans from the international organization. Sri Lanka needs to meet certain fiscal criteria before the next round of funding is released.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The country's former president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, brokered the deal with the IMF and said upending it would be a costly mistake for the economy. Prior to the cash injection, the country faced an unprecedented economic crisis where spiraling inflation wiped out household savings and ignited protests.</p>

<p>Investors hope that Dissanayake will stick with the loan plan. Rizvie Salih, an executive committee member of the president's coalition party, said Saturday that the country will remain with the program but seek modifications.</p>

<p>In its statement, the IMF said the recent agreement with bondholders "represents significant progress in Sri Lanka's debt restructuring process," adding that it's still "subject to confirmation on comparability of treatment by Sri Lanka's Official Creditors Committee."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telegram founder and chief executive Pavel Durov said Monday that the messaging platform had removed more "problematic content", weeks after his arrest in France on charges of failing to act against criminals using the app.</p>

<p>Telegram's search feature "has been abused by people who violated our terms of service to sell illegal goods", Durov told the 13 million subscribers of his personal messaging channel.</p>

<p>"Over the past few weeks" staff had combed through Telegram using artificial intelligence to ensure "all the problematic content we identified in Search is no longer accessible", he said.</p>

<p>Durov added that the platform had updated its terms of service and privacy policy to make clear that it would share infringers' details with authorities -- including internet IP addresses and phone numbers -- "in response to valid legal requests".</p>

<p>"We won't let bad actors jeopardise the integrity of our platform for almost a billion users," he said.</p>

<p>Durov was arrested on August 24 as he arrived at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on a private jet.</p>

<p>After days of questioning, he was charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist and terrorist content and released on a five-million-euro ($5.6 million) bail.</p>

<p>During the investigation he must remain in France and report to police twice a week.</p>

<p>Durov -- who holds Russian, French and United Arab Emirates passports -- initially criticised his arrest, but he has since announced steps appearing to bow to Paris's demands.</p>

<p>On September 6, he said Telegram would alter its "people nearby" feature to present users with "legitimate businesses" rather than "bots and scammers".</p>

<p>"This year we are committed to turn moderation on Telegram from an area of criticism into one of praise," he said at the time.</p>

<p>Durov, an enigmatic figure who rarely speaks in public, has a fortune estimated at $15.5 billion by Forbes magazine, but touts the virtues of an ascetic life that includes ice baths and not drinking alcohol or coffee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Taliban's decision to halt door-to-door polio vaccinations in Afghanistan has jeopardized the nation's fight against the disease.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major setback to the efforts to eliminate the highly infectious polio disease in Afghanistan, the Taliban leadership has called off a nationwide vaccination campaign. The unexpected decision was taken by the Taliban government only a few days before the campaign was about to start. With 18 confirmed cases this year (three times the number reported in 2023) Afghanistan is now at risk of a resurgence of the highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization warns that unvaccinated populations of children, especially in areas with expanding polio outbreaks, could undo years of global efforts to eradicate the virus.</p>

<p>"The reason behind the postponing of the polio campaign is the issues with the modality of implementation," the health official explained to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/17/taliban-curbs-women-risk-polio-outbreak-vaccination-campaign-health-officials-warn"><em>The Guardian </em></a>on condition of anonymity. "The leadership of the current government has ordered us to not conduct door-to-door campaigns."</p>

<p>Instead, the Taliban government wants to shift vaccination efforts to local mosques, with the expectation that families would bring their children to get doses.</p>

<p>"This is very bad news for the polio programme," the official said. "For the eradication to be successful, we need to cover more than 95% of the children with two doses of the vaccine.</p>

<p>"But without the door-to-door campaigns, we will not be able to reach [that target]. It puts the whole country at risk, even the region."</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/17/taliban-curbs-women-risk-polio-outbreak-vaccination-campaign-health-officials-warn"><em> The Guardian</em></a>, while the Taliban have banned women from working in various sectors, women in healthcare have largely been allowed to remain in their jobs.</p>

<p>However, the healthcare worker said: "Women in the southern region face restrictions from local authorities in participating in the programme, particularly in the rural areas."</p>

<p>The health official agreed. "Women have been crucial to the success of the door-to-door campaigns and raising awareness of the vaccines among mothers and families since, in a deeply conservative society, men would not be allowed into those spaces," they said.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.unicef.org/afghanistan/polio-eradication">United Nations</a>, Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only two remaining polio-endemic countries in the world. In Afghanistan, despite continuous concerted efforts by the polio program to achieve polio-free status, the battle to finish the last mile has become a pivoting challenge, resulting in an increase in the number of polio cases during the last three years. Unfortunately, poliovirus is currently spreading to the provinces that have remained polio-free for a long time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

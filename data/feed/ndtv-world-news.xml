       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world reacted with horror 10 years ago when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.</p>

<p>The crash came in the early stages of a war in which Moscow seized the Crimean Peninsula from Kyiv and stoked an insurgency by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine's east.</p>

<h3><strong>What happened?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The doomed flight took off from Amsterdam on a bright summer's day on July 17, 2014.</p>

<p>Among the passengers were Dutch HIV/AIDS expert Joep Lange, on his way to a conference in Melbourne, and Jeroen and Nicole Wals and their four children, who were Malaysia-bound on a holiday.</p>

<p>At 4:19 pm (1319 GMT), while flying over eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region where pro-Russian separatist rebels were battling Ukraine forces, the plane exploded in mid-air, at an altitude of 33,000 feet (10.1 kilometres).</p>

<p>All 298 people on board were killed, 196 of them Dutch, as well as 43 Malaysians and 38 Australians.</p>

<p>A later reconstruction of the jet using some of the wreckage revealed the horror of the plane's last moments.</p>

<p>"The forward section of the aircraft was penetrated by hundreds of high-energy objects coming from the warhead," a Dutch-led international investigation heard.</p>

<p>"As a result of the impact and the subsequent blast, the three crew members in the cockpit were killed immediately and the aeroplane broke up in the air."</p>

<p>The investigators said some of the passengers may have known for up to 90 seconds that they were about to die.</p>

<h3><strong>Who was held responsible?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Russia and Ukraine immediately traded blame for the plane's downing.</p>

<p>The international probe in 2016 found "irrefutable evidence" that the plane was downed by a Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missile system which was transported from Russia to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Investigators later determined that the missile originated in a Russian military brigade based in the western city of Kursk.</p>

<p>Russia denied that any anti-aircraft missile crossed the border.</p>

<p>In June 2019, four senior figures in east Ukraine's self-styled rebel Donetsk People's Republic, Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov of Russia, and Leonid Kharchenko of Ukraine were charged with murder.</p>

<p>They were accused of bringing the missile system to the launch site in eastern Ukraine (but not of actually pressing the button).</p>

<p>The investigators said there were "strong indications" that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the supply of the missile.</p>

<h3><strong>Was anyone convicted?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>After a two-and-a-half-year trial, a Dutch court in November 2022 convicted Girkin, Dubinsky, and Kharchenko in absentia of murder and intentionally causing an aircraft to crash and sentenced them to life in prison.</p>

<p>The three refused to take part in the legal proceedings or acknowledge their roles in the incident.</p>

<p>Pulatov was acquitted.</p>

<p>Russia dismissed the court verdict as politically motivated.</p>

<p>In January 2024, Girkin was jailed for four years in Russia for repeatedly criticising the Kremlin for not pursuing a more aggressive offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In 2023, the MH17 crash investigators suspended their work, saying there was not enough evidence to prosecute more suspects.</p>

<h3><strong>Has justice been served?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>An investigation against Russia is still ongoing at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency.</p>

<p>The Netherlands and Ukraine have also jointly taken a case against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, however, hope is fading that any of those responsible will ever be brought to justice.</p>

<p>"In the end, we were unable to put anyone behind bars," Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told public broadcaster NOS on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the disaster.</p>

<p>"That sense of justice is there, but ultimately not as it should have been," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American singer Ingrid Andress has revealed that she was "drunk" when she performed the national anthem at the Major League Baseball's (MLB) Home Run Derby and is seeking treatment now.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Andress, 32, addressed her out-of-tune performance of the 'Star-Spangled Banner' at the Globe Life Field in Texas' Arlington on Monday evening and announced that she would check into a rehab facility for required help.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/e093z2NoJo">pic.twitter.com/e093z2NoJo</a></p>
— Ingrid Andress (@IngridAndress) <a href="https://twitter.com/IngridAndress/status/1813261515257999679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"I'm not gonna bulls*** y'll, I was drunk last night. I'm checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need," she wrote. Andress later apologised to her fans and the MLB for the same.</p>

<p>"I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country for that rendition. I'll let y'all know how rehab is. I hear it's super fun," she added.</p>

<p>Soon after Andress' performance, social media was abuzz with criticism.</p>

<p>Many speculated the singer struggled with more than just the in-ear issues on stage. Her performance, according to reports, started off-key and even strained for high notes.</p>

<p>Several termed it among the worst national anthem performances ever heard during a major professional sporting event, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>Some social media users compared it to Fergie's rendition before the 2018 NBA All-Star game.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Ingrid Andress?</strong></h2>

<p>Andress came into the limelight after her appearance in the second season of The Sing-Off as a part of the Pitch Slapped group in 2010. While the group got eliminated early, Andress returned to the show as part of another group, Delilah, in the next season.</p>

<p>In 2020, she debuted her first album, Lady Like, which topped the Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.</p>

<p>She was later nominated for the Best New Artist Grammy in 2021. However, she lost to rapper Megan Thee Stallion.</p>

<p>While her most recent album -- Good Person -- was released in 2022, Andress is now gearing up for the release of her new single Colorado 9 next week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronauts often report that the joy of eating is lost in space. Food that tastes fabulous on Earth may become <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899900702009358?via%3Dihub">bland and boring in orbit</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, despite carefully designed diets, space travellers often <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/human-adaptation-2021-final.pdf">struggle to eat enough to meet their energy needs</a>.</p>

<p>What's going on here? We carried out some experiments on Earth to find out, using virtual reality (VR) and a simulated spacecraft environment to study how space travel might affect a person's sense of smell and experience of food.</p>

<p>We discovered that some smells seem much more intense in a space-like environment – and earlier theories about how zero gravity affects the body can't be the whole story. Our results, <a href="https://ifst.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijfs.17306">published</a> in the International Journal of Food Science and Technology, could help design the space menus of the future.</p>

<h2>Eating is a complicated experience</h2>

<p>Eating is a multi-sensory experience that involves sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch.</p>

<p>To enjoy the flavour of food – say, when biting into an apple – we need a combination of sensations, including taste (sweet, sour), smell (the complex combination of apple aromas), texture (the crunch), colour (green, red), and touch (firmness). If any of these senses is dulled, our enjoyment of food will not be the same.</p>

<p>The experience of food in space is very different from what we are used to on Earth.</p>

<p>One possible explanation for why space travellers experience taste differently involves the lack of gravity. Without gravity, bodily fluids are not drawn towards the feet but instead <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb10622.x">shift towards the head</a>, leading to a sensation <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1541-4337.12633">like having a blocked nose</a>. If you've ever had a cold, you know how difficult it is to taste and enjoy food without your sense of smell.</p>

<p>But could there be other reasons?</p>

<h2>The importance of environment</h2>

<p>In space, the environment is unfamiliar and consistently monotonous. Could this change our perception of food?</p>

<p>Context heavily contributes to the eating experience. Studies have shown that eating the same meal in <a href="https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-82188b09-5e0d-341c-a5c2-826baefddca6">different settings</a> can lead to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329302001891">varying opinions</a> about the meal. Think about enjoying a picnic sandwich in a scenic park versus eating the same sandwich quickly at your work desk.</p>

<p>A spacecraft is an enclosed and confined environment, an airtight container in which you are surrounded by wiring and equipment and with no boundary between work and personal space. Imagine being in a pandemic-grade lockdown for multiple years with limited food and essential goods (and a persistent blocked nose).</p>

<p>One <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/joss.12254">taste-test study</a> compared airline meals consumed in three settings: a classic sensory laboratory environment (quiet, closed or semi-closed cubicles – like a voting booth), a semi-realistic aircraft environment simulated in a laboratory using aircraft furnishings, and an actual flight.</p>

<p>Passengers in the simulated aircraft environment enjoyed their meals about as much as passengers on an actual flight did. (Both of them liked it less than the people in the lab environment did.) This suggests the aircraft environment has a significant influence on food enjoyment.</p>

<h2>Bringing space to Earth</h2>

<p>Research involving humans in space is very challenging. Space missions typically involve at most <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-facts-and-figures/">six or seven crew members</a>, which limits the sample size for experiments and the predictive power of the results.</p>

<p>Moreover, for food research, each person has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221479931500048X">unique sensory experiences</a> and responses toward them. This makes it challenging to understand how different individuals perceive smells in space, let alone food aromas.</p>

<p>So we set out to recreate space on Earth. Using VR, we simulated the environment of the International Space Station.</p>

<p>The VR setup let us obtain data about participants' feelings regarding food stimuli “in the moment”, rather than waiting for them to take off the headset and asking them questions afterwards. VR is a vital training environment for astronauts because of its unmatched ability to create a realistic sense of presence, crucial for studying what it is like to live in a spacecraft.</p>

</figure>

<p>Our study is the first to involve a significant sample size (54 people) to capture the variation of individuals' personal experiences of aromas and taste in simulated isolated settings.</p>

<p>In our study comparing everyday aromas, some scents were perceived differently in the virtual International Space Station environment compared to the partitioned booth environment.</p>

<h2>Molecular magic of aroma</h2>

<p>Aromas are <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemistry/articles/10.3389/fchem.2022.820749/full">a complex blend of molecules</a> with unique chemical structures, influencing how they interact with the olfactory receptors in the nose to form distinctive smells.</p>

<p>Our study suggests that only specific aroma compounds are perceived differently in space-like environments. We found that sweet-smelling molecules tended to be perceived more strongly.</p>

<p>Vanilla and almond, which both contain the sweet, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b05845">almond- or cherry-scented</a> compound benzaldehyde, smelled stronger in our VR space station than in the control environment. By contrast, there was no difference in perception of the lemon aroma.</p>

<p>This knowledge could be used in designing space meals. For example, the sweet aromas could be used as flavour enhancers or additives to bring out other flavours and add depth.</p>

<p>Understanding how these aroma compounds interact with each other, and finding the right concentration levels is essential. And of course, no single flavour will suit everybody's taste.</p>

<h2>Earthly implications</h2>

<p>A better understanding of how smell is perceived in space-like environments could inspire ways to create personalised diets based on each astronaut's unique sensory experiences and preferences. By tailoring food aromas, we could encourage space travellers not only to eat more, but enjoy food more.</p>

<p>These solutions may also help people on Earth living in isolated or confined environments, such as nursing home residents, individuals on military deployment, and submarine crews.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service is facing intense scrutiny after a shooter opened fire on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally, and questions have emerged about why no sniper team was positioned on the building from which the shots were fired. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has attributed the absence of a sniper team to the "sloped roof" of the building, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-rally-shooting-unacceptable-secret-service-director-abc-exclusive/story?id=111962314">ABC News</a>, Cheatle explained, "That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. The decision was made to secure the building from inside."</p>

<p>The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had a clear line of sight of Trump from the roof, which was approximately 130 yards away. Using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle, Crooks opened fire, injuring Trump and two others, and killing firefighter Corey Comperatore. Secret Service snipers ultimately killed Crooks.</p>

<p>Despite acknowledging the agency's missteps, Cheatle refused to step down, stating, "It was unacceptable, and it's something that shouldn't happen again. The buck stops with me."</p>

<p>The incident has spurred a wave of criticism toward the Secret Service for failing to fulfil its "no fail" responsibility of protecting high-profile figures. President Joe Biden announced an independent review of the agency's handling of the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, and Republican leaders in Congress have also called for an investigation.</p>

<p>Key questions remain about the safety roles at the rally and why the roof used by Crooks was not secured. Cheatle noted that the building where the shooter was located was in the "outer perimeter" of the rally, which was the responsibility of local police. "There was local police in that building -- there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building," she said, though she did not clarify how the shooter was able to access the roof.</p>

<p>The attack has prompted the Secret Service to vow full cooperation with the independent review. Cheatle stated, "The Secret Service is working with all involved federal, state, and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again. We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President Biden yesterday and will participate fully."</p>

<p>The rally, held in Butler, Pennsylvania, was interrupted when multiple gunshots rang out. Trump, visibly injured with blood on his ear and cheek, was swiftly surrounded by Secret Service agents and rushed to safety. The shooter and a bystander were killed, and two spectators were injured.</p>

<p>Newly surfaced video supports witness reports that they had alerted police to the shooter on the roof. According to the Washington Post, shots targeting Trump were fired 86 seconds after the first attempts to warn the police.</p>

<p>In response to the incident, Biden has ordered a comprehensive review of security at the rally and at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is expected to be the party's presidential nominee. Additionally, Secret Service protection has been extended to independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, whose candidacy could impact key swing states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bodies of six foreign nationals were found in a luxury hotel room in central Bangkok on Tuesday, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six people have been discovered dead in a suite of a Bangkok hotel, sparking a wave of confusion and speculation across the city. Initially reported as a shooting, authorities have since debunked these claims, focusing instead on a harrowing possibility: poisoning. The victims, all Vietnamese nationals, including two with dual US citizenship, were found in a room at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel.</p>

<p>The cleaning staff discovered the bodies at 4.30 pm on the fifth floor of the hotel. Police were called, and PM Thavisin arrived soon after. "There were no signs of a struggle," the prime minister told a press conference at the hotel.</p>

<p>Thai police, in a subsequent press conference, revealed that preliminary investigations indicated no signs of physical altercation or robbery. Instead, suspicions turned towards a lethal ingestion of a toxic substance, possibly cyanide.</p>

<p>"One of the six dead caused this incident using cyanide," said Noppasil Poonsawas, deputy commander of investigations at Bangkok's Metropolitan Police Bureau, in a press conference. "We are confident that one of the six conducted the crime."</p>

<p>But photos released by police of a bloodless crime scene showed plates of untouched Thai food, and two thermos flasks of coffee and cups.</p>

<p>The police chief said they needed to find out why this happened, adding it was a "killing", not a suicide.</p>

<p>The motive behind this tragic incident remains unclear as authorities delve deeper into the backgrounds of the deceased. Some of the victims were visiting Thailand for the first time, while others were familiar with the country's attractions.</p>

<p>The area where the incident occurred is popular with tourists and has many shopping malls and attractions. There was a shooting in the area last year in which three people were killed. Thailand's tourism industry has been recovering slowly from the pandemic, with 28 million visitors in 2023, up from 11 million the previous year.</p>

<p>The government hopes to attract 35 million visitors in 2024 and generate $55 billion in revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a warehouse in the lush humid farmlands of central Thailand, thousands of pythons lie coiled in containers, rearing and striking at the glass as people pass by.</p>

<p>They are being raised for their robust, diamond-patterned skins, which are sold to high-end European fashion houses for belts, bags and handbags, but some scientists and industry insiders believe the snakes' true value could lie in their meat.</p>

<p>Demand for meat is growing globally, despite the carbon footprint associated with traditional livestock, and while a plant-based diet is often touted as the best alternative, some feel reptiles have been overlooked as an option.</p>

<p>Snakes can tolerate high temperatures and drought, reproduce quickly, and grow far faster than traditional sources of animal protein while consuming a lot less food.</p>

<p>Researchers estimate that China and Vietnam alone have at least 4,000 python farms, producing several million snakes, mostly for the fashion industry.</p>

<p>"Python farming may offer a flexible and efficient response to global food insecurity," concluded a study published earlier this year in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>The researchers spent a year studying nearly 5,000 reticulated Burmese pythons at two commercial farms in Vietnam and Thailand.</p>

<p>"They can survive for months on end with no food at all and no water, and literally they won't lose condition at all," said Patrick Aust, director of the African Institute of Applied Herpetology and one of the scientists involved in the study.</p>

<p>The pythons were fed waste chicken and wild-caught rodents and offered a more efficient feed-to-meat ratio than poultry, beef and even crickets.</p>

<p>They also reproduce rapidly, Aust said, with female pythons laying between 50 and 100 eggs annually.</p>

<h3><strong>'Complete waste'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>That is music to the ears of Emilio Malucchi, whose farm in central Thailand's Uttaradit houses around 9,000 pythons.</p>

<p>Malucchi, who moved to Thailand from Italy with his family more than four decades ago, has had little success convincing people to take up snake meat, and most of what he produces is either discarded or goes to fish farms.</p>

<p>"It's a complete waste," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"I eat my snakes because I know what they eat and how I raise them," he said.</p>

<p>Wild python has long been eaten throughout Southeast Asia, but the meat has yet to attract widespread international interest despite offering a chicken-like texture low in saturated fats.</p>

<p>"The problem is that there is no market for python flesh. We need to educate people about its possibilities," said Malucchi.</p>

<p>The climate impact of meat has been extensively documented, with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noting that meat from grazing animals -- mainly beef -- has been "consistently identified as the single food with the greatest impact on the environment."</p>

<p>That effect is both in terms of greenhouse emissions and land use change.</p>

<p>While the UN and climate activists advocate moving to a more plant-based diet, the OECD estimates demand for meat will increase 14 per cent by 2032, driven by population growth in low-income regions and rising living standards in Asian countries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, drought and extreme weather are making traditional farming increasingly difficult in many parts of the world where the need for protein is urgent.</p>

<p>Protein-energy malnutrition, sometimes called protein-energy undernutrition, caused nearly 190,000 deaths globally in 2021, according to the Global Burden of Disease study.</p>

<h3><strong>'Nice and crispy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>That paradox has spurred a push to explore meat alternatives, from edible insects to lab-grown meats.</p>

<p>But uptake of these alternatives has not yet been significant and commercial python farmers face strict processing standards that the industry complains are outdated.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, Aust believes python farming has "huge potential" and is enthusiastic about its merits.</p>

<p>"You can barbecue it or eat it in curries and stews. I like to fry it in garlic butter until it's nice and crispy," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a very versatile meat."</p>

<p>Animal welfare organisations are less impressed.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, animal rights group PETA accused Malucchi's farm of cruelty after secretly documenting his pythons being killed with hammers before being skinned.</p>

<p>Malucchi has placed large posters on his walls on how to kill pythons "humanely" and said his industry is no different from other types of livestock farming.</p>

<p>"Farm animals are slaughtered all over the world," he said.</p>

<p>"Pythons are no different."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump called JD Vance on Monday to offer him the vice presidential post just 20 minutes before making the announcement. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Former US President Donald Trump has picked JD Vance, a Republican senator, as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election. On his Truth Social platform, Trump said that after lengthy deliberation and thought, and "considering the tremendous talents of many others", he decided Vance was best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States.</p>

<p>According to a source, the Republican nominee called the Ohio senator on Monday to offer him the vice presidential post just 20 minutes before making the announcement. The two met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday before the rally where Trump was shot at.</p>

<p>Vance and Trump share similar views on issues such as immigration and trade.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Trump chose JD Vance</strong></h2>

<p>Donald Trump, recently, spent months evaluating potential running mates, observing how they performed on TV, at fundraisers and rallies. Some contenders accompanied him to his criminal trial in New York, while others joined him at the debate last month. The debate was known for President Joe Biden's poor performance, which led to calls for him to step down and let a younger candidate take his place.</p>

<p>Trump's choice of JD Vance as his running mate is a strategic move to energise his loyal base. Vance has established himself as a leader who can carry Trump's mantle into the future, thanks to his frequent appearances on the conservative media circuit and his willingness to spar with reporters on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>In his announcement post, Trump praised Vance for his dedication to American workers and farmers, saying he "will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for" in Midwestern states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Minnesota, as per AP.</p>

<p>Vance and Trump also regularly talk over the phone.</p>

<p>The former president has even complimented the senator's looks, comparing him to a young Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Vance was once a vocal critic of Donald Trump, labelling him "a total fraud," an "idiot", "a moral disaster", and even "America's Hitler."</p>

<p>However, as Trump's political fortunes soared, Vance's perspective shifted dramatically. Despite his early scepticism, Vance later praised Trump's presidency, crediting him with "delivering peace and prosperity."</p>

<p>This change in stance led to Trump endorsing him during his 2022 Senate bid.</p>

<p>Now a steadfast Trump loyalist, Vance has actively defended him against criminal and civil charges and questioned the 2020 election results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sikh Republican Harmeet Dhillon delivered a prayer at the Republican National Convention (RNC) on Monday.&nbsp;Ms Dhillon, a religious-liberty lawyer and former Donald Trump campaign adviser, told the Milwaukee audience that she comes from a family of Sikh immigrants. She shared a prayer from her faith tradition, which translates to, "This body and soul are yours. You are our mother and father, and we are your children. In your grace and through your benevolence, we experience peace and happiness!"&nbsp;<br />
<br />
She then thanked God for protecting Donald Trump, who was shot at on Sunday at a Pennsylvania rally. She said, “We thank you, dear God, for protecting his life.”<br />
<br />
However, some conservative Christians on X criticised Ms Dhillon's prayer, saying it was "unacceptable" and that she was praying to a "foreign god."&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential nominee Donald Trump would let Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell complete his four-year term to 2026 if he returns to the White House, he said in an interview published Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I would let him serve it out, especially if I thought he was doing the right thing," Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek, according to CNBC's website.</p>

<p>In April, it was reported that allies of Trump's campaign were drafting various proposals to weaken the independence of the US central bank, the most radical of which involved firing its chairman.</p>

<p>Trump regularly criticizes Powell, who he selected to head the Fed when he was in the White House.</p>

<p>In February, the Republican decried Powell's decision to lower interest rates in 2024, saying it would help the Democratic Party win the presidential election.</p>

<p>He also said he would not reappoint him if elected president.</p>

<p>Powell was first brought onto the Fed's board of governors by Democratic president Barack Obama in 2012.</p>

<p>Trump appointed him to lead the financial institution in 2018 and President Joe Biden selected him to serve a second term in 2022.</p>

<p>Powell's 14-year term on the Fed's board of governors will end in 2028.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, who has been named former US President Donald Trump's running mate, stirred a controversy after he said that that UK under Labour might be the first "truly Islamist" country with nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Vance said he had been discussing with a friend which country would be the first "truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon".</p>

<p>"Maybe it's Iran, maybe Pakistan kind of counts, and then we sort of decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labour just took over," he said last week at a conference for UK Conservatives last week.</p>

<p>Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, meanwhile, played down Vance's comments, saying he had a history of making "fruity" remarks.</p>

<p>Britain would work with whoever won November's US presidential election, Angela Rayner said, adding that "I don't recognise that characterisation".</p>

<p>"We're interested in governing on behalf of Britain, and also working with our international allies," she said.</p>

<p>In one of his first interviews after being named the Vice Presidential pick, Vance also branded China the biggest threat to America, underscoring the likely hawkish stance of their administration toward Beijing if elected.</p>

<p>The Ohio Senator made the remarks in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday. When asked about the war in Ukraine, Vance said Trump would negotiate with Moscow and Kyiv to "bring this thing to a rapid close so America can focus on the real issue, which is China."</p>

<p>"That's the biggest threat to our country and we are completely distracted from it," he said</p>

<p>Vance, 39, was tapped by Trump days after a failed assassination attempt on the former president upended what had already been a chaotic presidential contest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The significant electricity consumption of these companies calls for ongoing discussions around sustainability and renewable energy adoption.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech giants Google and Microsoft each consumed 24 TWh of electricity in 2023, surpassing the consumption of more than 100 countries, new research claims.</p>

<p>Analysis by Michael Thomas, shared on X, states that both Google and Microsoft used the same amount of energy as Azerbaijan, which has a GDP of $78.7 billion. In 2023, Google's revenue was $307.4 billion, and Microsoft's was $211.9 billion, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/google-and-microsoft-now-each-consume-more-power-than-some-fairly-big-countries"><em>Tech Radar </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This massive energy usage underscores the significant environmental impact of these companies but also highlights their potential to lead more sustainable initiatives.</p>

<p>For comparison, Iceland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, and Tunisia each consumed 19 TWh, while Jordan consumed 20 TWh. Libya (25 TWh) and Slovakia (26 TWh) used slightly more power.</p>

<p>The comparison between entire countries and two single companies emphasizes the colossal energy demands of Big Tech. It also points to the environmental impacts of data centers that power cloud services and the new generation of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The significant electricity consumption of these companies calls for ongoing discussions around sustainability and renewable energy adoption. Both Google and Microsoft have pledged to be carbon-free or carbon-negative by the end of the decade and have significantly scaled up investments in cleaner energies and energy matching.</p>

<p>With market caps of $2.294 trillion and $3.372 trillion respectively, Google and Microsoft are currently the world's fourth and second-most valuable companies. Given the scale of their operations, comparable to entire nations, their actions in preventing and reversing environmental damage are closely watched.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Taking to his X handle, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he is moving the headquarters of both SpaceX and the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to Texas]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taking to his X handle, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he is moving the headquarters of both SpaceX and the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to Texas, citing several criticisms he has of California and doing business in San Francisco, Los Angeles Times reported.</p>

<p>Pointing to a new state law that bans teachers from telling families about student gender identity changes, Musk tweeted that he is moving the headquarters of SpaceX from Hawthorne to the company's launch test site in Texas, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>

<p>The move would be a blow to Southern California, where SpaceX has helped to anchor a burgeoning space economy, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>

<p>"This is the final straw," posted Musk shortly after noon. "Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."</p>

<p>The law the SpaceX founder cited was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday after a contentious battle between conservative school boards concerned about parental rights and LGBTQ activists worried about vulnerable youths.</p>

<p>Shortly after his post about moving SpaceX, Musk posted that he would also move X, formerly known as Twitter, from San Francisco to Austin, saying that he has "had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building."</p>

<p>The announcement is the latest salvo in Musk's long-running feud with California and comes nearly three years after he announced the move of Tesla's headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto, citing the high cost of housing and long commutes for employees. The electric vehicle company maintains a manufacturing operation in Fremont.</p>

<p>It comes amid the highly charged presidential campaign during which the libertarian Musk has increasingly moved to the right. Musk was one of the first entrepreneurs to openly endorse Donald Trump as President ahead of the elections.</p>

<p>Musk also drew a comment from the other side of the political spectrum, with Democratic State Senior Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, posting that Musk hugely benefitted from California subsidies. "Will this be a fake temper tantrum move just like Tesla's fake "move" to Texas?"</p>

<p>Weiner added, "I'm not confident that whatever he's going to do has anything to do with a law that we passed to protect the safety of trans kids," he said. "He has a history of saying one thing and it not being true."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden is weighing proposals to reform the Supreme Court, US media reported Tuesday, including possible term limits and a new ethics code for the conservative-dominated bench.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden is weighing proposals to reform the Supreme Court, US media reported Tuesday, including possible term limits and a new ethics code for the conservative-dominated bench.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has dealt several major blows to Democratic priorities in recent years -- most notably by repealing the nationwide right to abortion -- with Biden increasingly voicing disagreement.</p>

<p>This year the court significantly rolled back the power of federal agencies, while also partially ruling in early July in favor of ex-president Donald Trump's immunity claims.</p>

<p>Biden, seeking reelection in November against Trump, has previously resisted calls to overhaul or reform the court of nine lifetime-appointed justices, which includes three nominated by his Republican predecessor.</p>

<p>But that may be changing, according to several US media reports, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the planning.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether Biden would come out in support of the measures in the near future or in his second term if he wins the presidential election in November, the New York Times reported.</p>

<p>However, the measures Biden is reportedly considering -- including backing a constitutional amendment that would overturn the court's ruling on presidential immunity -- would require bipartisan congressional support that is almost certainly out of reach.</p>

<p>Amid the legal setbacks the Supreme Court has handed down to Democrats, it has also recently been engulfed in ethics scandals.</p>

<p>Conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas refused to step aside on cases related to the 2020 election, even as flags linked to Trump's false election claims were discovered to be flown outside Alito's home, and Thomas's wife was part of Trump's effort to overturn the vote result.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's former leading rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, offered full-throated endorsements of his candidacy at the party's convention on Tuesday, in a display of unity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former rivals of Donald Trump, including Indian-Americans Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, endorsed him at the Republican National Convention held in Milwaukee on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Taking the stage during prime time, Nikki Haley stated that agreeing with Trump on every issue is not necessary for supporting him. "Take it from me: I haven't always agreed with President Trump. But we agree more often than not," she said.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Haley criticised Trump for his age and described his comments about Black people as 'disgusting'.</p>

<p>The former UN Ambassador and South Carolina governor, once a significant rival of Trump, surprised many by appearing at the Convention. She joined other endorsers after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally on Saturday.</p>

<p>Following her endorsement, Haley used the social media platform X to highlight what she sees as failures in the Biden-Harris administration. "If we have four more years of Biden... or even a single day of Harris... our country will be worse off. For the sake of our nation, we must choose Donald Trump," she wrote.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I'll start by making one thing perfectly clear. Donald Trump has my strong endorsement.<br />
<br />
Our country is at a critical moment. We have a choice to make. For more than a year, I said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Kamala Harris. After seeing the debate, everyone…</p>
— Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley/status/1813385712546320651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Haley faced criticism for her endorsement of Trump, with some users on social media expressing disapproval. "Congratulations on completely losing respect from both sides," one user commented. Another wrote, "You should be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>The 52-year-old also pointed out Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and contrasted it with what she described as inaction by Vladimir Putin during Trump's presidency.</p>

<p>Another former Trump rival, entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy, addressed the Convention for the first time, stating, "Donald Trump is the president who will unite this country through action, not just words."</p>

<p>Ramaswamy also condemned the recent attack on Trump, which left the 78-year-old former president with a bandaged ear. The Convention marked Trump's first public appearance since the incident.</p>

<p>Ron DeSantis, conservative governor of Florida and another of Trump's challengers, also spoke at the convention, criticising President Joe Biden as unfit for the job due to his age.</p>

<p>Despite being the first former US president to be impeached twice, Trump received a loud ovation as he was officially announced as the Republican presidential candidate. He did not make any formal remarks but acknowledged and thanked his endorsers for their support.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Joe Biden faces pressure to withdraw from the presidential race due to concerns over his age, exacerbated by his poor performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>As Trump gains endorsements from former rivals, Biden is facing potential setbacks, including the possible loss of key labour endorsement from the Teamsters union. The recent assassination attempt on Trump has also added to the tension leading up to the November presidential elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A homeless black man, armed with two knives near a Republican Party Convention site in Wisconsin, was shot dead by police officers from Ohio on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homeless black man, armed with two knives near a Republican Party National Convention site in Wisconsin, was shot dead by police officers from Ohio on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to the police, the man, identified by relatives as 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe, was armed with a knife in each hand. The situation escalated when Sharpe charged at an unarmed individual, prompting the officers to open fire. Two knives were recovered from the scene.</p>

<p>"Someone's life was in danger," Milwaukee police chief Jeffrey Norman said during a press conference. "These officers, who were not from this area, took it upon themselves to act and save someone's life today."</p>

<p>The incident occurred amidst heightened security in Milwaukee, with thousands of officers from various jurisdictions present to ensure the safety of the Republican National Convention, which started on Monday and is set to conclude on Thursday.</p>

<p>The shooting, however, has sparked outrage among Milwaukee residents, who questioned the necessity of out-of-state officers patrolling their neighbourhood, which is located over a kilometre away from the convention site. Many locals gathered at the scene, voicing their anger and planning a nighttime vigil to honour Sharpe.</p>

<p>"They came into our community and shot down our family right here at a public park," said Linda Sharpe, Samuel's cousin. "What are you doing in our city, shooting people down?"</p>

<p>Linda Sharpe described her cousin Samuel as a long-time resident of a tent encampment situated across the street from King Park, where the shooting took place. This encampment is a known fixture in the neighbourhood, which hosts several social service clinics and a shelter. Residents believe that Milwaukee police officers, familiar with the local homeless population, might have been able to de-escalate the situation more effectively.</p>

<p>Norman explained that a group of 13 Columbus officers, part of a bicycle patrol, were in their designated area when they noticed the altercation involving Sharpe. They approached the scene and repeatedly commanded Sharpe to drop his weapons, but he ignored their orders and moved towards the unarmed individual, prompting the officers to fire.</p>

<p>The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office has scheduled an autopsy for Wednesday and further investigation into the shooting is underway.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump received tens of millions of views on X, researchers said Tuesday, highlighting the potential for extreme falsehoods to go viral on the Elon Musk-owned platform.</p>

<p>The social media site, formerly named Twitter, was flooded with unsubstantiated claims soon after the shooting Saturday at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which left one spectator dead and a bloodied Trump injured in the ear.</p>

<p>Those included unfounded assertions that the assassination attempt had been "staged" or an "inside job," while fingers were pointed at imaginary culprits such as Jews and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theories were viewed over 215 million times on X, the watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said after analyzing a sample of 100 popular posts.</p>

<p>A majority of the posts did not carry a "Community Note," a crowd-sourced moderation tool that Musk has promoted as the way for users to add context to the tweets, CCDH added.</p>

<p>In the first 24 hours alone, unsubstantiated narratives around the incident amassed more than 100 million views on X, according to the nonprofit research group Institute for Strategic Dialogue.</p>

<p>X did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Internet hoaxers also falsely identified several people as the shooter -- including Italian sports journalist Marco Violi, anti-Trump protester Maxwell Yearick and comedian Sam Hyde, AFP's fact-checkers reported.</p>

<p>Federal investigators have identified the shooter, who was killed on the scene, as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, several social media users voiced confusion as they scrambled to obtain accurate information in what appeared to be a sea of false or misleading posts, which rapidly gained traction.</p>

<p>The trend illustrates the ability of falsehoods to mutate into viral political discourse on tech platforms including X, which now offer fewer guardrails as they scale back content moderation.</p>

<p>Researchers say some clout-chasing accounts on the platform have a financial motive to post sensational falsehoods, as X's ad revenue-sharing program incentivizes extreme content designed to boost engagement.</p>

<p>"In the marketplace of disinformation -- which is effectively what a lot of social media platforms have now been reduced to, a marketplace for lies -- extreme content is your currency," said Imran Ahmed, chief executive and founder of CCDH.</p>

<p>"The algorithms take the most outlandish content and amplify it exponentially until the entire digital world is flooded with conspiracism, disinformation and hate."</p>

<p>Researchers have warned about a possible firehose of disinformation in the run up to the November election, which will take place in a deeply polarized political climate in the United States.</p>

<p>"Already, at an early stage in the US electoral cycle, we can see flashing warning signs that social media in the weeks and months ahead will be increasingly chaotic and rife with disinformation," Ahmed said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just days after a failed assassination bid against former US President Donald Trump, an armed man wearing a ski mask was arrested in the area where the Republican National Convention is being held, reports said.</p>

<p>The man was carrying a concealed AK-47 rifle in his tactical backpack, the Fox News reported. Officials also found a full magazine of ammunition inside the bag.</p>

<p>Prominent Republican politicians and officials are gathered at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee for the Republican convention this week.</p>

<p>"United States Capitol Police initially observed the suspect looking suspicious, wearing a ski mask and a large tactical backpack in the street," the CNN reported quoting Milwaukee Police Department.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a man - who was wielding two knives near the convention - was shot dead by the cops.&nbsp;According to the police, the man, identified by relatives as 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe, was armed with a knife in each hand. The situation escalated when Sharpe charged at an unarmed individual, prompting the officers to open fire. Two knives were recovered from the scene.</p>

<p>This comes days after a 20-year-old man was gunned down for trying to assassinate the 78-year-old former president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump survived with a nicked ear during his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday after Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at him. The attack left him with a bloodied face as the former president said the bullet pierced his "upper part of right ear".</p>

<p>Donald Trump won formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.</p>

<p>While Trump is increasingly confident of a shock return to the White House -- despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments during his first term -- President Joe Biden is reeling from weak polls and Democratic concerns over his health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States had received intelligence from a human source about an Iranian plot to kill Donald Trump weeks before the assassination attempt against the former US president on Saturday, according to national security officials. This led to increased security measures for Trump.</p>

<p>Officials, however, said that there is no known connection between this Iranian plot and the 20-year-old who attempted to assassinate Trump on Saturday.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service and the Trump campaign were notified of the Iranian threat, and security was boosted as a result, as confirmed by a US national security official.</p>

<p>Trump and his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have faced threats from Tehran since the 2020 drone strike that killed Qassim Soleimani, the leader of Iran's Quds force, in Iraq.</p>

<p>Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the US Secret Service, said that it and other agencies were "constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources as needed." He added, "We cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly."</p>

<p>Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said that US security officials had been "tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years."</p>

<p>The Iranian mission at the United Nations dismissed the report as "unsubstantiated and malicious," adding that Trump "is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law."</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump made his first public appearance at the Republican National Convention on Monday (local time) since surviving the assassination attempt on Saturday.</p>

<p>Wearing a white bandage on his right ear, Trump waved at supporters and received a standing ovation from the audience. He made no remarks during the convention and stood alongside his newly announced running mate, Senator JD Vance.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Indian Americans and former presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy will address the Republican National Convention here.</p>

<p>Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and former US Ambassador to the United Nations, was a presidential candidate in the Republican primary and was the last one to suspend her campaign.</p>

<p>Millionaire entrepreneur-turned-politician Ramaswamy has seen a meteoric rise in the Republican party. He is now considered as one of the close confidant of the former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.</p>

<p>This would be the first time that Ramaswamy would be speaking at the Republican National Convention, while Haley has addressed the RNC multiple times including in 2016, 2020.</p>

<p>Sources familiar with the RNC said that Ramaswamy is scheduled to speak first on Tuesday night in the 7:30-8:00 pm local time slot in the list of two other speakers. Haley has been placed third in the list of four speakers in the next slot of 8-8.30 pm local time.</p>

<p>The evening would conclude with remarks by Senator Marco Rubio and Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is expected to make another appearance Tuesday night before and is expected to stay in the last one hour of the RNC events.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

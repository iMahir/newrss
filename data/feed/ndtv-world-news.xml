       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro violated a law limiting political activity by federal employees when he publicly advocated voting for President Joe Biden and criticized former President Donald Trump, the Office of Special Counsel said on Thursday.</p>

<p>U.S. federal employees are subject to the Hatch Act, a law limiting some political activities to keep the government free from partisan influence. It prohibits using official authority to influence the results of an election.</p>

<p>During a speech in London in January 2024 while on official travel, Del Toro said he was "confident that the American people will step up to the plate come November and support President Biden for a second term as our Commander-in Chief."</p>

<p>The Office of Special Counsel, which is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency, said that during the event and in an interview with the BBC later that day, Del Toro also "expressed his electoral opposition to President Trump as a candidate."</p>

<p>"When speaking in his official capacity on a taxpayer-funded trip, Secretary Del Toro encouraged electoral support for one candidate over another in the upcoming presidential election," Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger said.</p>

<p>"By doing so, he crossed a legal line and violated the Hatch Act. This is especially troubling because Secretary Del Toro has himself acknowledged that military work and partisan politics should not be mixed," Dellinger added.</p>

<p>Del Toro self-reported his comments to the watchdog, saying that his intent was to discuss the importance of strong international alliances.</p>

<p>"In retrospect, I believe my response should have been delivered more broadly without reference to specific candidates," he told the office.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is meant to be apolitical, loyal to the U.S. Constitution and independent of any party or political movement. Del Toro was appointed Navy Secretary, a civilian-held post, by Biden.</p>

<p>Potential punishments include a fine or removal from office.</p>

<p>The Pentagon on Thursday said that it was reviewing the report, but generally it was important for the military to avoid any action that could imply support for any political party or campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned the US not to cross Russia's "red lines" on the Ukraine conflict, asserting that Washington is starting to lose its sense of mutual restraint with Moscow, state-owned TASS news agency reported.</p>

<p>In an interview on Wednesday, Lavrov said that Americans have "crossed their own red lines" on the supply of arms to Ukraine, the Russian news agency reported.</p>

<p>"They (the US) should understand that our red lines are nothing to fool with. And they know very well where they are," the report quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>Lavrov said the US is starting to lose its sense of mutual restraint with Russia, calling it "dangerous".</p>

<p>"(US National Security Council spokesman John) Kirby said that the issue of stepping up support for Ukraine should be approached carefully so as not to provoke World War III because it will be sad to see Europe gone," he said, adding that the US has a "deep-seated conviction that they are untouchable".</p>

<p>Lavrov said he hoped Washington would realise the potential consequences of supplying Ukraine with weapons.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that there are reasonable people with significant influence left there. And I hope that the interests of the US will be taken into account," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at a press conference on Wednesday, Kirby said the US welcomes any nation that is willing to try to help end the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Any nation that is willing to try to help end this war and do so in keeping with President Zelenskyy's prerogatives, the Ukrainian people's prerogatives, his plan for a just peace, we would certainly welcome a role like that," he said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin named India among the three countries he is constantly in touch with over the Ukraine conflict, asserting that they are sincerely making efforts to resolve it.</p>

<p>"We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India. I constantly keep in touch with our colleagues on this issue," Putin was quoted as saying in a separate report by TASS.</p>

<p>Putin's remarks came within two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic visit to Ukraine, where he held talks with President Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>On August 23, Modi visited Ukraine, where he conveyed to President Zelenskyy that Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the ongoing war and that India was ready to play an "active role" to restore peace in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said his main aim in Ukraine after 30 months of fighting was to capture the eastern Donbas area -- and claimed that Ukraine's Kursk counter-offensive had made that easier.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said his main aim in Ukraine after 30 months of fighting was to capture the eastern Donbas area -- and claimed that Ukraine's Kursk counter-offensive had made that easier.</p>

<p>Putin was speaking a day after Russia attacked Ukraine's western Lviv region with deadly strikes, and after recent advances by Moscow's forces in the Donbas.</p>

<p>Since the start of its offensive in February 2022 when it failed to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Russia has adapted its aims, concentrating instead on trying to conquer eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>While Ukraine's surprise push into Russia's Kursk region last month caught Russian forces off-guard, Putin stressed that the move had failed to slow Moscow's advance in occupied Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The aim of the enemy (in Kursk) was to force us to worry, hustle, divert troops and to stop our offensive in key areas, especially in the Donbas, the liberation of which is our main primary objective," Putin said at a forum in Vladivostok, in Russia's far east.</p>

<p>Russia claims as its own the eastern Donetsk region and three other Ukrainian regions.</p>

<p>Moscow has advanced strongly this summer and its troops are now around a dozen kilometres from the city of Pokrovsk -- a key logistics hub in east Ukraine from where thousands have now fled.</p>

<p>Putin said that by sending "quite well-prepared units" into Kursk, Ukraine had made Moscow's advance in Donbas quicker.</p>

<p>"The enemy weakened itself in key areas, our army has accelerated its offensive operations," he argued.</p>

<p><strong>'Holy duty'</strong></p>

<p>Putin also claimed that Moscow's army has begun to push out Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region, where Kyiv's troops have held on to towns and villages for almost a month.</p>

<p>"Our armed forces have stabilised the situation and started gradually squeezing (the enemy) out from our territory," Putin said.</p>

<p>It was not possible to verify those claims.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted on Thursday that Ukraine was "maintaining the defined lines" in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>Russia did not mount a large-scale response in the first days of the incursion, which became the largest on Russian soil since World War II.</p>

<p>Putin has since played down the significance of the Ukrainian attack but has hardened his rhetoric in recent days.</p>

<p>"It is the holy duty of the Russian army to do everything to throw out the enemy from this territory and to protect our citizens," he said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Zelensky told US TV channel NBC that Ukraine would hold on to the territory captured in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>Zelensky has previously said that one of Kyiv's "goals" in Kursk was to show Russians "what is more important to him (Putin): occupation of the territories of Ukraine or the protection of his population".</p>

<p>Kyiv has also said that it wants to force Moscow into "fair" negotiations.</p>

<p><strong>Aborted deal</strong></p>

<p>While Russian officials have rushed in recent weeks to say that the Kursk incursion makes any talks with Ukraine impossible, Putin appeared to roll back those statements.</p>

<p>Russia was ready to talk, he said -- but on the basis of an aborted deal reached in Istanbul in 2022, the details of which were never made public by either side.</p>

<p>But Putin has repeatedly said that Moscow can only negotiate with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders four of its regions -- Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p>

<p>"Are we ready to negotiate with them? We have never refused to do so," Putin said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"But not on the basis of some ephemeral demands, but on the basis of those documents that were agreed and actually initialled in Istanbul," he added.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has claimed Russia and Ukraine were on the verge of a deal in the spring of 2022, shortly after Moscow launched its offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>On Thursday, both sides reported fresh casualties near the frontlines.</p>

<p>In Ukraine's Donetsk region, a 74-year-old man died when a Russian shell hit his home in the town of Kostyantynivka, the regional prosecutor's office said, posting a photo of a destroyed building.</p>

<p>Ukrainian shelling killed a man in Russia's Belgorod border region, the region's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An already beleaguered Justin Trudeau has been left in a politically precarious place as key ally Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party (NDP) withdrew support for his minority Liberal government ahead of the general election next year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An already beleaguered Justin Trudeau has been left in a politically precarious place as key ally Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party (NDP) withdrew support for his minority Liberal government ahead of the general election next year.</p>

<p>The NDP leader made the announcement in a video message on social media, saying the Liberals "have let people down" and that they "don't deserve another chance from Canadians".</p>

<p>Though it is unlikely that the Trudeau government would fall, the prime minister would have to seek support from other opposition lawmakers in the House of Commons chamber.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Canadian leader of opposition Pierre Poilievre held a press conference where he dared Jagmeet Singh, who he refers to as 'sell out Singh', to call for elections immediately.</p>

<p>Early elections could suit the Conservatives, who have a good chance at winning amid the anti-incumbency against Mr Trudeau's government over a housing crisis and inflation.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty regarding whether the NDP would push for a no-confidence motion against Mr Trudeau in parliament.</p>

<p>The Trudeau government is safe for now as the power lies with the 32 members of parliament from Bloc Quebecois, a regional political party in Canada. The MPs seemingly are not against Justin Trudeau and his government for the time being. Mr Trudeau, however, would find it difficult to pass any new bills or legislation as his government's numbers are vastly diminished in Parliament. His Liberal party currently has 154 seats in the lower house out of the total 338 seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While believing the Liberals were unable to implement several welfare schemes, the NDP was able to push for laws such as pharmacare, dental health care and a $10-a-day child care scheme, all while supporting the ruling government.</p>

<p>Mr Singh and Mr Trudeau had come together in 2022 to boost the Liberal party's minority government. The agreement was supposed to continue till October next year but an NDP spokesperson said the plan to end the deal was in the works for the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Reacting to Mr Singh's announcement, Mr Trudeau said his government will continue to focus on tackling the affordability crisis in the country.</p>

<p>"These are the things that we're focused on. I'll let others focus on politics. I really hope the NDP stays focused on how we can deliver for Canadians, as we have over the past years, rather than focusing on politics," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The study is the first to provide global estimates of inadequate micronutrient intake across 185 countries. Researchers found widespread deficiencies, with iodine, vitamin E, calcium, and iron being particularly low in diets worldwide.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A well-rounded diet is critical for the body's overall growth, strengthening immunity, and supplying the nutrients required for optimum health; yet, many people do not obtain enough important vitamins and minerals from their food and beverages. More than half of the global population consumes inadequate levels of several micronutrients essential to health, including calcium, iron, and vitamins C and E, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the first study to provide global estimates of inadequate consumption of 15 micronutrients critical to human health. The study was published in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00276-6/fulltext"><em> The Lancet Global Health</em></a> on August 29.</p>

<p>"Our study is a big step forward," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/billions-worldwide-consume-inadequate-levels-of-micronutrients-critical-to-human-health/">said co-lead author Chris Free,</a> research professor at UCSB. "Not only because it is the first to estimate inadequate micronutrient intakes for 34 age-sex groups in nearly every country, but also because it makes these methods and results easily accessible to researchers and practitioners."</p>

<p>The researchers used data from the Global Dietary Database, the World Bank, and dietary recall surveys in 31 countries to compare nutritional requirements with nutritional intake among the populations of 185 countries. (They have made these data, as well as code for analysis, freely available.) They divided populations into males and females belonging to17 age groups: zero to 80 in five-year spans, as well as an 80+ group. The assessment studied fifteen vitamins and minerals: calcium, iodine, iron, riboflavin, folate, zinc, magnesium, selenium, thiamin, niacin, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and E.</p>

<p>The study found significant intake inadequacies for nearly all of the evaluated micronutrients, excluding fortification as a potential source of additional nutrients. Inadequate intake was especially prevalent for iodine (68% of the global population), vitamin E (67%), calcium (66%), and iron (65%). More than half of people consumed inadequate levels of riboflavin, folate, and vitamins C and B6. Intake of niacin was closest to sufficient, with 22% of the global population consuming inadequate levels, followed by thiamin (30%) and selenium (37%).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Speaking at the Handelsblatt banking summit, Sewing highlighted the disparity between Germanys work hours and those of other European countries, urging a change in work attitudes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once a cornerstone of stability in Europe, Germany has recently seen a slump. Geopolitical concerns, supply chain interruptions, and growing energy costs are some of the factors causing this economic burden. Key sectors that have historically supported Germany's economic strength, such as manufacturing and exports, have been under pressure as a result of these difficulties. Christian Sewing, the CEO of Deutsche Bank, has now proposed a fix for the sluggish German economy. He has urged Germans to work harder to help restore the country's economy.</p>

<p>"Investors are already doubting our ability to reform, but especially our ability and our will to perform," Sewing said at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/banken/bankengipfel-deutsche-bank-chef-sieht-standort-deutschland-in-gefahr/100063209.html">Handelsblatt banking summit in Frankfurt.</a></p>

<p>"More growth in Germany will come only if we also change our attitude to work; if we are prepared to work differently, but overall to work more and harder."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/05/deutsche-bank-ceo-germany-work-harder/"><em>The Fortune Magazine,</em></a> Sewing is right to point out the disparity in EU and German working hours. Official data from 2023 suggest that the bloc's average weekly work time is 36.1 hours, while Germany's is only 34 hours.</p>

<p>Other European countries exceed the regional average, such as Greece, where the work week lasts 39.8 hours. Workers at Germany's industrial competitor, the US, labour for 36.4 hours on average-closer to the EU average.</p>

<p>Sewing has led the German banking giant since 2018 and has urged policy-level changes in the past to prevent the country from becoming called "the sick man of Europe." Now, he says investors are beginning to question the country's ability to fight back.</p>

<p>"Investors have been telling us for more than a year that they doubt Germany's and Europe's ability to perform, and even worse, the will to perform," Sewing said. "We simply have to tell our fellow citizens that we have to do more again."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States said Thursday it had secured the release of 135 political prisoners from Nicaragua, the latest mass transfer by President Daniel Ortega's increasingly authoritarian government.</p>

<p>The White House said that the prisoners included members of faith organizations, students and others viewed by Ortega and his team as a "threat to their authoritarian rule."</p>

<p>The freed prisoners arrived Thursday in nearby Guatemala, whose reformist President Bernardo Arevalo has worked closely with Washington on the key issue of migration, the State Department said.</p>

<p>They will have the opportunity to seek to move to the United States.</p>

<p>"We urge the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Nicaragua," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The Nicaraguan people want and deserve a restored democracy where all can exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms, free from fear of persecution or reprisal."</p>

<p>The latest move follows the mass release of more than 200 prisoners in February 2023 who were flown to the United States.</p>

<p>The former prisoners have largely welcomed being able to leave, although some human rights activists view Ortega's move cynically, seeing him as trying to get rid of perceived opponents while at least attempting to curry favor with Washington.</p>

<p>The latest release includes 13 members of Mountain Gateway, an evangelical Christian group based in Texas, the White House said.</p>

<p>Nicaraguan authorities earlier this year accused members of the group, which conducts mass gospel campaigns as well as humanitarian work, of money laundering and organized crime.</p>

<p>Mountain Gateway strongly denied the charges, saying that Nicaraguan authorities were able to review its budgeting.</p>

<p>Ortega, a 78-year-old former leftist guerrilla who battled US-backed forces in the 1980s, returned to power in 2007 and initially had been seen as more moderate.</p>

<p>But he has since lifted presidential term limits, seized control of all branches of government and led a sweeping crackdown on groups including the Catholic Church and NGOs seen as threats to his rule.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and Singapore on Thursday elevated their ties to a "comprehensive strategic partnership" and inked four MoUs, including one on cooperation in the semiconductor industry, as the prosperous city-state's companies pledged to invest about USD 60 billion in the next few years.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived here from Brunei on a two-day visit, touted Singapore as a model for developing nations and said India wanted to create "several Singapores" of its own during his talks with Premier Lawrence Wong.</p>

<p>"Prime Ministers @narendramodi and @LawrenceWongST held productive talks today. They deliberated on ways to further deepen India-Singapore partnership across key sectors including technology, healthcare, trade, skilling, and more," the prime minister's office said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Later, PM Modi held a roundtable with top business leaders and CEOs in Singapore, where he talked about ways to deepen economic linkages. Highlighting the reforms underway in India, which will encourage investment and innovation, PM Modi invited Singaporean business leaders to look at investment opportunities in India in sectors like aviation, energy, and skill development.</p>

<p>At the roundtable with business leaders, Singapore companies committed an investment of around USD 60 billion (over Rs 5 lakh crore) in the next few years, officials said.</p>

<p>"Collaborative initiatives have been identified in areas such as skilling, digitalisation, mobility, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors and AI, healthcare, sustainability and cybersecurity," PM Modi said during his meeting with Lawrence Wong.</p>

<p>Describing Singapore as an "important facilitator" of India's Act East policy, PM Modi said, "Our strategic partnership is completing a decade. Over the past 10 years, our trade has more than doubled. Mutual investment has increased almost threefold to cross USD 150 billion. Singapore was the first country with which we launched the UPI Person-to-Person payment facility." Noting that in the past ten years, 17 satellites of Singapore have been launched from Indian soil, PM Modi said bilateral cooperation has gained momentum from skilling to the defence sector.</p>

<p>"I am pleased that today, we are together elevating our relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership," he said.</p>

<p>Both leaders witnessed the exchange of MoUs for cooperation in semiconductors, digital technologies, skill development and healthcare. These are the outcomes of the deliberations during the two rounds of India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtables held so far.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi also announced the setting up of an Invest India office in Singapore, which will be a handholding office for investors in Singapore in various areas identified in the six pillars.</p>

<p>At their talks, both leaders reviewed existing cooperation in the fields of defence and security, maritime domain awareness, education, AI, Fintech, new technology domains, science and technology and knowledge partnership, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>The leaders also exchanged views on important regional and global issues of mutual interest, including India-ASEAN relations and India's vision for the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the two countries committed to work together to promote peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region, which would help promote free trade and open markets.</p>

<p>The two leaders "reaffirmed the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, security, stability, safety and freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea," the joint statement said, in a veiled reference to China, which claims most of the South China Sea, while the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, and Taiwan have counterclaims.</p>

<p>PM Modi also said India's first Thiruvalluvar Cultural Centre would soon be inaugurated in Singapore. "The great saint Thiruvalluvar provided guiding thoughts to the world in the most ancient language Tamil. His work, the Thirukkural, was composed nearly 2,000 years ago, yet its ideas remain relevant today," he added.</p>

<p>The two leaders discussed the outcome of the 2nd India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable held in Singapore in August 2024. Their discussion also covered the celebration of the 60th anniversary of bilateral ties in 2025.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister invited Lawrence Wong to visit India, which he accepted.</p>

<p>PM Modi thanked Lawrence Wong for the warm welcome. "This is our first meeting after you assumed the post of premier. Many congratulations to you from my side. I am confident that under the leadership of 4G (the fourth-generation leaders), Singapore will progress even faster," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>"The discussions with my friend, PM Lawrence Wong continued today. Our talks focused on boosting cooperation in areas like skilling, technology, healthcare, AI and more. We both agreed on the need to boost trade relations," PM Modi later said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Lawrence Wong said Singapore and India share a deep and enduring friendship, built on strong economic and people-to-people ties.</p>

<p>"Had a productive meeting with Indian Prime Minister @narendramodi at Parliament House. We've set out a forward-looking agenda for the next phase of our bilateral relations," he posted on X.</p>

<p>"This includes closer cooperation in areas like sustainability, advanced manufacturing, digital technologies and connectivity. We're also upgrading the Singapore-India Strategic Partnership to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership," he said.</p>

<p>"This is timely as we expand our partnership in new, mutually beneficial areas. We also celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations and our Strategic Partnership's 10th anniversary next year," Lawrence Wong said.</p>

<p>Singapore looks forward to strengthening bilateral ties and creating new opportunities for the people of the two nations, he said.</p>

<p>Ahead of the talks with Lawrence Wong, PM Modi received a ceremonial welcome at the Parliament House.</p>

<p>The meeting between the two leaders comes months after Lawrence Wong took over as premier and PM Modi began his third term as prime minister.</p>

<p>PM Modi and Lawrence Wong also visited a leading Singaporean company in the semiconductor and electronics sector and discussed ways for collaboration in this critical industry. This is his fifth visit as prime minister, all prior visits were made in his first term as prime minister.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's aviation safety agency said Thursday it will require inspection of at least a part of the fleet of Airbus A350 wide-body jets in operation after an engine fire on a Cathay Pacific flight.</p>

<p>Rolls-Royce, which makes the engines on Cathay's A350s, said it too would carry out its own inspections and was "working very closely" with the EU agency.</p>

<p>Hong Kong-based Cathay, one of the largest operators of the long-haul A350 jetliner, grounded 48 planes for checks on Monday after a Zurich-bound flight had to return to the city shortly after take-off.</p>

<p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said Thursday that the Cathay aircraft suffered an engine failure due to a high pressure fuel hose failing.</p>

<p>"An A350-1041 aircraft operated by Cathay Pacific on flight CX383 from Hong Kong to Zurich experienced an in-flight engine fire shortly after take-off," EASA said, adding the fire was "promptly detected and extinguished."</p>

<p>The agency said the incident was the subject of a safety investigation led by the Air Accident Investigation Authority of Hong Kong (AAIA).</p>

<p>EASA added it is taking "precautionary measures to prevent any further similar occurrence."</p>

<p>That will take the form of "a one-time fleet inspection, which may be applicable only to a portion of the A350 fleet."</p>

<p>EASA said the inspections would seek to "identify and remove from service any potentially compromised high pressure fuel hoses".</p>

<p>It added the compliance time frame was still being determined and would be detailed later Thursday in an EASA Emergency Airworthiness Directive.</p>

<p><strong>Only A350-1000s likely concerned</strong></p>

<p>It said the directive would only apply to European airlines that fly the aircraft, with regulators in other countries fre to decide whether or not to enforce it.</p>

<p>The incident prompted other airlines in the region to carry out similar checks on their A350-900 and A350-1000 models, which are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 and XWB-97 engines, respectively.</p>

<p>Rolls-Royce said Thursday it was launching "a one-time precautionary engine inspection programme" which may apply "to a portion of the A350 fleet".</p>

<p>A source told AFP that Airbus and Rolls-Royce have told airlines that only A350-1000s powered by XWB-97 engines are concerned by the problem.</p>

<p>Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The first A350 was delivered to Qatar Airways at the end of 2014. Since the end of the production of the jumbo A380, the A350 is Airbus's largest aircraft. The largest version, the 1000, can carry nearly 500 passengers.</p>

<p>The A350-1000 can travel more than 16,000 kilometers (nearly 10,000 miles) in one hop. That will be pushed to nearly 18,000 km in the "Sunrise" version ordered by Australian airline Qantas to fly directly between Sydney and London.</p>

<p>A competitor to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, more than 1,300 A350s have been ordered. Airbus figures from the end of July show 613 have been delivered to airlines.</p>

<p>Only 86 of the 613 aircraft are the 1000 version, according to Airbus. Qatar Airways is the biggest operator of the version, with 24 in its fleet, followed by Cathay Pacific and British Airways, which both operate 18.</p>

<p>Cathay, which cancelled 90 flights after the Monday incident, said Wednesday it expects to resume full operations on Saturday after having already fixed six of the 15 airplanes it found needed to have fuel lines replaced.</p>

<p>Emirates airlines CEO Tim Clark expressed concern last year about the durability of the Trent XWB-97 engines, prompting Rolls-Royce to indicate it would work to boost their performance.</p>

<p>Shares in Airbus shed 1.2 percent in late afternoon trading while the Paris CAC 40 index was 0.6 percent lower. Rolls-Royce shares fell 1.4 percent while London's FTSE 100 index was off 0.1 percent.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Royal Navy said on Thursday one person had been killed following an incident in which a helicopter was forced to ditch into the Channel during a training exercise.</p>

<p>"It is with great sadness that we must report a member of the Royal Navy has died following a training incident last night," the Navy said in a statement on X.</p>

<p>"A full investigation will take place. The incident involved a Merlin Mk4 helicopter in the English Channel near Dorset that ditched while conducting night flying exercises with HMS Queen Elizabeth. There were no other fatalities or serious injuries."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was deeply saddened by the death and paid tribute to those involved in the search operation.</p>

<p>"My thoughts are with the family and loved ones during this painful time," he posted on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The oil-rich United Arab Emirates on Thursday announced the completion of the Arab world's first nuclear power plant, calling it a "significant step".</p>

<p>Abu Dhabi's Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant will produce 40 terawatt-hours of electricity annually after its fourth and final reactor has entered commercial operation, the state-owned Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) said in a statement.</p>

<p>It will generate 25 percent of the electricity needs of the hot, desert Gulf state, where air-conditioning is ubiquitous -- nearly the equivalent of New Zealand's annual consumption, ENEC said.</p>

<p>The station will power companies including the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), one of the world's biggest oil producers, Emirates Steel and Emirates Global Aluminium, ENEC said.</p>

<p>Barakah, which means "blessing" in Arabic, started operations in 2020 when the first of its four reactors went into service.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has also said it plans to build nuclear reactors.</p>

<p>Emirati President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan hailed Barakah's completion as a "significant step on the journey towards net zero".</p>

<p>"We will continue to prioritise energy security and sustainability for the benefit of our nation and our people today and tomorrow," he said in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the plant "will have to be disassembled at the end of its useful life, in around 60-80 years".</p>

<p>The UAE, which is made up of seven emirates, including the capital Abu Dhabi and economic hub Dubai, is one of the largest oil producers in the OPEC cartel.</p>

<p>The country was largely built on oil but is spending billions to develop enough renewable energy to cover half of its needs by 2050.</p>

<p>Last year, it hosted the COP28 UN climate talks which resulted in an agreement to "transition away" from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The UAE lies across the Gulf from Iran which has a Russian-built nuclear power plant outside the coastal city of Bushehr, as well as a controversial uranium enrichment programme.</p>

<p>The UAE has repeatedly said its nuclear ambitions are for "peaceful purposes" and ruled out developing any enrichment programme or nuclear reprocessing technologies.</p>

<p>The country uses gas-powered stations for much of its electricity needs, but also has one of the world's biggest solar plants outside Abu Dhabi.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his support for US Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential elections in November.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok today, Mr Putin said that he admired the Democratic Party candidate's "infectious laugh", Russian state media Russia Today (RT) reported.</p>

<p>The Russian leader had earlier backed US President Joe Biden, who he said is "a more experienced, predictable person, a politician of the old school". He added that he respected President Biden's decision to endorse her as his successor.</p>

<p>During a plenary session of the forum, Mr Putin said Kamala Harris "laughs so infectiously" that it suggests "everything is going well for her". He said this in response to a query about whether he had a favourite candidate in the election now that Mr Biden had dropped out.</p>

<p>"In the end, the choice is up to the American people and we will treat their eventual decision with respect," he said.</p>

<p>He also said that Ms Harris' positive disposition could mean she might refrain from imposing sanctions on Russia. According to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rt.com/russia/603553-putin-endorses-kamala-harris/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">RT report</a>, Mr Putin went on to say that former US President Donald Trump introduced more restrictions on Moscow than any other President in American history.</p>

<p>In repsonse to Mr Putin's remark, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby urged the leader to "stop interfering" in US elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The only people who should get to determine who the next president of United States is are the American people, and we would greatly appreciate it if Mr. Putin would, a) stop talking about our election, and b) stop interfering in it," he said.</p>

<p>This comes amid reports of the US planning to accuse Russia of a campaign to influence the 2024 elections. A CNN report that cited six sources familiar with the matter, said Russia would target American voters with disinformation using online platforms.</p>

<p>Russian lawmaker Maria Butina spoke to Reuters and branded the report as "pure rubbish" and a "witch hunt". Notably, Ms Butina spent 15 months in a US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent before becoming a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Severe flooding and violent windstorms have affected 562,000 people across Yemen in recent weeks, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Thursday, appealing for $13.3 million in donations amid a funding shortfall.</p>

<p>The "unprecedented weather events" have compounded suffering in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country, which is already grappling with one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, said the IOM.</p>

<p>"The scale of the destruction is staggering, and we urgently need additional funding to ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind," said Matt Huber, the IOM's acting Yemen mission chief.</p>

<p>Since late July, torrential rains and flooding have destroyed homes, displaced thousands of families and severely damaged critical infrastructure, including health centres, schools and roads, according to the UN agency.</p>

<p>Late last month, torrential rains caused flash floods in Yemen's Mahawit governorate, leaving around 40 people either missing or dead, according to the UN's humanitarian agency OCHA.</p>

<p>Dozens of houses were damaged or destroyed, forcing 215 families into displacement, it said.</p>

<p>Another 60 people were killed and hundreds more were injured in earlier flash floods across Yemen since late July, according to UN figures.</p>

<p>"These rains have not only led to tragic loss of life but have also wiped out entire communities' belongings and means of survival," the IOM said.</p>

<p>"Immediate funding is necessary to address the most pressing needs on the ground," the IOM said, warning that severe weather conditions are expected to continue in the coming weeks.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump pleaded not guilty on Thursday to criminal charges in a revised federal indictment accusing the former U.S. president of attempting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers entered the plea on his behalf at the start of a court hearing in Washington focused on how the case should proceed after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election, is not attending the hearing.</p>

<p>The new indictment, brought in August, included the same four charges as the one obtained last year by Special Counsel Jack Smith, but dropped allegations the Supreme Court found could not remain part of the case.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is expected to consider dueling proposals from Smith, who is seeking to press the case forward, and Trump, who is pushing to delay action until after the election. The Supreme Court directed Chutkan to decide whether any other portions of the case must be tossed out.</p>

<p>Trump faces four criminal charges that accuse him of using false claims of voter fraud to undermine the election results and thwart certification of his defeat to Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The case had been delayed for months while Trump pursued his immunity claim and is virtually certain not to go to trial before Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.</p>

<p>Trump has argued that the prosecution as well as other legal cases against him are politically motivated attempts to undermine his presidential campaign.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision in July that former presidents are presumed to be immune from criminal prosecution for actions taken as part of their official responsibilities as president.</p>

<p>Smith has argued that all the remaining allegations are not covered by the immunity ruling and can proceed to trial.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have said that they are prepared to file court papers laying out their argument "at any time the court deems appropriate."</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers, meanwhile, have suggested that Chutkan should not begin weighing the impact of the immunity ruling until December, after the election.</p>

<p>If Trump wins the election, he is expected to direct the Justice Department to drop the charges.</p>

<p>Trump has proposed that his lawyers first move to dismiss the case based on an argument that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel under the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>Trump used the same argument to convince a federal judge in Florida who was appointed by Trump to throw out a second criminal case, also brought by Smith, accusing him of illegally holding onto classified documents after leaving office. Smith's office is appealing that decision.</p>

<p>The federal appeals court in Washington has previously upheld the authority of special counsels to handle certain sensitive investigations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Republic of Congo received its first batch of mpox vaccines on Thursday, which health authorities hope will help curb an outbreak that has prompted the U.N. to declare a global public health emergency.</p>

<p>Congo is the epicentre of the outbreak, which has spread to neighbouring countries and elsewhere, but a lack of vaccines in Africa has hampered efforts to stop the spread of the sometimes deadly disease.</p>

<p>A plane carrying doses manufactured by Bavarian Nordic and donated by the European Union touched down in the capital Kinshasa around 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT), Reuters reporters at the airport said.</p>

<p>Congo's health minister, Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba, told reporters the newly arrived vaccine had already proved its worth in the United States and would be rolled out to adults in Congo.</p>

<p>"We know which provinces are heavily affected, notably Equateur and South Kivu... The idea is to contain the virus as quickly as possible," he added.</p>

<p>This first delivery amounts to 99,000 doses and a further delivery on Saturday will take the total to 200,000 doses, said Laurent Muschel, the head of the EU Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).</p>

<p>Overall, Europe aims to deliver 566,000 doses to wherever needs are greatest in the region, Muschel told Reuters. "Based on the number of cases, the next country (for deliveries) should be Burundi, but the country's medical agency must authorise it."</p>

<p>The arrival of the vaccine in Congo should start to address a huge inequity that has left African countries with no access to the two shots used in a 2022 global mpox outbreak, while they were widely available in Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>Congo has said it will launch its vaccination campaign on Oct. 8 to allow time for a thorough awareness-raising campaign to overcome mistrust in some communities.</p>

<p>Mpox typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions, and can kill. There were 19,710 suspected cases of mpox reported in Congo in the first eight months of this year, according to the health ministry. Of those, 5,041 were confirmed and 655 were fatal.</p>

<p>It spreads through close contact, including sexual contact.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French woman whose husband has admitted to enlisting dozens of strangers to rape her while she was drugged told his trial on Thursday that police had saved her by uncovering the crimes.</p>

<p>"The police saved my life by investigating Mister P.'s computer," Gisele P. told the court in the southern city of Avignon, referring to her husband -- one of 51 of her alleged abusers on trial -- by only his last name.</p>

<p>Gisele P., now 71, revealed her emotion in almost 90 minutes of testimony, recounting the moment in November 2020 when investigators first showed her the images of a decade of sexual abuse orchestrated and filmed by her husband, Dominique P.</p>

<p>"My world is falling apart. For me, everything is falling apart. Everything I have built up over 50 years," Gisele P. said, pausing at times only to sip from a glass of water.</p>

<p>She had told police her husband was a "super guy" when she was first invited to speak with them, she recounted as her daughter and two sons watched the testimony.</p>

<p>At that meeting, Gisele P. was shown "barbaric" pictures where "I'm lying motionless on the bed, being raped", she remembered as her husband listened with his head bowed.</p>

<p>"They treat me like a rag doll," she told a panel of five judges, adding that she had only plucked up the courage to watch the video footage in May 2024.</p>

<p>Lawyers for some of the defendants had questioned on Wednesday whether the couple had had a libertine relationship, or whether it was credible that Gisele P. had noticed nothing for the entire decade of the abuse.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about sex scenes. These are rape scenes," she said on Thursday, emphasising that she had never practised swinging or any other form of libertine sex.</p>

<p><strong>'NEVER COMPLICIT'</strong></p>

<p>She reiterated that she was "never complicit" and had never "pretended to be asleep" when asked by lead judge Roger Arata.</p>

<p>Gisele P. has insisted that the trial take place in public so the full facts of the case can emerge.</p>

<p>"I'm speaking for every woman who's been drugged without knowing it, in the name of every woman who may never know... so that no woman has to suffer" the same thing in future, she said.</p>

<p>Gisele P. is in the process of divorcing her husband, who admitted on Tuesday to drugging her with sleeping pills and then recruiting dozens of strangers to rape her.</p>

<p>He was exposed by chance when he was caught filming up women's skirts in a local supermarket.</p>

<p>The husband "will again explain the reasons why he did this. He will explain himself and justify himself, if there can be a justification for this, because it's unpardonable," his lawyer Beatrice Zavarro told AFPTV.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old father of three documented his actions with meticulous precision on a hard drive with a folder labelled "abuse", lead investigator Jeremie Bosse Platiere told the court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>That enabled French police to track down more than 50 men suspected of raping Gisele P. while she was drugged.</p>

<p>A third of them were identified using facial recognition software, Bosse Platiere said.</p>

<p>He said he had hand-picked investigators "who had the stomach" to face the videos and images of abuse.</p>

<p>Police drew up a list of 72 individuals suspected of abusing Gisele P.</p>

<p>The investigators counted around 200 instances of rape, most of them by Dominique P., and over 90 by strangers enlisted through an adult website.</p>

<p><strong>'I FEEL DISGUSTED'</strong></p>

<p>Gisele P. said she had recognised only one of her alleged rapists, a man who had come to discuss cycling with her husband at their home.</p>

<p>"I saw him now and then in the bakery, I would say hello, I never thought he'd come and raped me," she said.</p>

<p>"I feel disgusted," she added, telling the accused to "for once in your lives at least, take responsibility for your actions".</p>

<p>The men received "strict instructions, there was clear and transparent information" about what was happening, the husband's lawyer Zavarro said.</p>

<p>"If these man came (to the couple's home), they were coming in the knowledge of what they were doing. That is what Mr P. will say."</p>

<p>The assaults took place between July 2011 and October 2020, mainly in the couple's home in Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in the southern region of Provence.</p>

<p>Most of the suspects face up to 20 years in jail for aggravated rape if convicted.</p>

<p>Eighteen of the 51 accused are in custody, including Dominique P. Thirty-two other defendants are attending the trial as free men.</p>

<p>The last suspect, still at large, will be tried in absentia, with hearings expected to last four months until December 20.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[To combat dead butt syndrome, experts recommend incorporating regular physical activity, stretching, and strengthening exercises targeting the gluteal muscles.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new medical ailment that is becoming more prevalent is concerning medical specialists and drawing attention to the risks associated with a more sedentary lifestyle. Gluteus medius tendinosis, commonly known as "dead butt syndrome," is a disorder marked by a weak or inactive gluteus medius muscle. It is frequently brought on by extended sitting, driving, or excessive screen time.</p>

<p>Experts caution that this health condition may result in a variety of issues, such as injuries to the knee, hip pain, and lower back pain. Dead butt syndrome is becoming increasingly common as more individuals spend their days slumped over computers or in front of screens.</p>

<p>"The name sounds silly, but the side effects are serious," said Jane Konidis, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnisota told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/well/move/dead-butt-syndrome-gluteal-amnesia.html"><em>The New York Times. </em></a>"The gluteus maximus is one of the strongest muscles in the body and biggest shock absorbers," she said. "If it's not working properly, it can cause a domino chain of issues, from hamstring tears and sciatica to shin splints and arthritis in the knees."</p>

<p>Gluteal amnesia happens when the muscles in your rear become so weak from inactivity they seem to forget how to function, meaning they fail or become slow to activate. This is different than a leg or arm "falling asleep" because of a compressed nerve; you won't feel pins and needles. Some people may feel a dull ache while sitting, but most people don't feel any pain until they go for a jog or hike, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/well/move/dead-butt-syndrome-gluteal-amnesia.html"><em>The NYT.</em></a></p>

<p>Sluggish glutes can result in other muscles and joints, especially in the lower back and knees, picking up the slack, Dr Konidis said.</p>

<p>To combat this issue, healthcare providers recommend incorporating regular physical activity, stretching, and strengthening exercises that target the gluteal muscles. By prioritising overall health and well-being, individuals can help prevent dead butt syndrome and its associated complications.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Baby elephant twins born last week on a timber camp in Myanmar are thriving after a wobbly first few days in the world, officials told AFP on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pearl Sint was born a few minutes before her brother Kyaw Pearl last week at the 60-acre Wingabaw elephant camp in the Bago region operated by state-run Myanmar Timber Enterprise.</p>

<p>At about two feet and six inches tall, the pint-sized twins were around four inches shorter than the average calf, said Myo Min Aung, the camp's assistant manager.</p>

<p>This meant they were not tall enough to reach their mother's teat and feed.</p>

<p>"We helped them by putting small wooden blocks under their front legs and bringing their heads up to their mother's breast," he said.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>On the third day, they were able to feed themselves and quickly showed their personalities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The little male likes to wander around and play with humans rather than stay with his mother," said Myo Min Aung.</p>

<p>"He is not feeding as much as the female little one does."</p>

<p>Another official at the camp, who did not want to give his name, said he hoped the twins would not take after their father, a bull elephant named Aye Htike.</p>

<p>"He was badly behaved. He used to attack the other elephants and people," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pearl Sandar, the twins' mother, "has a kind heart", the official said.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>"She doesn't attack others... we are training the twins to be well-behaved, not like their father."</p>

<p>The arrival of the twins takes the population of the elephant camp up to nine, the official said.</p>

<p>Previously around 3,000 elephants were used for labour at state timber enterprises in Myanmar, the majority dragging freshly cut trees through the dense jungle to transport hubs and mills.</p>

<p>But now those at the Wingabaw camp, like many others, carry humans instead of logs and earn their keep as a tourist attraction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fewer than 50,000 Asian elephants remain in the wild, and fewer than 2,000 of them are found in Myanmar, according 2018 figures from environmental group WWF.</p>

<p>"This is my first time personally experiencing an elephant twin birth," said Myo Min Aung.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am happy to take care of the little twin elephants, but it is also a big responsibility."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 people were injured after a passenger train derailed in Russia's Far North on Wednesday, authorities said.</p>

<p>The train was going from the city of Vorkuta, above the Arctic Circle, to the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea in the south of the country.</p>

<p>It derailed near the small town of Inta in the Komi Republic, which has a harsh climate and is scarcely populated.</p>

<p>Vladimir Uyba, the head of the Komi republic, said there 215 passengers onboard the train, adding: "20 people were injured, three in a serious condition."</p>

<p>He said the five last carriages of the train derailed, but authorities did not immediately give a reason for the cause of the accident.</p>

<p>Uyba said he was flying out to the scene of the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Images published by Russian state media showed several carriages lying on their side in a ditch by a forest.</p>

<p>It takes almost five days for the Vorkuta-Novorossiysk train to complete its journey.</p>

<p>Transport accidents are not uncommon in Russia, but less so on railways, with the country, the largest in the world, having a massive rail network.</p>

<p>Since Moscow launched its Ukraine offensive, Russia has battled a wave of sabotage acts on its railways, used by the army to transport equipment to Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A notorious German pensioner known as the "Nazi grandma" who has been jailed several times for denying the Holocaust was sentenced to another 16 months at her latest trial on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A Hamburg court convicted Ursula Haverbeck, 95, of denying the Nazi genocide on several occasions, including in 2015 during the trial of a former Nazi camp guard.</p>

<p>In their sentencing, the judges took into account her previous convictions and the fact she had "also used the proceedings to further disseminate her views", a court spokeswoman told AFP.</p>

<p>Haverbeck repeated her remarks on the Holocaust several times at the trial.</p>

<p>Supporters of the pensioner showed up on Wednesday and repeatedly interrupted proceedings with heckling, the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>Haverbeck was once head of a far-right training centre shut down in 2008 for spreading Nazi propaganda.</p>

<p>She has previously been sentenced on several occasions to jail for denying the Nazi genocide, once declaring on television that "the Holocaust is the biggest and most sustained lie in history."</p>

<p>Haverbeck was sentenced this time after losing an appeal over a conviction for comments allegedly made in 2015 during the trial of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening, who was convicted of being an accessory to murder.</p>

<p>Haverbeck said the Auschwitz concentration camp was just a labour camp and no mass murder had taken place there, according to prosecutors.</p>

<p>The proceedings were delayed several times due to the coronavirus pandemic and illness.</p>

<p>The sentencing also takes into account a previous conviction by a Berlin court in 2022 over statements made by Haverbeck in another interview and at an event.</p>

<p>It was not clear whether she would actually go to jail.</p>

<p>German law makes it illegal to deny the genocide committed by Adolf Hitler's regime, which in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in occupied Poland alone claimed some 1.1 million lives, mostly European Jews.</p>

<p>Holocaust denial and other forms of incitement to hatred carry up to five years in prison, while the use of Nazi symbols such as swastikas is also banned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III's sister Princess Anne is "recovering slowly" in hospital, her husband said Wednesday, after she suffered a concussion in an incident with a horse at her country estate.</p>

<p>"She'll be out when she's ready," Tim Laurence also told reporters outside Southmead Hospital in Bristol, western England, where Anne was taken on Sunday.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, suffered concussion and minor head injuries at Gatcombe Park on Sunday evening and was airlifted to hospital.</p>

<p>It is believed she was struck by a horse as she was walking within the protected perimeter of the sprawling estate, which hosts equestrian events.</p>

<p>The princess's medical team said her injuries are consistent with a potential impact from a horse's head or legs.</p>

<p>British media reported Wednesday that Anne's concussion meant the precise details of what happened are not clear.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, as she is also known, is a skilled horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and has a reputation as the hardest-working royal.</p>

<p>She has stepped in to represent King Charles while he postponed public engagements during his cancer treatment, and rode at his official birthday parade this month.</p>

<p>But the accident forced her to withdraw from an appearance at a state banquet on Tuesday evening for visiting Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and cancel an upcoming trip to Canada.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace said Anne was in hospital "as a precautionary measure for observation and is expected to make a full and swift recovery".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US State Department on Wednesday renewed its allegation that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange put people at risk for revealing secrets, after he was freed in a plea deal.</p>

<p>"The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department -- that included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world -- whose positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>"It also chilled the ability of American personnel to build relationships and have frank conversations," Miller said.</p>

<p>Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.</p>

<p>The Australian agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defense information and was sentenced to the time he had served in London -- five years and two months -- and given his liberty.</p>

<p>Assange has become a hero for activists who point to his role in divulging information about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but critics fault him for putting out vast quantities of government documents without any filtering.</p>

<p>Miller said that the State Department at the time "had to scramble to get people out of danger, to move them out of harm's way."</p>

<p>Pressed on whether anyone was harmed in the end, Miller said, "If you drive drunk down the street and get pulled over for drunk driving, the fact that you didn't crash into another car and kill someone doesn't get you out of the reckless actions and the endangerment that you put your fellow citizens in."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon.com plans to launch a section on its shopping site featuring cheap items that ship directly to overseas consumers from warehouses in China, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing slides shown to Chinese sellers.</p>

<p>The new marketplace, Amazon's most aggressive response to the growth of bargain sites like Temu and Shein, will offer unbranded fashion, home goods, and daily necessities, according to the slides, and will be delivered between 9 to 11 days to customers, the report said.</p>

<p>The e-commerce giant in a recent closed-door meeting told Chinese sellers it would start signing up merchants this summer and begin accepting inventory in the fall, according to the Information.</p>

<p>Amazon did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on the report.</p>

<p>Sellers joining the bargain site can determine their product selection and pricing, and can produce in small batches to test the demand for any new products they plan to launch, the report added.</p>

<p>It is not clear if these shipments will be made using a U.S. trade provision that exempts individual packages worth less than $800 from US customs duties, Information reported.</p>

<p>E-commerce powerhouse Shein, which is trying to expand its market share before going public, and PDD Group-owned e-retailer Temu, depend on the expedited clearance process, which is available for direct-to-consumer shipments valued at $800 or less.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would "be withdrawn", dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people were killed in clashes with police and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposed to the legislation.</p>

<p>The initially peaceful demonstrations were sparked last week by the 2024 finance bill -- which politicians passed Tuesday afternoon -- and took Ruto's administration by surprise as rallies gathered momentum across the country.</p>

<p>But the Gen-Z-led protests spiralled into violence Tuesday when police fired live bullets at the crowds outside parliament, leaving the complex ransacked and partly on fire.</p>

<p>Nineteen people were killed in the capital Nairobi, a state-funded rights watchdog said.</p>

<p>"I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn," Ruto told a press briefing. "The people have spoken," he said.</p>

<p>"I will be proposing an engagement with the young people of our nation, our sons and daughters, for us to listen to them," he said, in a marked shift from his late-night address Tuesday when he likened some of the demonstrators to "criminals".</p>

<p>'Cannot kill all of us'</p>

<p>Immediately after his speech, prominent protester Hanifa Adan dismissed Ruto's announcement as "PR".</p>

<p>Referring to his comments the previous night, she said on X: "He made that speech trying to intimidate us and he saw it won't work hence the PR."</p>

<p>"The bill is withdrawn but are you going to bring everyone that died back alive?"</p>

<p>Ahead of Ruto's about-turn, protesters had called for fresh rallies on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, we march peacefully again as we wear white, for all our fallen people," Adan had said.</p>

<p>"You cannot kill all of us."</p>

<p>Demonstrators shared "Tupatane Thursday" ("we meet Thursday" in Swahili), alongside the hashtag #Rejectfinancebill2024 on social media.</p>

<p>Cost-of-living crisis</p>

<p>Ruto came to power in 2022 promising to champion the needs of impoverished Kenyans, but tax increases under his government have only made life tougher for those already struggling with high inflation.</p>

<p>The Kenyan leader had already rolled back some tax measures last week, prompting the treasury to warn of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings.</p>

<p>Ruto said Wednesday that withdrawing the bill would mean a significant hole in funding for development programmes to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others.</p>

<p>The cash-strapped government had said previously that the increases were needed to service Kenya's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of GDP.</p>

<p>Deadly day</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Roseline Odede, chairwoman of the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, said "we have recorded 22 deaths", 19 of them in Nairobi, adding that they would launch an investigation.</p>

<p>"This is the largest number of deaths (in) a single day protest," she said, adding that 300 people were injured across the country.</p>

<p>Simon Kigondu, president of the Kenya Medical Association, said he had never before seen "such level of violence against unarmed people."</p>

<p>An official at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi said Wednesday that medics were treating "160 people...some of them with soft tissue injuries, some of them with bullet wounds."</p>

<p>Rights watchdogs have also accused the authorities of kidnapping protesters.</p>

<p>The police have not responded to AFP requests for comment.</p>

<p>'Madness'</p>

<p>A heavy police presence was deployed around parliament early on Wednesday, according to an AFP reporter, the smell of tear gas still in the air and dried blood on the ground.</p>

<p>A policeman standing in front of the broken barricades to the complex told AFP he had watched the scenes unfold on TV.</p>

<p>"It was madness, we hope it will be calm today," he said.</p>

<p>In the central business district, where the protests have been concentrated, traders surveyed the damage.</p>

<p>"They didn't leave anything, just the boxes. I don't know how long it will take me to recover," James Ng'ang'a, whose electronics shop was looted, told AFP.</p>

<p>The unrest has alarmed the international community, with Washington calling on Kenya to respect the right to peaceful protest on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ruto's administration is under pressure from the IMF, which has urged the country to implement fiscal reforms in order to access funding.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka said on Wednesday it had clinched a restructuring deal with India, China, and other nations, covering up to $10 billion in debt, a critical step towards recovery after a 2022 financial crash. The agreement is expected to revive stalled infrastructure projects, including a Japanese-funded airport expansion and a new mass transit light rail in the capital, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in April 2022 after running out of foreign exchange, and the unprecedented economic crisis forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down.</p>

<p>"Sri Lanka concluded negotiations with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and the Exim Bank of China," Wickremesinghe said in a televised Sinhalese-language address to the nation.</p>

<p>"Sri Lanka won," he added in English while thanking the OCC, which included Japan, India, the United States, Canada and several European nations.</p>

<p>He said the deal with OCC nations was reached in Paris, while an agreement with the Exim Bank of China was signed in Beijing on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka secured a moratorium on repayments until 2028, he said, but gave no further details.</p>

<p>His supporters in the capital Colombo let off firecrackers and distributed milk rice in celebration as he spoke.</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe said the nation was bankrupt when he took over almost two years ago and he hoped the International Monetary Fund bailout of $2.9 billion he secured last year would be the island's last.</p>

<p>Colombo had gone to the IMF, the international lender of last resort, on 16 previous occasions and the debt restructuring is a condition of the IMF bailout.</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe has doubled taxes, removed generous energy subsidies and is set to sell off loss-making state enterprises to shore up state revenue under that deal.</p>

<h2><strong>Teachers strike over pay</strong></h2>

<p>India welcomed Sri Lanka's deal and pledged more support.</p>

<p>"This milestone (agreement) demonstrates the strong progress made by Sri Lanka in stabilising its economy and moving towards reform and growth," the Indian government said in a statement.</p>

<p>Bilateral creditors account for 28.5 percent of Sri Lanka's outstanding foreign debt of $37 billion, according to treasury data from the end of March.</p>

<p>China accounts for $4.66 billion of a total of $10.58 billion borrowed from other countries.</p>

<p>Japan accounts for $2.35 billion and India for $1.36 billion.</p>

<p>The government said it was in talks with international bondholders but there was no agreement. A previous round of talks ended in deadlock in April.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka is unable to raise commercial loans until a deal with private creditors is struck.</p>

<p>However, the agreement with bilateral creditors allows the unfreezing of loans for ongoing infrastructure projects financed with funding from other countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of teachers from government schools went on strike in Colombo on Wednesday demanding higher pay, with police using water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protest.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka is due to hold a presidential election this year and opposition parties have vowed to renegotiate the terms of the IMF bailout.</p>

<p>The IMF's Sri Lanka mission chief Peter Breuer said the fund was willing to listen to alternative proposals from rival political parties, but said it was necessary to stick to the benchmarks set in the bailout.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka had made good progress but was not out of the woods yet, he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden and Donald Trump prepared Wednesday for the biggest moment so far in the US election -- the first of two high-stakes debates that could upend the race.</p>

<p>Thursday's showdown will raise the campaigning to boiling point, with both camps recently escalating their increasingly personal attacks.</p>

<p>"I think I have been preparing for it for my whole life...We'll do very well," Trump told right-wing network Newsmax in an interview on his debate preparation.</p>

<p>The 2024 election looks close, with Trump enjoying a slight polling advantage in the all-important swing states in an election likely to be decided by a few hundred thousand votes across a handful of battlegrounds.</p>

<p>The rivals both step onstage for the 90-minute clash, hosted by CNN in the southern city of Atlanta, seeking to allay fears about serious political liabilities.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, faces the most concern about his mental sharpness, with voters much more likely to bring up his age than Trump's, despite the Republican being just three years younger.</p>

<h2><strong>'Out for himself'</strong></h2>

<p>Both have faltered and appeared muddled during public events, although Trump in particular has raised eyebrows over his rambling and occasionally bizarre campaign speeches.</p>

<p>Trump is also engulfed in controversy over his inflammatory rhetoric and a glut of criminal cases he faces, as well as fears that he would weaponize the presidency to settle personal scores.</p>

<p>Biden spent the week off the radar at the mountainside retreat of Camp David near Washington, preparing with mock debates.</p>

<p>Trump's preparation has been more relaxed, eschewing dress rehearsals in favor of informal policy roundtables and workshopping debate strategy with rally crowds.</p>

<p>Aides have encouraged him to focus on his perceived strength on the economy and crime, while Biden will seek to paint Trump as unhinged and unfit for office.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign released an ad saying Trump is preoccupied with "revenge" rather than helping voters, and the Democratic National Committee put up billboards in Atlanta reminding voters that the Republican is a convicted felon.</p>

<p>"Come November, Georgians will head to the polls remembering that President Biden looks out for them, while white-collar crook Donald Trump will only look out for himself," said DNC spokesperson Jackie Bush.</p>

<h2><strong>'Ready for this'?</strong></h2>

<p>The Trump campaign has repeatedly characterized Biden as feeble and incompetent, but changed tack in recent days following warnings that setting low expectations for the Democratic president would only help him.</p>

<p>"We know that Joe Biden, that after taking an entire week off, will be ready for this," senior Trump campaign advisor Jason Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>Backed by right-wing media figures, Trump and his team have been pushing the baseless theory that Biden will be hyped up on performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

<p>The ex-president and his people have also been accused of "working the ref" and laying the groundwork for a poor Trump performance by repeatedly making insinuations of bias on the part of CNN.</p>

<p>Miller said Trump would emerge as the clear choice if "allowed" to set out his vision for America "without the blatant interference of CNN or the two moderators" of the debate -- the first ever between two candidates who have already served in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>One of Biden's biggest vulnerabilities is border security, with Trump promising to combat an influx of undocumented migrants from Mexico with mass deportations and repeatedly bringing up killings by migrants.</p>

<p>US media reported that Trump is expected to invite family members of victims of migrant violence to Atlanta, although the debate itself will have no audience.</p>

<p>The Biden administration announced Wednesday that new restrictions had brought illegal migrant crossings to their lowest levels in more than three years, undercutting immigration as an attack line.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cash-strapped Pakistan is likely to privatize its national flag carrier by the first week of August, a media report said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated privatization of Pakistan International Airline (PIA) has been on top of the agenda of the government after the groundwork was completed by the caretaker government that was in place to organize elections.</p>

<p>Citing sources close to the development, private television channel ARY News reported that six companies have been shortlisted for the privatization of the national flag carrier.</p>

<p>The shortlisted companies have sought details related to PIA and asked for time till July to review the financial issues of the national airline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the authorities are providing the required information to the consortium of shortlisted companies.</p>

<p>It is pertinent to mention here that a consortium of six companies has been pre-qualified for privatizing Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).</p>

<p>According to the details, the companies that lie in the pre-qualified consortium will now be eligible to participate in the bidding process for the PIA.</p>

<p>The decision was made during the Privatisation Commission Board meeting this week which was chaired by Privatization Minister Aleem Khan, who emphasized the government's commitment to ensuring a transparent and efficient privatisation process for all loss-making state-owned companies.</p>

<p>To maintain transparency and foster confidence, Khan proposed broadcasting the privatisation proceedings live on media platforms to assure all stakeholders about the integrity of the process.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new AI-based model could predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease by analysing an individual's speech, the developers said.</p>

<p>Trained on audio recordings of patients with mild cognitive impairment -- early stages of memory loss, the model achieved 78.5 per cent accuracy in forecasting whether patients would remain stable or progress to dementia within six years, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and impacts one's everyday activities by impairing memory and thinking.</p>

<p>The researchers at Boston University, US, used recordings of initial interviews of 166 patients aged 63-97 and trained the model using machine learning to discern patterns between speech, demographics, diagnosis, and how their condition was worsening.</p>

<p>The model analyses interview content such as spoken words and sentence structure, rather than speech features such as enunciation or speed, showed the study published in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia.</p>

<p>"We combine the information we extract from the audio recordings with some very basic demographics - age, gender, and so on - and we get the final score," said Ioannis C. Paschalidis, a professor of engineering and the study's corresponding author.</p>

<p>"You can think of the score as the likelihood, the probability, that someone will remain stable or transition to dementia. It had significant predictive ability," said Paschalidis.</p>

<p>The researchers said that the model was able to perform well, despite challenges like low-quality recordings and background noise.</p>

<p>The researchers emphasised that early prediction is crucial as current diagnostic tests often identify Alzheimer's disease only after significant cognitive decline has occurred such as memories starting to slip away and personality traits beginning to shift.</p>

<p>The team aims to make their model accessible through an app to make it accessible for patients in remote areas, potentially increasing the number of people getting screened.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday extended an olive branch to his predecessor and political rival Imran Khan, offering to hold talks with him if was facing "troubles" in jail.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, the founder of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, has been in jail since August last year after being convicted in some of the nearly 200 cases slapped on the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician since his ouster from power in April 2022.</p>

<p>"If their [PTI] founder is facing troubles [in jail], then I reiterate: come, let's sit down and talk," Mr Sharif said while addressing the National Assembly.</p>

<p>“Let us sit together to take the country ahead. Let us talk for the betterment of the country. There is no other way forward,” he said.</p>

<p>The Nawaz Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf have been at loggerheads for years, particularly after the February 8 elections, which Mr Khan's party claims it had won.</p>

<p>Commenting on the 2018 elections won by Mr Khan's PTI, Mr Sharif said: "We joined Parliament despite the [rigged] polls. The sort of slogans that were raised during my first speech will always be remembered as a dark chapter in the history books."</p>

<p>"If someone is facing any injustice, then I believe that the scales of justice should be in favour of those [being victimised], there is no difference over it — whether it be any politician or anyone from any walk of life," Geo News quoted Sharif as saying.</p>

<p>Mr Sharif lamented that he had once again, while he was in the opposition, proposed to Mr Khan to sit for a dialogue but such slogans were raised again.</p>

<p>"So who is responsible for this bitterness [between politicians]. We don't even shake hands now," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Sharif, 72, also recounted his ordeal of facing victimisation by Mr Khan's government and that he was in jail when his mother passed away. He said that despite being a cancer survivor and with a backbone issue, he used to be taken to courts on the ordinary prison van just to exacerbate the condition, but he never complained.</p>

<p>In response to Prime Minister Sharif's remarks, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub reiterated that the PTI would talk with the government only when Mr Khan and other incarcerated leaders and workers are released from jail.</p>

<p>"This should be in your minds: you torture our workers, you've kept our lady workers in prison vans at 45°C. My prime minister Imran Khan was kept in a death cell, there's an oven-like environment over there," he said, amidst sloganeering from the treasury benches.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US transport security body has sought a unique "one-stop agreement" with India to end the rescreening of passengers, asserting that the "really powerful" concept will raise global aviation security standards.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US transport security body has sought a unique "one-stop agreement" with India to end the rescreening of passengers, asserting that the "really powerful" concept will raise global aviation security standards.</p>

<p>Addressing the India US Aviation Summit here on Tuesday, David Pekoske, Administrator of the US Transportation Security Administration (USTSA) said that the one-stop security concept is "very reachable" between the countries.</p>

<p>"I think very tangible and very reachable between India and the United States is one-stop security," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a concept that expedites the flow of passengers and baggage to their destinations by eliminating the duplication of security controls at transfer points," Pekoske said.</p>

<p>He said in the case of a one-stop agreement, passengers who reach an airport in another country and have a connecting domestic flight would not need to be rescreened and their checked bags would go from aircraft to aircraft.</p>

<p>Terming it a "really powerful" concept, Pekoske said it raises global aviation security standards.</p>

<p>"Flights inbound to the United States are more secure. If there's a reverse agreement between the United States and India where US screening satisfies Indian requirements, that means that flights to India would also be more secure. It does require the regular exchange of information," he said.</p>

<p>"It requires improvements to security processes to maintain the agreement. It yields a reduction in security costs through better allocation of resources, reduces flight connection times and missed connections, and improves the passenger experience," he said.</p>

<p>Pekoske said the two countries should consider signing a memorandum of agreement to share sensitive security information.</p>

<p>"We have a category of classification of information that is not classified in the true sense of classified material, but it is sensitive enough that it needs additional protections," he said.</p>

<p>He said that whenever there is a sharing of sensitive security information -- which is critical to a growing partnership -- there is a need to have a memorandum of agreement which covers the aspects of that sharing arrangement.</p>

<p>He noted that both the TSA and India's transportation security posture were born of cruel tragedy.</p>

<p>For India, it was the bombing of Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 in 1985, while for the TSA, it was the 9-11 attacks in 2001.</p>

<p>"These tragic events were paradigm shifts in how we both thought about transportation security that continues today," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, addressing the summit, US Federal Aviation Administrator Michael Whitaker said that India and the United States need to work together on issues like aviation safety.</p>

<p>Asserting that safety is a team sport, he said that sharing data between the two countries can allow better identification and mitigation of risks in the sector.</p>

<p>"Our (US and India's) national systems of aviation are inextricably linked into a single global network," he said, adding that the two counties have adjoining air spaces, integrated supply chains, and international services that connect their economies and people.</p>

<p>"We need to work together on issues like safety, we need to share ideas and share innovations, especially in how to safely incorporate some of these new technologies into our airspace," he said.</p>

<p>Noting that the two countries have different systems that will take different approaches to solving challenges, he said, "We can and should work together to share best practices and learn from one another." "We all have an interest in increasing safety within our respective countries, but we must work together to increase the level of safety in the global aviation system," he added.</p>

<p>"This means sharing data. Sharing information allows us to better identify and mitigate risks before those risks become accidents and even before they become failures to the safety layers in our system," he added.</p>

<p>"When I started in aviation, accidents were unfortunately not uncommon. They were almost annual events, and safety regulators learned from those accidents and made the system safer," he said.</p>

<p>"For the past couple of decades, we've moved beyond that model, and accidents are now extremely rare, and they are simply unacceptable as an outcome," Whitaker said.</p>

<p>"Our challenge is to bring safety to the next level, and that means we need to proactively analyse data and find those risks of failure and mitigate those risks before they happen," he said.</p>

<p>Asserting that all the job categories in the aviation sector are highly sought after, he said that "for regulators, it means new questions about how we oversee those operations".</p>

<p>"We have to find a safe yet nimble way to regulate these new entrants who are operating at the speed of a startup while we are operating at the speed of government, he said.</p>

<p>He added that there is a need to figure out how to close the gap, identify these risks and leverage technology to incorporate them safely into the airspace.</p>

<p>"In the US, we've seen the public perception of safety and risk in the system evolve over time. As more people have access to aviation, the expectation grows that the system will be completely safe," he asserted.<br />

<p>Mr Musk's reaction came after a recent crash in Orange County, California, where a Tesla driver was reportedly speeding and crashed, causing the vehicle to flip into oncoming traffic, reported KTLA News.</p>

<p>Three people, including the Tesla driver, were hospitalised; their conditions were not immediately available.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the Tesla driver was driving at an estimated over 100 miles per hour. The crash involved six vehicles, with two overturning and trapping people inside. First responders extricated the victims, including the Tesla driver, and rushed them to the hospital.</p>

<p>An eye witness, who was waiting at a red light, recalled the car approaching at "over 100 miles" per hour.</p>

<p>"She smacked the cars right next to me. I don't know how she missed me," the witness said, stressing that the Tesla driver caused the crash.</p>

<p>A worker heard the tyres screech and saw the crash unfold. Recounting the "scary" experience, he said, "Cars are flipping over right outside the window, and it takes you a little bit out of reality."</p>

<p>Police are investigating the cause of the crash, saying it was possible that alcohol or drugs could also be involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US has reaffirmed its commitment to partnering with the Maldives to promote a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific region, a senior state department official has said, amidst the archipelagic nation in the Indian Ocean moving closer to China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has reaffirmed its commitment to partnering with the Maldives to promote a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, a senior state department official has said, amidst the archipelagic nation in the Indian Ocean moving closer to China.</p>

<p>This message was conveyed when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with visiting Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer on Tuesday in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>Secretary Blinken reaffirmed the US commitment to partnering with Maldives to promote a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Ever since Maldivian leader Mohamed Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, assumed charge as President in November last year, the Maldives has stepped up ties with Beijing and inked several bilateral agreements, including a defence cooperation deal.</p>

<p>Blinken's reference to the Indo-Pacific is also significant since China is vehemently opposed to the US and other countries getting involved in a region where Beijing has major maritime territorial disputes with countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Blinken highlighted the US donation of eight patrol boats to the Maldives and, working with Congress, the planned provision of $2 million in hydrographic support to help the country mitigate the impact of rising sea levels, Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Blinken and Zameer discussed additional opportunities to enhance cooperation on addressing the climate crisis, economic growth, maritime security, and other bilateral priorities, it said.</p>

<p>In Male, the foreign ministry said Zameer and Blinken discussed matters in the area of defence and security cooperation, commitment to economic growth and adapting to climate change among other issues and expressed their commitment to regional stability and maritime security.</p>

<p>"Met with Maldivian Foreign Minister @MoosaZameer to enhance the US-Maldives partnership and cooperation on climate, economic growth, and maritime security," posted Blinken on his X handle with the photos of the meeting.</p>

<p>Almost echoing the sentiment, Zameer posted on his X handle, "I am delighted to meet with the Honourable @SecBlinken, Secretary of State of the US, today. I reaffirmed our commitment to further strengthen the partnership between the Maldives and US in tackling climate change, promoting democracy and cooperation in maritime security."</p>

<p>A statement from the Maldives Foreign Ministry said that the Maldives and the United States reaffirmed their commitment to explore new avenues "to strengthen the partnership" and acknowledged the importance of upholding a rules-based international order and expressed their commitment to regional stability, maritime security and promoting peace.</p>

<p>"Secretary Blinken congratulated the Maldives on the successful Presidential and Parliamentary elections and acknowledged the Maldives' leadership in the international fora towards combating climate change and promoting environmental sustainability," the statement said.</p>

<p>News portal Sun.mv said that earlier on Tuesday, Zameer met with Samantha Power, the Administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>

<p>"The two deliberated on various themes related to economical advancements and protecting the environment in addition to consolidating Maldivian associations with the agency's assistance," Edition.mv said.</p>

<p>Zameer had left for Washington on Sunday night, in a visit that the Foreign Ministry said seeks to "further strengthen the Maldives - US partnership and reaffirm commitment to multilateralism," Sun.mv said.</p>

<p>Zameer will also travel to New York, where he will meet with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Li Junhua, media reports said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Dutch beach volleyball player, who raped a 12-year-old British girl, has qualified for next month's Paris Olympics despite being told by a judge that his dream of representing the Netherlands was "shattered."</p>

<p>Steven van de Velde was sentenced in March 2016 to four years in prison after admitting to three counts of rape against a child he met on Facebook. In August 2014, at the age of 19, he flew from the Netherlands to the UK to meet his victim, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/volleyball/2024/06/25/volleyball-steven-van-der-velde-raped-british-12-olympics/"><em>Telegraph </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judge Francis Sheridan told him, "Prior to coming to this country you were training as a potential Olympian. Your hopes of representing your country now lie as a shattered dream."</p>

<p>However, Van de Velde, who was released after serving only 12 months in a Dutch prison, has since been permitted to rehabilitate his Olympic career. This month, he secured his spot in the national pair for the Paris Games alongside Matthew Immers.</p>

<p>Upon sentencing at Aylesbury Crown Court after being extradited from his homeland, his defense lawyer, Linda Strudwick, commented on the verdict: "The headlines say it all: 'A sex monster.' It's plainly a career end for him."</p>

<p>It has proven otherwise, as Van de Velde, now 29, has successfully rebuilt his beach volleyball career to the extent that he and Immer are now ranked as the 11th team in the world heading to Paris next month.</p>

<p>Van de Velde's resurgence poses a significant ethical dilemma for the International Olympic Committee. Each Paris Olympian is required to sign an Athletes' Rights and Responsibilities Declaration, which includes a mandate to "act as a role model."</p>

<p>Having travelled from Amsterdam to Milton Keynes to engage in sexual activity with a 12-year-old girl, a fact acknowledged in strong terms by the judge in 2016, Van de Velde had previously communicated with the victim on social media before arranging the visit, during which he took her virginity while her mother was away.</p>

<p>"Your actions have wrecked your life and you could, had you never come to England and committed these offences, have been a leader in your sport," Judge Sheridan said. "A young, naive, foolish child had formed the view that you loved her. In reality, you only knew her on the internet, had never met her before and were fully aware of the age difference."</p>

<p>Upon his release in 2017, having served only a quarter of his sentence, Van de Velde, who had cried in court upon learning about the girl's subsequent self-harm and overdose, stated: "I want to correct all the nonsense that has been written about me while I was imprisoned. I deliberately didn't read any of it, but I understand it was quite severe, branding me as a sex monster, as a paedophile. That I am not, really not.</p>

<p>"Everyone is entitled to their opinion about me, but it's only fair if they also hear my side of the story."</p>

<p>These remarks elicited a scathing response from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which stated: "Van de Velde's lack of remorse and self-pity is astonishing, and we can only imagine how distressed his victim must feel upon seeing his comments.</p>

<p>"Grooming can leave a child feeling ashamed or even guilty, because they believe they have somehow willingly participated when, in reality, an adult has preyed upon them for sexual exploitation."</p>

<p>The Dutch Olympic committee has not yet commented on Van de Velde's qualification for Paris. According to The Australian, the country's volleyball federation has yet to finalize its athlete selections. The IOC has been contacted for a response.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A shaven-headed Evan Gershkovich went on trial behind closed doors on Wednesday in a Russian court where the US journalist is facing accusations of espionage.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shaven-headed Evan Gershkovich went on trial behind closed doors on Wednesday in a Russian court where the US journalist is facing accusations of espionage.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say the Wall Street Journal reporter gathered secret information on the orders of the US Central Intelligence Agency about a company that manufactures tanks for Russia's war in Ukraine. If convicted, he faces a sentence of up to 20 years.</p>

<p>Gershkovich, his newspaper and the US government all reject the allegations and say that he was just doing his job as a reporter accredited by Russia's Foreign Ministry to work there.</p>

<p>"His case is not about evidence, procedural norms, or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives," the US embassy in Moscow said in a statement, calling for Gershkovich's immediate release.</p>

<p>After several hours of closed proceedings, the court said the next session would take place on Aug. 13 - an indication the case will drag on for months. The reason for the long interval was not clear.</p>

<p>Journalists were briefly allowed to film the 32-year-old Gershkovich before the start of the trial, from which the media are barred. Wearing an open-necked shirt and standing in a glass box, he smiled faintly and nodded at colleagues he recognised.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Mikael Ozdoyev later summarised the charges for reporters.</p>

<p>"The investigation established and documented that... Gershkovich, on instructions from the CIA, in September 2023, in the Sverdlovsk region, collected secret information about the activities of a defence enterprise regarding the production and repair of military equipment," Ozdoyev said.</p>

<p>"Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions while observing painstaking conspiratorial measures," he added.</p>

<p>Ozdoyev later told reporters he had misspoken, and the alleged offence was actually in March 2023 - the month of the reporter's arrest.</p>

<h2><strong>Closed Hearing</strong></h2>

<p>Closed trials are standard procedure in Russia for cases of alleged treason or espionage involving classified state material, which typically can last several months.</p>

<p>The Kremlin says the case, and the arrangements for it, are a matter for the court, but has stated - without publishing evidence - that Gershkovich was caught "red-handed".</p>

<p>Against the background of the Ukraine war, Gershkovich and other Americans detained in Russia have been caught up in the gravest crisis between Moscow and Washington for more than 60 years.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is open to the idea of a prisoner exchange involving Gershkovich and that contacts with the United States have taken place, but they must remain secret.</p>

<p>The US has accused Russia of conducting "hostage diplomacy". It has designated Gershkovich and another jailed American, Paul Whelan, as "wrongfully detained" and says it is committed to bringing them home.</p>

<p>The US embassy statement said Russian authorities had failed to provide evidence supporting the charges against Gershkovich or to explain why his work as a journalist constituted a crime.</p>

<p>The trial is taking place in the city of Yekaterinburg, where officers of the FSB security service arrested Gershkovich on March 29, 2023, while he was eating in a steakhouse. Since then he has spent nearly 16 months in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has declined to comment on the purpose of his reporting trip to Russia's Urals region or on the specific allegation by prosecutors that Gershkovich was trying to gather information on Uralvagonzavod, a supplier of tanks for Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"He was there as an accredited journalist, doing his job," Wall Street Journal publisher Almar Latour told Reuters in a phone interview before the trial.</p>

<p>Many Western news organisations pulled staff out of Russia after Putin sent his army into Ukraine in February 2022. Russia then passed laws that set long prison terms for "discrediting" the armed forces or spreading "fake news" about them.</p>

<p>Gershkovich was one of a small number of Western reporters, also including journalists from Reuters, who continued to report from inside Russia.</p>

<p>Another journalist, Russian-American Alsu Kurmasheva, was arrested last year and is awaiting trial on charges of violating Russia's "foreign agent" law and spreading false information about the armed forces, which she denies.</p>

<p>Earlier this month a French researcher, Laurent Vinatier, was arrested and accused of failing to register as a foreign agent while gathering information about Russia's military.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assange landed on a chilly Canberra evening in a private jet hours after being freed by a court in the US Pacific territory of Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>He admitted to one count of revealing US defence secrets in exchange for being sentenced by the US judge to time already served in London's Belmarsh prison -- five years and two months.</p>

<p>The agreement allowed him to walk free and return home to Australia.</p>

<p>"He just arrived in Australia after being in a high-security prison for over five years and a long 72-hour flight, or something like that -- it's premature," Stella Assange said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's Prime Minister said Wednesday a string of recent non-disclosed missions to the United States helped to forge the plea deal that freed Julian Assange.</p>

<p>The 52-year-old WikiLeaks founder landed in Canberra hours earlier, after earning his liberty by pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate US national defence information.</p>

<p>He was sentenced by a court in the US Pacific territory of Northern Mariana Islands to time already served in London's high-security Belmarsh prison -- five years and two months -- and allowed to walk free.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice had to make a "range of decisions" for the plea deal to proceed, Anthony Albanese told a news conference in Canberra, stressing that the US department was independent and "not subject to political influence".</p>

<p>A "whole range of people" had visited the United States as the deal was worked out, the Australian leader told reporters.</p>

<p>"I am surprised that some of it was missed by the people in this room -- some of the visits -- but it's not up to me to indicate that," Albanese said.</p>

<p>He advised journalists to "go back and look at some diaries and who has travelled to the United States in recent months".</p>

<p>Albanese said he had exchanged "directly" with Assange's lawyers during the negotiations.</p>

<p>Australia's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Stephen Smith, also acted as a conduit for communication, visiting Assange in Belmarsh, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>"The details of the plea deal were worked through over a period of time," he said.</p>

<p>"This was the only way that I could see a resolution being achieved -- and the objective here was to conclude these matters."</p>

<p>Albanese said he had never met with Assange but spoke with him the moment his jet touched down in Canberra as part of a mutually agreed plan.</p>

<p>"I had a very warm discussion with him this evening. He was very generous in his praise of the Australian government's efforts," he added.</p>

<p>"The Australian government stands up for Australian citizens. That's what we do."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After Julian Assange was released by a court on the remote US Pacific territory of Saipan, ending a 14-year legal battle, the WikiLeaks founder's lawyer first thanked Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for making the outcome possible.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Julian Assange was released by a court on the remote US Pacific territory of Saipan on Wednesday, ending a 14-year legal battle, the WikiLeaks founder's lawyer first thanked Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for making the outcome possible.</p>

<p>Jennifer Robinson, the Australian attorney of Assange, said diplomacy and intense lobbying with the highest authorities in the US played a big role in Assange walking free, after spending five years in a high-security British prison and seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p>

<p>"At every opportunity, and when Australian officials were making outreach to the US, they knew that they were acting with the full authority of the prime minister of Australia," Robinson told reporters outside the courtroom in Saipan.</p>

<p>Albanese has claimed Assange's release as a win for the country, which leveraged its security ties with Washington and London to strengthen its case to resolve the plight of an Australian citizen.</p>

<p>"This work has been complex and it has been considered. This is what standing up for Australians around the world looks like," Albanese, leader of a centre-left Labor government, told parliament on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Assange, who landed in Australia on Wednesday evening, had faced a maximum jail sentence of 175 years after being charged with 17 counts of breaching the US Espionage Act and a hacking-related charge. Under a deal revealed on Tuesday, he pled guilty to a single charge of espionage and walked free.</p>

<p>The deal gained momentum as the US faced growing challenges in the UK over the legality of extraditing Assange, while Australian lawmakers and diplomats raised the heat in Washington and London.</p>

<h2><strong>Political Shift</strong></h2>

<p>A decade ago under a conservative government, there was little political will in Canberra to back Assange's case. But things changed in 2023 when dozens of lawmakers across the political spectrum swung in behind the campaign to bring him home, his father, John Shipton, told Reuters.</p>

<p>That swing culminated in the passage of a parliamentary motion in February this year calling for Assange's release.</p>

<p>Shipton told Reuters the Australian government had been "nothing short of magnificent" and praised former prime minister Kevin Rudd and former defence minister Stephen Smith, Australia's top envoys to the US and Britain.</p>

<p>Australian conservative lawmaker Barnaby Joyce, a former deputy prime minister, was among a cross-party group of politicians who travelled to Washington in September to lobby for a resolution.</p>

<p>Joyce said on Wednesday the trip made the case on Capitol Hill that Australian politicians wanted to "get this thing done", because it was a distraction to Australia's security alliance with the United States.</p>

<p>Long-time advisor to the Australian campaign for Assange, lawyer Greg Barns, said US politicians saw on that trip that "this wasn't a party political issue".</p>

<p>One government official who did not want to be identified said the first big break for Assange came in January 2021, when then shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus issued a statement calling for the case against Assange to end after a British court found that it would be unjust to extradite him to the US.</p>

<p>"This was the first indication that a major political party in Australia was supporting the cause to free Assange," the official said.</p>

<h2><strong>Enough Is Enough</strong></h2>

<p>When Labor won power in May 2022, Assange finally had state diplomatic support behind him. Later that year Albanese called for his release on the floor of the House of Representatives, the first time a Prime Minister had mentioned Assange in parliament since 2012.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough, it is time for this matter to be brought to a conclusion," he said.</p>

<p>"My position is clear and has been made clear to the US administration that it is time that this matter be brought to a close. This is an Australian citizen."</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Albanese and senior cabinet colleagues including Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Attorney General Dreyfus used visits to the US to lobby their counterparts, according to the government official.</p>

<p>The appointment of Smith and Rudd to the top diplomatic jobs in London and Washington in late 2022 added two more sympathetic lobbyists for Assange's cause.</p>

<p>Smith visited Assange in Belmarsh prison in April 2023, the first such visit by Australia's top UK diplomat since he was imprisoned four years earlier.</p>

<p>Deeper ties between Australia and the US through the AUKUS security pact helped push diplomatic efforts along, said Mark Kenny, a professor at Australian National University.</p>

<p>"It looks pretty odd if we're getting ever closer to the US and yet we don't have a special relationship with the US such that we can advocate and get concessions for an Australian citizen," Kenny said.</p>

<h2><strong>Final Details</strong></h2>

<p>As recently as last July, US officials appeared determined to prosecute Assange. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that month Australia needed to understand US concerns over the issue.</p>

<p>However, a month later, US Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy said a deal was possible.</p>

<p>After the cross-party delegation of Australian politicians travelled to Washington in September to speak to Republican and Democrat lawmakers about the Assange case, the Biden administration appeared to be softening its response.</p>

<p>Joe Biden said in April, "We are considering it," when asked by media about Australia's request to end Assange's prosecution.</p>

<p>But it was the UK High Court's decision in May to allow Assange to appeal against his extradition that triggered the breakthrough in negotiations over a plea deal according to his wife Stella.</p>

<p>The court's decision meant the legal battle over extradition would likely be delayed for months more to make time for appeals.</p>

<p>An early plan to have Assange fly to New York or Washington to enter his plea was changed to Saipan because of Assange's opposition to entering the continental United States, according to an Australian government official.</p>

<p>The deal marks the end of a legal saga following WikiLeaks' mass release of secret US documents in 2010 - one of the largest security breaches in US military history.</p>

<p>As Assange was moved from Belmarsh prison to London's Stansted airport in the dead of night on Monday, the secrecy was such that his children weren't told in case they spilled details about his release, according to his wife Stella Assange.</p>

<p>In a global outpouring of support following the news, a crowdfunding campaign to raise the $520,000 owed to the Australian government for the flights had already raised almost 330,000 pounds ($418,000) by Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>"I don't think that would have happened if it hadn't been for the incredible support that there has been for Julian, and which has been building over the years, which is global, which is across all sectors, all politics," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the world's biggest music production companies, including Sony Music Entertainment, are suing two US-based artificial intelligence (AI) platforms Suno and Udio that generate songs based on text prompts, news agency Associated Press reported.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was announced by the Recording Industry Association of America on Tuesday, stating Universal Group Recordings and Warner Records are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The case against Suno AI has been filed in Boston federal court, and of Udio AI in New York.</p>

<p>The case seeks damages of $150,000 per song infringement, alleging some popular songs like Mariah Carey's Christmas classic "All I Want for Christmas Is You" have been replicated by the AI music generators.</p>

<p>Suno AI came under the limelight in December last year when Microsoft partnered with it, integrating it inside Microsoft's own chatbot Copilot.</p>

<p>Music artists have expressed apprehensions over AI-generated music. Over 200 artists from across genres, including Billie Elish, Nikki Minaj and Zayn Malik, signed an open letter on 1 April, asking developers, tech companies and music platforms "to cease the use of AI to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists." The letter expressed concern of AI-generated content flooding platforms and diluting royalty pools.</p>

<p>According to the Financial Times, Sony Music in May sent warning letters to 700 AI developers and music streaming platforms, asking them to not use data owned by Sony for training, developing or commercialising AI systems.</p>

<p>In India, AR Rehman has embraced the use of AI to produce music, using it to recreate the voice of late singers Bamba Bakya and Shahul Hameed in the song 'Thimiri Yezhuda' that released on January 26 for the movie 'Lal Salaam'. The Oscar winning singer and composer took to X (formerly Twitter) at the time to clarify that technology can be used to enhance the musical experience ethically.</p>

<p>Indian Music Industry, a non-commercial body representing the interests of the likes of Sony Music (India), Saregama India Ltd, Tips, and T-Series, acknowledged the potential of AI in assisting music production, publishing a position paper authored by its president, in October last year. However, the paper advocated for a human-centric AI that respects India's rich musical traditions and safeguards creativity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

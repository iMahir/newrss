       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 150 years ago, surgeon and politician William Crowther allegedly stole the skull of an Aboriginal leader, William Lanne, from a Hobart morgue. Today, the crime continues to spark debate in the city as the statue of Crowther, once towering over a central square, lies in ruins – its feet severed by vandals.</p>

<p>In the heart of Hobart, Tasmania, the bronze monument once stood over the oak-lined square. The statue, earlier, was cut down at the ankles, leaving only severed bronze feet behind, the BBC reported. The vandalism, along with the words "what goes around" spray-painted on its base, symbolised a larger struggle – a debate about colonialism, racism and the dark history of Tasmania's treatment of its Aboriginal people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>William Crowther's notoriety stems from an event that took place over 150 years ago, when he allegedly broke into a morgue and mutilated the body of William Lanne, an Aboriginal leader. Lanne's skull was stolen and later sent overseas as a trophy, which showed the colonisers' view of Tasmanian Aboriginal people as extinct. Today, Lanne's descendants and many in the Aboriginal community see Crowther as a symbol of colonial brutality and erasure.</p>

<p>William Lanne, often referred to as the last "full-blooded" Aboriginal Tasmanian, is a symbol of the tragic history of Tasmania's Indigenous population and their mistreatment by British colonisers. Born around 1835, Lanne was part of the Palawa people, the original inhabitants of Tasmania (formerly Van Diemen's Land). Lanne was forcibly removed from his homeland and lived through two notorious camps established to confine Aboriginal people. He is remembered as a shipmate and advocate for his people.</p>

<p>William Lanne, once thought to be the last Aboriginal man in Tasmania, became the subject of scientific exploitation. He died at the age of 34 in 1869 due to disease. Before his burial in 1869, parts of his body, including his hands, feet and skull, were stolen by physicians eager to study the so-called "missing link" between humans and Neanderthals. Though Crowther denied involvement, the scandal rocked the city at the time, leading to his suspension from the hospital.</p>

<p>For Aboriginal activists, like Nala Mansell, the statue of William Crowther represented not just a man but the false narrative that Aboriginal Tasmanians were wiped out. In contrast, some Hobart residents, including Crowther's descendants, see him as a significant historical figure whose contributions should not be overshadowed by past misdeeds.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tributes from the ballet world and beyond have poured in, with American ballerina Misty Copeland writing, "Despite being told the 'world wasn't ready for black ballerinas,' she remained determined and made big strides." DePrince's life and career shattered barriers for dancers of colour, challenging stereotypes in the ballet community.</p>

<p>Born in 1995 in Kenema, Sierra Leone, DePrince's early life was marked by tragedy. She lost both parents during the country's civil war and was sent to an orphanage at age three, where she was mistreated due to her vitiligo. DePrince was later adopted by an American couple and moved to New Jersey, where her adoptive mother nurtured her love for ballet. She went on to become the youngest principal dancer at the Dance Theatre of Harlem and performed in Beyonce's Lemonade.</p>

<p>In 2021, she joined Boston Ballet as a second soloist and appeared in Dancing with the Stars at just 17. DePrince was also a dedicated humanitarian, advocating for children affected by conflict.</p>

<p>Her spokesperson said her artistry "touched countless hearts" and her life was defined by "grace, purpose, and strength." DePrince's legacy, they added, will continue to inspire future generations.</p>

<p>DePrince's family is also mourning the loss of their mother, Elaine DePrince, who passed away around the same time.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you care about the environment, think twice about using AI.</p>

<p>Generative artificial intelligence uses 30 times more energy than a traditional search engine, warns researcher Sasha Luccioni, on a mission to raise awareness about the environmental impact of the hot new technology.</p>

<p>Recognized as one of the 100 most influential people in the world of AI by the American magazine Time in 2024, the Canadian computer scientist of Russian origin has sought for several years to quantify the emissions of programs like ChatGPT or Midjourney.</p>

<p>"I find it particularly disappointing that generative AI is used to search the Internet," laments the researcher, who spoke with AFP on the sidelines of the ALL IN artificial intelligence conference, in Montreal.</p>

<p>The language models on which the programs are based require enormous computing capacities to train on billions of data points, necessitating powerful servers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there's the energy used to respond to each individual user's requests.</p>

<p>Instead of simply extracting information, "like a search engine would do to find the capital of a country, for example," AI programs "generate new information," making the whole thing "much more energy-intensive," she explains.</p>

<p>According to the International Energy Agency, the combined AI and the cryptocurrency sectors consumed nearly 460 terawatt hours of electricity in 2022 -- two per cent of total global production.</p>

<h3><strong>Energy efficiency&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A leading researcher on the impact of AI on climate, Luccioni participated in 2020 in the creation of a tool for developers to quantify the carbon footprint of running a piece of code. "CodeCarbon" has since been downloaded more than a million times.</p>

<p>Head of the climate strategy of startup Hugging Face, a platform for sharing open-access AI models, she is now working on creating a certification system for algorithms.</p>

<p>Similar to the program from the US Environmental Protection Agency that awards scores based on the energy consumption of electronic devices and appliances, it would make it possible to know an AI product's energy consumption in order to encourage users and developers to "make better decisions."</p>

<p>"We don't take into account water or rare materials," she acknowledges, "but at least we know that for a specific task, we can measure energy efficiency and say that this model has an A+, and that model has a D," she says.</p>

<h3><strong>Transparency&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In order to develop her tool, Luccioni is experimenting with it on generative AI models that are accessible to everyone, or open source, but she would also like to do it on commercial models from Google or ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, which have been reluctant to agree.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft and Google have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by the end of the decade, the US tech giants saw their greenhouse gas emissions soar in 2023 because of AI: up 48 per cent for Google compared to 2019 and 29 per cent for Microsoft compared to 2020.</p>

<p>"We are accelerating the climate crisis," says Luccioni, calling for more transparency from tech companies.</p>

<p>The solution, she says, could come from governments that, for the moment, are "flying blindly," without knowing what is "in the data sets or how the algorithms are trained."</p>

<p>"Once we have transparency, we can start legislating."</p>

<h3><strong>'Energy sobriety'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>It is also necessary to "explain to people what generative AI can and cannot do, and at what cost," according to Luccioni.</p>

<p>In her latest study, the researcher demonstrated that producing a high-definition image using artificial intelligence consumes as much energy as fully recharging the battery of your cell phone.</p>

<p>At a time when more and more companies want to integrate technology further into our lives -- with conversational bots and connected devices, or in online searches -- Luccioni advocates "energy sobriety."</p>

<p>The idea here is not to oppose AI, she emphasizes, but rather to choose the right tools -- and use them judiciously.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haridwar witnessed a unique celebration of love on Saturday when two Russian couples got married as per Hindu traditions. The wedding took place at the Akhand Param Dham Ashram, where the couples embraced Indian customs, including the chanting of Vedic hymns and completing seven rounds (<em>saat phere</em>) around a sacred fire, symbolising their commitment.</p>

<p>The couple, who have been married for 20 years and have three children, chose to renew their vows as per Hindu customs, a guest revealed to the news agency PTI.</p>

<p>“They have already tested their relationship and are confident they'll be together for the rest of their lives,” the guest said. “Their admiration for Indian culture inspired them to renew their vows here.”</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony was conducted by the Ashram's priest, who shared insights into the growing international interest in Indian culture.</p>

<p>“Every year, we hold meditation camps here, attracting people from around the world,” he told PTI.</p>

<p>“Many come for spiritual guidance and receive mantras and blessings from Gurudev Bhagwan. Today, these two couples decided to marry as per Indian customs, so we conducted their weddings following the Vedic traditions.”</p>

<p>The couples were dressed in traditional Indian attire, with the brides sporting mehndi (<em>henna</em>) designs on their hands. Friends and family joined in the celebrations, singing and dancing. They wore flower garlands, creating a festive Indian wedding atmosphere.</p>

<p>Guests at the wedding shared how deeply moved the Russian couples were by Indian culture. A guest mentioned, “The couples wanted a bond that would last not just for one lifetime but for seven lifetimes, as they had heard that Indian weddings signify an unbreakable bond. This is why they chose to marry according to Hindu customs.”</p>

<p>This is not the first instance of Russians embracing Indian culture. In October 2023, three <a href="https://www.etvbharat.com/english/state/uttarakhand/3-russian-couples-marry-following-hindu-customs-in-haridwar/na20231005145151108108122 ">Russian couples married</a>&nbsp;in a traditional Hindu ceremony at the Akhand Paramdham Ashram in Haridwar. The couple, who were part of a 50-member Russian pilgrimage group, were impressed by Indian culture and decided to get married according to Hindu customs. The wedding ceremony included the procession of the three brides, seeking blessings from Lord Shiva, and taking seven rounds around the sacred fire. The couples wore traditional Indian attire, and the ceremony was accompanied by Hindi songs, drums and Uttarakhandi musical instruments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This letter, which played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb, was originally addressed to the US president.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The letter that Albert Einstein penned in 1939, urging President Roosevelt to prioritize nuclear research, sold for a staggering $3.9 million at a recent <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.christies.com/en/auction/pushing-boundaries-ingenuity-from-the-paul-g-allen-collection-30730/overview" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Christie's </em></a>auction. This letter, which played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb, was originally addressed to the US president, highlighting the grave potential of nuclear weapons and the urgent need for American involvement.</p>

<h2><strong>A Warning That Changed History</strong></h2>

<p>The original letter, now part of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library's collection in New York, was Einstein's attempt to warn President Roosevelt that Germany might be developing nuclear weapons. In the letter, Einstein discussed recent breakthroughs in nuclear physics, noting that uranium could become "a new and important source of energy" and warning that this energy could be harnessed to create "extremely powerful bombs."</p>

<p>Einstein, along with fellow physicist Leo Szilard, had fled Europe due to the rise of Adolf Hitler. Feeling a sense of urgency, Einstein's letter helped convince the U.S. government to expedite its research into nuclear fission, leading to the Manhattan Project and the eventual development of atomic bombs.</p>

<p>Peter Klarnet, senior specialist in Americana, books, and manuscripts at Christie's, described the letter as "one of the most influential letters in history." Written in the summer of 1939, it set the stage for the nuclear arms race and changed the course of the war and human history.</p>

<p>According to <em>Business Insider</em>, the auctioned copy was the only one in private hands, previously owned by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who purchased it in 2002 for $2.1 million. Before that, it was part of publisher Malcolm Forbes' collection, acquired from Leo Szilard's estate.</p>

<h2><strong>Einstein's "Great Mistake"</strong></h2>

<p>Though instrumental in advancing the U.S. nuclear program, Einstein later expressed profound regret. He called his involvement in the development of nuclear weapons his "one great mistake." After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Einstein reportedly lamented, "Woe is me," recognizing the immense human suffering caused by these weapons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switzerland on Saturday inaugurated its new supercomputer called Alps -- one of the world's fastest -- which it hopes will help place the country first for trustworthy artificial intelligence solutions.</p>

<p>The ETH Zurich University officially inaugurated Alps at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) in Lugano, southern Switzerland.</p>

<p>"Alps is an expression of our vision of a future characterised by knowledge and progress," Economy, Education and Research Minister Guy Parmelin said in a speech at the CSCS site.</p>

<p>In June, Alps was ranked as the world's sixth most powerful supercomputer. However, at the time it was not fully constructed and had only reached 60 per cent of its potential.</p>

<p>The supercomputer was developed to meet extreme data and computing scientific requirements and allows artificial intelligence to be utilised more fully.</p>

<p>It is the central part of an initiative "to position Switzerland as the world's leading hub for the development and implementation of transparent and trustworthy AI solutions", ETH Zurich said in a statement.</p>

<p>Andreas Krause, head of the AI Centre at ETH Zurich, said: "Alps makes it possible to train complex AI models for important applications, for example, in medicine and climate research."</p>

<p>The MeteoSwiss national weather service is already using the Alps to produce a higher-resolution weather prediction model that better reflects Switzerland's complex topography of mountains and valleys.</p>

<p>Parmelin said on X that the Alps would be "opening new horizons, clearing the path for the future, placing Switzerland in pole position for scientific research".</p>

<p>CSCS deputy director Michele De Lorenzi told Switzerland's Keystone-ATS news agency it would take 40,000 years for a commercial laptop to perform the operations that the Alps can do in a day.</p>

<p>The supercomputer is housed in 33 cabinets covering 116 square metres.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia and Ukraine conducted a major exchange of 206 prisoners on Saturday, 103 apiece, in their second such swap in two days, following negotiations mediated by the United Arab Emirates, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelensky&nbsp;credited the release of the prisoners to his forces' recent incursion into Russia. The released Ukrainians -- 82 soldiers and privates and 21 officers -- had been held since the early months of the war, he said.</p>

<p>The Russian Defence Ministry said that the 103 Russian soldiers exchanged had been taken prisoner in the border Kursk region where Ukrainian forces launched the surprise incursion in August.</p>

<p>"Our people are home," Zelensky&nbsp;said on the Telegram messaging app. "We have successfully brought back another 103 warriors from Russian captivity to Ukraine."</p>

<p>In his nightly video address, he thanked his combat forces for their courage and the team handling the exchanges. "In particular, our operation in the Kursk region gave a necessary boost," he added.</p>

<p>Zelensky&nbsp;posted pictures of servicemen wrapped in the national blue and yellow flag, hugging each other, talking on mobile phones and posing for group photographs at an undisclosed location.</p>

<p>In his video address, he said those released included soldiers who fought to defend the city of Mariupol. The Azov brigade, which took part in the three-month defence of the port in 2022, said in a post on its Telegram channel that 23 of its men were among the captives released on Saturday.</p>

<p>The exchange was mediated by the UAE, Emirati state news agency WAM said. It was the country's eighth such mediation since the start of 2024, it said.</p>

<p>Kyiv and Moscow have frequently exchanged prisoners since Russia's invasion in February 2022, and Saturday's swap was the third since Ukraine began a cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region in early August.</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials have previously said Kyiv's forces had captured at least 600 Russian soldiers during the incursion, and that this would help it secure the return of captured Ukrainians.</p>

<p>Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's human rights ombudsman said that Kyiv had so far secured the return of 3,672 Ukrainians in 57 exchanges.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pledged on Friday to conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city of Springfield, even though the majority of them are in the United States legally.</p>

<p>The city for days has found itself at the center of a social media maelstrom after right-wing agitators latched onto false claims that Haitian arrivals were eating household pets.</p>

<p>"We will do large deportations in Springfield, Ohio," Trump said at a press conference at his golf resort near Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The majority of the 15,000 Haitians in Springfield are there legally. Trump's longstanding pledge to conduct mass deportations usually refers to those in the country illegally.</p>

<p>Trump did not repeat the assertion he made during Tuesday's presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that immigrants were eating dogs and cats, remarks that have been widely mocked.</p>

<p>Two elementary schools were evacuated and one middle school in Springfield was closed on Friday after anonymous bomb threats were made against the community for the second day in a row, according to ABC News.</p>

<p>At the White House, President Joe Biden urged the attacks on the Haitian community to cease.</p>

<p>"It's simply wrong. There's no place in America. This has to stop - what he's doing. It has to stop," Biden said.</p>

<p>The Biden administration extended Temporary Protected Status to hundreds of thousands of Haitians in the United States in June, a decades-old program that protects legal immigrants from deportation and gives them work permits. Gang wars in Haiti have displaced over half a million people and nearly five million are facing severe food insecurity.</p>

<p>Trump has cited the tensions in Springfield as another example of the need for hardline immigration polices. The influx of Haitians has boosted the economy but also has strained social services.</p>

<p>"I'm angry about illegal Haitian migrants taking over Springfield, Ohio. You see that mess, don't you?" Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas, later on Friday.</p>

<p>"I'm angry about young American girls being raped and murdered by savage criminal aliens that come into our country very easily, but very illegally," he added later in his speech.</p>

<p>Haitian community leaders across the United States said the Republican candidate's remarks could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in Springfield.</p>

<p>"We need help, not hate," Springfield's mayor Rob Rue told ABC News.</p>

<p>City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of "crimes of opportunity," such as property theft.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norwegian police said on Saturday that the 27-year-old son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit had been arrested for violating a restraining order.</p>

<p>Marius Borg Hoiby was initially detained on August 4 following a night-time row at a woman's apartment in Oslo and accused of causing bodily harm to the resident, with whom he was having a relationship.</p>

<p>Norwegian media reports said police found a knife stuck into one of the walls of the woman's bedroom at the time.</p>

<p>"At the beginning of September, police received information that Marius Borg Hoiby had, on several occasions, made unwanted contact with the woman, who has the status of victim in the incident," police said in a statement on Saturday.</p>

<p>They "filed a report for reckless behaviour and imposed a restraining order on Hoiby", it said.</p>

<p>They subsequently "received information that Hoiby had violated the restraining order" and he was rearrested late on Friday due to the "risk of recurrence".</p>

<p>Police now suspect Hoiby of crimes against three other victims -- domestic abuse of two women and threats to another person.</p>

<p>Hoiby's lawyer Oyvind Bratlien said his client denied the allegations.</p>

<p>"In my 17 years as a defence lawyer, I have never experienced or heard of an arrest on such a flimsy factual and legal basis," Bratlien told broadcaster NRK.</p>

<p>Hoiby was born in 1997 from a relationship prior to Mette-Marit's 2001 marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, the heir apparent to the Norwegian throne.</p>

<p>He and his step-siblings -- Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 20 and Prince Sverre Magnus, 18 -- were raised together by Mette-Marit and Haakon.</p>

<p>Unlike them, he has no official public role.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walking into court each day with her head held high, the ex-wife of a Frenchman on trial for orchestrating her mass rape in her own bed for almost a decade has become a feminist icon.</p>

<p>With her now trademark auburn bob and dark glasses, 71-year-old Gisele Pelicot has become a figurehead in the battle against the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Her life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilisers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him.</p>

<p>But she has decided not to hide and demanded the trial of Dominique Pelicot, 71, and 50 co-defendants since September 2 be open to the public because, as she has said through one of her lawyers, it should be up to her alleged abusers - not her - to be ashamed.</p>

<p>"It's a way of saying... shame must change sides," her attorney Stephane Babonneau said as the trial opened.</p>

<p>Since then, feminist activists have used her stylised portrait by Belgian artist Aline Dessine, daubed with the words "Shame is changing sides", to show support and call for protests.</p>

<p>The artist with 2.5 million followers on TikTok has given up all rights to the image.</p>

<h2><strong>'VERY BRAVE'</strong></h2>

<p>Outside the courtroom in the southern town of Avignon on Friday, protester Nadege Peneau said she was full of admiration for the trial's main plaintiff.</p>

<p>"What she's doing is very brave," she said.</p>

</div>

<p>"She's speaking up for so many children and women, and even men" who have been abused, she added.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot in August obtained a divorce from her husband, who has confessed to the abuse after meticulously documenting it with photos and videos.</p>

<p>She has moved away from the southern town of Mazan where, in her own words, for years he treated her like "a piece of meat" or a "rag doll".</p>

<p>She now uses her maiden name, but during the trial has asked the media to use her former name as a married woman.</p>

<p>Her lawyer Antoine Camus said she had transformed from a devoted wife and retiree, who loved walks and choir singing, into a woman in the seventies ready for a battle.</p>

</div>

<p>"I will have to fight till the end," she told the press on September 5, in her only public statement outside court in the first days of the four-month trial.</p>

<p>"Obviously it's not an easy exercise and I can feel attempts to trap me with certain questions," she added calmly.</p>

<h3><strong>'NOT IN VAIN'</strong></h3>

<p>The daughter of a member of the military, Gisele Pelicot was born on December 7, 1952 in Germany, returning to France with her family when she was five.</p>

<p>When she was only nine, her mother, aged just 35, died of cancer.</p>

<p>"In my head, I was already 15, I was already a little woman," she said, describing growing up "without much love".</p>

<p>Her older brother Michel died of a heart attack aged 43, before her 20th birthday.</p>

<p>She has said she was never one to publicly show emotions.</p>

<p>"In the family, we hide tears and we share laughter," one of her lawyers had reported her as saying.</p>

<p>She met Dominique Pelicot, her future husband and rapist, in 1971.</p>

<p>She had dreamt of becoming a hairdresser but instead studied to be a typist. After a few years temping, she joined France's national electricity company EDF, ending her career in a logistics service for its nuclear power plants.</p>

<p>At home, she looked after her three children, then seven grandchildren, and did a little gymnastics.</p>

<p>Only when the police caught her husband filming up women's skirts in a supermarket in 2020 did she find out the true reason behind her troubling memory lapses.</p>

<p>Camus, her lawyer, said his client "never wanted to be a role model".</p>

<p>"She just wants all this not to be in vain," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow and Kyiv swapped 103 prisoners of war each on Saturday in a deal brokered by the United Arab Emirates, a rare moment of coordination between the two warring sides as Russia pushes ahead in east Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Russians released in the swap were captured during Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, Moscow said, while some of the Ukrainians freed had been held prisoner since Moscow seized the Azovstal steel plant in May 2022.</p>

<p>"Another 103 soldiers were returned to Ukraine from Russian captivity," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Among the freed were 82 privates and sergeants as well as 21 officers, Zelensky said.</p>

<p>"The defenders of Kyiv, Donetsk, Mariupol and Azovstal, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and the Kharkiv regions," he added.</p>

<p>Russia confirmed it had "handed over" 103 Ukrainian army prisoners, and received 103 Russian servicemen captured by Kyiv in its Kursk offensive in return.</p>

<p>"At present, all Russian servicemen are on the territory of the Republic of Belarus, where they are being provided with the necessary psychological and medical assistance, as well as an opportunity to contact their relatives," the Russian defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Despite ongoing hostilities, Russia and Ukraine have managed to swap hundreds of prisoners throughout the two-and-half-year conflict -- often in deals brokered by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia or Turkey.</p>

<p>The announcement comes a day after Zelensky said 49 Ukrainian POWs had been returned from Russia, and three weeks ago both sides swapped 115 prisoners each in a deal also mediated by the UAE.</p>

<p>The UAE's foreign ministry hailed the deal as a "success" and thanked both sides for their cooperation on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>Russian advances</strong></p>

<p>The prisoner swap came as Russia pushed ahead in east Ukraine, where it claims to have captured a string of villages in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said in a daily briefing it had "liberated" the village of Zhelanne Pershe, less than 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the key Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for Moscow's army.</p>

<p>More than half of the city's 60,000 residents have fled since the invasion began in February 2022, with evacuations ramping up in recent weeks as Moscow's army closes in.</p>

<p>Ukraine had hoped its major cross-border incursion into the Kursk region last month would slow down Russia's advances in the east.</p>

<p>On Friday, Zelensky said Moscow had been slowed down somewhat but conceded the situation on the eastern front was "very difficult".</p>

<p>Russia meanwhile claimed this week to have clawed back a swath of territory in the Kursk region, as it mounted what appeared to be a counter-offensive.</p>

<p><strong>Missile spat</strong></p>

<p>Tensions between Russia and the West over the conflict reached dire levels this week over UK and US discussions about letting Ukraine use longer-range weapons to strike targets inside Russia.</p>

<p>The discussions came after a visit to Kyiv by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British counterpart David Lammy.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Thursday that green-lighting the use of the long-range weapons deep inside Russia would put the NATO military alliance "at war" with Moscow.</p>

<p>"This would in a significant way change the very nature of the conflict," Putin told a state television reporter.</p>

<p>"It would mean that NATO countries, the US, European countries, are at war with Russia," he added.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden on Friday delayed a decision on the move.</p>

<p>US officials believe the missiles would make a limited difference to Ukraine's campaign and also want to ensure that Washington's own stocks of the munitions are not depleted.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The study suggests that AI could play a significant role in combating misinformation, though questions remain about how AI achieves this and whether it would be embraced in real-world settings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have now found that artificial intelligence can alter conspiracy beliefs, challenging the long-held idea that those who embrace these ideas are very unlikely to change. A number of conspiracy theories include the assertion that moon landings were fabricated, and another reports that microchips have been placed in the Covid-19 vaccines. Such beliefs sometimes have a devastating consequence.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq1814">study</a>, headed by associate professor of American University Dr Thomas Costello, revealed that AI indeed effectively promotes critical thinking and disproves fact-based counterarguments. They conducted experiments involving 2,190 people who already subscribed to conspiracy theories using an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.debunkbot.com/conspiracies">AI system called "DebunkBot.".</a></p>

<p>Participants shared their conspiracy theory and evidence supporting it with the AI and then engaged in a three-round conversation. Afterward, they rated the truth of their beliefs on a 100-point scale. Those who discussed their conspiracy theory with the AI showed a 20% drop in belief, while the change was minimal for those discussing non-conspiracy topics.</p>

<p>"About one in four people who began the experiment believing a conspiracy theory came out the other end without that belief," said Dr Costello.</p>

<p>"In most cases, the AI can only chip away-making people a bit more sceptical and uncertain-but a select few were disabused of their conspiracy entirely."</p>

<p>Effects lasted at least two months and applied to almost all types of conspiracy theories, except for those based on factual information. One in four participants who initially believed in a conspiracy theory completely abandoned it by the end of the experiment.</p>

<p>This would suggest that AI may play a pivotal role in warding off the scourge of misinformation, especially on social media. However, Professor Sander van der Linden of the University of Cambridge and others posed questions over whether people would eagerly participate with AI in real-life situations and, quite frankly, how they really managed to win over participants with their methods, including empathy and affirmation. At any rate, this study has worthwhile lessons to impart upon us about the capacity of AI when it comes to countering conspiracy theories.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South America is being ravaged by fire from Brazil's Amazon rainforest through the world's largest wetlands to dry forests in Bolivia, breaking a previous record for the number of blazes seen in a year up to September 11.</p>

<p>Satellite data analyzed by Brazil's space research agency Inpe has registered 346,112 fire hotspots so far this year in all 13 countries of South America, topping the earlier 2007 record of 345,322 hotspots in a data series that goes back to 1998.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="A drone view shows a fire from burning vegetation in Amazon rainforest, in Apui, Amazonas state, Brazil." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/mkie7jrs_south-america-forest-fire-amazon-forest-fire-reuters_625x300_14_September_24.jpg" title="A drone view shows a fire from burning vegetation in Amazon rainforest, in Apui, Amazonas state, Brazil." /></div>

<p>A Reuters photographer traveling in the heart of Brazil's Amazon this week witnessed massive fires burning in vegetation along roadways, blackening the landscape and leaving trees like burned matchsticks.</p>

<p>Smoke billowing from the Brazilian fires has darkened the skies above cities like Sao Paulo, feeding into a corridor of wildfire smoke seen from space stretching diagonally across the continent from Colombia in the northwest to Uruguay in the southeast.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Smoke from a fire rises into the air in Amazon rainforest in the Apui, Amazonas state, Brazil.</p>
</div>

<p>Brazil and Bolivia have dispatched thousands of firefighters to attempt to control the blazes, but remain mostly at the mercy of extreme weather fueling the fires.</p>

<p>Scientists say that while most fires are set by humans, the recent hot and dry conditions being driven by climate change are helping the fires spread more quickly. South America has been hit by a series of heatwaves since last year.</p>

<p>"We never had winter," said Karla Longo, an air quality researcher at Inpe, of the weather in Sao Paulo in recent months. "It's absurd."</p>

<p>Despite still being winter in the Southern Hemisphere, high temperatures in Sao Paulo have held at over 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit) since Saturday.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">A tree burns during a fire rising in Amazon rainforest in Apui, Amazonas state, Brazil.</p>
</div>

<p>Hundreds of people marched in Bolivia's highland, political capital La Paz to demand action against the fires, holding banners and placards saying "Bolivia in flames" and "For cleaner air stop burning."</p>

<p>"Please realize what is really happening in the country, we have lost millions of hectares," said Fernanda Negron, an animal rights activist in the protest. "Millions of animals have been burned to death."</p>

<p>In Brazil, a drought that began last year has become the worst on record, according to national disaster monitoring agency Cemaden.</p>

<p>"In general, the 2023-2024 drought is the most intense, long-lasting in some regions and extensive in recent history, at least in the data since 1950," said Ana Paula Cunha, a drought researcher with Cemaden.</p>

<p>The greatest number of fires this month is in Brazil and Bolivia, followed by Peru, Argentina and Paraguay, according to Inpe data. Unusually intense fires that hit Venezuela, Guyana and Colombia earlier in the year contributed to the record but have largely subsided.</p>

<p>Fire from deforestation in the Amazon create particularly intense smoke because of the density of the vegetation burning, Longo said.</p>

<p>"The sensation you get flying next to one of these plumes is like that of an atomic mushroom cloud," said Longo of Inpe.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Drone view shows smoke rising from a forest fire in the Amazon in the Trans-Amazonian Highway BR230 in Brazil." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/8isvlvgk_south-america-forest-fire-amazon-forest-fire-reuters_625x300_14_September_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Drone view shows smoke rising from a forest fire in the Amazon in the Trans-Amazonian Highway BR230 in Brazil." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Drone view shows smoke rising from a forest fire in the Amazon in the Trans-Amazonian Highway BR230 in Brazil.</p>
</div>

<p>Roughly 9 million sq km (3.5 million sq miles) of South America have been covered in smoke at times, more than half of the continent, she said.</p>

<p>Sao Paulo, the most populous city in the Western Hemisphere, earlier this week had the worst air quality globally, higher than famous pollution hotspots like China and India, according to website IQAir.com. Bolivia's capital of La Paz was similarly blanketed in smoke.</p>

<p>Exposure to the smoke will drive up the number of people seeking hospital treatment for respiratory issues and may cause thousands of premature deaths, Longo said.</p>

<p>Inhaling wildfire smoke contributes to an average 12,000 early deaths a year in South America, according to a 2023 study in the academic journal Environmental Research: Health.</p>

<p>September is typically the peak month for fires in South America. It's unclear whether the continent will continue to have high numbers of fires this year.</p>

<p>While rain is forecast next week for Brazil's center south, where Sao Paulo is located, drought conditions are expected to continue through October in Brazil's northern Amazon region and center-west agricultural region.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada is in discussions about joining an expanded AUKUS deal between the US, Britain, and Australia formed to counter China's growing military influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Canadian Defence Minister Bill Blair said.</p>

<p>Canada has said it wants to join a second pillar of AUKUS that will collaborate on new military technologies, including artificial intelligence and quantum computing, but has not so far revealed any details of those talks.</p>

<p>The military alliance AUKUS stands for Australia, United Kingdom, United States.</p>

<p>"There have been important discussions about processes and platforms on a project-specific basis on where other nations, including Japan and ourselves, might participate," Blair said in an interview in Tokyo where he met his Japanese counterpart Minoru Kihara.</p>

<p>"I would respectfully wait until they've come to their determination, but I'm very optimistic," he said.</p>

<p>Blair said he and Kihara discussed AUKUS, which is already considering working with Japan. The initial phase of AUKUS involves the three founding members working on nuclear submarine technology for Australia.</p>

<p>Blair, who was on his first trip to Japan as defence minister, arrived in Tokyo from South Korea, which is also in talks about a role in AUKUS.</p>

<p>Canada is looking for a bigger security role in Asia and has made forging deeper ties with Japan and South Korea a priority. As its defence commitments expand at home and overseas the country is expanding military spending.</p>

<p>"Next year, my defence budget will rise by 27% over this year, and, frankly, in the next three or four years, our defence spending will triple," Blair said.</p>

<p>He and Kihara also discussed Chinese incursions into Japanese territory that last month prompted Tokyo to lodge protests with Beijing.</p>

<p>Concerns about that Chinese military activity may be discussed at a meeting of the Group of Seven defence ministers in Italy next month, Blair said.</p>

<p>"It's an important opportunity for us to have a conversation among the G7 partners about some of the activities that are deeply concerning to Japan and to Canada and to the United States and others," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global pop sensation Taylor Swift's support for Kamala Harris may have boosted the Democratic vice president's hopes of attracting young voters, but the question remains: Will the celebrity endorsement make a difference on Election Day?</p>

<p>Locked in a tight White House race, both Kamala Harris and her rival, Republican former President Donald Trump are doing all they can to lure voters on Election Day Nov. 5 and in early voting starting next week.</p>

<p>For his part, Trump dismissed Swift's Tuesday night endorsement of Harris, saying he was "not a Taylor fan."</p>

<p>With voter registrations down among young people in a country where 18 is the voting age, the first challenge for either campaign may be getting them to register to vote at all.</p>

<p>Young voters played a decisive role in Democratic President Joe Biden's victory over the then-incumbent Trump in 2020. Biden captured about 61% of the vote to Trump's 36% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29, according to data from Tufts University.</p>

<p>A July 2024 analysis by Tufts University's youth civic engagement group, CIRCLE, found that voter registrations have dropped significantly since then in 36 states among those aged 18-29. Harris launched her campaign on July 21 after Biden withdrew.</p>

<p>"Registering youths remains a major task in the months ahead," the analysis said.</p>

<p>Enter Swift, an artist so successful she tied hip-hop star Beyonce's record of 30 lifetime awards at the MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday night. A 2023 Morning Consult poll found that 55% of self-described Swift fans were Democrats and 45% were millennials aged 28 to 43.</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Swift wrote on Tuesday to her 284 million Instagram followers, urging them to register to vote and make their own choice.</p>

<p>Her post drew 10.4 million "likes." The vote.gov website received 405,999 visitors in the 24 hours after Swift shared a custom URL with followers, a U.S. government spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Harris aides say they would love for Swift to actively campaign, such as by appearing at a rally in her native Pennsylvania, a battleground state that could well decide the election.</p>

<p>But the campaign itself was not involved in Swift's decision to back Harris.</p>

<p>The vice president's aides said they learned of Swift's support only when the entertainer, 34, posted it on Instagram minutes after the vice president stepped off the debate stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night.</p>

<h2><strong>A QUESTION OF INFLUENCE</strong></h2>

<p>What difference does a celebrity endorsement make?</p>

<p>A 2008 Northwestern University report found Oprah Winfrey's endorsement added a million votes to Barack Obama's tally.</p>

<p>But a 2010 North Carolina State University report found celebrity endorsements by George Clooney and Angelina Jolie did little to move the political needle.</p>

<p>Margaretha Bentley, a professor at Arizona State University whose class studies Swift's social importance, is unsure whether the pop singer will have an impact. She asked her students earlier this year whether a Swift endorsement would matter.</p>

<p>Some said they would follow Swift's lead and others said it would prompt them to do more research. "Some students told me they listen to celebrities when it comes to, like, what coffee they would drink, not politics," Bentley said.</p>

<p>A Swift fan at the VMA awards on Wednesday, Morgan Paris, said: "It's good that she said what she feels. And I mean, I feel like her politics and her music are two separate things, so you can't really combine them."</p>

<p>Ashley Spillane wrote in a study published last month by Harvard's Kennedy School that non-profits found "higher rates of online voter registration or poll worker sign-ups when a celebrity promotes these calls to action."</p>

<p>"While some polling shows that people claim they aren't influenced by celebrity voices when it comes to politics, more rigorous evidence indicates that these voices are incredibly powerful," Spillane said.</p>

<h3><strong>SWIFT ACTION ON BEHALF OF HARRIS</strong></h3>

<p>The Harris campaign and their supporters are building on the endorsement, announcing pre-orders for its latest campaign wear: Swift fan-inspired friendship bracelets.</p>

<p>The progressive group MoveOn.org is selling Swift T-shirts that play on Swift's ongoing Eras concert tour. The shirt, reading "In My Voting Era," is the fastest selling item the group has sold this year, spokesperson Britt Jacovich said.</p>

<p>Voters of Tomorrow, which seeks to boost the youth vote, is teaming up with the informal group "Swifties for Harris" on a phone bank on Saturday to target college students in Georgia and Wisconsin, both battleground states like Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Swift "is one of the most influential people of our generation, and we're definitely excited to see how we can take her message and turn that into more political action and get more people involved," said Jessica Siles, a spokesperson for Voters of Tomorrow.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earth's moon will soon have a temporary junior companion, an apparent mini moon revolving around our planet for about two months. In a rare event, an asteroid will be captured by Earth's gravity and will orbit the earth from September 29 to November 25 this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The asteroid 2024 PT5 was spotted on August 7 using the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded asteroid impact early warning system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report published in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad781f">Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</a>, the asteroid is not too big with a diameter of just 10 metre (33 feet). During its 53-day tenure around the earth, 2024 PT5 will not be able to make a full orbit, instead it will perform a horseshoe loop before breaking away from the earth's gravitational pull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RNAAS report, authored by Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos, says that Earth has a tendency to capture asteroids and pull them into its orbit. These asteroids sometimes perform one or more full revolutions around our planet while other times, they break away from the earth's elliptical path before completing an orbit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2006, an asteroid captured by Earth's gravity revolved around it for a year from July 2006 to July 2007. However, the newly discovered 2024 PT5 seems to resemble the path of 2022 NX1, a temporary flyby that revolved around Earth in 1981 and 2022 without ever completing an orbit and will likely return to take another semi round in 2051.</p>

<p>While Earth may sometimes pull space junk into its orbit, the report says that 2024 PT5 is a natural object as "its short-term dynamical evolution closely resembles that of 2022 NX1, a confirmed natural object." The report also indicates that its orbital properties resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris will join celebrity Oprah Winfrey in a livestream event next week to rally support in key battleground states in the Nov. 5 presidential election, Harris' campaign said.</p>

<p>The "Unite for America" event will be in collaboration with Win With Black Women volunteer network, and will gather more than 140 grassroots groups to support Harris, the Democratic nominee, virtually on Thursday. Harris faces former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in the election.</p>

<p>"What is essential to me is getting people motivated to vote - and that's my intention in hosting this event," Winfrey said in a statement. "My goal is to get people excited about the privilege and power of the vote."</p>

<p>Winfrey was the host of the long-running "The Oprah Winfrey Show," as well as a businesswoman and philanthropist.</p>

<p>The event, which will stream at 8 pm EDT (05:30 am IST) across online platforms including YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitch, will feature representatives from dozens of groups that have organized over Zoom since the Harris campaign launched in July, including Latinas for Harris, White Dudes for Harris, Win With Black Men and Republicans for Harris.</p>

<p>Winfrey spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, to press the case for Harris.</p>

<p>"I'm calling on all you independents and all you undecided," Winfrey said then, describing herself as an independent voter. "Decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024."</p>

<p>Harris will also participate in an interview with the ABC News affiliate in Philadelphia that will air later on Friday, her campaign said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Athos Salome, known as the 'Living Nostradamus,' has claimed that four of his forecasts have become reality in 2024, including a looming asteroid threat, according to <em>The Daily Star.</em> This 36-year-old Brazilian parapsychologist has been celebrated for accurate predictions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, Elon Musk buying Twitter (now X), and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>The latest warning by Salome coincides with the recent confirmation by NASA over the asteroid now dubbed 'God of Chaos.' According to the Near-Earth Object Observations Programme, the gigantic asteroid that Salome had predicted would be a concern in July is expected to come close to Earth this Sunday. As Salome's past predictions start to materialise, his reputation as a psychic grows, leading to a whole Pandora's box of questions about the validity and consequences of his predictions.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/meet-athos-salome-living-nostradamus-and-social-media-sensation-15710"><strong>Also Read | Meet Athos Salome, 'Living Nostradamus' And Social Media Sensation&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>Speaking to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star,</em></a> the Brazilian seer insists he isn't seeking praise or "unnecessary personal accolades," he just wants public validation of his realised visions.</p>

<p>Athos admitted: "I have noticed that, on several occasions, my predictions are appropriated by other individuals (not clairvoyants or paranormal experts) who present themselves as the originators of these ideas."</p>

<p>"On 28 July this year, I posted a video in my Instagram stories again about the asteroid, predicting that NASA would make an announcement in September, confirming that the asteroid would enter a collision course with Earth by November. My predictions are not coincidences. They are grounded and come true," he told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star.</em></a></p>

<p>Low and behold NASA has confirmed its Near-Earth Object Observations Program has been monitoring a huge asteroid dubbed 'God of Chaos'. It's expected to brush past us at a mere 620,000 miles away on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>The beginning of World War 3</strong></p>

<p>Athos Salome has warned that World War 3 won't start in Ukraine or Gaza but will start in the disputed waters of the South China Sea through "some surprise event or a catastrophic cyber attack," as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star report.</em></a></p>

<p>Talking about the natural disasters, Athos told the news portal: "In September of 2024 real events supported these expectations with typhoon Yagi, which affected and brought a large amount of damages to these parts of the world.</p>

<p>"The typhoon had winds in excess of 93 mph causing devastating floods and landslides with casualties and major destruction of structures. I said that more and worse cases of the event would occur, and going by the observed natural disasters this year, I was right.</p>

<p>"The increase of these events deepens the discussion on climate change and the poor readiness of countries for the consequences of climate change."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing's first strike in 16 years could further compound global shortages of jetliners that have been pushing up airfares and forcing airlines to keep older jets flying longer, industry executives and analysts said.</p>

<p>The US planemaker's West Coast workers went on strike at midnight on Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract deal, halting production of Boeing's workhorse 737 MAX.</p>

<p>It is Boeing's first strike since 2008, and Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West warned a prolonged walkout could hurt output and "jeopardize our recovery".</p>

<p>"Boeing is a systemically important company for global aviation," Ross O'Connor, chief financial officer of Irish leasing company Avolon, told Reuters on Friday.</p>

<p>A strike "could have an impact on production levels, which could exacerbate some of the supply shortages that are in the market at the moment for sure," he said after Avolon announced it had acquired a large portfolio of jets from Castlelake.</p>

<p>Airlines have struggled to expand capacity to meet rising demand as supplies of jetliners are curtailed by parts shortages, industry-wide recruitment problems and overloaded maintenance shops.</p>

<p>Analysts have been warning the most promising part of the industry's all-important business cycle could run out before airlines have a chance to enjoy the full benefits of demand.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a significant amount of time before we see that balance. I'm starting to evolve the hypothesis that it won't be (extra) supply that corrects it, but instead a softening of demand," said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Cirium Ascend.</p>

<p>Some say high air fares - although good for airlines in the short term - could themselves accelerate that tipping point.</p>

<p>"My view is that (average fares) will rise; and when ticket prices go up, then all other things being equal, you have lower traffic levels," said aviation economist Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at AVITAS consultancy.</p>

<p>As Boeing halts production of its most-sold jet, European rival Airbus is also struggling to meet its goals.</p>

<p>Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury expressed optimism at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference this week that the European planemaker would meet a recently lowered target of 770 deliveries this year, following a profit warning and engine supply glitch in the summer.</p>

<p>But following a short-lived spike in deliveries in July, industry sources questioned how comfortably the world's largest planemaker would exceed last year's 735.</p>

<p>Dwindling numbers of planes in storage and record-high utilization of existing planes confirm the supply squeeze.</p>

<p><strong>FLEET AGE RISING</strong></p>

<p>For now, Boeing's lower production levels compared to Airbus may limit the incremental effect of the strike. Yet analysts said airlines have little room to maneuver.</p>

<p>With leasing companies also running out of available capacity, carriers need to keep existing jets flying longer.</p>

<p>For most of the past 15 years, the average age of the fleet declined as airlines and leasing companies took advantage of low interest rates to invest in new fuel-saving jets.</p>

<p>In 2010, the average age of the widely flown single-aisle jet fleet was about 10.2 years, according to Cirium data.</p>

<p>After dipping to 9.1 years during the pandemic as airlines grounded fleets, the age started growing again. It now stands at 11.3 years "and still heading upwards," Morris said.</p>

<p>That is despite efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050, which rely partly on modernizing the planes in service.</p>

<p>"It must mean that we're burning more CO2 than we should be because we're using more old aircraft...so one of the things that can go wrong is sustainability," Morris said.</p>

<p>The airline industry says it is confident of reaching a target of net zero emissions by 2050.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have developed a novel computer algorithm that can predict various diseases like diabetes or stroke, just by analysing the colour of the human tongue with 98 per cent accuracy.</p>

<p>The imaging system developed by Middle Technical University (MTU) and the University of South Australia (UniSA) in Australia can diagnose conditions such as diabetes, stroke, anaemia, asthma, liver and gallbladder issues, Covid-19, and other vascular and gastrointestinal diseases.</p>

<p>"The colour, shape, and thickness of the tongue can reveal a litany of health conditions," said Ali Al-Naji, adjunct Associate Professor at MTU and UniSA.</p>

<p>"Typically, people with diabetes have a yellow tongue; cancer patients a purple tongue with a thick greasy coating; and acute stroke patients present with an unusually shaped red tongue," he added.</p>

<p>The breakthrough was achieved through a series of experiments using 5,260 images to train machine-learning algorithms to detect tongue colour.</p>

<p>Researchers received 60 tongue images from two teaching hospitals in the Middle East, representing patients with diverse health conditions. The AI model matched tongue colour with the correct disease in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>The paper published in Technologies describes how the system analyses tongue colour to provide real-time diagnoses, demonstrating that AI can advance medical practices significantly.</p>

<p>Al-Naji explained that AI is replicating a 2,000-year-old technique from traditional Chinese medicine, where the tongue's colour, shape, and thickness are used to diagnose health issues.</p>

<p>For example, people with diabetes typically have a yellow tongue, while cancer patients show a purple tongue with a thick greasy coating. Stroke patients often present with an unusually shaped red tongue. A white tongue can indicate anaemia, severe Covid-19 cases are associated with a deep red tongue, and an indigo or violet tongue suggests vascular or gastrointestinal problems or asthma.</p>

<p>The study used cameras placed 20 centimetres from a patient to capture tongue colour, and the imaging system predicted health conditions in real time.</p>

<p>Co-author UniSA Professor Javaan Chahl noted that this technology could eventually be adapted for use with smartphones, making disease screening more accessible.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Water is considered essential for life, and geological studies show the planet's surface had lakes, rivers and oceans more than 3 billion years ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A study released Monday using data from NASA's Mars InSight lander shows evidence of liquid water far below the surface of the fourth planet, advancing the search for life there and showing what might have happened to Mars' ancient oceans.</p>

<p>The lander, which has been on the Red Planet since 2018, measured seismic data over four years, examining how quakes shook the ground and determining what materials or substances were beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Based on that data, the researchers found liquid water was most likely present deep beneath the lander. Water is considered essential for life, and geological studies show the planet's surface had lakes, rivers and oceans more than 3 billion years ago.</p>

<p>"On Earth what we know is where it is wet enough and there are enough sources of energy, there is microbial life very deep in Earth's subsurface," said one of the authors, Vashan Wright of the University of California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. "The ingredients for life as we know it exist in the Martian subsurface if these interpretations are correct."</p>

<p>The study found that large reservoirs of liquid water in fractures 11.5 kilometres (7.15 miles) to 20km beneath the surface best explained the InSight measurements.</p>

<p>It notes that the volume of liquid water predicted beneath the surface is "more than the water volumes proposed to have filled hypothesised ancient Martian oceans".</p>

<p>"On Earth, groundwater infiltrated from the surface" to deep underground, Wright said. "We expect this process to have occurred on Mars as well when the upper crust was warmer than it is today."</p>

<p>There is no way to directly study water that deep beneath the surface of Mars, but the authors said the results "have implications for understanding Mars' water cycle, determining the fates of past surface water, searching for past or extant life, and assessing in situ resource utilization for future missions".</p>

<p>The study, whose other authors are Matthias Morzfeld of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Michael Manga of the University of California Berkeley, was published the week of Aug. 12 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>"I'm inspired and I hope the public is also inspired," Wright said. "Humans can work together to put instruments on a planet... and try to understand what's going on there."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Cornell University student was sentenced to 21 months in prison on Monday for threatening Jewish classmates.</p>

<p>Patrick Dai, who was suspended by the Ivy League school in Ithaca, New York, posted the threats anonymously on an online campus bulletin board three weeks after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Dai pleaded guilty to one felony count of making threats and was sentenced to 21 months in prison and three years of supervised release by District Judge Brenda Sannes in Syracuse, New York.</p>

<p>"The defendant terrorized a campus community for days and horrified the nation at a very volatile time," prosecutors said in their sentencing memo.</p>

<p>Lisa Peebles, Dai's lawyer, told the court her 22-year-old client is "autistic" and is actually "pro-Israel."</p>

<p>"In a misguided attempt to highlight Hamas's genocidal beliefs and garner support for Israel," Peebles said, he "made several posts on a campus-related website in the guise of an anti-Semite Hamas extremist.</p>

<p>"He believed, wrongly, that the posts would prompt a 'blowback' against what he perceived as anti-Israel media coverage and pro-Hamas sentiment on campus," she said.</p>

<p>According to the Justice Department, Dai said he was "gonna shoot up 104 west," a dining hall that mostly caters to Jewish students, and "stab" and "slit the throat" of any Jewish males he saw on campus.</p>

<p>Cornell canceled classes for a day in November following the threats.</p>

<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland highlighted the case at the time of Dai's arrest as part of "a significant increase in the volume and frequency of threats against Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities across our country."</p>

<p>Colleges across the United States were rocked for months by protests over Israel's war in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The armed wing of Palestinian group Hamas said Monday its operatives had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, "in two separate incidents" in Gaza.</p>

<p>Palestinian operatives seized 251 hostages during their October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, with 111 of them still held in Gaza including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement: "In two separate incidents, two recruits assigned to guard enemy prisoners fired at a Zionist prisoner, killing him immediately, and also injured two female prisoners critically".</p>

<p>The statement, posted on Telegram, did not identify the hostages or say when or where the incidents occurred, but noted "attempts are being made to save the lives" of the two women.</p>

<p>Abu Obeida said Hamas had formed a committee to investigate the shootings.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement that it does "not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas claims".</p>

<p>"We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message", the statement added.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a televised briefing earlier on Monday, said: "We do not forget for a moment the hostages being cruelly held by Hamas in Gaza".</p>

<p>"We are deeply concerned about their physical and mental condition, given the prolonged time that has passed and the harsh conditions of their captivity."</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip since then has killed at least 39,897 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant exchanged criticism on Monday over stalled talks for a ceasefire deal that would free hostages held in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The reason a hostage deal is stalling is in part because of Israel", Israeli media, including television channel Kan, reported Gallant saying in a private briefing for a parliamentary committee on Monday.</p>

<p>Gallant was discussing the choice Israel faced between a ceasefire deal that could end the conflicts in the north with Lebanese Hezbollah and in Gaza, and escalating the war, Kan reported.</p>

<p>"I and the defence establishment support the first option," he said, rather than talk of "'total victory' and all that nonsense", a phrase frequently used by Netanyahu in his communications.</p>

<p>Within hours of Gallant's words leaking to the media, Netanyahu hit back in a statement issued by his office, in which he accused Gallant of jeopardising a deal to secure the release of hostages.</p>

<p>"When Gallant adopts the anti-Israel narrative, he harms the chances of reaching a hostage release deal," Netanyahu said, adding that Hamas supremo Yahya Sinwar is the one "who has been and remains the only obstacle to a hostage deal."</p>

<p>He concluded by saying that Israel's only choice was "to achieve total victory", which "obligates everyone - including Gallant".</p>

<p>Gallant defended himself in a post on X stating that during the briefing he had "emphasised that (he is) determined to meet the goals of the war and continue the fighting".</p>

<p>He also blasted what he called "incessant leaks" since the beginning of the war, including the one on Monday.</p>

<p>Hamas commented on the row between the two politicians, with one of its leaders, Izzat al-Rishq saying in a statement that "Gallant's admission (...) confirms what we have always said."</p>

<p>"Netanyahu is lying to the world and to hostage families, he doesn't care about the hostages' lives and doesn't want to reach an agreement", he added.</p>

<p>Hamas officials, some analysts and critics in Israel have said Netanyahu has sought to prolong the fighting for political gain.</p>

<p>In late July, Israeli media reported that Gallant was criticising the lack of a deal to guarantee the return of the hostages held in Gaza since Hamas's unprecedented attack on October 7.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Islamist movement's attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has since then killed at least 39,897 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salvatore Strazzullo, the New York City lawyer notorious for his colourful client roster and personal scandals, was found dead in his car outside his parents' Brooklyn home on Saturday. He was 52. The circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear, with his cause of death not yet determined, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/12/us-news/sal-strazzullo-found-dead-night-life-lawyer-repped-strippers-celebs/ ">NY Post</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Night-Life Lawyer'</strong></p>

<p>Strazzullo, who earned the nickname "Night-Life Lawyer" given his penchant for taking on cases involving celebrities and embarrassing circumstances, was facing multiple ongoing criminal cases for allegedly exploiting elderly clients out of millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Famous Clientele&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, Strazzullo defended rapper Foxy Brown in a case where she was accused of flashing a neighbour she had been feuding with. Strazzullo was prepared to invoke "the underwear defence" if the case went to trial, arguing that his client had simply not worn underwear that day. The case, however, ended up getting dismissed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In another case, Strazzullo represented Milana Dravnel, an exotic dancer who sued Oscar de la Hoya for $100 million in 2007. The case involved racy photos of the boxing legend in his underwear, which Ms Dravnel sold to a West Coast photo agency for $70,000. Mr De la Hoya's team claimed the photos were doctored.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Scandals</strong></p>

<p>The infamous lawyer faced numerous legal troubles, including allegations of sexual harassment and criminal charges for theft and fraud, throughout his career.</p>

<p>In 2011, Desiree DeMartino, a former paralegal and employee, pressed charges against Strazzullo for sexual harassment in Brooklyn Federal Court. The suit alleged that Strazzullo trapped Ms DeMartino in a conference room, pleasured himself in front of her, and committed other inappropriate acts, including forcibly kissing her and touching her breasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More recently, Strazzullo faced criminal charges for theft and fraud, accused of misusing his escrow account to fund a lavish lifestyle. In April, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez alleged that Strazzullo operated a Ponzi scheme, using funds from one client to pay off another while accumulating tens of thousands of dollars in charges at upscale restaurants and hotels. Prosecutors also alleged he spent the stolen funds on luxuries like a $100,000 BMW and a $13,000-per-month apartment.</p>

<p>Strazzullo pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of grand larceny and scheme to defraud, but the evidence against him was substantial. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez condemned Strazzullo's actions, stating he stole the "nest eggs" of senior citizens who trusted him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of his death, two criminal cases, including another alleged theft of $1.5 million from three clients, against Strazzullo were still pending.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump today spent nearly an hour discussing the recent assassination attempt, something he had promised never to talk about again. Trump and Musk discussed at length how a bullet narrowly missed the former US President during a rally at Pennsylvania's Butler.</p>

<p>At the Republican national convention last month, Trump had told the crowd about the close call and what he went through - but said he would do so only that one time. During the speech, his first following the assassination attempt, he promised never to narrate the ordeal.</p>

<p>But Trump went back on his word during the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-live-updates-x-owner-to-interview-republican-2024-us-elections-presidential-candidate-6324927">conversation with Musk</a>, saying "It was a miracle. If I hadn't turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now, as much as I like you."</p>

<p>"It was a hard hit. It was very, I guess you would say, surreal, but it wasn't surreal. You know, I was telling somebody, you have instances like this... where you feel it's a surreal situation. And I never felt that way. I knew immediately that it was a bullet," Trump said before elaborating the entire incident.</p>

<p>The start of the much-awaited interview though was delayed due to techinical glitches, which Musk claimed were caused due to a targeted cyber attack on the platform.</p>

<p>The glitches prevented people from listening to the event and led to widespread frustration among users. Many were met with error messages and resulted in 'crashed' and 'unable to fetch spaces' being the top trending hashtags on X.</p>

<p>The conversation was intended to help reinvigorate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-interviews-donald-trump-on-x-6323844">Donald Trump's</a> stuttering campaign, which has flagged since Biden dropped out of the race, to be replaced by a surging Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Earth was hit Monday by an intense solar storm that could bring the northern lights to night skies further south than normal, a US agency announced.</p>

<p>Conditions of a level-four geomagnetic storm -- on a scale of five -- were observed Monday from 1500 GMT, according to a specialized center at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>

<p>These conditions may persist for several hours, but were not expected to increase further in intensity, NOAA added in a statement.</p>

<p>"A severe geomagnetic storm includes the potential for aurora to be seen faintly as far south as Alabama and northern California," NOAA said in a statement, referring to US states.</p>

<p>The new solar storm is caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are explosions of particles leaving the Sun. When these particles arrive on Earth, they disrupt its magnetic field.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of auroras now... If it lasts until nightfall here, we might be able to see some," Eric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Cote d'Azur Observatory in France, said on X.</p>

<p>On Sunday, NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick published on X a superb photo of the aurora borealis -- or Northern Lights -- taken from the International Space Station, where he is currently stationed.</p>

<p>But solar or geomagnetic storms can also trigger undesirable effects.</p>

<p>For example, they can degrade high-frequency communications, disrupt satellites, and cause overloads on the electricity grid. Operators of sensitive infrastructure have been notified to put in place measures to limit these effects, NOAA said.</p>

<p>In May, the planet went through the most powerful geomagnetic storms recorded in 20 years. They caused auroras to light up the night sky in the United States, Europe, and Australia, at much lower latitudes than usual.</p>

<p>This type of event has increased recently because the Sun is currently close to its peak activity, as per its 11-year cycle.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump said that the country "will go out of business," if Kamala Harris wins US elections 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States President Donald Trump was interviewed by billionaire Elon Musk on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) today. The interview had a rocky start and was delayed by 40 minutes after the Tesla Chief announced that there was a cyber attack on his social media platform. The two businessmen discussed a variety of topics ahead of US polls including immigration, layoffs, the assassination attempt on Mr Trump and climate change. Amid this, Mr Musk has now invited US Vice President Kamala Harris for a chat on X Spaces.</p>

<p>He took to the microblogging platform and wrote, "Happy to host Kamala on an X Spaces too."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Happy to host Kamala on an ? Spaces too</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1823217769229566251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Since being shared, his post has amassed a variety of reactions online.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign reacted to the post with a folded hands emoji.</p>

<p>A person joked, "Same chance of her agreeing to come on as me meeting Abraham Lincoln tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"It would be really smart of her to do this. Significantly simpler logistics than doing a rally, with a far larger potential impact. I'm sure you'd be a fair interviewer," said a person.</p>

<p>A user stated, "Free Speech! @VP should 100% do this. The American people deserve to hear your thoughts on the issues!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Republican candidate slammed Ms Harris and said, "The number of illegals Kamala (Harris) has welcomed into our communities is much bigger than we think." He told Elon Musk, "Countries are emptying their prisons - and sending them to our country. They're bringing crime and violence to our backyards," he said.</p>

<p>In a separate comment, he also said that the country "will go out of business," if she wins US elections 2024. "We don't have a president right now - and Kamala is even worse. She's a San Francisco liberal who destroyed that city, destroyed California, and will destroy our country if she's elected," Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the same, Ms Harris' presidential campaign<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1823194536983556377"> issued a statement on X</a>. They said, "Donald Trump's extremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda is a feature not a glitch of his campaign, which was on full display for those unlucky enough to listen in tonight during whatever that was on X.com."</p>

<p>They added, "Trump's entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself - self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"If I hadn't turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now," former US President Donald Trump told billionaire Elon Musk today, recalling last month's assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Republican presidential nominee spoke with Musk on the microblogging site, X, where he also discussed the 2024 US presidential elections, his Democratic counterpart Kamala Harris, and climate change.</p>

<p>The live stream, delayed by more than 40 minutes due to a DDOS attack and technical issues, drew in over 1.3 million users.</p>

<div>Here are the top quotes from the interview:</div>

<h2><strong>On Assassination Attempt</strong></h2>

<p>On July 13, Trump was shot at in Butler, Pennsylvania, while he was addressing a rally. Twenty-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight shots from a nearby rooftop, hitting Trump in the upper right ear, killing one and injuring three others. The suspect was killed by a Secret Service sniper.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"It was a hard hit. It was very, I guess you would say, surreal, but it wasn't surreal. You know, I was telling somebody, you have instances like this... where you feel it's a surreal situation. And I never felt that way," Trump said of the moment the bullet hit his ear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that it was a bullet. I knew immediately that it was at the ear... For those people that don't believe in God, I think we all have to start thinking about that," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>On Kamala Harris</strong></h2>

<p>Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, criticising her justice system, energy policies, and stance on immigration.</p>

<p>On her justice system, Trump stated, "They set a very bad precedent -- NEVER happened before in this country. It DOES happen in banana republics and Third-World countries."</p>

<p>He added, "We don't have a president right now -- and Kamala is even worse. She's a San Francisco liberal who destroyed that city, destroyed California, and will DESTROY OUR COUNTRY if she's elected."</p>

<p>Regarding energy costs, Trump promised to take action, saying, "The cost of energy HAS TO COME DOWN. We're going to drill, baby, drill."</p>

<p>He warned that if Kamala Harris wins the presidency, "this country will go out of business."</p>

<p>On immigration, Trump stated, "We have millions of people coming in a month and then [Kamala] gets up and tries to pretend she's gonna do something. She had 3.5 years, and they have another 5 months but they won't do anything," adding the Vice President was "incompetent."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>On Iran And Israel</strong></h2>

<p>The former President talked about his past policies on Iran, claiming his administration's measures effectively curtailed Tehran's ability to fund terrorism. He stated, "When I was president, Iran knew not to mess around. Iran was broke -- they had no money for terror." Trump also asserted if he were President, "Israel never would've been attacked."</p>

<p>Donald Trump also announced plans to build an Iron Dome defence system, citing Israel's successful implementation of the technology. "We're going to build an Iron Dome. Israel has it. We're going to have the best Iron Dome in the world. We need it and we're going to make it all in the United States. We're going to have protection," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2><strong>On Global Warming</strong></h2>

<p>Donald Trump expressed his skepticism about climate change, downplaying its significance as a global threat. He stated, "The biggest threat is NOT global warming. The biggest threat is nuclear warming."</p>

<p>He again criticised the current government, saying, "We have some really bad people in the government. We have a modern-day Axis of Evil." "If you have a smart president, we don't have to worry," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump was banned from Twitter (now X) after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. On February 21, 2022, he launched his own social media platform, Truth Social.</p>

<p>Months later, in November 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter and restored Trump's account, @realDonaldTrump.</p>

<p>Last month, the Tesla CEO also endorsed Trump shortly after the former president survived the attempt on his life.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden Administration looks forward to expanding its "critical and critically important" partnership with India and creating a more prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific, the White House has said.</p>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre made the remarks on Monday while responding to questions on the priorities of US President Joe Biden in the remaining six months of his administration.</p>

<p>“We look forward to continuing to expand our critical and critically important partnership and how it's going to benefit the American people," she said while addressing her daily news conference.</p>

<p>"We want to create a more prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and the world. That is going to continue to be our focus as we move forward,” she said.</p>

<p>“The president (Joe Biden) views our relationship -- the United States' relationship with India -- as one of the most consequential in the world. We work closely with India on our most vital priorities, including through the Quad and the US-India initiative on -- Critical and Emerging Technology,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, India's Ambassador-designate to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, arrived in the American Capital.</p>

<p>Kwatra, who previously served as Minister of Commerce in the Indian Embassy here, is expected to present his credentials to President Biden shortly.</p>

<p>The top Indian diplomat, who is well known in the US diplomatic circles, arrives in the US in the middle of an intense presidential election campaign, fast-moving developments in Bangladesh and two wars in which the US is currently engaged.</p>

<p>Over the next 90 days, India and the US are expected to have some high-level diplomatic engagements, including visits of cabinet-level officials on either side.</p>

<p>The overall ties between India and the US have witnessed a major upswing following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic state visit to Washington in June last year, followed by Biden's trip to India last September for the G20 summit.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finally got underway on Musk's social media platform X on Monday evening.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finally got underway on Musk's social media platform X on Monday evening, following a lengthy delay caused by technical problems that kept many users from accessing the live stream.</p>

<p>Musk, who has endorsed Trump, began the event at 8:42 p.m. (0042 GMT Tuesday), more than 40 minutes after the scheduled start time. He blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was not confirmed.</p>

<p>More than 1.3 million people were listening about 45 minutes into the conversation, according to a counter on X.</p>

<p>Trump sought to turn the problems into a positive, congratulating Musk on the number of people trying to tune in.</p>

<p>The former president sounded at times as if he had a lisp, many listeners on X pointed out. Some said it made him sound like a cartoon character, others suggested it could be due to audio compression issues.</p>

<p>The technical issues recalled a similar event on X in May 2023, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the platform.</p>

<p>At the time, Trump mocked DeSantis on his own, social media platform, Truth Social. "My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!)" Trump posted, "Yours does not."</p>

<p>Ahead of Monday's event, Musk had written: "Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight &amp; tomorrow in advance of the conversation." X did not respond to requests for details or evidence of the alleged cyberattack.</p>

<p>Musk spent much of the early part of the interview lauding Trump for his bravery during the attempt on his life on July 13, when his ear was struck by a bullet.</p>

<p>Musk, the world's richest person, announced his support for Trump shortly after the shooting. He backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since.</p>

<p>Trump said he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the attack, for a rally in October.</p>

<p>As the conversation unfolded, Trump delivered his usual mix of grievances, exaggerated claims and personal attacks, with Musk offering occasional encouragement.</p>

<p>Trump claimed without evidence that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - all authoritarian strongmen - as at the "top of their game."</p>

<p>He also expressed anger that Vice President Kamala Harris had been swapped in for Biden on the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>"She hasn't done an interview since this whole scam started," Trump said, claiming falsely that Biden dropping off the ticket was a "coup." Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election, but is now trailing Harris in some of the same states.</p>

<p>In an interview that was light on policy detail, Trump also appeared to praise Musk for firing workers.</p>

<p>"You're the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: 'You want to quit?' They go on strike - I won't mention the name of the company - but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's okay, you're all gone.'"</p>

<h3><strong>TRUMP BACK ON X</strong></h3>

<p>The interview provided an opportunity for Trump to seize the limelight at a time when his campaign is facing new headwinds.</p>

<p>Harris has erased Trump's lead in opinion polls and energized Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies since she replaced Biden as the party's candidate three weeks ago. Her momentum could get another boost from the Democratic National Convention next week in Chicago.</p>

<p>Trump returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a series of posts on Monday for the first time in a year, reviving an account that had served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and his four years in the White House, including his followers' Jan. 6 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6 attack, citing concerns he would incite violence.</p>

<p>Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was launched in February 2022, but his posts there reach a much smaller audience than on X.</p>

<h3><strong>MUSK BACKS TRUMP</strong></h3>

<p>Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, has echoed Trump's false claims about voter fraud and Biden's immigration policies.</p>

<p>Musk has started an external super PAC spending group to support Trump's campaign. The political action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on gathering voter information.</p>

<p>Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears after Musk's endorsement.</p>

<p>"I'm for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice," Trump said at an early August rally.</p>

<p>United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of Harris, called Trump a "sellout."</p>

<p>The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.</p>

<p>Republicans in Congress, including Trump's running mate Senator JD Vance, have opposed those subsidies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump ran through his checklist of conspiracy theories Monday in a rambling conversation with his uber-wealthy supporter Elon Musk that was initially derailed by what the tech titan said was a technical glitch.</p>

<p>In a very one-sided conversation on X, Trump vented about a "zombie apocalypse" of immigration, repeatedly blasted President Joe Biden as "stupid" and mused on developing a new missile defense system based on the one that defends Israel.</p>

<p>The Republican standard-bearer also dismissed climate change, whose sea-level rises he said would simply create more real estate opportunities.</p>

<p>"The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years," he told Musk.</p>

<p>"You'll have more ocean front property, right? The biggest threat is not that. The biggest threat is nuclear warming, because we have five countries now that have significant nuclear power, and we have to not allow anything to happen with stupid people like Biden."</p>

<p>What was billed as a "no limits" conversation between the two billionaires started more than half an hour late, with many of those logging on unable to listen in live.</p>

<p>Musk, the world's richest man according to Forbes, claimed the platform formerly known as Twitter had experienced a cyber "attack."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Border 'apocalypse'</strong></h3>

<p>The conversation was intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign, which has flagged since Biden dropped out of the race, to be replaced by a surging Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The young men who view Musk as a hero are a prized target for Trump, whose following tends to skew older.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>

<p>The apparent technical difficulties come after Musk fired swathes of staff at the platform, and also served as an uncomfortable reminder that the Tesla boss had once backed Trump's rival Ron DeSantis, whose campaign launch on the platform was also beset by problems.</p>

<p>When things finally got under way, Musk said the "massive attack illustrates there's a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say."</p>

<p>Trump was banned from Twitter after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, but Musk reinstated him when he took the platform over and renamed it.</p>

<p>The South African-born billionaire has emerged as a major voice in US politics, but is accused of turning X into a megaphone for right-wing conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>He is one of the Democrats' fiercest critics, leveraging his 194 million-strong following on X to assail liberal efforts to boost diversity and inclusion -- what he calls the "woke mind virus" -- and the White House's handling of the southern border.</p>

<p>"We have people streaming over," Musk told Trump, likening the border to the "zombie apocalypse" depicted in the film "World War Z."</p>

<p>"It's just not possible for the United States to absorb, you know, everyone from Earth," said Musk, identifying himself as a "legal immigrant."</p>

<h3><strong>Cost 'cutter'</strong></h3>

<p>In his "chat" with Musk, Trump returned often to a favorite theme -- boasting about his relationship with autocrats like Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, and insisted America would be safer under his stewardship.</p>

<p>"One of the things we're going to do is we're going to build an Iron Dome," he said, referring to Israel's missile defense system.</p>

<p>"We're going to have the best Iron Dome in the world... because it just takes one maniac to, you know, start something."</p>

<p>Musk reiterated his strong support for Trump, saying the ex-president "was the path to prosperity and Kamala is the opposite."</p>

<p>At one point he also appeared to be touting for a job under a future Trump administration, suggesting he would like to serve on a cost-cutting committee.</p>

<p>"I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at these things and and just ensures that taxpayer money... is spent in a good way," he said. "I'd be happy to help out on such a commission."</p>

<p>Trump appeared sold on the job application.</p>

<p>"You're the greatest cutter," he told the man who slashed swathes of staff months after taking over Twitter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Trump, who survived the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-live-updates-x-owner-to-interview-republican-2024-us-elections-presidential-candidate-6324927">assassination bid</a> but was left with a bloodied ear, said he's "more of a believer" now.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that it was a bullet. I knew immediately that it was at the ear...," he said as over a million listeners joined to listen to the 78-year-old former president.</p>

<p>"For those people that don't believe in God, I think we all have to start thinking about that," he added.</p>

<p>He also pointed out that he turned his head at the "perfect angle", which saved his life.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm a believer. Now I'm more of a believer, I think. And a lot of people have said that to me. A lot of great people have said that to me, actually. But it was, it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle," the Republican presidential candidate said.</p>

<p>The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, wounded two rally-goers and killed another before he was shot dead by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's much-trailed interview with Donald Trump got off to a rocky start this morning after what the tech entrepreneur said was a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-is-ddos-attack-flagged-by-elon-musk-that-hit-donald-trump-interview-6324982">cyberattack</a> on his microblogging platform.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down," Musk, the world's richest man, wrote earlier on the platform, formerly known as Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump today praised Russia, China and North Korea heads saying that they are at the top of their game and the US needs a strong president to tackle them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(Vladimir) Putin, Xi (Jinping), Kim Jong Un are at the top of their game," Trump said during an interview with Elon Musk being streamed on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>He said that these leaders, who are often referred to as dictators, love their country, but "it is a different form of love".</p>

<p>Referring to Biden as "sleepy Joe", Trump also claimed Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if it hadn't been for Biden.</p>

<p>"I got along with Putin very well, and he respected me. We would talk about Ukraine. It was the apple of his eye. But I told him don't do it," he claimed.</p>

<p>The interview began more than 40 minutes after the scheduled start time due to tech glitches. Musk blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, a type of cyber attack in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was not confirmed.</p>

<p>The conversation is intended to help reinvigorate Trump's stuttering campaign, which has flagged since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>Musk, who has said he previously voted Democrat, has thrown his weight -- and his wealth -- behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the Republican at a rally last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump amplified a wave of false social media claims that his opponent Kamala Harris used artificial intelligence to fabricate a picture of her supporters at a Michigan rally last week -- an allegation disproved by photos and videos.</p>

<p>"Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she 'A.I.'d' it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN'T EXIST!" the Republican presidential nominee wrote in the first of a series of posts Sunday on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>"There was nobody there!" he added in a second post.</p>

<p>Live footage and photos from numerous media outlets, including AFP, showed the crowd of supporters, who packed an airfield hangar and spilled onto the tarmac to see Harris and her freshly announced running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>The photo appeared to have been first posted by a Harris campaign official who received it from another staffer.</p>

<p>"This is an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan," the campaign's official rapid response page wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>The campaign shared an original copy of the image -- which appears dimmer than the high-exposure version available online and highlighted by Trump -- with the BBC, telling the British broadcaster that it was "not modified by AI in any way."</p>

<p>Drexel University digital forensic expert Matthew Stamm analyzed the image for AFP and said his specialized software "did not find any evidence that the image was generated by AI."</p>

<p>The University of California-Berkeley's Hany Farid also told AFP two models designed to identify traces of AI uncovered no evidence the technology was used in the image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The false claim circulated on right-wing and conspiratorial social media circles before reaching Trump, who shared a post from conservative commentator Chuck Callesto focusing on the lack of a reflection of the crowd on the side of the plane.</p>

<p>Experts said the crowd was likely not directly mirrored because of the distance between the aircraft and the audience and the angle of the reflection.</p>

<p>"The reflection on the hull of the plane and the engine will show the ground immediately in front of the plane," Stamm told AFP.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has flagged a "massive DDOS attack" on X that disrupted the airing of his interview with former Donald Trump. Musk was set to interview Trump this morning, marking his return to the microblogging platform ahead of the US Presidential elections due in November.</p>

<p>In the worst case, the Tesla chief said, the platform would allow only a small number of live listeners and later post the conversation online.</p>

<p>"There appears to be a massive DDOS attack on X. Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later," the Tesla chief said in a post as the interview missed its scheduled timing.</p>

<p>What is DDOS attack?</p>

<p>DDOS attack stands for "Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack" that is disrupts a targeted server or network's normal traffic by flooding the target or its surrounding infrastructure with internet traffic.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity firm Fortinet has termed it a cybercrime.</p>

<p>"DDoS Attack means 'Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack' and it is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites," according to the firm.</p>

<p>DDoS attacks use multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic and the exploited machines could include computers and other networked resources, reads an explainer by IT service management firm Cloudfare.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 47,000 people died in Europe due to scorching temperatures in 2023, with countries in the region's south hit the hardest, according to a report by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) published on Monday.</p>

<p>Last year was the world's hottest on record. As climate change continues to increase temperatures, Europeans live in the world's fastest-warming continent, facing growing health risks stemming from intense heat.</p>

<p>The 2023 death count - below the more than 60,000 heat-related deaths estimated for the previous year - would have been 80% higher without measures introduced in the past 20 years to help people adapt to rising temperatures, such as early warning systems and healthcare improvements, according to the report by the Spanish research centre.</p>

<p>"Our results show how there have been societal adaptation processes to high temperatures during the present century, which have dramatically reduced the heat-related vulnerability and mortality burden of recent summers, especially among the elderly," said Elisa Gallo, researcher at ISGlobal and lead author of the study.</p>

<p>Researchers used death and temperature records from 35 European countries. They estimate that 47,690 died from causes related to high temperatures.</p>

<p>Adjusting the data for population, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain were the countries with the highest mortality rates related to heat.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

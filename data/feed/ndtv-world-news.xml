       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OJ Simpson's former bodyguard, Iroc Avelli, claims to have a recording of Simpson confessing to the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The alleged confession was reportedly captured on a thumb drive seized from Avelli in 2022, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2513646/oj-simpson-allegedly-confessed-to-killings-on-tape-ex-bodyguard-claims" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Express Tribune </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Avelli alerted authorities to the device earlier this year, following Simpson's death in April. While the contents of the recording remain undisclosed, the revelation has reignited interest in one of the most infamous trials in American history.</p>

<p>However, Bloomington, Minn. PD say the search of thumb drives, believed to contain a confession by OJ Simpson, uncovered nothing of "evidentiary value," according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox9.com/video/1556741" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Fox9</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>O.J. Simpson, the American football star whose 1995 acquittal in the so-called "trial of the century" for the murder of his ex-wife and a male friend gripped the world, died in April this year, he was 76.</p>

<p>Once a beloved national figure, his fame turned to infamy after the savage killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in a suburb of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The televised police chase to apprehend Simpson, and the extraordinary subsequent trial featuring high-octane lawyers and allegations of racism, were watched by millions on television.</p>

<p>His acquittal in October 1995 after nine months in court was greeted with disbelief by many Americans who had followed every twist and turn in the arguments over details as intricate as whether a pair of gloves really fitted the former athlete's hands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Chad Chronister, has withdrawn his name from consideration. Florida sheriff Chronister is the second Trump nominee to step back following the nomination after former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, who withdrew his nomination for attorney general.</p>

<p>Mr Chronister, who currently serves as the sheriff in Florida's Hillsborough County on Tuesday said there is "more work to be done" for those living there.</p>

<p>"Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration," he wrote in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">To have been nominated by President-Elect <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a> to serve as Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is the honor of a lifetime. Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully… <a href="https://t.co/bvNF8m9Bh4">pic.twitter.com/bvNF8m9Bh4</a></p>
— Chad Chronister (@ChadChronister) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChadChronister/status/1864068222309277751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"I sincerely appreciate the nomination, outpouring of support by the American people, and look forward to continuing my service as Sheriff of Hillsborough County," the sheriff added.</p>

<p>The Trump transition team did not immediately issue any statement on the issue.</p>

<p>The President-elect on Sunday announced his intention to nominate Mr Chronister to lead the DEA, saying he would focus on stemming the flow of fentanyl across the US border with Mexico. DEA is part of the Department of Justice and is responsible for enforcing US drug laws.</p>

<p>However, his nomination was seen with a critical lens by Mr Trump's supporters, who cited the sheriff's arrest of a Florida pastor for violating a COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Mr Chronister, who has spent over three decades working in law enforcement, also appeared to lack the broader experience suited for the DEA role, according to a report by Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Chronister was first appointed as county sheriff in 2017 by then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott. He then successfully ran for election to the role. Mr Chronister also reportedly overlapped in the office with Pam Bondi, incoming President Trump's pick for attorney general, when she was a state prosecutor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His withdrawal follows a similar move by former Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz, Trump's first pick for attorney general. Mr Gaetz dropped out of consideration amid concerns about his previous conduct. He, however, denied any wrongdoing and called the investigation a "smear."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's attorneys sought to dismiss his historic criminal fraud conviction in a new filing released Tuesday -- arguing President Joe Biden used similar reasoning to pardon his son, Hunter Biden.</p>

<p>The Democratic lame-duck president pardoned his son Sunday, after Hunter was convicted earlier this year of tax evasion and illegally possessing a firearm, arguing he was "selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted" by the Department of Justice (DOJ) "only because he is my son."</p>

<p>Trump's motion to dismiss, filed Monday, saw his legal team cite the arguments used by Biden to make their own case to presiding judge Juan Merchan.</p>

<p>Biden's "comments amounted to an extraordinary condemnation of President Biden's own DOJ," the letter's introduction reads. "This is the same DOJ that coordinated and oversaw the politically-motivated, election-interference witch hunts targeting President Trump."</p>

<p>The 69-page brief also invoked the doctrine of presidential immunity -- which the Supreme Court has ruled extends to "official acts" while president -- and the Presidential Transition Act, among other laws, to "immediately dismiss the Indictment and vacate the jury's verdicts."</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was found guilty in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records from covering up the payment of $130,000 to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to silence her from coming forward about an alleged extramarital affair during the final stretch of the 2016 election campaign.</p>

<p>Merchan, the judge in the only criminal case against Trump that has gone to trial, indefinitely postponed Trump's sentencing at a hearing on November 22, given his win in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>With Trump's defense team filing to dismiss the case, Merchan will now have to decide whether to throw out the case entirely, or to suspend any legal consequences until after the end of Trump's upcoming term in office, which will begin on January 20.</p>

<p>Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg has supported the latter in light of the "unprecedented circumstances" caused by Trump's electoral victory.</p>

<p>Bragg had argued during the hush money trial that Trump's payments were made to cover up a scandal that would have tarnished his campaign in the 2016 election that Trump ended up winning over Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Trump has consistently denied having an affair with Daniels.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>December, 1971&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Pakistan Air Force bombed Indian airfields, and then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared war against the enemy. The breakout of armed hostilities was not due to a sudden escalation but a result of a brutal crackdown by Pakistani troops on its citizens in the east (now Bangladesh).&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Operation Searchlight' as it was called, resulted in a systematic annihilation of Bengalis and other minorities in east Pakistan and death count surpassing 3 million and over 4,00,000 women were subjected to sexual assault. It was genocide the US intentionally ignored.</p>

<h3><strong>Tensions In South Asia</strong></h3>

<p>The 1965 war marked a crucial shift in Indian politics, then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri died under mysterious circumstances during the Tashkent Agreement in 1966 and Indira Gandhi was elected as the Prime Minister of India. Meanwhile, Pakistan's Field Marshal Ayub Khan handed over the reins to General Yahya Khan who declared martial law across the country after his anointment. A year later in 1970, Yahya Khan declared general elections to legitimise his position and "bring democracy" back into Pakistan.</p>

<p>To his and everyone's surprise, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman's Awami League in East Pakistan won a majority in the 311-member National Assembly. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was not ready to accept the decision, especially seeing a Bengali rule the Pathans and Mohajirs in West Pakistan. The fire was ignited in the east and the revolution led to a crackdown. Major General Tikka Khan, also known as the Butcher of East Pakistan, ordered an armed suppression of a freedom movement.</p>

<h3><strong>'Dissent Cables'</strong></h3>

<p>Archer Blood was a young American diplomat posted at the consulate office in Dacca. His telegrams to the White House are considered to be one of the most strongly worded opinions against the American policy toward Pakistan and their decision to ignore the crackdown in the east outrightly.&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em>Archer Blood was a young American diplomat posted at the consulate office in Dacca.</em></h5>
</div>

<p>On April 6, 1971, in one of the now-<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/30311-document-41-state-department-us-consulate-dacca-cable-dissent-us-policy-toward-east" rel="noindex,nofollow">declassified</a> telegrams, he wrote, "I am aware of the task force proposals on "openness" in the foreign service and with the conviction that the US policy related to recent development in east Pakistan serves neither our moral interests broadly defined nor our national interests narrowly defined...Our government has failed to denounce atrocities. Our government has failed to take forceful measures to protect its citizens while the same time bending over backwards to placate west Pak dominated government and to lessen likely and deservedly negative international public relations impact against them.</p>

<p>"Our government has evidence what many will consider moral bankruptcy," the cable authorized by Blood and signed by 20 others said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then-US President Richard Nixon and his foreign minister Henry Kissinger did not view India as an ally. They had an inherent emotional dislike towards New Delhi, which was later proven when the US sent the USS Enterprise into the Indian Ocean to threaten the Indian Navy in the east and support the authoritarian Pakistani regime. The 'Dissent Cable' highlights the American hypocrisy and says, "Ironically, at a time when USSR sent President Yahya Khan a message defending democracy, condemning arrest of leader of democratically elected majority party and calling for repressive measures and bloodshed...We have chosen not to intervene, even morally on the grounds that the Awami conflict, in which unfortunately the overworked term genocide is applicable, is purely an internal matter of a sovereign state...."</p>

<p>American journalist Gary J Bass has written the most detailed account in his book - 'The Blood Telegram Nixon, Kissinger, And A Forgotten Genocide', and explains how the American diplomat shared first-hand information to Washington of the atrocities Pakistani troops are committing, especially using American weapons like the Chaffee tanks and the F-86 Sabre jets against its citizens, but the Oval office chose to ignore the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>The war ended in just 14 days. Over 3,800 Indian Armed Forces personnel were killed in action and over 9,800 were wounded. At least 90,000 Pakistani soldiers in the east surrendered. Bangladesh was born out of the sacrifice of Indian soldiers and the Mukti Bahini.</p>

<h3><strong>Yahya Khan Gets US Backing</strong></h3>

<p>US President Richard Nixon and his foreign minister Henry Kissinger were determined to establish relations with China, for which the duo needed Pakistan, and Islamabad was bought using military and financial aid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The American objective was to create a new front against the USSR in South Asia, especially after the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s. The crisis in East Pakistan came at just the right time for the US to show its support to Yahya Khan to bargain a better position in talks with China. Richard Nixon travelled to China the following year in 1972 after Kissinger's back-channel diplomacy with Beijing for some time. The visit came at the cost of a genocide in the east that the US failed to stop. Richard Nixon even snapped at the height of the crisis in east Pakistan and said, "I don't like the Indians," a dislike stemming from India's nonaligned movement and the historically good relations with the Soviet Union since independence.</p>

<p>A memorandum sent by Kissinger to Nixon, titled '<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/30312-document-42-white-house-memorandum-president-policy-options-toward-pakistan-secret" rel="noindex,nofollow">Policy Options Toward Pakistan</a>', on April 28, almost three weeks after the dissent cable, was declassified by the US. The document states how Kissinger gave three policy options towards Pakistan to President Nixon and suggested that it would be in the best "interests to have the advantage of making the most of the relationship with Yahya while engaging in a serious effort to move the situation toward conditions less damaging to US and Pakistani interests."</p>

<p>"We would not withhold aid now for the sake of applying pressure We would face that question only after giving the West Pakistanis every chance to negotiate a settlement in the face of the costs of not doing so," he said in the memorandum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"On economic assistance, we would state our willingness to help in the context of a West Pakistani effort to negotiate a viable settlement We would have to point out that it will be beyond the US--or World Bank or IMF- -financial capacity to help Pakistan if the situation drags on and Pakistan faces a financial crisis We would also have to point out that US assistance legislation requires that economic aid be reduced to the extent that there is a possibility of its diversion to military purposes."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sensing US backing for Yahya, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation in August 1971, setting the agenda that in case of aggression against any of the two parties, then they would immediately consult each other. It irked the Americans, but for New Delhi, it served the purpose of nonalignment and national interests.</p>

<p>The dissent cable advised the White House to rethink its policy toward Pakistan and said, "I hope the most likely eventual outcome of the struggle underway in east Pakistan and the consequent establishment of an independent Bangladesh. At the moment, we possess the goodwill of the Awami League. We would be foolish to forfeit this asset by pursuing a rigid policy of one-sided support to the likely loser."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Notre Dame cathedral will reopen in Paris on Saturday with incoming US president Donald Trump to attend the ceremony marking the resurrection of the Gothic masterpiece five years after a devastating fire.</p>

<p>The Republican confirmed Monday he had accepted an invitation from French President Emmanuel Macron to attend the grand re-opening of the 850-year-old edifice which was nearly lost to flames in April 2019.</p>

<p>It will be Trump's first foreign trip since his re-election last month in a political comeback that has set off alarm bells in much of Europe, including in France where Macron regularly tussled with the New York real estate tycoon during his first term.</p>

<p>Trump posted on his Truth Social website that Macron had "done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!"</p>

<p>The presence of Trump is likely to encourage other world leaders to attend as they seek to build relations before his January 20 inauguration.</p>

<p>After he took office in 2017, Trump's initial dealings with Macron -- then also a fresh face on the world stage -- had the makings of a "bromance".</p>

<p>Their long and muscular handshakes -- which saw each man seek to assert his superiority -- became a light-hearted focus of attention before ties cooled, then soured, following disputes about climate change, trade and defence.</p>

<p>Trump publicly mocked Macron's "very low approval rating" and even aimed a jibe at France's war history during a rancorous 2018 trip to the country.</p>

<p>Macron's current political problems, with his latest government likely to fall this week, risk overshadowing Saturday's ceremony which the French leader hoped to present as a moment of national and personal triumph.</p>

<p>- 'Sublime' -<br />
Parisians watched in horror in 2019 as flames ravaged Notre Dame, a landmark famed as the setting for Victor Hugo's novel "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and an integral part of the city's identity.</p>

<p>The apocalyptic images were even seen by some as a sign of the demise of Western civilisation, with the edifice saved from complete collapse only by the heroic intervention of firefighters.</p>

<p>Tweeting as the blaze took place, Trump suggested that "perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out", leading irritated French officials to dismiss the suggestion and almost certain to devastate what remained of the building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were brought in to restore the destroyed artwork, blackened walls and damaged facilities at a cost of 700 million euros ($750 million).</p>

<p>During a visit last Friday, Macron praised them for achieving the "impossible" by healing a "national wound".</p>

<p>Accompanied by Paris' archbishop Laurent Ulrich and top city politicians, he gazed at the restored pale-coloured stonework in the nave and praised the edifice as "much more welcoming" and "sublime".</p>

<p>- Politics and diplomacy -<br />
Saturday's ceremony will mix public celebration, politics, diplomacy and religion.</p>

<p>Macron is to deliver a speech in front of a small crowd at the cathedral and up to 50 heads of state and government including German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier who confirmed his attendance on Tuesday.</p>

<p>They will then inspect the monument and attend a mass service overseen by the archbishop of Paris, which will feature the newly restored 8,000-pipe Grand Organ.</p>

<p>Pope Francis will not attend -- to the surprise of some observers. The Catholic church head will instead go on a visit to the French island of Corsica later in December.</p>

<p>A public area with capacity for 40,000 people will be created on the bank of the river Seine opposite Notre Dame, while a concert featuring the Notre Dame choir, the Radio France philharmonic orchestra and singers will be broadcast.</p>

<p>There are unconfirmed rumours that Pharrell Williams will provide some international stardust.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the first mass with 170 bishops and more than 100 Paris priests will take place at 10:30am (0830 GMT) followed by a second service in the evening at 6:30pm which will be open to the public and be attended by Macron.</p>

<p>All tickets for the public mass in the 3,000-seat edifice were reserved within a few hours on Tuesday, according the cathedral's phone app.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The asteroid, measuring less than 70 centimetres (27.5 inches) in diameter, was identified earlier in the day on a "collision course" with Earth, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). However, the impact was deemed "harmless."&nbsp;</p>

Thanks to observations from astronomers around the world, our alert system was able to predict this impact to within +/- 10 seconds," the ESA wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government early on Wednesday lifted martial law after a tense night of political drama at South Korea's National Assembly, where lawmakers defied security forces to vote against his declaration, while thousands of people protested on the streets. The martial law was in effect for about six hours and was formally lifted during a Cabinet meeting, where lawmakers rejected his attempt to ban political activity and censor the media.</p>

<p>The President's shocking bid to impose South Korea's first martial law in over four decades plunged Asia's fourth-largest economy into the deepest turmoil in its modern democratic history. After the law was lifted, South Korean lawmakers on Wednesday called for the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<h2><strong>Call To Impeach Parliament</strong></h2>

<p>A coalition of lawmakers from opposition parties said they planned to propose a bill to impeach Mr Yoon, on Wednesday which should be voted on within 72 hours, unless he immediately resigned. If Mr Yoon "does not resign immediately, the Democratic Party will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings in line with the will of the people," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Even if martial law is lifted, he cannot avoid treason charges. It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down," senior DP member of parliament Park Chan-dae said in a statement.</p>

<p>The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it. A trial is then held by the constitutional court, which can confirm it with a vote by six of the nine justices. Mr Yoon's party controls 108 seats in the 300-member legislature.</p>

<h2><strong>Six Hours Of Martial Law In South Korea</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Yoon, who has been in office since 2022, shocked the nation on Tuesday night by declaring martial law to thwart "anti-state forces" among his domestic political opponents. Yoon Suk-yeol's drastic decision also mentioned the threat from North Korea. However, as the night unfolded, it became clear that the move was not spurred by external threats but by the President's own political troubles.</p>

<p>After Mr Yoon's announcement of martial law, South Korea's military said activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command. Helmeted troops briefly tried to enter the parliament building. Parliamentary aides were seen trying to push the soldiers back by spraying fire extinguishers.</p>

<p>While opposition lawmakers rushed to parliament to push through an emergency vote to reverse the order, thousands of people gathered outside the building to protest against the decree. All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote, even several from Mr Yoon's own party, voted for lifting martial law. Dramatic footage from the proceedings showed troops stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.</p>

<p>Protesters outside the National Assembly parliament shouted and clapped. "We won!" they chanted.</p>

<p>A few hours later, a defeated Mr Yoon accepted the parliament's vote and lifted the martial law order. Under South Korean law, the president must immediately lift martial law if parliament demands it by a majority vote.</p>

<p>Protests are expected to continue in South Korea, including near the National Assembly where thousands of people gathered late on Tuesday to call to block Mr Yoon's order and then demand his arrest and resignation. Some companies including Naver Corp and LG Electronics Inc advised employees to work from home.</p>

<h2><strong>A Look At Yoon Suk-yeol</strong>'<strong>s Politics</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Yoon, a career prosecutor, squeezed out a victory in the tightest presidential election in South Korean history in 2022. He rode a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars, aiming to reshape the political future of Asia's fourth-largest economy. But he has been unpopular, with his support ratings hovering at around 20 per cent for months, according to a report by Reuters.</p>

<p>His People Power Party suffered a landslide defeat at a parliamentary election in April this year, ceding control of the unicameral assembly to opposition parties that captured nearly two-thirds of the seats.</p>

<h2><strong>Martial Law And Its History In South Korea</strong></h2>

<p>Martial law is the temporary replacement of civilian government by military rule in a time of emergency when civil authorities are deemed unable to function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Korea's martial law entails total prohibition of all political activities, complete media control, and a total ban on protests and rallies. It also says that misinformation is punishable. It also orders medical staff, including doctors, medics, nurses, and other medical personnel including trainees - both in service and retired- to return to the medical field within 48 hours. It also says that any anti-state forces and subversive forces would be prosecuted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There have been more than a dozen instances of martial law being declared since South Korea was established as a republic in 1948.</p>

<p>In 1980, a group of military officers led by Chun Doo-hwan forced then-President Choi Kyu-hah to proclaim martial law to crush calls by the opposition, labour and students for the restoration of democratic government.</p>

<p>The law had never been invoked since the country became a parliamentary democracy in 1987 before Mr Yoon pulled the trigger on Tuesday.</p>

<h2><strong>Market Destabalised</strong></h2>

<p>South Korean stocks opened down around 2 per cent on Wednesday, while the won steadied to trade around 1,418 to the dollar, having plunged to a two-year low.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Asian country's finance ministry promised to pour in money if needed to prop up volatile financial markets after Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong held emergency meetings overnight.</p>

<p>"We will inject unlimited liquidity into stocks, bonds, short-term money market as well as forex market for the time being until they are fully normalised," the government said in a statement.</p>

<h2><strong>"Bullet Dodged"</strong></h2>

<p>The crisis in a country that has been a democracy since the 1980s, and is a US ally and major Asian economy, caused international alarm.</p>

<p>"South Korea as a nation dodged a bullet, but President Yoon may have shot himself in the foot," said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank in the United States.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he welcomed Yoon's decision to rescind the martial law declaration. "We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law," Blinken said in a statement.</p>

<p>Some 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to guard against the nuclear-armed North.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing the threat of impeachment, with opposition lawmakers accusing him of violating his constitutional duty and committing a crime akin to treason when he declared martial law on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Yoon lifted the martial law declaration before dawn on Wednesday, just hours after opposition-controlled parliament rejected his attempt to ban political activity and censor the media.</p>

<p>Below are details of the presidential impeachment process and past presidents who were impeached.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">What Is The Law?</span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p>The Constitution provides for parliament to bring an impeachment motion against the president or other high-ranking public officials if they are believed to "have violated the Constitution or any law in the performance of official duties."</p>

<p>The presidential impeachment motion needs a two-thirds majority vote by the members of the single-chamber parliament to pass. A simple majority is needed to impeach other officials.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Court conducts a trial to either confirm or reject the impeachment motion, hearing evidence from parliament to determine whether the president violated the law.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Does The Opposition Have The Votes?</span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p>Parliament is currently controlled by the main opposition Democratic Party, which has vowed to impeach Yoon. The party and other smaller parties have 192 seats, just short of the 200 required to impeach the president.</p>

<p>Some members of Yoon's ruling People Power Party have strongly objected to his martial law declaration, but it was not clear if or how many of them will join the opposition if a motion is brought to a vote.</p>

<p>Yoon was already facing calls for impeachment and special investigations into a scandal involving his wife.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Is The Parliament Vote All That's Needed?</span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p>If parliament votes to impeach, the president is suspended from exercising his powers until the result of an impeachment trial held by the Constitutional Court. The prime minister serves as leader in acting capacity.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Court hears oral arguments from the chair of parliament's justice committee and from the public official or their legal counsel.</p>

<p>The Court has up to six months to confirm the impeachment by a vote of six out of the nine justices, or reject the motion.</p>

<p>The Court currently has six sitting justices with three posts to be filled. It has waived the requirement of seven justices to deliberate cases, but it was not clear if it would take up the impeachment motion without the full nine justices.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">What Happens If The President Is Removed From Office?</span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p>A new presidential election must be held within 60 days.</p>

<p>The same would apply if Yoon resigns - the prime minister takes over in an acting capacity and a new election is held within 60 days.</p>

<p>In May 2017, a presidential election was held after the Constitutional Court's ruling to confirm then-President Park Geun-hye's impeachment on March 9.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Daughter Of Slain President Is Sole Impeached President</span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p>Park was the first democratically elected leader to be ousted from office, accused of colluding with a confidant in an influence peddling scheme and abusing her presidential authority.</p>

<p>Parliament voted to impeach her in December 2016, with some members of her own conservative party voting in favour.</p>

<p>Park is a daughter of former President Park Chung-hee who was assassinated in 1979.</p>

<p>She was later tried separately on criminal charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. She served almost five years before being released on medical grounds and was then pardoned in 2021.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Roh Moo-Hyun</span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p>In 2004, then-President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached on the charge of failing to maintain political neutrality as required of a high public official.</p>

<p>The motion was rejected by the Constitutional Court and Roh was restored to serve a full five-year term.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A nose job by Peruvian President Dina Boluarte sparked intense controversy on Tuesday, with some lawmakers calling for her to be removed from office for not delegating her responsibilities during the procedure.</p>

<p>The procedure that Boluarte, 62, underwent in the summer of 2023 has been discussed at length on social media and in the local press, but was only officially confirmed Tuesday, when Boluarte's former prime minister Alberto Otarola revealed it to a congressional commission.</p>

<p>"She told me she was going to get a rhinoplasty... a surgery on the nose, but for breathing problems," Otarola told lawmakers conducting an inquiry into the matter.</p>

<p>The congressional oversight commission is probing Boluarte's whereabouts between June 28 and July 10, 2023, when she completely disappeared from public view.</p>

<p>This is when, local media reports say, Boluarte had the surgery at a clinic in Lima without informing the public or delegating her powers to Congress.</p>

<p>Otarola said that during her recovery period, Boluarte carried out her duties virtually.</p>

<p>"There was no absence of power at that time, because the surgical procedure had no major complications," added Otarola, who was dismissed by Boluarte in March.</p>

<p>Some lawmakers and legal experts now charge that Boluarte's behavior constitutes a constitutional violation and are calling for her removal.</p>

<p>"It would be cause for dismissal... because the president should have asked permission from Congress," lawmaker Juan Burgos, who heads the oversight commission, told reporters.</p>

<p>Vice President of Congress Patricia Juarez sought to quell the dispute, calling it "a storm in a glass of water."&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scottish artist Jasleen Kaur won the prestigious Turner Prize on Tuesday, as the UK contemporary art award celebrated its 40th anniversary.</p>

<p>Kaur was honoured for her solo exhibition Alter Altar, which includes an installation of a Ford Escort car with a giant doily on it.</p>

<p>She was announced the winner during a ceremony at the Tate Britain gallery in central London.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old pipped Philippines-born Pio Abad, Manchester-born Claudette Johnson and English artist Delaine Le Bas to the award.</p>

<p>Kaur walked away with 25,000 pounds ($32,000), while the remaining shortlisted artists were awarded 10,000 pounds each.</p>

<p>The five jury members chose Kaur for "her ability to gather different voices through unexpected and playful combinations of material".</p>

<p>During her victory speech she called for a ceasefire in Gaza and said "Free Palestine".</p>

<p>Established in 1984, the Turner is awarded each year to a British artist for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work.</p>

<p>Previous victors include now-household names such as duo Gilbert &amp; George, Anish Kapoor, Rachel Whiteread, Antony Gormley, Chris Ofili, Steve McQueen and Damien Hirst.</p>

<p>British artist Jesse Darling won last year's prize for his sculptures and installations that invoke societal breakdown.</p>

<p>The annual award seeks to encourage debate around new advances in contemporary art and is given to a visual artist based or born in Britain.</p>

<p>But that debate has often spilled over into controversy. Ofili, for example, won in 1998 for incorporating elephant dung into his paintings.</p>

<p>Hirst in 1995 exhibited pieces including a rotting cow's head, while Tracey Emin's 1999 entry "My Bed" -- an unmade double bed with stained sheets surrounded by soiled underwear, condoms, slippers and empty drink bottles -- attracted huge attention.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A seven-year-old Ohio girl pleaded with her father not to harm her during a tense standoff with police, saying, “I don't want to go to heaven today.” On November 11, 2024, Charles Ryan Alexander, 43, abducted his daughter, Oaklynn, from her grandmother's home in Ohio. Since Alexander did not have custody rights, authorities issued an alert, sparking a police chase that culminated in a parking lot confrontation in Ohio's Medina County, according to the Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>In a release, the Medina County Sheriff's Office stated, “The vehicle came to a stop in a business parking lot where law enforcement attempted to negotiate with the armed suspect. The suspect, Charles Ryan Alexander, communicated with several dispatch centres by telephone. Multiple gun shots were fired in an officer-involved shooting. Alexander was pronounced dead at the scene by the Medina County Coroner, Dr. Deranek.”<br />
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="250" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D959168669561932%26set%3Da.454234976721973%26type%3D3&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe><br />
Audio from a 911 call captured the moments as Alexander, armed and agitated, threatened to end both his and his daughter's lives. “I will shoot us both, stand back!” he screamed at officers, according to a report in <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/01/us-news/ohio-girl-oaklynn-alexander-begs-her-dad-not-to-kill-her-in-911-call/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The New York Post</a>. In the background, Oaklynn's desperate voice could be heard, pleading repeatedly, “Please don't.”<br />
<br />
In one exchange, Oaklynn asked her father, asking are they “both going to heaven.” Alexander responded, “We'll both go?” to which the child cries out, “No! I don't want to go to heaven today.”<br />
<br />
Alexander, still clutching a gun, expressed frustration about the situation, saying, “I didn't want it to happen either; I just wanted to talk to your mother.” He addressed Oaklynn's mother directly during the call, stating, “If you're listening, Ashley, you should've called.”<br />
<br />
911 dispatchers worked frantically to defuse the situation. “Let's not do anything we can't undo,” one dispatcher said. Another added, “Just keep talking to her if you don't want her to be scared. Let's not do anything that is going to make it even more unfair to her, ‘cause you love her, I know you do.”<br />
<br />
Despite these efforts, the situation escalated. At an unspecified point, police fired at Alexander, fatally wounding him. Oaklynn, although unharmed physically, watched the incident.<br />
<br />
“The 7-year-old daughter was safely recovered from the scene and returned to family members without injury,” stated the Medina County Sheriff's Office.<br />
<br />
The tragedy has sparked an outpouring of support for the young girl. A family friend has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help cover the costs of her care, mental health support and future needs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Outgoing US President Joe Biden on Sunday pardoned his son, Hunter, for any federal crimes "he committed or may have committed" between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outgoing US President Joe Biden on Sunday pardoned his son, Hunter, for any federal crimes "he committed or may have committed" between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. The 54-year-old was facing legal troubles involving tax violations and firearms-related charges. This has brought renewed attention to the US Constitution's provision granting the president the authority to offer clemency, a power wielded by every president since George Washington.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the Presidential Pardon?</strong></h2>

<p>The US Constitution grants the president the power to pardon federal offences. Section 2 of Article II dictates that the president can "grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment." This power applies only to federal crimes, not state ones, and does not cover impeachment cases.</p>

<p>The concept of the pardon power was taken from England, where kings had the authority to grant mercy. While there was debate during the Constitutional Convention about whether Congress should approve pardons or whether treason should be an exception, Alexander Hamilton argued the power should rest solely with the president. In 'Federalist No. 74', Mr Hamilton explained that having one person in charge of issuing pardons would avoid the dangers of group decisions, which could lead to inconsistency or leniency. He also saw power as a tool to unite the country, especially in times of rebellion or crisis.</p>

<h2><strong>Historical use of the Presidential Pardon</strong></h2>

<p>The power to pardon is one of the most controversial and widely discussed aspects of the presidency. George Washington's first use of the pardon came in 1795 when he forgave participants in the Whiskey Rebellion, a violent protest against a federal tax.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln famously used his pardon power during and after the Civil War, offering amnesty to former Confederate soldiers as part of his efforts to heal a divided nation. In 1974, President Gerald Ford issued a controversial pardon to Richard Nixon for any crimes committed during the Watergate scandal. It was met with significant criticism.</p>

<p>President Jimmy Carter also utilised the pardon power early in his administration, granting amnesty to individuals who evaded the draft during the Vietnam War. The decision was aimed at reconciling a nation deeply divided over the conflict.</p>

<p>As George W Bush wrapped his presidency in 1992, he pardoned six individuals, including former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, involved in the Iran-Contra affair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bill Clinton's final day in office in 2001 saw him pardon his half-brother and make a highly controversial decision to grant clemency to Marc Rich, a fugitive convicted of financial crimes whose ex-wife had been a significant donor to Clinton's campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During his tenure, Barack Obama granted clemency to over 1,700 individuals, with a focus on those convicted of nonviolent drug offences.</p>

<p>More recently, Donald Trump, during his first term, used his pardon power to help political allies and associates. He pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared, convicted of tax evasion and witness tampering. Other pardons included political advisor Steve Bannon, who faced charges related to defrauding donors for a border wall project, and Paul Manafort, a top official in Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump also pardoned Roger Stone, former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, conservative figure Dinesh D'Souza, and Republican donor Elliott Broidy.</p>

<p>Trump also granted clemency to rapper Lil Wayne and Alice Marie Johnson, who spent years in prison for drug offences. Trump suggested he might pardon those involved in the January 6 Capitol attack, which would undo investigations and prosecutions related to the event.</p>

<h2><strong>Does India have the Presidential Pardon power?</strong></h2>

<p>In India, the President holds the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, and remissions of punishment, as outlined in Article 72 of the Indian Constitution. The power allows the President to reduce or remove the punishment for individuals convicted of crimes, particularly in cases involving offences against Union law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, unlike the US President, who has almost unrestricted power to grant pardons, the President of India must act on the advice of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>The President can exercise this power in certain situations, such as in cases where the punishment is for an offence under Union jurisdiction, including military offences. One of the most significant uses of this power is in cases involving the death penalty. The President can grant a pardon or reduce the sentence to life imprisonment or a lesser punishment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States will provide more than $1 billion in humanitarian aid for people displaced by drought or conflict in 31 African countries, US President Joe Biden said in Angola Tuesday.</p>

<p>The assistance would address food insecurity and other urgent needs of refugees, internally displaced persons and affected communities in 31 African countries, a statement from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today, I'm announcing over $1 billion of new humanitarian support for Africans displaced from homes by historic droughts," Biden said in an address in the Angolan capital Luanda, where he arrived late Monday for his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president.</p>

<p>Several countries in southern African are experiencing a drought that according to some estimates is the worst in the region in a century, causing major losses of crops and livestock.</p>

<p>"Armed conflict, extreme weather events, natural disasters, and other emergencies are driving humanitarian needs across the continent and requiring humanitarian assistance to save lives and alleviate suffering among the most vulnerable," the USAID statement said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today's announcement, yet again, demonstrates our firm commitment to stand alongside our African partners and people across the continent in addressing the challenge of food insecurity," it said.</p>

<p>According to the UN, one in five Africans -- almost 300 million people -- faced hunger in 2023, and the number of people facing acute food insecurity and malnutrition continues to rise, it said.</p>

<p>The United States in the 2024 fiscal year provided nearly $6.6 billion in humanitarian aid across sub-Saharan Africa, according to USAID.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">President Yoon Suk Yeol declared <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korea-declares-emergency-martial-law-to-counter-threats-posed-by-north-korea-7163931" target="_blank">emergency martial law</a> in a dramatic, late-night television address to the nation on Tuesday, citing "threats" from North Korea and slamming the main opposition party in South Korea. It was the first time since 1980 that it had been declared in the East Asian country.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In the address to the nation, President Yoon said, "To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He also attacked the main opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-member parliament, accusing it of "paralysing" governance solely for the "sake of impeachments, special investigations, and shielding their leader from justice".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korean-president-yoon-suk-yeol-withdraws-martial-law-after-lawmakers-defy-him-7167066#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">President Yoon</a>, however, withdrew <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/a-six-hour-martial-law-drama-in-south-korea-all-you-need-to-know-7166879#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">martial law</a> within six hours of announcing it. "Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations," he said in a televised address.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Democratic Party demanded that 63-year-old Yoon - who was elected president in 2022 - step down immediately over the attempted "insurrection". The party also said it would initiate impeachment proceedings against him unless he resigned "immediately".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">South Korea's main labour union group also called an "indefinite general strike" until he resigned over the "irrational and anti-democratic measure".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Yoon's People Power Party, which suffered a landslide defeat at a parliamentary election in April this year, giving control of the unicameral assembly to opposition parties that captured nearly two-thirds of the seats, called his attempt "tragic" and demanded that those involved be held accountable.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The United States, which stations nearly 30,000 troops in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/live-updates-south-korea-under-martial-law-whats-next-7165018" target="_blank">South Korea</a> to protect it from the nuclear-armed North, initially said it was watching events with "grave concern" and then said that it was "relieved" that President Yoon has reversed his "concerning" declaration of martial law.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">China, a key ally of North Korea, urged its citizens to exercise caution. Russia, which is also close to Pyongyang, called the situation "alarming".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The imposition of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korea-under-martial-law-heres-what-it-means-for-its-citizens-7165007" target="_blank">martial law</a> came after Yoon's approval rating dropped recently, with many expressing dissatisfaction over his handling of the economy and controversies involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta said on Tuesday it is seeking proposals from nuclear power developers to help meet its artificial intelligence and environment goals, becoming the latest big tech company to take interest in atomic power amid an expected boom in power demand.</p>

<p>The company wants to add 1 to 4 gigawatts of new U.S. nuclear generation capacity starting in the early 2030s, it said in a release. A typical U.S. nuclear plant has a capacity of about 1 gigawatt.</p>

<p>"At Meta, we believe nuclear energy will play a pivotal role in the transition to a cleaner, more reliable, and diversified electric grid," the company said in a release.</p>

<p>U.S. data center power use is expected to roughly triple between 2023 and 2030 and will require about 47 gigawatts of new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Constellation Energy announced a deal in September to restart a unit at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in what would be the first-ever restart for a data center. The announcement follows a similar agreement in March in which Amazon.com, purchased a nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy.</p>

<p>Meta said it is seeking developers with expertise in community engagement, development and permitting, and would consider either small modular reactors, an emerging part of the business that is not yet commercial, or larger nuclear reactors similar to today's fleet of U.S. nuclear plants.</p>

<p>Meta said it will take submissions from developers that want to take part in the request for proposals until Jan. 3, 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock bid to impose South Korea's first martial law in over four decades plunged the country into the deepest turmoil in its modern democratic history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol abandoned a short-lived attempt to impose martial law on Wednesday after lawmakers defied security forces to vote against his declaration and thousands of protesters took to the streets.</p>

<p>Yoon's shock bid to impose South Korea's first martial law in over four decades plunged the country into the deepest turmoil in its modern democratic history and caught its close allies around the world off guard.</p>

<p>The United States, which stations nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea to protect it from the nuclear-armed North, initially voiced deep concern at the declaration, then relief that martial law was over.</p>

<p>The dramatic developments also left the future of Yoon -- a conservative politician and former star public prosecutor who was elected president in 2022 -- in jeopardy.</p>

<p>South Korea's main opposition party -- whose lawmakers jumped fences and tussled with security forces so they could vote to overturn the law -- demanded that Yoon step down immediately over the attempted "insurrection".</p>

<p>The nation's largest umbrella labour union also called an "indefinite general strike" until Yoon resigned. And the leader of Yoon's own ruling party described the attempt as "tragic" while calling for those involved to be held accountable.</p>

<p>Yoon backed down after lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, which he made late on Tuesday night citing the threat of North Korea and "anti-state forces".</p>

<p>"Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations," Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (1930 GMT Tuesday).</p>

<p>"We will accept the National Assembly's request and lift the martial law through the Cabinet meeting."</p>

<p>Yonhap news agency then reported that Yoon's cabinet had approved the motion to lift the order.</p>

<p>Senior aides working for Yoon offered Wednesday to resign en masse over the martial law declaration, Yonhap reported.</p>

<p>By the start of the working day, Yoon had yet to reappear publicly.</p>

<h3><strong>'Impeachment'</strong></h3>

<p>The U-turn prompted jubilation among protesters outside parliament who had braved freezing temperatures to keep vigil through the night in defiance of Yoon's martial law order.</p>

<p>Demonstrators who had been waving South Korean flags and chanting "Arrest Yoon Suk Yeol" outside the National Assembly erupted in cheers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lim Myeong-pan, 55, told AFP that Yoon's decision to rescind martial law did not absolve him of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>"Yoon's act of imposing it in the first place without legitimate cause is a serious crime in itself," Lim told AFP.</p>

<p>"He has paved his own path to impeachment with this."</p>

<p>Defying security forces, 190 lawmakers managed to get into the assembly in the early hours of Wednesday and unanimously voted to oppose martial law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the constitution, martial law must be lifted when a majority in parliament demands it.</p>

<h3><strong>'Anti-state' elements</strong></h3>

<p>Yoon had given a range of reasons to justify martial law -- South Korea's first in more than 40 years.</p>

<p><br />
"To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a televised address.</p>

<p>Yoon did not give details of the North's threats, but the South remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang.</p>

<p>"Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order," Yoon said.</p>

<p>The president labelled the main opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-member parliament, "anti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime".</p>

<p>Yoon and his People Power Party are also bitterly at odds with the opposition over next year's budget.</p>

<p>Opposition MPs last week approved a significantly downsized budget plan through a parliamentary committee.</p>

<p>The imposition of emergency martial law came after Yoon's approval rating dropped to 19 percent in the latest Gallup poll last week, with many expressing dissatisfaction over his handling of the economy and controversies involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.</p>

<h3><strong>Concern, relief</strong></h3>

<p>Democratic South Korea is a major ally of the United States in Asia, but Washington said it was not given advance notice of Yoon's plan to impose martial law.</p>

<p>"We welcome President Yoon's statement that he would rescind the order declaring emergency martial law," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.</p>

<p>"We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law."</p>

<p>China, a key ally of North Korea, urged its nationals in the South to stay calm and exercise caution, while Britain said it was "closely monitoring developments".</p>

<p>Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korea studies at the University of Oslo, said Yoon's move to impose martial law was "an attempt to wind history back".</p>

<p>"I don't think South Korea's civil society can recognise Yoon as a legitimate president any longer," he told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rapper Eminem's mother Debbie Nelson has passed away. She was 69.</p>

<p>As per Eminem's rep, Nelson died on December 2 from complications related to lung cancer, People reported.</p>

<p>Nelson was born in 1955. At age 16, she married Eminem's father, Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. Two years later, she welcomed the "Lose Yourself" rapper in 1972.</p>

<p>Em and his mother went through a turbulent relationship during his childhood and into his Hall-of-Fame career. He apparently called her out in his 2002 song "Cleanin' Out My Closet," which led to Nelson suing her son for USD 11 million for defamation.</p>

<p>Nelson considered reconciling with Eminem in a 2008 interview with The Village Voice. "There's hope for everybody," she said at the time. "It's a matter of just basically swallowing your pride. It's like a cashed check. It's over, it's done. You need to move on."</p>

<p>In 2013 when the rapper released "Headlights," fans speculated that it was his apologizing to Nelson. "And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad," he sings in one part of the song. "So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote on this jet."</p>

<p>She celebrated Eminem from afar in recent years. When he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022, she congratulated him online, as per People.</p>

<p>"Marshall, I want to say, I could not let this day go by without congratulating you on your induction into the Hall of Fame," she said in a since-deleted video.</p>

<p>Along with Eminem, Nelson is survived by son Nathan Mathers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday said he would lift martial law just hours after he imposed it, in a brief and confusing episode in which he blasted the opposition as "anti-state forces" threatening the country's democracy.</p>

<p>The unexpected move from Yoon -- the first time martial law had been declared in South Korea in more than four decades -- alarmed the United States and the country's other allies.</p>

<p>What do we know about the imposition, its lifting and what might come next?</p>

<p><strong>- What was the declaration? -</strong></p>

<p>In a dramatic, late-night emergency television address to the nation, Yoon announced that he was imposing martial law, as he accused the opposition of paralysing the government with "anti-state activities".</p>

<p>A six-point decree from the new martial law commander, army chief General Park An-su swiftly followed, banning political activities and parties, "false propaganda", strikes and "gatherings that incite social unrest".</p>

<p>The order also brought all media outlets under the authority of martial law and directed all medical staff, including striking doctors, to return to work within 48 hours.</p>

<p><strong>- What happened at parliament? -</strong></p>

<p>Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and troops entered the building for a short time, seemingly in a bid to prevent lawmakers from getting inside.</p>

<p>But 190 lawmakers managed to enter and voted unanimously to reject Yoon's declaration and call for martial law to be lifted.</p>

<p>Outside, hundreds of protesters gathered, many raising chants calling for Yoon to be arrested.</p>

<p><strong>- What happened next? -</strong></p>

<p>Following the lawmakers' vote, Yoon backed down. His cabinet additionally approved the motion to lift the order, Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations," Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (1930 GMT Tuesday).</p>

<p>Under South Korea's constitution, the parliamentary vote to lift martial law has to be respected.</p>

<p><strong>- Why did Yoon do this? -</strong></p>

<p>Yoon said he was acting to safeguard his country's liberal democracy from "anti-state elements" and "threats posed by North Korea" -- but gave little detail.</p>

<p>While unexpected, the announcement came in the context of a festering budget row between Yoon and the opposition Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The opposition has slashed around 4.1 trillion won ($2.8 billion) from Yoon's proposed 677 trillion won budget for next year, prompting the president to complain that "all key budgets essential to the nation's core functions" were being cut.</p>

<p>"What is clear is that Yoon has been a deeply unpopular, ineffectual leader and he is having a hard time getting any kind of public support for anything he's trying to do," said Alan Yu, a former US diplomat in Asia now at the Center for American Progress.</p>

<p>"The use of martial law feels almost like a desperation move to try to break out, both in a political and policy sense, but it is really poorly played on both fronts."</p>

<p><strong>- What is next for Yoon? -</strong></p>

<p>Domestically, pressure has only grown further on Yoon after his late-night bombshell.</p>

<p>South Korea's main opposition party has demanded that Yoon step down, accusing him of "insurrection".</p>

<p>The country's main labour union group has also called an "indefinite general strike" until he resigns over the "irrational and anti-democratic measure".</p>

<p>Yoon's own People Power Party described his attempt at imposing martial law as "tragic" and demanded that those involved be held accountable.</p>

<p><strong>- What has the reaction been abroad? -</strong></p>

<p>South Korea is a key Western ally in Asia, seen as an important democratic bulwark in a region dominated by authoritarian regimes, and the drama is being watched with concern.</p>

<p>Washington said it was "relieved President Yoon has reversed course" on his martial law order.</p>

<p>Earlier, Britain and Germany both said they were closely following developments.</p>

<p>China, a key ally of nuclear-armed North Korea, urged its citizens to exercise caution, while Russia -- itself increasingly close to Pyongyang -- called the situation "alarming".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia and the United States clashed at the United Nations on Tuesday, accusing each other of supporting terrorism during a Security Council meeting convened over a sudden escalation of fighting in Syria.</p>

<p>Syrian rebels captured Aleppo last week in an attack initiated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Formerly known as the Nusra Front, it was al Qaeda's official wing in Syria until breaking ties in 2016. It is sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council.</p>

<p>Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood called for a de-escalation of the fighting in Syria and the protection of civilians. He also expressed concern that the rebel offensive was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.</p>

<p>"The fact that HTS is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.N. does not justify the further atrocities by the Assad regime and its Russian backers," said Wood, accusing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces and Russia of causing civilian casualties in attacks on schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>In remarks directed at Wood, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: "You were unable to summon the courage to condemn a clear terrorist attack undertaken against peaceful civilians in peaceful Syrian cities."</p>

<p>"There are no illusions that Washington will ever be willing to sincerely combat international terrorism," he said. "To be frank we are pleased that we are on opposite sides of the barricades right now from you."</p>

<p>Wood responded by accusing Nebenzia of being in "no position to lecture us on this issue" because Moscow "props up regimes that sponsor terrorism around the world."</p>

<p>"The United States has for decades fought the scourge of terrorism and will continue to fight that scourge of terrorism," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

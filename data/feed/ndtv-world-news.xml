<p>The US-India defence relationship is rapidly expanding, adapting to evolving regional and global security demands. This includes safeguarding supply chains, advancing critical and emerging technologies, and enhancing cooperation in cyber, space, and new dimensions of battlespace dominance. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to the US from August 23-26 highlighted these shifts, aiming to bridge bilateral gaps in these critical areas. The visit underscored a clear trend: while major defence deals continue to strengthen traditional security ties, both nations are increasingly emphasising emerging strategic elements to integrate the security partnership with a purposive intent towards making the Indo-Pacific region free and open. Issues central to joint India-US interests in the Indian Ocean and the security of the Indo-Pacific are being prioritised. India's increasing role in shaping regional security by ensuring freedom of navigation, now especially as a member of the Combined Maritime Force (CMF), was acknowledged. With India assuming leadership in the Combined Task Force 150 in 2025, stakes for an expanded regional security role have increased for New Delhi.</p>

<h2><strong>The Indo-Pacific Arena</strong></h2>

<p>As the Indo-Pacific remains central to regional and global security, enhancing partnership in this region is key to shaping a regionally favourable security architecture. Towards this, the visit provided an opportunity for steps in increasing supply chain security as well as enhancing maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Among the highlights was a new agreement to expand and strengthen operational coordination between India and the US by placing Indian liaison officers at US commands. The agreement is a step up for regional security coordination and domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific for India, complementing an earlier initiative to host US officers at the Information Fusion Centre (IFC-IOR) in India. It also overcomes the capacity limitations of India, indeed any country, to solely monitor the vast expanse of the Indo-Pacific on a real-time basis. Beyond the Indo-Pacific, placing Indian liaison officers at the other 10 Combatant Commands could usher new vistas in information sharing.</p>

<p>At the heart of the visit were steps to strengthen the Major Defence Partnership (MDP) and provide fresh momentum to joint production, including the reigniting of the Defense Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI). Under the US-India Roadmap for Defense Industrial Cooperation, an agreement to jointly produce jet engines, unmanned platforms, munitions, and ground mobility systems was signed. Leading up to the third summit of the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X) to be held in September in the US, discussions to expand cooperation in the areas of undersea and space-related collaborations were timely.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is SOSA</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most significant outcomes of the visit was the signing of the Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA), which makes India the 18th country to enter into this agreement with the US. It reflects a shared long-term vision to seamlessly integrate the defence industrial ecosystems of both nations while safeguarding supply chains from future disruptions. SOSA complements the Major Defense Partnership (MDP) and the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI). Notably, the visit aimed to reinvigorate the DTTI, a co-production initiative launched with high expectations, but that had lost momentum. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment will host a DTTI meeting in the coming months, bringing together government and private stakeholders from both countries' defence industries. The DTTI's primary goal is to integrate the defence industrial bases of the US and India, promoting bilateral co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment efforts.</p>

<p>SOSA strengthens the partnership by establishing guardrails for supply chains between the two countries' defence industries, which are poised to grow with new co-production and co-development opportunities. Guided by the US Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS), the arrangement provides structural and institutional assurances for defense supplies. India, in turn, is expected to develop a common code of conduct for government and industry stakeholders, prioritizing critical supplies to the US on a voluntary basis. With SOSA in place, working groups will have the framework to communicate more frequently and take proactive steps to ensure supply chain stability in both peacetime and crisis situations.</p>

<h2><strong>Diaspora As A 'Living Bridge'</strong></h2>

<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's reference to the Indian diaspora in the US as a 'living bridge' now resonates within the context of the growing India-US defence relationship. This June marked the first anniversary of the US-India INDUS-X Initiative, which aims to build a defence innovation bridge between the two countries under the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET). By connecting researchers, investors, and defence tech companies from both nations, INDUS-X outlines a strategy to harness private capital for defence innovation.</p>

<p>India and the US are swiftly adapting to the evolving global security landscape, responding to new threat perceptions with increased innovation and cooperation in advanced domains. The second US-India Advanced Domains Defense Dialogue (AD3) held this year underscored the importance of coordination in emerging defence areas, including space, cyber, and artificial intelligence, while identifying critical sub-sectors for potential industrial collaboration.</p>

<h2><strong>The Next Goals</strong></h2>

<p>The Defence Minister also visited the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Memphis, accompanied by a delegation from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), signalling a potential pathway for co-learning and development. In a boost to India's Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capabilities, India secured the purchase of sonobuoys from the US in the lead-up to the visit. The acquisition and co-production of General Atomics' MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft systems and the joint production of GE F414 jet engines in India are the next major goals for both nations.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh's visit managed to underline once again that defence is the main driver when it comes to shaping the trajectory of US-India bilateral engagement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Arizona Wells Fargo employee was found dead at her desk four days after clocking into work. Sixty-year-old Denise Prudhomme was last recorded entering her office building on the 1100 block of West Washington Street in Tempe at 7 am on Friday, August 16. However, it wasn't until the following Tuesday, August 20, that building security called authorities after finding she was unresponsive in her cubicle.</p>

<p>Tempe police have stated that their initial investigation found no signs of foul play. The department's criminal investigations bureau is now working with the Maricopa County Medical Examiner to determine the exact cause of Ms Prudhomme's death.</p>

<p>According to reports from <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/investigation-underway-after-body-of-wells-fargo-employee-found-dead-at-work-tempe/75-1329570f-3b63-4869-b4bd-7d45801a80f2 ">local media</a>, Ms Prudhomme's body was discovered by a colleague walking around the building. Police responded to a 911 call made by on-site security, who claimed "she was dead in a cubicle located on the third floor of the building." Officials arrived at the scene and pronounced her dead at 4:55 pm that day. It is believed that Ms Prudhomme had been sitting at her desk for the entire weekend and Monday, unnoticed by her coworkers.</p>

<p>Employees reportedly noticed a foul odour in the office but assumed it was related to plumbing issues. A distressed employee told 12 News, "It's really heartbreaking. What if I were just sitting there? No one would check on me?"</p>

<p>A Wells Fargo spokesperson <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/08/29/wells-fargo-employee-dies-work-tempe-office-body-not-found-until-days-later/">released a statement</a>&nbsp;saying they were "deeply saddened" by the "tragic loss of our colleague." "Our thoughts and prayers are with their family and loved ones during this difficult time," the statement read.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A team of Finnish researchers has developed a new suite of methods to test for the antivirulence and antibacterial effect of hundreds of unknown compounds from the Arctic Sea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of Finnish researchers has developed a new suite of methods to test for the antivirulence and antibacterial effect of hundreds of unknown compounds from the Arctic Sea.</p>

<p>The team from the University of Helsinki targeted an enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strain that causes severe diarrhoea in children under five, especially in developing countries. The compounds were derived from four species of actinobacteria and tested against EPEC adhering to colorectal cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EPEC causes disease by adhering to cells in the human gut. Once it adheres to these cells, EPEC injects so-called "virulence factors" into the host cell to hijack its molecular machinery, ultimately killing it.</p>

<p>Two compounds showed strong antivirulence or <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rare-flesh-eating-bacteria-that-can-kill-in-2-days-spreading-in-japan-5896619" target="_blank">antibacterial</a> activity: one from an unknown strain (T091-5) in the genus Rhodococcus and another from an unknown strain (T160-2) of Kocuria. The compound from T091-5 was most likely a phospholipid, a class of fatty phosphorus-containing molecules that play important roles in cell metabolism.</p>

<p>"Here we show how advanced screening assays can identify antivirulence and antibacterial metabolites from actinobacteria extracts," said Dr. Paivi Tammela, a professor at the University of Helsinki in Finland.</p>

<p>The molecule from T091-5 did not inhibit the development of EPEC bacteria, in contrast to the compounds from T160-2.</p>

<p>Of the two strains, T091-5 is the most promising since EPEC is less likely to develop resistance to its antivirulence actions.</p>

<p>Using sophisticated analytical techniques, the team found that the active component from T091-5 was most likely a phospholipid -- a family of fatty phosphorus-containing molecules vital for cell <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/microbes-have-adapted-to-microwave-ovens-finds-study-how-to-disinfect-6290180" target="_blank">metabolism</a>. But this is subject to further studies, they noted, in the paper published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.</p>

<p>"The next steps are the optimisation of the culture conditions for compound production and the isolation of sufficient amounts of each compound to elucidate their respective structures and further investigate their respective bioactivities," said Tammela.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Durek, in an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/11/the-princess-and-the-shaman" rel="nofollow,noindex">Vanity Fair</a> in 2020, shared he had died at age 28. He suffered seizures, organ failure and flatlined for four minutes. During this intense moment, he claimed to have felt like flaming knives were stabbing him and heard his grandmother's spirit telling him to let go.</p>

<p>However, his mind took him back to his "mother's womb", where he relived every moment of his life and re-met every person he had ever known. After being resuscitated, Mr Verret spent two months in a coma and eight years on dialysis, until his sister donated a kidney in 2012. He believes his recovery required him to think with his "expansive soul" rather than his "limiting brain."</p>

<p>Mr Verret's spiritual practices and claims, including his assertion that he rose from the dead, have raised eyebrows in Norway, a country known for its more conservative royal traditions.</p>

<p>Mr <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/norway-princess-announces-wedding-plans-with-hollywood-guru-4386325 ">Verrett is an African-American spiritual advisor</a>&nbsp;who counts celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Antonio Banderas among his followers. He has suggested that cancer is a choice, advocated exercises to remove "imprints" from women's bodies left by previous sexual partners, and sold $222 medallions on his website, claiming they helped him overcome COVID-19. These beliefs have led to him being labelled as a "charlatan, a quack" by Norwegian columnist Dagfinn Nordbo.</p>

<p>Despite the controversy, Princess Martha Louise, who is fourth in line to the Norwegian throne, has stood by her fiance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Louise introduced Mr Verrett to the world via an Instagram post in 2019. In the post, she defended her choice, urging critics to refrain from judgment and stressing that Mr Verrett was simply "a man I love spending my time with."</p>

<p>Martha Louise and Durek Verrett announced their engagement in June 2022.</p>

<p>In November 2022, Ms Louise relinquished her royal duties to pursue a career in holistic healing and spirituality with Mr Verrett. While she retained her title, she agreed not to use it for commercial purposes. The princess was previously married to writer Ari Behn, who died by suicide in 2019, three years after their divorce.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cindy Rodriguez Singh, a woman with ties to India, is wanted for allegedly killing her 6-year-old son Noel, who has been missing since October 2022. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to her arrest.</p>

<p>While police have not been able to recover the boy's body, they believe his mother had a role to play in his death. Police cadaver dogs detected human remains on a carpet that had once been on the floor of a shed on the Singh's property.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The carpet was disposed of by Singh's husband Arshdeep Singh but later recovered by police.</p>

<h2><strong>Why is Cindy Rodriguez Singh a suspect?</strong></h2>

<p>Reports have suggested that Singh believed her son was "evil, possessed or [had] a demon in him."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the days leading up to his suspected death, witnesses told police that she told people she feared the boy would "hunt" her newborn twins.</p>

<p>The child was last seen at the hospital when Singh gave birth to her twins and one other time in October 2022. Those who saw the child told police that he appeared "malnourished" and "unhealthy". Noel reportedly suffered from severe disabilities including chronic lung disease.</p>

<p>Singh was also reported to be "abusive and neglectful" to the child, relatives told police.</p>

<p>"One relative witnessed Cindy strike Noel in the face with keys for drinking water. Witnesses additionally stated that food and water were often withheld from Noel because Cindy did not like changing Noel's dirty diapers," police said.</p>

<p>According to a report by Fox News, Noel's grandmother had told police that Singh told her that she sold the 6-year-old to another woman at a grocery store.</p>

<h2><strong>Where is Cindy Rodriguez Singh?</strong></h2>

<p>In March 22, 2023, Singh along with her husband and six other children boarded an international flight for India and have not been located. The missing child was not with the family at the time, and did not board the flight.</p>

<p>The police first suspected Singh after she lied to officers, who had visited her home for a welfare check. She told them that the boy was living with his biological father in Mexico, and had been there since November 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/s-jaishankar" target="_blank">S Jaishankar</a> has signalled a distinct change in the government's Pakistan policy, stating "the era of uninterrupted dialogue... is over" but acknowledging also that New Delhi stands ready to react to developments across the border "whether positive or negative".</p>

<p>At a private event in Delhi this week, he also offered a stern "actions have consequences" warning to Pakistan, and those within who support terrorist attacks on India. "The issue is... what kind of relationship can we contemplate with Pakistan..." he responded to a question about ties with Pakistan.</p>

<p>On a suggestion that India is content for the relationship to continue as is, he said, "Maybe yes, maybe no... but what I do want to say is that we are not passive, and that whether events take a positive or negative direction... either way we will react."</p>

<p>India's relationship with Pakistan is volatile with border disputes in Jammu and Kashmir a regular flashpoint. New Delhi has often raised concerns over Pakistan's support - financial and logistical - of cross-border terrorism, red-flagging these in bilateral and international forums.</p>

<p>In March Mr Jaishankar, on a visit to Singapore, lamented Pakistan's "almost industry-level" sponsoring of terrorism and terror activities, but stressed "India will not skirt this problem..."</p>

<p>"How do you deal with a neighbour who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft? It's not one-off... but very sustained, almost at an industry level."</p>

<p>He indicated then that while New Delhi will always be open to a friendly dialogue to resolve disputes - as it has stressed in conflict between Russia and Ukraine and amid military tension in West Asia - this could not be at the continued cost of terrorist attacks on India and Indians.</p>

<p>"I don't have a quick instantaneous fix... but what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore. We are not going to say, 'Well, that happened and (now) let's continue our dialogue'... we should not give the other country a free pass," he said in Singapore.</p>

<p>A couple of months earlier Mr Jaishankar re-emphasised India's zero-tolerance stance on cross-border terrorism, and made it clear New Delhi would not, under any circumstance, overlook terror attacks.</p>

<p>"In this country, I think tolerance for any kind of cross-border terrorism is very low... there will be consequences. That is the message of Balakot," he said, referring to a precision strike by Indian armed forces on a terror training camp in Pakistan. This was after a terror attack that killed 19 soldiers.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's comment on dialogue with Pakistan must also be viewed against the backdrop of elections in Jammu and Kashmir in less than 20 days. The former state will hold its first Assembly election in a decade over three phases beginning September 18.</p>

<p>Ahead of voting both mainstream regional parties - the National Conference and the People's Democratic Party - have spoken about resuming dialogue and diplomatic ties with Pakistan.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The king of New Zealand's Maori died on Friday after heart surgery, with aides saying the beloved 69-year-old monarch, praised as a symbol of national unity, had "passed to the great beyond".</p>

<p>Spokesman Rahui Papa said King Tuheitia died peacefully surrounded by family, just days after celebrating the 18th anniversary of his coronation.</p>

<p>A symbol of Maori identity and kinship, Tuheitia occupied a largely ceremonial role and for most of his reign only spoke publicly once a year.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, he helped put New Zealand's rich Indigenous heritage at the centre of public life.</p>

<p>He campaigned to reduce high rates of Indigenous incarceration and for whales to be granted legal personhood, hoping to protect them from the ravages of evermore polluted and warming seas.</p>

<p>"The death of Kiingi Tuheitia is a moment of great sadness," Papa said in a statement. "A chief who has passed to the great beyond. Rest in love."</p>

<p>After a string of health problems, Tuheitia had been in hospital trying to recover from heart surgery when he died.</p>

<p>His body was brought on Friday afternoon to lie in state at a marae -- ceremonial grounds -- near the north island town of Ngaruawahia.</p>

<p>Black-clad mourners flocked to the site as news of the king's death spread.</p>

<h3><strong>Kawakawa leaves</strong></h3>

<p>New Zealand's Maori currently make up about 17 percent of the population, or about 900,000 people.</p>

<p>Women carried wreaths of kawakawa leaves on their heads and were cloaked in patterned shawls. Some prayed gently as they placed bouquets of flowers.</p>

<p>Many were marked with facial tattoos -- an indelible statement of pride in their Maori heritage.</p>

<p>They passed under an ochre-red archway, ornately carved with beaked figures, and into the ceremonial grounds.</p>

<p>Inside, leaders sang songs of bereavement -- the dirges and polyphonic melodies that have marked Maori funerals for generations.</p>

<p>A royal spokesperson told AFP that Tuheitia will lie in state before being buried on Wednesday at Mount Taupiri, the sacred "embracing mountain" that is the final resting place for Maori royals.</p>

<p>The process of electing his successor will be guided by a privy council.</p>

<p>During Tuheitia's past periods of ill health, his eldest son Whatumoana Te Aa Paki took over official duties.</p>

<h3><strong>'Immense fondness'</strong></h3>

<p>King Charles III, New Zealand's formal head of state, led the tributes, saying he was "shocked" having recently spoken to Tuheitia by phone.</p>

<p>"My wife and I were profoundly saddened to learn of the death of Kiingi Tuheitia," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I had the greatest pleasure of knowing Kiingi Tuheitia for decades."</p>

<p>The UK monarch said he remembered with "immense fondness" his meetings with Tuheitia in New Zealand in 2015 and at Buckingham Palace last year.</p>

<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon praised the king's "unwavering commitment to his people" as he ordered flags on government and public buildings to be flown at half-staff.</p>

<p>"Today, we mourn," Luxon said in a statement from Tonga, where he is attending the Pacific Islands Forum.</p>

<p>The Kiingitanga -- Maori King movement -- was founded in 1858 with the aim of uniting New Zealand's Indigenous Maori under a single sovereign, in the face of British colonisation.</p>

<p>The position has significant political and symbolic weight, but carries no legal status.</p>

<p>Tuheitia was the seventh Kiingitanga monarch.</p>

<h3><strong>Whales' rights</strong></h3>

<p>In 2006, Tuheitia succeeded his mother, Queen Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, who held the position for four decades.</p>

<p>During his reign he held countless ceremonies, visited the United Nations, met Pope Francis at the Vatican and represented a New Zealand delegation at the Olympic games in Paris.</p>

<p>Tuheitia called a 'hui' (national meeting) in January, when he asked for unity among Maori in response to concerns that the policies of the coalition government are undermining Indigenous rights.</p>

<p>In March, Tuheitia made international headlines with an impassioned call for whales to be granted the same legal rights as people, in a bid to protect vulnerable species.</p>

<p>He wanted the marine mammals to have inherent rights, such as having a healthy environment, to allow the restoration of their populations.</p>

<p>Chief of staff Ngira Simmonds told local media he would miss the king's love of music and community.</p>

<p>"I think what he will leave behind for this nation at large was his strong belief for unity, that unity is the best way forward for us as a nation," Simmonds said.</p>

<p>Around half a million New Zealanders tuned in to watch the last funeral of a Maori monarch when Tuheitia's mother was buried in 2006.</p>

<p>Maori expert Carwyn Jones told AFP, saying thousands would likely attend in person.</p>

<p>"Here is an opportunity to see (the Kiingitanga) operating and being a focal point for Maori."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of External Affairs is making efforts to push for an early return of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl from Thane district, who has been in foster care in Germany for the past 36 months following allegations of minor physical abuse, local MP Naresh Mhaske has said.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has assured him that the government is expediting legal processes to secure the return of the girl, Ariha. Her parents, who are currently in Germany, can now meet their daughter twice a month, said Mr Mhaske in a release on Thursday.</p>

<p>Ariha's parents Bhavesh and Dhara Shah are residents of Mira Bhayander in Thane district.</p>

<p>After the Thane MP raised the matter in Parliament earlier this month, the Foreign Minister wrote to him detailing the efforts being made through his ministry.</p>

<p>It was as a result of "our" intervention that the German Youth Welfare Authorities decided against appealing the court orders granting visitation for the parents, Mr Jaishankar said in his letter dated August 16.</p>

<p>"The matter has been raised with the German side at all levels, including personally by myself with my German counterpart where I emphasized that the long-term welfare of Ariha can only be ensured when she is brought up in her own socio-cultural environment in India," wrote Mr Jaishankar.</p>

</div>

<p>The MEA and embassy officials in Berlin are trying to ensure that the toddler is introduced to Indian culture and familiarised with the elements of the cultural environment of her original upbringing by sharing resources on Jainism, Indian festivals, and cultural and religious traditions with a request that the foster parent may use these resources appropriately, the letter said.</p>

<p>Ariha has been taken to Indian temples twice by embassy officials and efforts are being made to work out an arrangement under which she can be taught Gujarati/Hindi, he wrote.</p>

<p>"Pursuant to court orders, the parents have been granted visitation rights twice a month with the child (the time for which has also been increased recently by the courts) In addition, the German side has also been granting regular consular access for our Embassy officials to visit the child," the Foreign Minister said.</p>

<p>He has assured Mhaske that the government will continue to make all possible efforts to bring the child to India.</p>

<p>"It is important to note that this case centers around a minor girl child, and the aforementioned diplomatic efforts are all being undertaken in a consistent and continuous manner by the Ministry of External Affairs. I also hope that you would appreciate the sensitivities surrounding this case and handle the matter with appropriate discretion," added the letter.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After more than four years in the making, French video game designer Ubisoft on Friday released its much-anticipated "Star Wars Outlaws", an immersive spinoff from the famed saga.</p>

<p>The group's first foray into the universe created by George Lucas, "Outlaws" is an open-world adventure featuring Kay Vess, a young outlaw who travels the galaxy far away to pull off the heist of the century.</p>

<p>"This project is a childhood dream for many of us," the studio's creative director Julian Gerighty told AFP.</p>

<p>The game crafted by Sweden-based Massive Entertainment allows players to explore cities and space stations in a fictional planet truthful to the sci-fi epic.</p>

<p>While "Outlaws" is not the first <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/what-is-star-wars-day-why-is-it-celebrated-on-may-4-heres-everything-to-know-5584954" target="_blank">Star Wars</a>-themed game, Gerighty says his teams managed to design dense cities and ultra-realistic vessels thanks to the advent of state-of-the-art, powerful consoles.</p>

<p>"We created new planets, new moons, and characters that enter this universe," said Gerighty.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/star-wars-outlaws-like-reconnecting-with-childhood-developer-of-star-wars-outlaw-game-6079823" target="_blank">"Outlaws"</a>is the product of a partnership struck with the company LucasFilms, the video game branch of the Disney-owned franchise.</p>

<p>Its creators were granted access to the entertainment giant's "exclusive library with all the details and design documents" of Star Wars -- the key to rendering an authentic atmosphere.</p>

<h3><strong>An odyssey without Jedis</strong></h3>

<p>Fans however should not expect Jedis -- members of the saga's mystical knightly order. Rather, "Outlaws" brings the galaxy's underworld into the spotlight.</p>

<p>The world features iconic <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/princess-leias-star-wars-gold-bikini-sells-for-175-000-in-us-6211898" target="_blank">characters</a> and legendary locations, with planet Tatooine, where original hero Luke Skywalker was born, as its setting.</p>

<p>The "incredibly ambitious" project inserts itself between the events of the "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi", said Gerighty.</p>

<p>Some of the adventure's protagonists could appear in other productions, he added, as Disney in recent years has scaled up spinoffs from the franchise.</p>

<p>"Outlaws" will be the first Star Wars game to be developed by a publisher other than Electronic Arts (EA), since an exclusivity contract between the brand and the US firm ended in 2021.</p>

<p>Some gamers who were granted early access reported a few bugs, which the creators have pledged to fix.</p>

<h3><strong>A plethora of adaptations</strong></h3>

<p>EA since 2013 has rolled out a number of titles, from shooting multiplayer "Star Wars <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korea-set-to-deploy-starwars-laser-weapons-to-take-down-n-korean-drones-6087822" target="_blank">Battlefront</a>" to laser sabre combat "Jedi: Fallen Order" and "Jedi Survivor".</p>

<p>"These games have been key successes," said Mat Piscatella, an analyst for the industry-tracking firm Circana, who says Disney terminated its deal with EA to "maximise" revenue from the franchise.</p>

<p>The latest Star Wars video games have all ranked among the top 10 best-sellers in the US, according to Piscatella's figures -- the likely trajectory for "Outlaws".</p>

<p>"There has been a plethora of adaptations" since the late 1970s, said Thibaut Claudel, the author of "Star Wars - Disney and the legacy of George Lucas".</p>

<p>"As an entrepreneur and an artist, George Lucas has always been interested in gaming," which explains the "insane range" of games in the early 2000s, when the second trilogy came out, said Claudel.</p>

<p>"It's a lot of pressure on the creators," he added, pointing out that fans with high standards dissect every fresh release.</p>

<p>Once the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/may-the-fourth-be-with-you-internet-celebrates-star-wars-day-4004904" target="_blank">"Outlaws"</a> frenzy dies down, connoisseurs will shift their attention to "Star Wars Eclipse", a space epic by French studios Quantic Dream, who have yet to announce a release date.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's census will ask citizens about their sexuality for the first time, the government said Friday, a policy U-turn aimed at quelling anger from LGBTQ groups.</p>

<p>Supporters have said questions about sexual identity would provide a more accurate snapshot of who Australians are and who they love.</p>

<p>Just a day after his ministers explained the census change had been scrapped to avoid a divisive debate, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Friday that a question about sexuality would in fact be included in the 2026 survey.</p>

<p>Australia's statistics bureau has developed a new question about sexual orientation, which will now be tested before it can be included in the survey, he said.</p>

<p>"We think that is a common sense position," Albanese told public broadcaster ABC.</p>

<p>It is compulsory to complete the census in Australia, with fines for those who fail to do so.</p>

<p>But people would have the option of answering the sexual orientation question or not, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>Asked why the government had backed down, Albanese said: "No, this is the first time I have been asked about it."</p>

<p>He made no mention of plans to include a question about gender identity, however, saying only that there would not be "massive changes" to the census.</p>

<p>Equality Australia, a rights advocacy group, said it was now unclear how the census would affect trans and gender-diverse people, as well as people with innate variations of sex characteristics.</p>

<p>"We welcome the inclusion of a sexual orientation question but the national snapshot of our nation must include all of us, not just some of us," said Equality Australia chief executive Anna Brown.</p>

<p>"The federal government shouldn't pick and choose those of us who are worthy of being counted."</p>

<p>Brown said including LGBTQ people in the census would bring Australia into line with other countries that already do so, including Britain, Canada and New Zealand.</p>

<p>"It would be a shame if the government doesn't trust the Australian public enough to accept that the census needs to gather basic data about our nation for it be meaningful and useful," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has confirmed that an F16 fighter jet crashed and its pilot died while combating Russian airstrikes.</p>

<p>The F16 fighters participating in the combat had destroyed four missiles, and one of the aircraft lost contact while approaching the next target, the General Staff said in a statement on Telegram.</p>

<p>"As it turned out later, the plane crashed, and the pilot died," the statement said, without specifying the date of the incident.</p>

<p>The special commission of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is working on the scene to determine the cause of the crash, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian Air Force said pilot Oleksii Mes was killed on August 26 while repelling a Russian attack on Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Air Force did not specify whether Mes was an F16 pilot.</p>

<p>In early August, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the first batch of F16s had arrived in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naming others is considered a marker of highly advanced cognition in social animals, previously observed only in humans, bottlenose dolphins and African elephants.</p>

<p>Marmoset monkeys have now joined this exclusive club, according to a new study published in Science on Thursday.</p>

<p>The diminutive primates use loud, high-pitched calls to assign each other "vocal labels," as shown in research conducted by a team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"We are very interested in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/education/iit-mandi-study-deploys-robots-to-unravel-homing-behaviour-in-animals-6421711" target="_blank">social behavior</a> because we think that social behavior is essentially what drove us humans to be so special compared to other animals," senior author David Omer told AFP.</p>

<p>"We don't run fast, we don't fly, we don't excel in anything else besides being social and all our achievements as a society are our societal achievements."</p>

<p>Marmosets are ideal subjects to study the evolution of social behavior and language in humans, he explained, because they exhibit similar traits, living in small monogamous family groups of six to eight individuals that cooperatively rear their young.</p>

<p>Led by graduate student Guy Oren, the researchers recorded natural conversations between pairs of marmosets separated by a visual barrier, as well as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/iit-researchers-discover-how-animals-find-their-way-home-using-robots-6434736" target="_blank">interactions</a> between the monkeys and a computer system that played back pre-recorded calls.</p>

<p>They discovered that marmosets use "phee calls" -- very high-pitched vocalizations, as loud as power tools -- to address one another. Notably, the monkeys could recognize when such calls were directed at them and were more likely to respond when addressed by their name.</p>

<p>The ten marmosets they tested came from three separate families, and the research also revealed that members within a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/research-suggests-cats-mourn-the-death-of-companion-animals-even-dogs-6325308" target="_blank">family group</a> used similar sound features to code different names, akin to dialects or accents in humans. This held true even for adult marmosets that weren't related by blood, suggesting they learned from others within the family group.</p>

<p>Marmosets are relatively distant relatives of humans. We last shared a common ancestor around 35 million years ago, while the split between ourselves and chimpanzees could have happened 5-7 million years ago.</p>

<p>Rather than genetic proximity, Omer attributes the acquisition of vocal labels by marmosets to "convergent evolution," or the idea that they evolved similar traits in response to comparable environmental challenges.</p>

<p>For marmosets, vocal labeling may have been crucial for maintaining <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/can-hippos-fly-new-uk-research-reveals-bizarre-finding-6065938" target="_blank">social bonds</a> and group cohesion in the dense rainforests of South America, where visibility is often limited.</p>

<p>How and when humans first began talking is a matter of debate, but until recently many scientists had dismissed the idea we could look to other primates for clues. Omer stressed the latest research was yet another blow to that long-standing opinion.</p>

<p>"We can still learn a lot from non-human <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/animals-experience-time-differently-from-humans-16566" target="_blank">primates</a> about the evolution of language in humans," he said.</p>

<p>The team's statistical analysis of the marmosets' calls was made possible by recent advancements in computational power and machine learning, he added. Looking ahead, one exciting avenue for future research could be leveraging AI to further decipher the content of marmoset conversations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also have been in talks about participating in the financing that is led by Thrive Capital, which is investing about $1 billion]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia Corp., the world's biggest chipmaker, has discussed joining a funding round for OpenAI that would value the artificial intelligence startup at more than $100 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also have been in talks about participating in the financing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The round would be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing about $1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. Nvidia has discussed investing about $100 million, two of the people said.</p>

<p>If the discussions move forward, it would mean the three most valuable tech companies are all backing OpenAI, maker of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft was already OpenAI's biggest funder, having invested roughly $13 billion.</p>

<p>Representatives for Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI and Thrive all declined to comment.</p>

<p>Big Tech's influence over artificial intelligence has been drawing mounting scrutiny, with regulators in both the EU and US expressing concerns about Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and Microsoft's close relationship with OpenAI. Microsoft has tightly integrated OpenAI's services into its Windows and Copilot AI platforms - a bet that the capabilities will help drive growth.</p>

<p>Apple has existing ties with OpenAI as well. The iPhone maker is adding ChatGPT to its new suite of AI features, called Apple Intelligence. The company also was slated to take a board observer seat at OpenAI - alongside Microsoft - but those plans were dropped in July.</p>

<p>Nvidia, meanwhile, supplies the critical infrastructure needed to develop and run AI tools like ChatGPT. It's the biggest maker of so-called AI accelerators, sales of which have soared over the past two years.</p>

<p>In Nvidia's latest quarterly report, released on Wednesday, revenue more than doubled to $30 billion. It predicted even bigger sales in the current quarter, topping the average analysts estimates, though investors have grown so accustomed to blowout results that the shares still declined.</p>

<p>OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees in a memo Wednesday that the company was seeking fresh capital, without giving details, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has been in discussions to raise funding at a valuation at or above $100 billion since at least December, Bloomberg has reported.</p>

<p>The financing would bolster one of the world's most valuable venture-backed startups. The runaway success of ChatGPT also has kicked off an arms race among tech companies, which are integrating AI technology across their products and funding other promising startups.</p>

<p>In her memo to employees, Friar said that OpenAI would use the financing to acquire more computing power and fund other operating expenses, the people said.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal previously reported on the discussions with Apple.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Resumes of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the most iconic figures in the world of technology, have resurfaced on social media. These vintage documents, created when they were 18, offer a rare glimpse into the early lives of two tech innovators who changed the world.</p>

<p>The 1973 resume of Steve Jobs underlines his focus on electronics and technology. Mr Jobs, who would go on to revolutionise the tech industry with Apple, listed "electronics" and "tech" as his special abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bill Gates' resume, dated 1971, lists his experience with various programming languages, including FORTRAN, COBOL and BASIC, and computers, including PDP-10, PDP-8, and CDC-6400.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Gates put down his salary at the time as $35,000, a substantial amount for a young student in the 1970s. He also mentioned his ongoing partnership with Paul G Allen, with whom he would later co-found Microsoft.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Inc and Pixar Animation Studios. He introduced the Apple II, one of the first successful personal computers. He was forced out of Apple in 1985 but returned in 1997 and led the company's resurgence with products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Mr Jobs' leadership, Apple became one of the most valuable companies in the world. He died on October 5, 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bill Gates co-founded Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company, with Paul Allen in 1975. He showed a keen interest in computer programming at a young age and began writing his code when he was just 13. Mr Gates and Mr Allen developed the operating system MS-DOS, which became a huge success. In 1985, Microsoft released Windows, a graphical user interface for MS-DOS, which revolutionised personal computing.</p>

<p>Mr Gates is also known for his philanthropic efforts. He established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, which focuses on global health, education and poverty alleviation. Today, Mr Gates is no longer actively involved in Microsoft's day-to-day operations, but he remains the company's technology advisor.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Insurers of the Bayesian superyacht that sank this month, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, could be on the hook for at least $150 million, according to the first estimates by industry experts.</p>

<p>The British-flagged 56-metre-long (184-foot-long) yacht, which the experts estimated cost around $40 million, capsized and went down on August 19 within minutes of being hit by a pre-dawn storm while anchored off northern Sicily.</p>

<p>The superyacht's hull was insured against physical damage by yacht insurance provider OMAC and a consortium of insurers including Travelers Companies Inc, Navium Marine and Convex, Reuters reported last week.</p>

<p>Its protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) insurance, which typically covers third-party liability claims including for environmental damage, injury and death, was provided by British Marine.</p>

<p>The hull was likely insured for around $40 million, while the P&amp;I cover would be larger, insurance sources said.</p>

<p>"Our understanding is that the cost of the boat was between $40 and $50 million, so the limit of the hull &amp; machinery policy was probably around those values," said Marcos Alvarez, managing director of global financial institution ratings at Morningstar DBRS.</p>

<p>The P&amp;I policy would likely be "several multiples" of the hull policy, or $200-300 million, Alvarez added, noting it would also likely cover liability payments even if the captain or crew are found to be negligent.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in the town of Termini Imerese, near Palermo, are investigating the captain and two other crew members. An investigation does not imply guilt or mean formal charges will follow. Prosecutors have said the probe would take time and require salvaging the wreck.</p>

<p>Oscar Seikaly, CEO of broker NSI Insurance Group, that provides yacht insurance, estimated the hull value at $40-70 million, but said P&amp;I cover might not total more than $100 million.</p>

<p>P&amp;I insurance would also cover recovery of the Bayesian, said Francesco Dubbioso, country manager for Italy for insurer Alta Signa Europe, who estimated the superyacht's value at $30 million to $40 million.</p>

<p>Reuters is the first to report the potential insurance costs. OMAC, Travelers and Navium Marine did not immediately respond to Reuters' for comment. Convex declined to comment.</p>

<p>The Bayesian disaster, which has puzzled experts who said the boat would have been built to withstand a severe storm, adds to recent woes&nbsp;for yacht insurers, who have faced a raft of hurricane losses in the past few years.</p>

<p>Premium rates have risen by four to five times in the past couple of years in parts of the US and the Caribbean, and yacht insurers have cut the amount of cover they provide because of the risks, Seikaly said.</p>

<p>As a result, insurers have increased rates and re-evaluated their guidelines and risk appetite, according to industry experts.</p>

<p>As well as hurricanes, insured losses have mostly stemmed from severe storms, floods, and other weather events in North America, the Caribbean, and Europe, according to a report by broker Marsh.</p>

<p>Seikaly said four clients had last week been ready to buy boats but changed their minds because of the high cost of insurance.</p>

<p>Climate change was also likely to add to yacht insurers' worries, Seikaly added, as it throws up more unexpected events.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing abortion at home using pills is safe and may ease hospital burden, claimed a study published in The Lancet journal on Friday.</p>

<p>The randomised controlled trial of 435 women by Swedish researchers analysed women who took the first dose of misoprostol (a pill given as part of the procedure for medical abortions) at home or in the hospital.</p>

<p>Those who took the pill at home had a 71 per cent chance of completing their care in hospital within 9 hours with no overnight stay, compared to 46 per cent of women who took the first dose of misoprostol at the hospital.</p>

<p>Women in hospital settings are more likely to find abortion "stressful and isolating", compared to those at home.</p>

<p>In a medical abortion (also known as abortion with pills) women are typically prescribed two types of pills.</p>

<p>Mifepristone, which blocks the hormone progesterone therefore causing the lining of the uterus to break down, is usually prescribed in a clinic.</p>

<p>Misoprostol, which makes the womb contract, can be taken two days later. The medicine has to be taken every few hours until the abortion is complete.</p>

<p>"Offering the choice to take the first dose of misoprostol at home provides a safe and effective alternative to taking all misoprostol doses at the hospital and enables women to self-manage some of the process," said Johanna Rydelius, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

<p>This can also help women with "feelings of autonomy during a time where they can feel extremely vulnerable", Rydelius said.</p>

<p>Previous studies indicate that most medical abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy are completed within eight to 12 hours after the first misoprostol dose and require an average of two to three misoprostol doses, with some patients needing to stay overnight in the hospital.</p>

<p>Rydelius said that in the study, "1 per cent of the women who took misoprostol at home completed the abortion before attending hospital for the next dose."</p>

<p>The study, however, found no difference in the average pain score, types and number of side effects, or rates of admittance to hospital earlier than planned between the two groups.</p>

<p>The patients in the home treatment group (1 per cent ) had the abortion on the way to the hospital, between one to two hours after taking the first dose of misoprostol.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chatbot startup Character.AI laid off at least 5% of its staff, The Information reported on Thursday, citing a person briefed by company leaders.</p>

<p>The employees who were laid off mostly worked on marketing and recruiting for the startup, the report said.</p>

<p>"We are refocusing the company to ensure all roles align with our new direction to build personalized AI (artificial intelligence) products," a Character.AI spokesperson told Reuters.</p>

<p>"As a result, we have made a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/ai-job-cuts-coming-survey-shows-companies-plan-to-shrink-workforce-5385210" target="_blank">small reduction</a> in our workforce," the spokesperson said, without giving the numbers of the laid off employees.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Character.AI signed an agreement with Alphabet's Google that grants the search engine giant a non-exclusive license to the chatbot maker's large language model technology.</p>

<p>Character.AI will get more funding as part of the deal with Google, the startup had said in a blog, without disclosing the amount.</p>

<p>Character.AI previously raised $193 million in venture capital from investors including Andreessen Horowitz.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The condition of a Missouri teen, who contracted the West Nile virus just over two weeks ago, has left many concerned in the United States. The 18-year-old has been left paralysed and on a ventilator in the ICU, <a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/hazelwood-teen-fights-west-nile-virus-for-over-two-weeks/">Fox News</a> reported. John Procter VI's case has also led to many asking what the virus is and how it spreads.</p>

<p>West Nile virus is one of the primary causes of mosquito-borne disease in the US. The virus spreads in the human body when an infected mosquito bites a person. According to the <a href="http://https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, West Nile cases occur throughout the mosquito season, from summer to autumn. Since its first report in 1999, there have been over 51,000 cases of West Nile in the United States, reported <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10939-west-nile-virus">Cleveland Clinic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How it spreads</strong></p>

<p>Humans contract the West Nile virus when mosquitoes first feed on infected birds and then bite people, according to the CDC. Unlike birds, humans do not produce sufficient quantities of the virus in their bloodstream, making them dead-end hosts.</p>

<p><b>How birds get infected</b></p>

<p>Birds get infected with the West Nile virus when an infected mosquito bites them. Mosquitoes become carriers after feeding or biting an infected bird, forming a chain of sorts. Predators such as hawks and owls or scavengers -- crows -- may also get infected after eating other dead birds that already had the West Nile virus.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

<p>As per the CDC, eight of the 10 people who get infected with the West Nile virus do not show any symptoms.</p>

<p>Approximately one in five infected individuals experience a fever and additional symptoms such as joint pain, body aches, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and sore throat. After the person recovers, weakness and fatigue may persist for weeks or months.</p>

<p>One out of 150 people may develop serious illness after contracting the West Nile virus. In some cases, it can affect the central nervous system, causing inflammation of the brain aka encephalitis, and inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord aka meningitis.</p>

<p>Some symptoms of severe illness include neck stiffness, high fever, disorientation, tremors, convulsions, vision loss, muscle weakness, paralysis, and coma. It can affect people of any age but those above 60 are more prone to it. People already dealing with chronic ailments like diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and kidney diseases are at a greater risk too.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b></p>

<p>No particular medicines are available to treat West Nile, says the CDC. Antibiotics are also of no use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over-the-counter medications, plenty of sleep, and drinking fluids can alleviate the symptoms.</p>

<p>In case of severe symptoms, the patient should be hospitalised for treatment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two women in China have been accused of child abuse after they separated a crying child from her grandmother and locked her in the toilet of a plane to "educate her". According to the <em>BBC</em>, the incident took place on August 24 onboard a Juneyao Airlines flight from the southwestern city of Guiyang to Shanghai. The little girl, who was travelling with her grandmother, started crying during the flight, following which the two women passengers locked the distressed child in the toilet, saying that they trying to help others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident went viral on the Chinese internet after one of the two women, identified as Gou Tingting, posted a video of herself carrying the girl inside the toilet. The clip also showed the other woman telling the child that she could only leave the bathroom if she stopped crying. They presented themselves as trying to help others on board, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nj5l0gego" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. However, many people on the internet accused the two of "bullying" the child and lacking empathy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The airline, on the other hand, said that the girl's grandmother had agreed to let two women take the girl to the toilet. It also added that it had also spoken to the child's mother, who was not on the flight, and who "expressed her understanding" of the women's behaviour, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/29/chinese-women-spark-anger-after-locking-crying-toddler-in-plane-toilet#:~:text=Two%20women%20in%20China%20have,of%20the%20locked%20lavatory%20door." rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But shortly after the video was posted online, many criticised the women for lacking "empathy" and "bullying" the child. Responding to the criticism, Ms Gou said she "prefers to take action rather than be a bystander". "I just wanted to calm the child down and let everyone rest," she wrote on Chinese social media platform Douyin. The woman also explained that some passengers had "moved to the back of the plane to escape the noise" while others stuffed tissue papers into their ears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Ms Gou's explanation did little to quell the backlash, and her social media account has since been set to private. "Children cannot control their emotions when they are one or two years old. What's wrong with crying? Didn't you cry when you were young too?" one user wrote, per the <em>BBC</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another user, concerned about the psychological impact on the girl, said, "We should be thinking about how public spaces can better accept and accommodate young children."</p>

<p>But there were some who also defended the women, saying that their actions were justified as the girl's grandmother had given her consent. "To be honest, some children cannot do without some education," one user wrote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old Missouri teen has been fighting for his life in a hospital for two weeks after contracting the West Nile virus. John Procter VI's nightmare began when he experienced what seemed to be routine symptoms such as headache and dizziness on August 8, but rapidly worsened, leaving him paralysed and on a ventilator in the ICU, reported <a href="https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/hazelwood-teen-fights-west-nile-virus-for-over-two-weeks/ ">Fox News</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, when he visited urgent care, he was diagnosed with a tension headache and sent home with over-the-counter medication. Soon, his condition worsened, leading to violent vomiting and a high fever that had him in and out of the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They thought he had meningitis, so they did some tests for that," his father, John Procter V, shared with a local news station. "It came back negative."</p>

<p>The following day, he had stroke-like symptoms and pneumonia, his father recalled. "Unable to move, and his speech was real slurred," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rushed back to the hospital, the 18-year-old was admitted to the ICU and placed on a ventilator. Despite being treated at four different hospitals, it took over 20 doctors more than two weeks to identify the cause of his rapid decline - West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne illness.</p>

<p>The virus has taken a devastating toll on Mr Procter's body. According to his father, the teenager has restricted mobility, particularly on his left side. He requires assistance to support his weight and head.</p>

<p>Despite the grim situation, there have been some "small but vast" improvements, his father said. Mr Procter has undergone a tracheostomy to help with breathing and has begun physical therapy.</p>

<p>John Procter VI, who dreamt of becoming a diesel mechanic, now faces a long and challenging recovery. "Doctors say this will be a marathon to try and get him back to what he was before this virus almost killed him," his father wrote on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-john-procter-vis-bbs-road-to-recovery?qid=2daa0f5bf32db46e90cbb4a958d1d683 ">GoFundMe</a> page set up to help cover the mounting medical expenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most people infected with West Nile virus don't show symptoms, but rare cases can be severe, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html">CDC</a>). About 1 in 150 people will develop serious illnesses like meningitis or encephalitis, which can cause fever, headache, paralysis and even coma. Recovery from a severe case can take weeks or months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

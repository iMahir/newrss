       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week India crossed a major milestone as a top global investment destination. Latest data reveals that Foreign Direct Investment into India crossed a thousand-billion-dollar mark since the turn of the century, showing how India has been the favoured destination for foreign investors.</p>

<p>The data released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade or DPIIT showed that the cumulative amount of FDI, including equity, reinvested earnings and other capital, stood at USD 1,033.40 billion (or $1 trillion) between April 2000 and September 2024.</p>

<p>To get a perspective of just how gigantic a trillion dollars really is, let's take this simple example - If a person was to earn one dollar (Rs. 84) per second (i.e. a trillion dollars in trillion seconds) - then it would take the person 11.5 days to earn a million dollars. But here's where is gets interesting. Continuing to earn a dollar a second, it would take the person 31.7 years to reach the billion-dollar mark, and a staggering 31,709 years to reach the trillion-dollar figure.</p>

<p>Another thought-provoking way to look at this is that India, which is the fifth largest global economy, has an overall GDP of around $3.89 trillion in 2024. It used to be around $2 trillion in 2014. Now compare that to the FDI inflow of $1 trillion in the last two decades.</p>

<h2><strong>SOURCE OF THE FDI</strong></h2>

<p>So, where did all this investment come from? Which are the countries from which these investments flowed in? One might assume that the top spot would be either the US, which is the largest economy in the world, or perhaps China, which is the second-largest economy globally. But it's neither.</p>

<p>The country which has contributed the most in terms of FDI in India during this period is Mauritius - a massive 25 per cent of all FDI inflows came via this route. Mauritius was closely followed by Singapore at 24 per cent. The United States of America came a distant third with 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Other countries which have invested significantly in India include The Netherlands at 7 per cent, Japan at 6 per cent, The UK at 5 per cent, UAE at 3 per cent, and the Cayman Islands, Germany, and Cyprus all accounting for 2 per cent each.</p>

<h2><strong>SECTORS WHICH SAW BIG INVESTMENT</strong></h2>

<p>The sector which saw the highest investment was the services and allied sector. There was significant investment in computer software and hardware, telecommunications, trading, construction, infrastructure development, automobile, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.</p>

<h2><strong>FDI INFLOWS ON THE RISE</strong></h2>

<p>Of the 1,033 billion dollars, USD 667.4 billion came in the last ten years between 2014 and 2024 showing a 119 per cent uptick in investment when compared to the previous decade. The data also revealed that FDI inflows have come for nearly 60 sectors across 31 states and union territories in India.</p>

<p>To attract more investment over time, India has also made its investment policies liberal and lucrative. Reforms have resulted in most sectors, barring ones of strategic importance, see 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.</p>

<p>Giving impetus to the 'Make in India' initiative, the manufacturing sector has seen a 69 per cent rise in FDI in the last ten years as compared to the prior ten.</p>

<h2><strong>WHICH SECTORS ARE OPEN AND WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE</strong></h2>

<p>FDI is allowed through the automatic route in most of the sectors, while in areas like telecom, media, pharmaceuticals and insurance, government approval is required for foreign investors.</p>

<p>Under the government approval route, a foreign investor has to get a prior nod from the ministry or department concerned, whereas, under the automatic route, an overseas investor is only required to inform the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after the investment is made.</p>

<p>At present, FDI is prohibited in some sectors. They are lottery, gambling and betting, chit funds, Nidhi company, real estate business, and manufacturing of cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes using tobacco.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Russia has warned its citizens to not visit the US since relations with Washington are confrontational, claiming that they could risk being "hunted" by American authorities.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia-US ties are at an all time low, and probably worse than the time since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when both the countries were closest to an intentional nuclear war, because of the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>Russia has warned its citizens to not visit the US since relations with Washington are confrontational, claiming that they could risk being "hunted" by American authorities.</p>

<p>Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the warning through a news briefing on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Trips to the United States of America privately or out of official necessity are fraught with serious risks," she said, and described US-Russia relations as "on the verge of rupture".</p>

<p>She further issued warnings to avoid travelling to Canada and to the US allies in the European Union saying, "We urge you to continue to refrain from trips to the United States of America and its allied satellite states, including, first of all, Canada and, with a few exceptions, European Union countries, during these holidays."</p>

<p>In a similar way, the US has also issued a notice to its citizens on avoiding travel in Russia, saying "they may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials".</p>

<p>The US has backed Ukraine with $62 billion in military aid since the war began in February 2022 and further escalating the issue, last month the US authorised Ukraine to use long-range missiles deep into Russia. This became a watershed moment in the war and the move triggered Moscow to lower its nuclear threshold.</p>

<p>In addition, the US has now handed Ukraine a $20 billion loan, which President Biden said "will be paid back by the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets".</p>

<p>"These loans will support the people of Ukraine as they defend and rebuild their country. And our efforts make it clear: tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause," he added.</p>

<p>In any case, the White House states that it is only protecting its own interest by supplying weapons to Ukraine meanwhile Russia says the US is merely using Ukraine to weaken and ultimately destroy Russia.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government will allocate 75 million pounds ($96 million) to compensate LGBTQ military veterans sacked by the army over their sexual orientation, the defence ministry announced on Thursday.</p>

<p>Until a 2000 reform, lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people were barred from military service in Britain. Those who were found out were often harassed, abused and sacked, according to a government-commissioned report last year.</p>

<p>Seeking to right "historic wrongs", former armed forces members or employees sacked over their sexuality or gender identity will be eligible to receive £50,000 each, the defence ministry said -- a larger amount than initially expected.</p>

<p>"The historic treatment of LGBT veterans was a moral stain on our nation. Our government is determined to right the wrongs of the past and recognise the hurt that too many endured," Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement.</p>

<p>Besides losing their jobs and being subjected to public humiliation, the veterans involved were sometimes stripped of their pension benefits, living the rest of their lives in poverty.</p>

<p>"We fully welcome our LGBT veterans back into Defence, and acknowledge their vital contribution to keeping the nation safe," said Minister for Veterans Alistair Carns.</p>

<p>Additional compensation of £1,000 to £20,000 will be offered based on the "suffering" of particular individuals, whether harassment, brutal interrogations or imprisonment, officials said.</p>

<p>Victims will also be able to request the reinstatement of their military rank and medals.</p>

<p>Parliament is due to debate the measure on Thursday, but veterans can already begin filing their compensation requests online.</p>

<p>In July 2023, a report ordered by Britain's then-Conservative Party government revealed the "horrendous" treatment of LGBTQ veterans who had served between 1967 and 2000.</p>

<p>The day it was published, former prime minister Rishi Sunak apologised on behalf of the government. He then set in motion the process that led to Thursday's reparations announcement.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump said "anything can happen" when asked about the chances of going to war with Iran during his next term in an interview with Time, coinciding with his being named the magazine's Person of the Year.</p>

<p>"Anything can happen. Anything can happen. It's a very volatile situation," Trump said, before going on to say he thinks the most dangerous thing happening now is Ukraine shooting missiles into Russia, which he said was a major escalation.</p>

<p>Trump has previously threatened Iran, whose elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have sought to assassinate him, according to the US government. Iran has denied the claim.</p>

<p>During his first term in office, in 2020, Trump ordered a US air strike that killed Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Trump in 2018 also reneged on a nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and re-imposed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran that had been relaxed. The deal had limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium, a process that can yield fissile material for nuclear weapons.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The garland, which was worn by Gandhi-ji during the Salt March, was expected to fetch between GBP 20-30,000 but remains open for bids.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A unique and historic tinselled garland presented to Mahatma Gandhi during the iconic Dandi March in 1930 failed to meet its guide price at a recent UK auction. The garland, which was worn by Gandhi-ji during the Salt March, was expected to fetch between GBP 20-30,000 but remains open for bids.</p>

<p>"I am very surprised that the 'Gandhi Garland' did not find a home on the day of the auction," said Kristina Sanne, Head of Sale at the auction house specialising in fine arts and antiques.</p>

<p>"That said, we have had quite a lot of interest since the sale and hope to sell it to the highest bidder. It deserves a great home," she said.</p>

<p>The garland is a significant piece of Indian history, composed of a large teardrop-shaped medallion of pink cloth backed on card, applied with silver and gold thread and sequins. It is edged with gold tinsel and features four smaller rectangular medallions and two triangular medallions similarly decorated.</p>

<p>The garland was presented to Gandhi-ji by Nanduben Kanuga, the wife of Dr Balvantrai N Kanuga, Gandhi-ji's personal physician. It has remained in the Kanuga family collection until now.</p>

<p>While the Gandhi-ji garland failed to sell, other highlight lots in the auction attracted fierce bidding. A fine illustration from a Bhagavata Purana series from Punjab sold for GBP 27,700, exceeding its estimate. A group of six Rajput Equestrian Portraits from Rajasthan fetched GBP 20,160, and an album of Kalighat Paintings sold for GBP 21,420.</p>

<p>According to Kristina Sanne, Head of Sale at the auction house, the Indian Art section saw frantic bidding throughout, with over 90% of lots sold. This demonstrates the continued buoyancy of the Indian Art market.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ellen Greenberg, a vibrant 27-year-old teacher in the US, was found dead in 2011 with 20 stab wounds and at least 11 bruises. Her death was initially ruled a homicide. But investigators, following a meeting, would change their minds again and list her death as "suicide". Now, even after 13 years, her case remains shrouded in controversy. In a hearing on Wednesday, lawyers squared before a judge, arguing 13-year-old details surrounding Ms Greenberg's death, <em>The Independent</em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Joshua Greenberg and his wife, Sandra "Sandee" Greenberg, are convinced that the investigation into their daughter's brutal 2011 stabbing death was botched, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/stabbing-ellen-greenberg-lawsuit-hearing-b2662932.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>. At the hearing, the Greenbergs' attorneys tried to convince a judge to let their case be heard by a jury. They alleged a deep-seated conspiracy, claiming the city's police department and medical examiner's office conspired to "hide" a homicide to effectively cover up a botched investigation into Ms Greenberg's death.</p>

<h3><strong>Ellen Greenberg's death&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Greenberg's body was found in the kitchen of her apartment in January 2011. She was slumped against the cabinets, her legs splayed out in front of her and had been stabbed at least 20 times, with puzzling wounds to her back, neck and the back of her head. A 10-inch knife was also lodged in her chest.</p>

<p>Philadelphia pathologist Marlon Osbourne initially ruled her death a homicide. However, as police began an investigation, they publicly challenged the findings, and her death was reclassified as suicide.</p>

<p>Ms Greenberg's parents are now seeking to have the determination changed back to homicide or underdetermined. They have filed two lawsuits, one seeking to change the ruling on their daughter's death certificate and the other alleging a conspiracy by local officials to cover up a murder. Both lawsuits are still active.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Greenbergs' attorney Joseph Podraza presented the family's arguments in their civil lawsuit against five Philadelphia officials, including the chief medical examiner at the time of the autopsy, detectives on the case, and the city of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"The police department botched the investigation starting January 26," Mr Podraza said in court, arguing that the crime scene was left unattended and by the time police returned, there was nothing to work with. The lack of progress ultimately triggered a cover-up, he suggested.</p>

<p>"These premises have been compromised. The evidence has been tampered with," Mr Podraza said, adding, "We can't rule out the presence of a third party when Ellen was killed, when she died."</p>

<p>Ms Greenberg's parents have been working for over a decade to get their daughter's case heard in court. On Wednesday, the judge said he would make a decision on whether or not the case could go before a jury by the end of January. In the meantime, the Greenbergs are not giving up.</p>

<p>"I'm glad the public is getting an opportunity to observe the way things work in this city ... the things that have gone down, the mistakes that were made, the lies that have been told," said Sandee Greenberg, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, while criminal charges remain inactive for now, Pennsylvania law places no statute of limitations on homicide, leaving a glimmer of hope for Ellen Greenberg's family.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rates of bowel cancer are rising among younger adults, a new study found that also revealed that rates are rising faster in England than in almost any other country. According to the <em>BBC</em>, global data suggests that doctors are seeing people under-50s develop early-onset bowel cancer. An increase in rates was reported in 27 of the 50 countries examined, with the greatest annual increases seen in New Zealand (4%), Chile (4%), Puerto Rico (3.8%), and England (3.6%), the researchers wrote in the study, published in the journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2824%2900600-4/fulltext" rel="noindex,nofollow">Lancet Oncology</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts are still trying to understand the reasons behind the rise. The authors of the study said consumption of junk food, high levels of physical inactivity and the obesity epidemic were likely to be among the factors, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4rnzq47z2o" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>. Eating too much-processed meat and not enough fibre can also increase the risk, per the study.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The increase in early-onset colorectal cancer is a global phenomenon," said Hyuna Sung, a senior principal scientist in cancer surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study. "Previous studies have shown this rise in predominately high-income western countries, but now it is documented in various economies and regions worldwide," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study found bowel cancer rates in people aged between 25 and 49 rose in 27 of the 50 countries studied in the decade to 2017. Young women were found to have faster increases in early bowel cancer rates than men if they lived in England, Norway, Australia, Turkey, Costa Rica or Scotland.</p>

<p>Experts said people need to be aware of the early signs and symptoms, such as blood in poo. Other symptoms include a persistent change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The global scope of this concerning trend highlights the need for innovative tools to prevent and control cancers linked to dietary habits, physical inactivity and excess body weight," said Mr Sung.</p>

<p>"Ongoing efforts are essential to identify the additional factors behind these trends and to develop effective prevention strategies tailored to younger generations and local resources worldwide," he added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Chess Champion title is a heavy and prestigious one to bear and although there are many great minds in chess, there are only a select few who have found a place in the sun at a young age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the five youngest World Chess Champions in the world:</p>

<h2><strong>Gukesh Dommaraju (India)</strong></h2>

<p>In a dramatic finale, 18 year old D. Gukesh dethroned Ding Liren of China and became the youngest World Chess Champion in history, in 2024. Gukesh started playing chess at the age of 7, and got his first taste of success at the Under-9 section of the Asian School Chess Championships in 2015.</p>

<p>But 2023 was an eventful year for Gukesh when he unleashed himself to the world as the youngest player to reach a rating of 2750. The same year, he outperformed Viswanathan Anand as the top-ranked Indian chess player and clinched India's first-ever Chess Olympiad gold.</p>

<h3><strong>Garry Kasparov (Russia)</strong></h3>

<p>Garry Kasparov was the youngest World Chess Champion at 22 years of age when he defeated Anatoly Karpov in 1985. He started playing chess at the age of 6 and at the age of 17, he became an international grandmaster in 1980. He was mentored by former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik.</p>

<p>In 1996, famously, Kasparov defeated an IBM custom built chess computer called Deep Blue. However, after an upgrade in 1997, the machine prevailed over Kasparov. He later retired from competitive chess in 2005.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he also started a political organisation called the United Civil Front to oppose President Vladimir Putin of Russia.</p>

<h3><strong>Magnus Carlsen (Norway)</strong></h3>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India aims to move to a system of holding a singular, unified, gargantuan election in which citizens elect both the Central government and respective state (federal) governments.</p>

<p>This will not be the first time India attempts this system of election. When the country earned its Independence in 1947, the founding fathers had planned for this very model of election - simultaneous parliamentary and state assembly polls. From the very first election held in the country - in 1952 - this was the way India voted.</p>

<p>But all that changed in 1967 - when India voted for the last time under the 'One Nation, One Election' format. At the time, all of India voted in a single phase, except for Uttar Pradesh (formerly United Provinces), which voted in four phases. Polling was conducted between the 15th and 21st of February that year. This was India's fourth such election and polling was carried out to elect MPs and MLAs to 520 Lok Sabha seats and 3,563 Assembly constituencies.</p>

<p>Then the era of coalition politics peaked, and ultimately led to the end of simultaneous elections in the country. Till 1967, the Congress was the only party which governed India, but by then it was facing several challenges and setbacks. India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had died a few year ago, his daughter, Indira Gandhi was facing pressure from key allies; the Congress was facing large-scale anti-incumbency as well as struggling with an internal power tussle, and to top it all, India had lost the 1962 war against China.</p>

<p>Six decades hence, India now looks to resume the 'One Nation, One Election'. The Union Cabinet led by the Prime Minister has cleared the proposal and approved the bills to implement it. It will now likely be tabled in Parliament in the ongoing Winter Session, with an aim to be passed Constitutionally for it to become the norm.</p>

<h2><strong>OTHER NATIONS WITH SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS</strong></h2>

<p>Before this stage was reached, a high-level panel had been formed. It was led by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The panel not just studied how India carried out such elections in the past and what the loopholes were at the time, but also carried out extensive research on how such elections are carried out across the world.</p>

<p>During its global research, the panel focused on seven countries - South Africa, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Indonesia, The Philippines, and Japan - all of which carry out simultaneous elections and have been doing so successfully. The panel then submitted its findings and a proposed working model to the President of India, Droupadi Murmu earlier this year.</p>

<p>In its report, the panel stated that a detailed comparative analysis of countries with similar electoral processes was studied to understand their workings of conducting simultaneous elections. The aim of understanding multiple models from different nations carrying out unified, simultaneous polls was to learn and adopt the best international practices and to ensure fairness and transparency in the electoral process.</p>

<p>"In South Africa, voters cast their ballots for both the National Assembly and Provincial Legislatures simultaneously. However, municipal elections are held separately from provincial ones in a five-year cycle," the report stated.</p>

<p>Sweden, the panel stated, functions on a proportional electoral system. This means that the number of seats a political party is assigned in the elected assembly is based on its share of votes in the election. "They have a system where elections for the Parliament (Riksdag), County Councils, and Municipal Councils all take place at the same time. These elections occur every four years on the second Sunday of September whereas elections to the municipal assemblies occur on the second Sunday of September, once every five years," it stated.</p>

<p>The panel also studied the German model of electioneering. In its report is stated that in Germany, there is a constructive vote of no-confidence in addition to the procedure for the appointment of a Chancellor made by the Bundestag (Germany's Lower House of Parliament). It is a variation on the motion of no confidence that allows a parliament to withdraw confidence from a head of government only if there is a positive majority for a prospective successor.</p>

<p>In Japan, the Prime Minister is firstly appointed by the National Diet and thereafter accepted by the Emperor. According to the report, a key member in the high-level panel had suggested that India should "adopt a model similar to that in Germany and Japan".</p>

<p>Like India, Indonesia also switched to the 'One Nation, One Election' format only recently - in 2019. The President, Vice-President, and members of both national and regional legislative bodies are elected on the same day. According to the report by the high-level panel "Political parties need 4 per cent of votes to qualify for the National Parliament. A Presidential candidate needs more than 50 per cent of votes cast overall and at least 20 per cent of votes in more than half the country's provinces to win."</p>

<p>The report also noted that "On February 14, 2024, Indonesia successfully conducted simultaneous elections. It was termed as the world's largest single day elections since nearly 200 million people voted across all five levels - President, Vice-President, Members of Parliament, Members of Regional Assemblies and Municipal elections."</p>

<p>India, a country of more than 1.4 billion (1,400 million / 140 crore) people, now aims to create the world record by conducting the largest-ever simultaneous elections. Whether that will happen in 2029 is not certain yet. It will first have to pass the test in Parliament.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outgoing President Joe Biden said Thursday he had commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 criminals and pardoned 39 others convicted of non-violent crimes, in what the White House called the largest single-day act of clemency in US history.</p>

<p>"I am pardoning 39 people who have shown successful rehabilitation," Biden said in a statement, adding that he was also "commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people who are serving long prison sentences."</p>

<p>The White House said the nearly 1,500 people granted commuted sentences -- "the most ever in a single day" -- had been serving them at home for at least one year.</p>

<p>"America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances," Biden said. "As President, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation."</p>

<p>Biden this month faced criticism for issuing an official pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases, despite earlier assurances that he would not intervene in his son's legal troubles.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British woman who died after a Brazilian butt-lift procedure in Turkey had undergone a "frankly barbaric medical practice" in which she gave no informed consent, a coroner ruled, as per the <em>BBC</em>. 26-year-old Demi Agoglia, from Greater Manchester, travelled to Turkey for the procedure in January after seeing social media advertisements for Istanbul-based Comfort Zone. She died in the hospital in Istanbul on January 8 three days after the operation and a catalogue of poor care, an inquest heard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Bolton Coroner John Pollard found that Ms Agoglia died from a microscopic fat embolism, caused when she was injected fat enters the bloodstream, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwl2jnvn1wo" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. He ruled that the 26-year-old died as a result of "misadventure contributed to by neglect".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I find there was no proper informed consent in this matter, there was no proper pre-operative care and advice, and no proper post-operative care. All of this meant the care in total fell well below the standard expected of this type of treatment and the lack of care contributed significantly to Demi's death," Mr Pollard said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brazilian-butt-lift-turkey-demi-agoglia-b2662921.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Independent</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coroner also told Ms Agoglia's family that he would write to the Health Secretary, adding, "I do feel something further needs to be done to stop this frankly barbaric medical practice being conducted to such low standards that would certainly not be tolerated in the UK."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Ms Agoglia travelled to Turkey with her partner, Bradley Jones. He said he did not want Ms Agoglia to have the surgery, but she had booked the trip months earlier after "she had seen some celebrity" advertising the procedure. The couple stayed in a shared villa in Istanbul before they were taken by taxi to the hospital.</p>

<p>Following the operation Ms Agoglia was "shaking" and appeared "very, very cold", Mr Jones said. Staff from Comfort Zone were called to the villa after Ms Agoglia complained of a tight chest and they checked her blood pressure but did not inspect the area of the operation or check her heart rate and pulse, the inquest heard.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old collapsed at the villa the following day and was taken back to the hospital where she died. The surgeon who conducted the operation later told Mr Jones they had done everything they could. It later emerged that the Comfort Zone staff who were called out to the villa were not qualified nurses.</p>

<p>A Brazilian butt lift (BBL) is a surgery where a doctor transfers fat from the abdomen, hips, lower back, or thighs to the buttocks. Women get the surgery to achieve an hourglass-shaped figure, with larger buttocks. Doctors remove the fat using liposuction. According to The Independent, the procedure can cost 3,500 pounds (Rs 3,71,049) in Turkey, but up to 10,000 pounds (Rs 10,60,021) in the UK, and carries the highest risk of all cosmetic surgeries.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese influencer with 46 million followers, identified as Meng or Qi Tiandao, was detained for 10 days after harassing a woman during a live-stream. The incident, which took place in Sanya, involved Meng poking a woman's buttocks with a bamboo stick. The woman, later revealed to be hired for the stunt, was part of an act intended to boost online engagement. However, the police condemned the act for its negative societal impact.</p>

<p>The incident happened during a live-streaming session&nbsp;staged in Sanya at the end of November. In the stream, Meng showed a woman wearing a short skirt who was buying milk tea on the street. Meng then picked up a short bamboo stick, squatted down, and discreetly approached the woman. He used the stick to poke her backside, causing her visible distress.&nbsp;The woman turned to Meng and asked, "Why did you touch my bottom?" Meng responded with a cheeky comment, saying, "I'd like to remind you that half of your buttocks are revealed." The woman's response was not captured.</p>

<p>The scene was broadcast live to his followers. However, it was later revealed that the woman had been hired by Meng to pose as a passerby, according to the police.</p>

<p>After receiving numerous complaints from internet users, Kuaishou suspended Meng's account for 15 days, citing a violation of the platform's rules. Meanwhile, local police have stated that the case is still under investigation. The consequences, if any, for the woman involved in the incident remain unclear.</p>

<p>Meng, previously jailed for fraud, is known for provocative and controversial content to attract viewers. The 28-year-old, better known by his online alias Qi Tiandao on the short video platform Kuaishou, boasts an impressive 46 million followers. He is famous for his humorous live-streaming content, often filmed in outdoor locations across mainland China.</p>

<p>He has a history of legal issues, having served a three-year prison sentence for fraud in 2019. Following his release, he began a career as a blogger, but his content frequently included vulgar and harassing behaviour towards women.</p>

<p>Reacting to the stunt, one user wrote, "I wonder who his followers are. What kind of people are they?" Another commented, "The popularity of this individual, who primarily produces sleazy content, indicates a decline in society's moral standards."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just our allies but our adversaries and our competitors, too," she added. "He is willing to talk to anyone and he will always put America's interests first."</p>

<p>The Kremlin separately on Thursday said that it had not received an invitation to attend the January 20 inauguration.</p>

<p>The offer for Xi to attend Trump's swearing-in was extended in early November, shortly after the Nov. 5 presidential election, according to CBS News, which first reported the invitation on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms have donated $1 million to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, a company spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed response.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said the donation was a departure from past practice by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg had declined to endorse either Donald Trump or Joe Biden for this year's election, in a media interview that took place before Biden stepped down as the Democratic nominee and was replaced by Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The billionaire CEO, however, had complemented Trump's reaction to the July 13 assassination attempt as "one of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life," among his recent attempts to appeal to conservative users.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg had met Trump after the elections in late November, according to the New York Times, a meeting that the newspaper said was the latest attempt by the Meta boss to establish a positive rapport with Trump.</p>

<p>Trump and Zuckerberg's Meta have had strained relations in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election.</p>

<p>The president-elect accused Meta of suppressing content that would have hurt Biden in the 2020 election, and also criticized Zuckerberg's donations to bolster election infrastructure.</p>

<p>Meta suspended Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts for about two years following the January 2021 Capitol riots.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time Magazine on Thursday named US President-elect Donald Trump its "person of the year," marking the second time he has won the accolade in acknowledgement of the mogul's stunning political comeback.</p>

<p>Trump, who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, adorns the magazine's title cover sporting his distinctive red tie and striking a pensive pose.</p>

<p>"For marshaling a comeback of historic proportions, for driving a once-in-a-generation political realignment, for reshaping the American presidency and altering America's role in the world, Donald Trump is Time's 2024 - Person of the Year."</p>

<p>This year saw Trump convicted on charges of business fraud and nearly assassinated twice -- and will end with him preparing to return to the White House with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>"We are witnessing a resurgence of populism, a widening mistrust in the institutions that defined the last century, and an eroding faith that liberal values will lead to better lives for most people. Trump is both agent and beneficiary of it all," the magazine said in a statement.</p>

<p>The award, given out annually, is an acknowledgement of the year's most influential figure. Past winners include Taylor Swift and Volodymyr Zelensky -- and Trump himself, in 2016, after his shock defeat of Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p><strong>Trump influence</strong></p>

<p>Having dominated the news events of 2024, Trump's influence is set to continue when he assumes the presidency in January.</p>

<p>This time around, Trump is promising mass expulsions of undocumented immigrants and major tariffs that threaten to shake up not just the US economy, but those of key trade partners.</p>

<p>He's cast doubt on continued support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, and has already become something of a shadow president, feting foreign leaders at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p>

<p>His comeback -- on the cover of Time magazine, but also at the helm of the US government -- was unthinkable a few years ago.</p>

<p>After his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss, it seemed like Republicans might be ready to wash their hands of the brash outsider who had taken over the party.</p>

<p>Criminal cases were launched over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and he was found liable in civil court for sexual abuse. He remains a polarizing figure in US and world politics.</p>

<p>Yet none of that prevented him from rising back up to the top of the Republican ticket, and then going on to win in the general election against Harris.</p>

<p>Harris was among those shortlisted for the award, alongside Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian economist Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Joy Bangla" or "Victory to Bangla" was the symbol of patriotism and unity especially during the birth of Bangladesh. "Joy Bangla" was more than a political slogan - it was a war cry.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's Supreme Court has put a hold on a High Court verdict that declared "Joy Bangla" as the country's national slogan. This phrase, popularised by Bangbandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been a significant part of Bangladesh's history and identity.</p>

<p>"Joy Bangla" or "Victory to Bangla" was the symbol of patriotism and unity especially during the birth of Bangladesh. "Joy Bangla" was more than a political slogan - it was a war cry.</p>

<p>On March 2nd 2022, it was made the national slogan by the Awami League government and it became mandatory at all government offices to voice the two words during national celebrations.</p>

<p>The recent development comes after Sheikh Hasina, Rahman's daughter and the former Prime Minister, was ousted from power on August 5. Since then, the new government has taken steps to remove symbols associated with Hasina and her father, including the removal of Rahman's image from currency notes.</p>

<p>After the change of government, the state made a move to the High Court to hold the ruling and filed the leave to appeal petition with the SC on December 2nd seeking a stay on the High Court verdict of March 10, 2020.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's decision was made on the grounds that the national slogan is a matter of government policy, and the judiciary should not interfere.</p>

<p>Additional Attorney General Aneek R Haque stated that "'Joy Bangla' will not be considered as the national slogan following this Appellate Division order".</p>

<p>This move is part of a broader effort by the new government to distance itself from the previous administration. The government has also decided not to observe August 15 as a national mourning day and public holiday, despite a High Court verdict justifying the observance.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, on August 13th, the advisory council of the interim government made a decision to not even have a national holiday on August 15th.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Bank is also printing new currency notes that feature the July uprising, which refers to the student-led protests that forced Hasina to flee to India. Notably, these new notes will not include the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is facing criticism for its new Christmas advertisement, which features a nonbinary beauty influencer named Cyrus Veyssi. The ad promotes Google Shopping and showcases Veyssi using the service to find skincare products. In the ad, Veyssi is shown wearing makeup and women's clothing, complaining about dry skin during the winter season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Veyssi says, "This winter dryness is not it. Especially when I have so many holiday looks to pull off. Thankfully, I know just the thing." Veyssi then proceeds to search for skincare products on Google Shopping. The ad concludes with the influencer saying, "Hydrated skin is a gift to everyone. No wrapping needed. Happy holidays to me," as the Google Shopping logo appears on the screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, some social media users have expressed disapproval of the ad, accusing Google of promoting a "woke" agenda. "Google launches WOKE Christmas campaign featuring a man wearing women's clothing complaining about his skin," wrote one user while sharing the video on X.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the video:</strong></p>

<p>Another person commented, "Google is cancelling women. Bizarre marketing strategy." A third said, "This has gone too far."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A fourth added, "Google keeps getting more woke and more cringe."&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>A Google spokesperson told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/google-accused-woke-new-christmas-ad-nonbinary-beauty-influencer">Fox News Digital </a></em>that the advertisement featuring Cyrus Veyssi is part of a larger campaign that showcases dozens of smaller social media influencers.</p>

<p>"Everyone likes to find a good deal and save money. That's why we're promoting Google Shopping as the best way to do that. To put it in perspective, this was a single sponsored Instagram post, representing a fraction of a per cent of a much wider Google Shopping campaign," a spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Notably,&nbsp;Veyssi is a 30-year-old non-binary beauty influencer and content creator. The content creator, who goes by "he/him" and "they/them" pronouns, initially gained popularity on TikTok, where they share makeup tutorials, skincare routines, and inspirational videos. Veyssi's content also focuses on promoting self-acceptance, inclusivity, and diversity in the beauty industry. As a beauty expert, Veyssi has collaborated with several brands and has been featured in various publications.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Miss Netherlands beauty pageant is being scrapped after 35 years, organisers said on Thursday, transforming into a new platform dealing with mental health and sharing positive stories.</p>

<p>"Times have changed and we are changing with the times," the organisers of the pageant said in a statement.</p>

<p>Instead of running the competition, director Monica van Ee has set up a platform entitled "no longer of this time."</p>

<p>This platform aims to share stories of successful women but also those struggling with, among other things, social media and unrealistic beauty standards.</p>

<p>"No more crowns, but stories that inspire. No dresses, but dreams that come to life," organisers said.</p>

<p>Van Ee said in a blog post on the new platform that her involvement in the pageant aimed to give young woman a springboard and show others what was possible.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a sash and a crown are no longer of this time. But women who support each other and help each other, that is timeless for us," she said.</p>

<p>The competition made headlines in 2023 when Rikkie Kolle, then 22, became the first transgender woman to win the pageant.</p>

<p>Kolle told AFP in an interview she hoped her victory would be an inspiration to young people from the transgender community.</p>

<p>Van Ee said the new platform should be "a place to show your authentic self and a world where we celebrate real life. Without the pressure to conform to a perfect image."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forty-six seconds into her match against Algeria's Imane Khelif, Italian boxer Angela Carini abandoned the bout. She left the ring in tears, but the result also caused a huge uproar on social media, with many accusing authorities of "allowing a man", referring to Imane, to compete in the women's category.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
British author and philanthropist JK Rowling called the sporting establishment “misogynist.”<br />
<br />
“Could any picture sum up our new men's rights movement better? The smirk of a male who knows he's protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he's just punched in the head, and whose life's ambition he's just shattered,” read the post shared by JK Rowling on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

Former professional boxer Barry McGuigan also took a dig at the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for its alleged insensitivity towards women. “Shocking dangerous and profoundly unfair on Women &amp; Girls. IOC hang you head in shame,” McGuigan wrote.</p>

However, there were many who defended Imane and said she was born woman and had not undergone any gender-affirming surgery.<br />

Imane Khelif is an amateur boxer who clinched a silver medal at the International Boxing Association's 2022 World Championships. Khelif is one of the two boxers permitted to fight at the Olympics despite being disqualified from the women's world championships last year for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests.<br />
<br />
According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-boxing-gender-4b6eb881cce9c34484d30c68ad979127">Associated Press</a>, the International Boxing Association disqualified Imane from last year's championships right before the Algerian's gold-medal bout because of elevated levels of testosterone. Khelif will next feature in a quarterfinal bout against Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori on Saturday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US appeals court on Thursday blocked the Federal Communications Commission's reinstatement of landmark net neutrality rules, saying broadband providers are likely to succeed in a legal challenge.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US appeals court on Thursday blocked the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) reinstatement of landmark net neutrality rules, saying broadband providers are likely to succeed in a legal challenge.</p>

<p>The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume regulatory oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open internet rules adopted in 2015 that were rescinded under then-President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals, which had temporarily delayed the rules, said on Thursday it would temporarily block net neutrality rules and scheduled oral arguments for late October or early November on the issue, dealing a serious blow to President Joe Biden's effort to reinstate the rules.</p>

<p>"The final rule implicates a major question, and the commission has failed to satisfy the high bar for imposing such regulations," the court wrote. "Net neutrality is likely a major question requiring clear congressional authorisation."</p>

<p>The court on July 12 had temporarily placed the net neutrality rules on hold until August 5 as it considered industry legal challenges.</p>

<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said: "The American public wants an internet that is fast, open, and fair. Today's decision by the Sixth Circuit is a setback but we will not give up the fight for net neutrality."</p>

<p>Net neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users. The rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or access to favoured users.</p>

<p>The rules would bar internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic to certain websites, or engaging in paid prioritisation of lawful content, as well as give the FCC new tools to crack down on Chinese telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet service outages.</p>

<p>Reinstating net neutrality has been a priority for Biden, who signed a July 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules adopted in 2015 under President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat.</p>

<p>Under Trump, the FCC had argued that net neutrality rules were unnecessary, blocked innovation and resulted in a decline in network investment by internet service providers, a contention disputed by Democrats.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has backed Italian boxer Angela Carini after her loss to Algerian fighter Imane Khelif at the Paris Olympics 2024 on Thursday. The bout lasted only 46 seconds as Carini withdrew from the contest after she was struck multiple times in the face. The Italian boxer, on her knees, sobbed in the middle of the ring after the defeat. She did not shake hands with Khelif, who made her place in the quarterfinals of the category following the match.</p>

<p>Musk retweeted an X post by American swimmer Riley Gaines who wrote, "Men don't belong in women's sports #IStandWithAngelaCarini.”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely,” Musk wrote in a retweet of Gaines' initial message.</p>

Italy's Prime Minister Georgian Meloni also reacted to Angela Carini's defeat and said that it "was not an even contest".<br />
<br />
"I have a big pain in my nose and I said, 'Stop'. It's better to avoid keeping going. My nose started dripping (with blood) from the first hit," Carini said.<br />
<br />
Khelif was cleared to take part in the Olympics despite getting disqualified from the 2023 women's world championships after she reportedly failed the <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-womens-boxing-match-at-paris-olympics-sparks-gender-row-6241881">gender eligibility tests.</a><br />
<br />
The International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s decision to permit Khelif to compete has led to criticism from former female boxing champions, including Claressa Shields and Ebanie Bridges.<br />
<br />
The IOC allowed two boxers to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics despite failing the gender eligibility tests for the World Boxing Championships last year.<br />
<br />
In 2023, the Algerian boxer suffered disqualification hours before the gold medal match at the women's World Championships. Khelif was reportedly disqualified for a high level of testosterone in her system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey man has been arrested for his alleged disruptive and life-threatening behaviour on an American Airlines flight. Twenty-six-year-old Eric Nicholas Gapco, travelling on flight 2101 from Seattle to Dallas on July 18, exhibited what authorities described as "unruly" behaviour.</p>

<p>Apart from propositioning a female crew member for sex, Gapco also attempted to open the plane's door mid-flight multiple times, forcing the emergency landing, the New York Post reported. The US Attorney's Office for the District of Utah said that Gapco removed his shirt mid-flight and began inhaling on a vape pen while cursing and hitting on a crew member, proposing to her for sex. The passenger also allegedly assaulted a flight attendant.</p>

<p>The Delanco man ate too many marijuana edibles before flight leading to his obnoxious behaviour on the plane.</p>

<p>Chaotic camera footage shows Gapco bare-chested and shouting "I am sane!" as crew members attempted to calm him near the plane's lavatory. A second video shows other passengers assisting the flight crew after tying up Gapco's hands and feet to get him to sit in the rear seat while the<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/flight-from-hell-plane-makes-emergency-landing-after-fliers-break-into-fight-6062125"> plane diverts</a> to Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Police arrested the Delanco resident at Salt Lake City International Airport around 11 a.m., local time. According to a criminal complaint, Gapco's hands and feet were restrained by passengers and crew after he "failed to follow instructions from <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dubai-bound-plane-makes-emergency-landing-at-nagpur-airport-due-to-engine-glitch-5934118">flight </a>crew to remain in his seat, used a vape pen on board in contradiction of crew instructions, locked himself in a lavatory for a time, screamed, and attempted to open the aircraft exterior doors (forward and aft)" while the plane was in the air.</p>

<p>A federal grand jury indicted Gapco on counts of interfering with a flight crew and attempting to harm an <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bengaluru-bound-air-india-express-plane-make-emergency-landing-in-tamil-nadu-5691430">aircraft </a>under the United States' special aircraft jurisdiction. His initial court appearance is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday that Washington is committed to defending Israel's security "against all threats from Iran," the White House said, after the assassination of a top Hamas leader in Tehran.</p>

<p>Biden, who was joined on the call by Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, also emphasized the "ongoing efforts to de-escalate broader tensions in the region," the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>The call between the leaders also came after Israel announced it had "eliminated Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's government has not commented on the slaying of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but the Palestinian militant group has blamed Israel.</p>

<p>Biden "reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Huthis," the White House said in a readout of the president's call with Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"The president discussed efforts to support Israel's defence against threats, including against ballistic missiles and drones, to include new defensive US military deployments," it said.</p>

<p>Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen's Huthi rebels all receive backing from Iran.</p>

<p>Israel has been battling Hamas in the Gaza Strip since the group's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Israel has said the assassination of Shukr was a response to deadly rocket fire from the Lebanese group last week on the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel in south Lebanon since the Gaza war began.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Qatar on Friday is due to hold funeral ceremonies for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after his killing in Tehran, an attack blamed on Israel that has deepened fears of a regional escalation.</p>

<p>Haniyeh, the Palestinian armed group's political chief, had resided in Doha along with other members of the Hamas political office.</p>

<p>He will be buried at a cemetery in Lusail, north of the Qatari capital, following funeral prayers at the Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab mosque, the gas-rich emirate's largest.</p>

<p>His killing sparked calls for revenge and is among several incidents that have inflamed regional tensions during the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas which has drawn in Iran-backed militant groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Hamas has said that "Arab and Islamic leaders" as well as representatives of other Palestinian factions and members of the public would attend the events.</p>

<p>Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in the pre-dawn attack on their accommodation in Tehran early on Wednesday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said.</p>

<p>He had travelled to Iran to attend Tuesday's swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of the attack, has not directly commented on it.</p>

<p>The Hamas leader's assassination came just hours after Israel struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Hamas-allied Lebanese group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In Tehran on Thursday, crowds of mourners paid their respects during a public funeral ceremony for Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led the prayers, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.</p>

<h3><strong>'Rage'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday in honour of Haniyeh, while Hamas has called for a "day of furious rage" to coincide with the burial.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group encouraged "roaring anger marches... from every mosque" following Friday prayers to protest Haniyeh's killing as well as the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack on Israel that ignited the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'High price'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Haniyeh's coffin arrived in Doha on Thursday afternoon, Qatar-based network Al Jazeera reported, broadcasting images of a convoy including internal security force vehicles travelling down Doha's shore-hugging corniche road.</p>

<p>Qatar has hosted Hamas's political bureau with the blessing of the United States since 2012 following the Palestinian operatives group's closure of its office in Damascus.</p>

<p>Haniyeh had played a key role in talks for a potential truce in Gaza, liaising with mediators Qatar, which has led months of behind-the-scenes negotiations alongside Egypt and the United States.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said late on Thursday that he was "very concerned" about rising tensions in the region and added that the killing of Haniyeh had "not helped" the situation.</p>

<p>The White House said Biden spoke with Netanyahu by telephone on Thursday, promising to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran".</p>

<p>"We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it and they should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call.</p>

<p>Reacting to Haniyeh's death, Qatar's prime minister said the killing had thrown the Gaza war mediation process into doubt.</p>

<p>"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on social media site X.</p>

<p>The international community called for calm and a focus on securing a ceasefire in Gaza -- which Haniyeh had accused Israel of obstructing.</p>

<p>Israel warned its adversaries on Thursday that they would "pay a very high price" for any "aggression".</p>

<p>"Israel is at a very high level of preparation for any scenario, both defensive and offensive," Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Those who attack us, we will attack in return."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tears of joy flowed in the Oval Office the moment families of prisoners such as Evan Gershkovich, freed by Russia in the biggest such swap since the Cold War, first spoke by phone to their loved ones, a White House video showed on Thursday.</p>

<p>"This is momma. Do you hear me? It's your mom," Gershkovich's mother tells her son, a Wall Street Journal reporter, in the emotional two-minute video of the virtual reunion, posted by President Joe Biden's social media account on X.</p>

<p>"We just want to say how overwhelmed we are," Biden tells the released detainees as the families stand around the presidential Resolute Desk. "You've been wrongfully detained for a long time, and we are glad you are home."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Russia freed Gershkovich, ex-U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and others on Thursday as part of the elaborate multi-country exchange that the White House said involved 24 prisoners, including Russian hitman Vadim Kasikov, released by Germany.</p>

<p>"Every parent, child, spouse and loved one who joined me in the Oval Office today has been praying for this day for a long time," Biden posted about the deal, which was negotiated in secrecy for more than a year.</p>

<p>In the video, Biden tells family members the detainees have been released and are heading to board the plane that will take them from Russia to the United States.</p>

<p>"No word is strong enough for this. I was sure I was going to die in prison," Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza tells his family as they weep.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid celebrations at getting a slew of US citizens and Kremlin opponents out of Russian prisons, the White House had one public regret Thursday: failure to get out an even bigger name -- Alexei Navalny.</p>

<p>"We had been working with our partners on a deal that would have included Alexei Navalny and, unfortunately, he died,"&nbsp; US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan revealed.</p>

<p>In the White House's plans, the last truly high-profile political opponent of President Vladimir Putin should have been included in the historic swap that saw 16 people -- including three US citizens and a US resident -- freed in return for 10 Russians chosen by the Kremlin, including two minors.</p>

<p>But in February 2024, just as the secret international talks were at a crucial stage, Navalny was pronounced dead at a notoriously brutal Russian Arctic prison, where he was serving a 19-year sentence after exposing Kremlin corruption.</p>

<p>Navalny was a larger-than-life figure whose bravery in confronting Putin, despite the deaths of multiple other Kremlin opponents over the years, amazed Russia watchers around the world.</p>

<p>After surviving an assassination attempt in which he was poisoned with a rare, Soviet-designed nerve agent, and then daring to return from safety in Germany to certain arrest in Russia, Navalny took on an aura of near-invincibility.</p>

<p>His sudden death behind bars shocked the White House team who had been trying to get the other prisoners home.</p>

<p>"The team felt like the wind had been taken out of our sails," a senior US official told reporters.</p>

<p>When the news broke, national security chief Sullivan said he happened to be with the parents of one of the other key targets in the prisoner swap plan: Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter arrested in Russia in March 2023.</p>

<p>"On the very day that he died, I saw Evan's parents," Sullivan said.</p>

<p>"I told them that the president was determined to get this done, even in light of that tragic news, and that we were going to work day and night to get to this day."</p>

<p>And the plan worked.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Western-chosen prisoners -- including Gershkovich and a veteran Russian human rights campaigner -- were flown to Turkey and then home.</p>

<p>They also included two former aides to Navalny: Lilia Chanysheva, 42, and Ksenia Fadeyeva, 32.</p>

<p>The Russian-chosen prisoners -- including a hitman and accused deep-cover spies -- were flown to Moscow.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris gave Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, a call.</p>

<p>Harris, who is running to replace Biden in November, called "to dicuss the exchange and express her support," Navalnaya spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on X.</p>

<p>And the Russian opposition figure's widow urged efforts to get others out continue.</p>

<p>She "called on the international community to facilitate the release of other Russian political prisoners," Yarmysh said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a customer wrote a homophobic slur on his receipt rather than leaving a tip, a young waiter at a restaurant in Kansas was left in tears.</p>

<p>Noah Bierig, 19, was serving a group of customers who were aggressive from the very start earlier this month at the well-known fast-food restaurant Bubba's 33 in Wichita, Kansas. They were staring at his manicured nails and a Pride bracelet he got from his mother six years ago when he came out as homosexual. Bierig noticed.</p>

<p>"That hurt me a lot. I'm not the type to cry at work, but I gotta say, that was definitely the first time that had happened to me," Noah Bierig told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kake.com/home/wichita-server-turning-homophobic-slur-left-in-place-of-tip-into-powerful-anti-bullying-message/article_6c940cb6-4966-11ef-9e65-a764b9129b9d.html"><em>KAKE TV.</em></a></p>

<p>"I'm not used to sort of blatant homophobia like that," said Bierig.</p>

<p>"The first time I went up to the table, they were just shooting me a couple dirty looks. And every time I would walk away, they would kind of just start laughing a little bit," said Bierig.</p>

<p>The teenager chose to overlook the group's taunts and provided them with the same level of service as he would any other customer.</p>

<p>In return, the group left a hurtful message instead of a tip. Instead of adding a tip, the customer wrote a homophobic slur in the designated tip area on the receipt.</p>

<p>"I looked at one of their receipts, and I noticed that it had a certain three-letter derogatory term written on it," Bierig explained.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kake.com/home/wichita-server-turning-homophobic-slur-left-in-place-of-tip-into-powerful-anti-bullying-message/article_6c940cb6-4966-11ef-9e65-a764b9129b9d.html"><em>KAKE TV</em></a>, after the receipt got posted online, with the customer's name signed and printed just below the slur, people flooded him with comments and shares.</p>

<p>The customer posted an apology on Facebook, saying, in part:</p>

<p>"I know it was wrong of me to write what I did, and for that, I am very sorry. The overall dining experience wasn't that great, and I shouldn't have dealt with it by saying what I did."</p>

<p>The post and the customer's social media pages have since disappeared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is facing a fierce backlash for questioning the race of US election rival Kamala Harris, but to those acquainted with the Republican's long history of inflammatory language and behavior around the issue, the smear was nothing new.</p>

<p>Trump's political career was forged in the cauldron of the 2010s "birther" conspiracy theory that sought to delegitimize then-president Barack Obama -- who had a Kenyan father -- by claiming falsely that he was born abroad.</p>

<p>Those who say Trump is racist point to dozens of other controversies the property tycoon has stoked, from being sued in the 1970s for discrimination against Black tenants to his notorious pandering to white supremacist marchers in 2017.</p>

<p>Trump's worst impulses resurfaced Wednesday with his outlandish claim that Harris -- the first female and non-white vice president -- recently "became a Black person" for political convenience.</p>

<p>Like an estimated 34 million Americans in the nation's fastest-growing demographic, Harris is mixed race and has been consistent in celebrating her Black and South Asian identity.</p>

<p>The attack handed Trump back a media spotlight that had evaded him since Harris's game-changing entry into the White House race, but it also honed attention on his extensive record of racial transgressions.</p>

<p>"He did crap the bed... The only question is whether he's going to roll around in it or get up and change the sheets," veteran strategist Scott Jennings, a one-time aide to former President George W. Bush, told CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Lion's den'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's inflammatory comments came amid a barrage of insults and falsehoods as he attacked Harris during a combative interaction with African American journalists in Chicago.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old is desperate to woo Black voters from Harris -- who has erased his polling leads since jumping into the race -- but the invitation was already controversial, given his well-documented history of denigrating Black female reporters.</p>

<p>Jennings suggested that Trump should move on from the scandal, but the former president has been doubling down, sharing images of Harris celebrating her Indian origins as some kind of ill-conceived "gotcha."</p>

<p>Riding high after surviving an assassination bid in July, Trump saw his campaign thrown into chaos when the 59-year-old vice president replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket for the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Keith Gaddie, a politics professor at Texas Christian University, said Trump's motivation for his latest remarks was likely a compulsion to grab back the limelight, as "no one is talking about assassination attempts any more."</p>

<p>But he also sees significance in the context -- a conversation with three African American interviewers in front of an audience of fellow Black journalists -- and believes the ex-president was playing "the gladiator in the lion's den" for his white base.</p>

<p>"He essentially decided to battle his opponent by proxy, by battling with Black female journalists," Gaddie said.</p>

<h3><strong>'No sense of decency'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Bill Kristol, chief of staff from 1989-93 to then vice president Dan Quayle, said Trump's goal was likely to revive old characterizations of Harris as inauthentic after her pivot to the political left during her 2020 primary campaign.</p>

<p>"Trump has no sense of decency. It would be nice if this were disqualifying for political success," Kristol wrote in a newsletter Thursday for center-right publication The Bulwark.</p>

<p>"But decency doesn't always prevail in this world of ours. Decency needs to be aggressively defended. Indecency needs to be exposed and denounced."</p>

<p>While some observers see Trump's racial remarks as part of some clever political strategy rather than the intemperate outbursts of a bigot, analysts are mixed on whether they are helpful.</p>

<p>"Birtherism made him an avatar of populist conservatism in 2011 and his attacks on Mexicans and Muslims played a critical role in his victories in 2016," said Donald Nieman, a political analyst and professor at Binghamton University in New York state.</p>

<p>"They stoke the passion of the base and that's important. But they also turn off a lot of the few swing voters who play a critical role in deciding elections these days -- as the results in 2018, 2020, and 2022 suggest."</p>

<p>Political scientist Nicholas Creel, of Georgia College and State University, told AFP the latest controversy lays bare Trump's lack of self-control and narcissism -- "Trump being Trump" -- rather than some underlying strategy.</p>

<p>"The best way to view this specific scandal is not as some sort of fifth-dimensional chess strategy whereby he was looking to excite his base via dog whistles," he said, "but simply as an insensitive comment from a latently racist old man who thinks he can do no wrong."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former president Donald Trump, who has a long history of making incendiary comments about race, has stepped up his attacks on his 2024 White House rival Kamala Harris by claiming she "happened to turn Black" for political advantage.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president Donald Trump, who has a long history of making incendiary comments about race, has stepped up his attacks on his 2024 White House rival Kamala Harris by claiming she "happened to turn Black" for political advantage.</p>

<p>But the reality is that the vice president, the product of a mixed-race marriage between Jamaican and Indian immigrants, embraced her Blackness long before embarking on a career in public service.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'I'm proud of being Black'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Harris was born in Oakland, California, in 1964, to Afro-Jamaican Donald Harris, who came to the United States to study economics, and Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated from India at 19 to pursue her doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology.</p>

<p>They met at the University of California, Berkeley, a hub of student activism, while participating in the civil rights movement -- and sometimes even taking a toddler Kamala along to marches.</p>

<p>Donald Harris remains a professor emeritus at Stanford University, while Gopalan, who helped advance breast cancer research, passed away in 2009.</p>

<p>After the couple divorced, Gopalan raised Kamala and her younger sister Maya, instilling pride in their South Asian roots. She took them on trips to India and often expressed affection or frustration in Tamil, Kamala wrote in her 2019 book, "The Truths We Hold."</p>

<p>But Gopalan also understood she was raising two Black daughters.</p>

<p>"She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to ensure we grew into confident, proud Black women," Harris wrote.</p>

<p>As a child, Harris was bused to a newly desegregated elementary school in a wealthier white neighbourhood and attended a Black church on Sundays.</p>

<p>"I'm Black, and I'm proud of being Black, and I was born Black, I will die Black," Harris told The Breakfast Club radio show in 2019.</p>

<p>But she's continued to lean into her Indian heritage too, appearing in a 2019 video where she and actress Mindy Kaling, also of Indian descent, bonded over making dosas.</p>

<p>"She's embraced her Blackness and her Indian heritage as well," said Kerry Haynie, chair of political science at Duke University, adding that Trump's "race-baiting" attacks were aimed at galvanizing his own base.</p>

<h3><strong>Howard University and the 'female Obama'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>When it came time for college, Harris chose Howard University, a historically Black institution in the US capital, following in the footsteps of her hero Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice on the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>She attended protests against apartheid in South Africa and joined the storied Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, founded to support Black women. Today, its 360,000 members include leading figures in politics, the arts, science and more.</p>

<p>"It's a powerful signal of alignment with Black Americans," said Christopher Clark, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

<p>After Howard, Harris enrolled at UC Hastings College of the Law, where she was elected president of the Black Law Students Association.</p>

<p>As she progressed through her career&nbsp;- elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and California's attorney general in 2010 -- she was consistently identified as Black or African American in media reports.</p>

<p>Some went so far as to dub her the "female Obama" after Barack Obama, who was elected the nation's first Black president in 2008.</p>

<p>Their biographies have parallels: both are biracial, with Obama's father a Kenyan economist and his mother a white American.</p>

<p>Critics questioned the authenticity of his African American experience, and Trump may be using a similar tactic to try to discredit Harris, suggested Clark.</p>

<p>However, being Black in America has always been a "very broad umbrella" due to the legacy of slavery, wrote Teresa Wiltz in a Politico op-ed, encompassing "myriad iterations of skin colour and hair texture and life experiences."</p>

<p>The most important Black political figures in US history have often been of mixed race, from abolitionist Frederick Douglass to activist-philosopher Angela Davis, Wiltz noted.</p>

<p>If Harris identifies as Black, "we can -- and should -- take her word for it," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pupils are wilting in ageing school buildings in Japan because poor insulation is cancelling out the effect of air conditioning, leading to drowsy kids and testy teachers.</p>

<p>But it also means higher electricity bills and more carbon emissions in a country that campaigners say is behind on making buildings more energy efficient.</p>

<p>"Children are often banned from playing outside, while teachers frantically ask them to drink water from morning to afternoon," said Tokyo elementary school teacher Yuriko Takahashi.</p>

<p>"Even when they can have a physical education class outside, they have to come back to a classroom that is so hot... Poor kids," the 29-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>Japan just recorded its hottest July since records began 126 years ago, and since April heat has killed 59 people, according to the disaster management agency.</p>

<p>Last year, the country recorded its hottest September since records started, just after students got back to classrooms after summer holidays.</p>

<p>In recent days Japan has seen temperatures touching 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), with a record 12,666 heatstroke patients taken to hospital last week, according to broadcaster NHK.</p>

<p>"In recent years, summer has been arriving much earlier, well before children go on vacation (in mid-July)," said Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Kazue Suzuki.</p>

<p>"Many school buildings in Japan are 60 or 70 years old and do not have enough insulation... The problem now is that ACs installed are not working because of it."</p>

<p>Tokyo's Katsushika ward, which has 73 elementary and middle schools, has renovated a few classrooms at two schools so far, adding extra insulation in the ceiling and walls, as well as installing heat exchanger devices to cool down classes.</p>

<p>In those classrooms, the AC now cuts the temperature from 32C to 27C in 45 minutes, compared to 100 minutes before, and uses less than half the energy, the ward says.</p>

<p>More than 60 per cent of students said they could concentrate better after the renovations, it adds.</p>

<p>"We also doubled the windows," said Takatoshi Kimura, a Katsushika official in charge of facility renovation.</p>

<p>Kimura said this is part of the ward's pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>But Greenpeace's Suzuki said Japan remains way behind global energy efficiency standards for buildings.</p>

<p>"It will be only from next year that a certain level of insulation becomes required when building a new house in Japan... but unfortunately, the required level will still be very low," she said.</p>

<p>At school, teacher Takahashi says hotter temperatures have made once regular parts of a student's day less routine.</p>

<p>"Children can no longer do what they used to do naturally, like playing in the schoolyard," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Death waited for Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh for over two months. A bomb was secretly smuggled into the guesthouse in Iran where he was expected to arrive, reports The New York Times citing several officials in the US and the Middle East.</p>

<p>It was hidden in the guesthouse in a posh locality in Tehran, protected by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) - around two months ago. The guesthouse was inside a large compound used by the IRGC for their secret meetings and housing important guests.</p>

<p>The wait, though, was long, it was fruitful.</p>

<p>Haniyeh, a top Hamas negotiator who had led its political delegation in Qatar, arrived in Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, it was confirmed that he was in his room in the guesthouse and the assassins detonated the bomb remotely, reported NYT. The blast shook the building. A portion of the wall collapsed. Windows were shattered.</p>

<p>Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in the attack that Hamas called a "treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran". The Palestinian group engaged in a deadly fight over Israel's Gaza campaign called it a "grave escalation" as it accused Israel of the assassination.</p>

<p>The Hamas chief's killing threatened to disrupt talks to end the war and unleash another wave of violence.</p>

<p>Israel hasn't claimed responsibility yet. However, the report states that Israeli intelligence officials had shared details about the covert operation with Western officials in the immediate period.</p>

<p>Top US diplomat Antony Blinken had denied that the US had prior knowledge about the assassination plot.</p>

<p>It was speculated earlier that Haniyeh was killed in a missile strike, but the missile theory raised doubts over how Israel evaded the air defence systems in the Iranian capital. The damage caused was minimal, much less than what a missile strike would have done.</p>

<p>The report found the assassins were able to find a gap in Iranian security to smuggle in the bomb, though it remains unclear how they managed to keep it hidden for two months.</p>

<p>There were rumours of witnesses seeing a missile-like object hitting the window of Haniyeh's room, but Iranian officials have confirmed that the blast occurred inside the room and that the bomb had been placed in advance.</p>

<p>According to Middle Eastern officials, it took months for the planning and needed detailed surveillance of the compound. The planning was so precise that the next room, where Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah was staying, wasn't as badly damaged.</p>

<p>The assassination has caused tremendous embarrassment for Iranian officials who are yet to find out how or when the bombs were planted.</p>

<p>A medical team housed in the compound declared Haniyeh dead. They failed to revive the bodyguard too.</p>

<p>Israel's spy and foreign intelligence agency Mossad is primarily tasked with assassinations outside the country. Mossad chief David Barnea had vowed to hunt down Hamas leaders after the October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>He had said it would take time, like it had after the Munich massacre, to get hold of the Palestinian leaders.</p>

<p>Barnea was referring to the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian operatives at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Mossad had activated its hit squad to carry out the 'Operation Wrath of God' covert operation, codenamed Bayonet, to avenge the murders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 hijackings -- the deadliest ever attacks on US soil -- has dedicated his life to plotting against the West.</p>

<p>Regarded as one of Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden's most trusted and intelligent lieutenants, Mohammed, also known as "KSM," was captured in Pakistan in March 2003.</p>

<p>He then spent three years in secret CIA prisons before arriving in 2006 at the US navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>

<p>Nearly 20 years later, he and two accomplices have reached a deal with prosecutors, the Pentagon said Wednesday, which will reportedly see them avoid a death penalty trial.</p>

<p>Mohammed was known as "mukhtar" (the chosen one) or "the brain" in extremist circles, but mocked as "KFC" for his love of fried chicken, biographers say.</p>

<p>An "arrogant," "very proud" man of small stature, Mohammed also had a reputation for being short-tempered.</p>

<p>Now around 60 years old, the trained engineer was involved in a string of major plots against the United States, where he attended university and attained an engineering degree.</p>

<p>His deadliest was the 9/11 operation, which saw nearly 3,000 people killed after hijacked planes rammed into the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, with another crashing in a Pennsylvania field.</p>

<p>He claims to have helped in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and to have personally beheaded US journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002.</p>

<p>KSM was born in the mid-1960s to a Pakistani family living in Kuwait, but his roots lie in Baluchistan, a restive Pakistani region bordering Afghanistan.</p>

<p>He says he joined the Muslim Brotherhood, an anti-Zionist activist group, when he was 16, beginning a life-long infatuation with violent jihad.</p>

<p>In 1983, Mohammed moved to the United States for his studies and stayed with a "small group" of Arabs from Kuwait, biographer Richard Miniter told AFP.</p>

<p>"KSM's limited and negative experience in the United States -- which included a brief jail stay because of unpaid bills -- almost certainly helped propel him on his path to becoming a terrorist," a US intelligence summary said.</p>

<p>In 1987, he traveled to Afghanistan and fought alongside mujahedeen rebels against the Soviet invasion.</p>

<p>He stayed in Afghanistan until 1992, and then headed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to fight with Muslim fighters against the Serbs, according to the 9/11 Commission report.</p>

<p>It was not until a botched 1995 plot to blow up US airliners over the Pacific, known as Operation Bojinka, that he achieved notoriety.</p>

<p>He had earlier helped finance the 1993 World Trade Center bombing hatched by his nephew Ramzi Youssef that killed six people and wounded more than 1,000 others.</p>

<p>Mohammed fought alongside Bin Laden in Afghanistan in the late 1980s, but they did not forge a close relationship until 10 years later, at which point Mohammed began plotting what would later become the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>

<p>"Bin Laden realized that this difficult little man was absolutely essential for turning AQ into the kind of organization he wanted," Miniter said.</p>

<p>Mohammed then had a hand in nearly every single Al-Qaeda plot until his arrest. But experts say it is not possible that one man alone was at the center of all these terror plans.</p>

<p>"He's obviously a smart guy, but he's not a genius... He didn't do the impossible," said Terry McDermott, co-author of "The Hunt for KSM."</p>

<p>Most of what is known about Mohammed comes from interrogation transcripts released by the Pentagon.</p>

<p>He is known to have been waterboarded 183 times during his years in US custody.</p>

<p>Rights groups denounce the simulated drowning technique as torture, and it later led to years of delays in his trial due to legal manoeuverings.</p>

<p>In reported confessions, Mohammed claimed to be the "military operational commander" for all Al-Qaeda foreign operations, saying, "I'm not making myself a hero."</p>

<p>"I'm looking to be a martyr for a long time," he told a hearing at Guantanamo in June 2008, the first time he had appeared in public since his arrest.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Thursday recognized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's opponent and opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of Venezuela's disputed presidential election, rejecting Maduro's claim of victory.</p>

<p>"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's July 28 presidential election," U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>The announcement from Washington did not go beyond congratulating him for a "successful campaign," the closest the U.S. has come since Sunday's contested election to recognizing Gonzalez as the OPEC nation's new leader.</p>

<p>The dispute over the presidential election results has sparked protests in Venezuela. Venezuela's electoral council proclaimed Maduro, who has been in power since 2013, the winner of the July 28 election with 51% of the vote.</p>

<p>But the country's opposition says its tally of about 90% of the votes shows that Gonzalez received more than double the support of the incumbent president, in line with independent polling conducted before the contest.</p>

<p>The opposition has released detailed tallies on a public website, while the government has so far not shared any information beyond a national total of votes for each candidate.</p>

<p>The statement from Blinken on Thursday stopped short of threatening new sanctions on Venezuela but he hinted at possible "punitive action." Reuters reported on Tuesday that Washington was considering fresh sanctions following the disputed election.</p>

<p>"We fully support the process of re-establishing democratic norms in Venezuela and stand ready to consider ways to bolster it jointly with our international partners," Blinken said.</p>

<p>Blinken also urged that opposition leaders be protected and kept safe.</p>

<p>"Law enforcement and security forces should not become an instrument of political violence used against citizens exercising their democratic rights," he said.</p>

<p>The presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia called for Venezuela to release detailed voting tallies on Thursday amid the dispute over presidential election results.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential nominee and former president Donald Trump has said that his campaign raised USD 139 million in July and has USD 327 million cash on hand.</p>

<p>"There has never been anything like the MAGA Movement. We raised $139 Million Dollars in July alone. We now have a whopping $327 Million Cash On Hand." Trump said on Truth Social, his social media platform.</p>

<p>"Spectacular support from Great American Patriots who are donating to our Campaign for President of the United States, and helping out in many other ways. Much work to be done, but I will always keep fighting for YOU. Our Country is failing, but we will turn it around, quickly, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!," he said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Trump Campaign, in a statement, said these numbers reflect continued momentum with donors at every level and provide the resources for the final 96 days until victory on November 5th.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vadim Krasikov, a Russian freed from jail in Germany on Friday in a prisoner swap between Moscow and the West, was convicted of the murder in 2019 of a former Chechen militant as he walked in broad daylight in a park in central Berlin.</p>

<p>The brazenness of the murder, committed a few minutes' walk from parliament and the office of then-chancellor Angela Merkel, sparked outrage in Germany that has complicated attempts to swap him for the growing list of political prisoners the West would like freed from Russian jails.</p>

<p>The judge called the killing of Georgian citizen Zelimkhan Khangoshvili "state terrorism", adding that the order had almost certainly come from Putin himself.</p>

<p>Among the evidence he cited for Russian state involvement were his official Russian papers containing a false identity and the fact that Russian law empowered Putin to order the murder of state enemies abroad.</p>

<p>The three shots fired from a Glock pistol on a sunny August day were deemed murder "with especially serious aggravating circumstances" - the most serious conviction possible under German law.</p>

<p>Particularly aggravating was the fact that Khangoshvili had long forsworn any violent struggle for Chechen independence, the judge said.</p>

<p>"This was not an act of self-defence by Russia. This was and is nothing other than state terrorism," he said. "Four children lost their father, two siblings their brother."</p>

<p>Krasikov was born in Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union, in 1965, and police mugshots show him with deep, narrow-set eyes and a mournful expression. He worked for Russia's FSB state security service, where, according to open source investigators Bellingcat, he became a specialist assassin.</p>

<p>Krasikov's conviction in December 2021 triggered the expulsion of two of the 101 diplomats then serving in Russia's giant Berlin embassy. Their number has been reduced by another 50 since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>He entered Germany via France with false papers under the name Vadim Sokolov. He was arrested minutes after cycling up behind Khangoshvili and shooting him dead; passers-by spotted him changing his clothes, shaving off his beard and dumping his bicycle in a pond, and alerted police.</p>

<p>While Krasikov pleaded innocent and maintained he was genuinely Sokolov, a St Petersburg construction engineer visiting Berlin as a tourist, Putin has implicitly acknowledged his identity and profession. Last year, without naming Krasikov, he spoke of his desire to secure the release of someone who had "eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals".</p>

<p>Investigators identified Krasikov with the help of Ukraine's security services, who spotted footage of a man with identical tattoos - seemingly of a demon wearing a crown and a snake - at his second marriage, to a woman from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in 2010.</p>

<p>Throughout his trial, he made a show of not recognising the court, often removing the headset relaying the interpretation when witnesses against him were heard.</p>

<p>For Germany, releasing him is legally complex, especially given the seriousness of the crime.</p>

<p>Specialists have suggested that he could be released under a theoretical agreement that he serve his sentence in Russia, even if the Kremlin then chose to renege on this. Alternatively, prosecutors could state that they no longer wish to see his sentence enforced.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US officials have arrested two Indian nationals with drugs worth USD 10 million, the Department of Justice said. Simranjit Singh, 28, and Gusimrat Singh, 19, of Fresno, California were each charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances, it said.</p>

<p>Both made initial appearances before a federal court in Boston on July 29 and remain in federal custody. They were detained after local police found in the cab of the tractor trailer, over 400-kg bricks of suspected cocaine worth more than USD 10.5 million.</p>

<p>"The sheer amount of drugs seized in this one case is disturbing and dangerous. These defendants allegedly took a cross-country trip to distribute illicit narcotics into Massachusetts communities," said Acting United States Attorney Joshua S Levy.</p>

<p>According to charging documents, on July 29, at 10.15 pm, a white tractor trailer arrived at a planned Andover address to deliver methamphetamine to the undercover agents. The driver and passenger of that tractor trailer, later identified as Gusimrat Singh and Simranjit Singh, allegedly handed off 65 pounds of suspected methamphetamine to the undercover agents. The men were immediately taken into custody.</p>

<p>The charge of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, at least three years and up to life of supervised release, and a fine of up to USD 1,000,000.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US chip maker Intel said Thursday it will slash more than 15 percent of its workforce as it streamlines operations.</p>

<p>The plan to cut approximately $20 billion in expenses this year came as Intel reported a loss of $1.6 billion in the recently ended quarter.</p>

<p>"Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones," Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger said in an earnings release.</p>

<p>"Second-half trends are more challenging than we previously expected."</p>

<p>Second quarter earnings were negatively affected by "headwinds" to the ramp-up of Intel's artificial intelligence PC product and unused capacity at its facilities, according to chief financial officer David Zinsner.</p>

<p>"By implementing our spending reductions, we are taking proactive steps to improve our profits and strengthen our balance sheet," Zinsner said.</p>

<p>Intel reported having 124,800 employees at the end of last year, meaning the layoffs could hit about 18,000 positions.</p>

<p>In June, Intel announced it was halting the expansion of a major factory project in Israel, which was going to pump an extra $15 billion towards a chip plant.</p>

<p>Intel said at the time that "managing large-scale projects, especially in our industry, often involves adapting to changing timelines."</p>

<p>"Decisions are based on business conditions, market dynamics and responsible capital management," the US-based company added.</p>

<p>The belt-tightening came just a month after Intel struck a defiant tone in the face of strong challenges from rivals Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm, unveiling technologies it said would lead the artificial intelligence revolution.</p>

<p>For decades, Intel has dominated the market for the chips that run everything from laptops to data centres. But in recent years, its competitors -- especially Nvidia -- have soared ahead on specialized AI processors.</p>

<p>During a keynote speech at Taiwan's Computex expo, Gelsinger introduced Intel's latest Xeon 6 processors for servers, and shared more details about its next-gen Lunar Lake chips for AI PCs.</p>

<p>"AI is driving one of the most consequential eras of innovation the industry has ever seen," Gelsinger said.</p>

<p>"The magic of silicon is once again enabling exponential advancements in computing that will push the boundaries of human potential and power the global economy for years to come."</p>

<p>Gelsinger said Intel's latest equipment provides the best available mix of performance, energy efficiency and affordability.</p>

<p>His presentation followed earlier keynote speeches by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, AMD CEO Lisa Su and Qualcomm's Cristiano Amon -- and they were replete with claims and counterclaims about which firm's products were the best for AI.</p>

<p>Microsoft in June unveiled its Copilot+ AI PCs, which will have artificial intelligence features built into its Windows operating system.</p>

<p>Along with Microsoft, the features will be added by some of the world's biggest computer manufacturers, including Dell, HP, Samsung and Lenovo, offering AI capabilities on the device itself, not just through the internet.</p>

<p>AI computers are expected to be 80 percent of the PC market by 2028, Intel said, citing the Boston Consulting Group.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday that Washington is committed to defending Israel's security "against all threats from Iran," the White House said, after the assassination of a top Hamas leader in Tehran.</p>

<p>Biden, who was joined on the call by Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, also emphasized the "ongoing efforts to de-escalate broader tensions in the region," the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>The call between the leaders also came after Israel announced it had "eliminated Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's government has not commented on the slaying of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, but the Palestinian militant group has blamed Israel.</p>

<p>Biden "reaffirmed his commitment to Israel's security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Huthis," the White House said in a readout of the president's call with Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"The president discussed efforts to support Israel's defense against threats, including against ballistic missiles and drones, to include new defensive US military deployments," it said.</p>

<p>Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels all receive backing from Iran.</p>

<p>Israel has been battling Hamas in the Gaza Strip since the group's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Israel has said the assassination of Shukr was a response to deadly rocket fire from the Lebanese group last week on the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel in south Lebanon since the Gaza war began.<br />

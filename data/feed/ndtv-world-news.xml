       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like any other 3D printer - except it's the size of a crane and is, layer by layer, building a hotel in the Texan desert. El Cosmico, an existing hotel and campground on the outskirts of the city of Marfa, is expanding. It is building 43 new hotel units and 18 residential homes over 40 acres (16 hectares) - all with a 3D printer.</p>

<p>It is the world's first 3D-printed hotel, says El Cosmico owner Liz Lambert and the partners behind the project - Austin, Texas-based 3D printing company ICON and architects Bjarke Ingels Group.</p>

<p>Lambert said the technology allows for unprecedented creativity.</p>

<p>"Most hotels are contained within four walls and a lot of times you are building the same unit over and over and over again," Lambert said. "I've never been able to build with such little constraint and such fluidity ... just the curves, and the domes, and the parabolas. It's a crazy way to build."</p>

<p>The units can include architectural features that would normally be too expensive to replicate on a large scale with traditional construction, according to Lambert.</p>

<p>The single-story, 12-foot (3.7-meter) high walls of the first two units under construction are a three-bedroom residential space and a single-room hotel unit.</p>

<p>The curvy, beige-colored walls are being piped out by ICON's Vulcan, a 46.5-foot (14.2 m) wide 3D printer standing 15.5 feet (4.7 m) and weighing 4.75 tons.</p>

<p>A print technician monitors Vulcan as its robotic arm and nozzle glide through the work site on a gantry.</p>

<p>The "ink" of this 3D printer is a special cement-based material called Lavacrete, a proprietary mixture designed for strength, affordable scale, and printability. ICON CEO and founder Jason Ballard said workers adjust and blend the ingredients based on weather conditions.</p>

<p>"The magic happens in the admixtures that allow us to continue printing," Ballard said, adding that humidity, temperature, and irradiance affect the material's behavior and even the final color.</p>

<p>ICON is also working on a 3D-printed neighborhood of homes near Austin.</p>

<p>In the long term, 3D-printed construction could displace some skilled laboring jobs, said Milad Bazli, a science and technology lecturer at Charles Darwin University in Australia.</p>

<p>"I think from the social point of view and the effect on the economy in terms of the local jobs, especially in remote areas, that will be one of the challenges that we need to consider when we're going to the 3D printing method," Bazli said.</p>

<p>The expansion of El Cosmico is set to be completed by 2026. The hotel units will range between $200 and $450 per night.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted after a federal corruption investigation, but the indictment is sealed and it is unclear what charges he will face, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. It was not immediately clear whether Adams would be arrested or voluntarily surrender. The charges are likely to be unsealed on Thursday, when Adams may appear in court.</p>

<p>The charges come after the FBI last November searched Adams' electronic devices, and in the wake of a slew of resignations by top city officials in recent weeks as multiple federal corruption investigations entangle his administration.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment. Adams' lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>One of his lawyers has said that the mayor, a Democrat, was cooperating with an investigation but did not say what it was about.</p>

<p>The case is likely to complicate any Adams bid for re-election in 2025. Other Democratic politicians, including New York City comptroller Brad Lander, plan to challenge Adams - once a key ally of Democratic President Joe Biden - for the party's nomination.</p>

<p>The Times, citing a search warrant, reported in early November 2023 that federal authorities were investigating the possible acceptance by Adams' 2021 campaign of illegal donations, including by the Turkish government.</p>

<p>The probe, conducted by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, focused on whether Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign conspired with a Brooklyn construction company to funnel foreign money into the campaign through a straw-donor scheme, the Times said.</p>

<p>Authorities have also sought information about Adams' interactions with Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan, according to the Times.</p>

<p>Adams, a former police officer, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said he is cooperating with the probe. His lawyers said in a statement on Aug. 15 that they had conducted their own investigation into the matters prosecutors were probing and had not found evidence of illegal conduct by Adams.</p>

<p>"To the contrary, we have identified extensive evidence undermining the reported theories of federal prosecution as to the Mayor, which we have voluntarily shared with the U.S. Attorney," said the lawyers, Brendan McGuire and Boyd Johnson.</p>

<p>The largest U.S. city has been in a state of political upheaval for the past month. Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned on Sept. 12, a week after FBI agents seized his phone. Days later, Adams' chief legal adviser resigned, saying she could "no longer effectively serve" in the position.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the city's public schools chancellor David Banks said he would retire at the end of the year, weeks after the Times reported his phones were seized by federal agents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Humanity could use a nuclear bomb to deflect a massive, life-threatening asteroid hurtling towards Earth in the future, according to scientists who tested the theory in the laboratory by blasting X-rays at a marble-sized "mock asteroid".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humanity could use a nuclear bomb to deflect a massive, life-threatening asteroid hurtling towards Earth in the future, according to scientists who tested the theory in the laboratory by blasting X-rays at a marble-sized "mock asteroid".</p>

<p>The biggest real-life test of our planetary defences was carried out in 2022, when NASA's fridge-sized DART spacecraft smashed into a 160-metre (525-feet) wide asteroid, successfully knocking it well off course.</p>

<p>But for bigger asteroids, merely crashing spaceships into them will probably not do the trick.</p>

<p>When the roughly 10-kilometre wide Chicxulub asteroid struck the Yucatan peninsula around 66 million years ago, it is believed to have plunged Earth into darkness, sent kilometres-high tsunamis rippling around the globe and killed three quarters of all life -- including wiping out the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>We humans are hoping to avoid a similar fate.</p>

<p>There is no current threat looming, but scientists have been working on how to stave off any big asteroids that could come our way in the future.</p>

<p>A leading theory has been to be blow them up with a nuclear bomb -- a last-ditch plan famously depicted in the 1998 sci-fi action movie "Armageddon".</p>

<p>In the movie, Bruce Willis and a plucky team of drillers save Earth from an asteroid 1,000 kilometres wide -- roughly the size of Texas.</p>

<p>For a proof-of-concept study published in the journal Nature Physics this week, a team of US scientists worked on a much smaller scale, taking aim at a mock asteroid just 12 millimetres (half an inch) wide.</p>

<p>To test whether the theory would work, they used what was billed as the world's largest X-ray machine at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>

<p>The machine is capable of generating "the brightest flash of X-rays in the world using 80 trillion watts of electricity", Sandia's Nathan Moore, the lead study author, told AFP.</p>

<p>Much of the energy created by a nuclear explosion is in the form of X-rays. Since there is no air in space, there would be no shockwave or fireball.</p>

<p>But the X-rays still pack a powerful punch.</p>

<p><strong>- Turned into a 'rocket engine' -</strong></p>

<p>For the lab experiment, the X-rays easily vaporised the surface of the mock asteroid.</p>

<p>The vaporising material then propelled the mock asteroid in the opposite direction, so that it effectively "turned into a rocket engine," Moore said.</p>

<p>It reached speeds of 250 kilometres an hour, "about as fast as a high-speed train," he added.</p>

<p>The test marked the first time that predictions about how X-rays would affect an asteroid had been confirmed, Moore said.</p>

<p>"It really proves this concept could work."</p>

<p>The scientists used modelling to scale up their experiment, estimating that X-rays from a nuclear blast could deflect an asteroid up to four kilometres wide -- if given enough advanced notice.</p>

<p>The biggest asteroids are the easiest to detect ahead of time, so "this approach could be quite viable" even for asteroids the size of the dinosaur-killing Chicxulub, Moore said.</p>

<p>The experiment was based on using a one-megaton nuclear weapon. The largest ever detonated was the 50-megaton Soviet Tsar Bomba.</p>

<p>If there was to be a planet-saving mission in the future, the nuclear bomb would need to be placed within a few kilometres of the asteroid -- and millions of kilometres away from Earth, Moore said.</p>

<p>- Asteroids come in many flavours -</p>

<p>Testing out the theory using a real nuke would be dangerous, hugely expensive -- and banned by international treaties.</p>

<p>But there is still plenty to be discovered before such a high-risk test.</p>

<p>The largest uncertainty right now is that asteroids can "come in many flavours", Moore said.</p>

<p>"We have to be prepared for every scenario."</p>

<p>For example, the asteroid hit by DART, Dimorphos, turned out to be a loosely held-together pile of rubble.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency's Hera mission is scheduled to launch next month on a mission to find out more about its composition -- and the finer details about how DART sent it packing.</p>

<p>Mary Burkey, a staff scientist at California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that was not involved in the new study, has run computer simulations about using nukes on asteroids.</p>

<p>She praised the study, saying that "being able to match my calculations to real-life data increases the credibility of my results."</p>

<p>Her simulations have also demonstrated that such a mission "would be a very effective means to defend planet Earth", Burkey told AFP.</p>

<p>"However, in order for it to work, there must be enough time after a mission for the extra push of velocity to move the asteroid's trajectory off Earth."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Wednesday Iran should be blown "to smithereens" if the Islamic Republic is involved in the harming of a US White House candidate or ex-president.</p>

<p>The provocative remarks come after US intelligence warned of threats from Tehran against the Republican's life after two apparent assassination bids in recent months.</p>

<p>"As you know, there have been two assassination attempts on my life that we know of, and they may or may not involve -- but possibly do -- Iran," Trump said at a campaign event in North Carolina.</p>

<p>"If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country, in this case Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens," he added.</p>

<p>Trump went on to say he and the United States have been "threatened very directly by Iran" and that a firm message needed to reach Tehran that there would be the most severe consequences should it be involved in plots to kill or hurt a US president or presidential candidate.</p>

<p>"The best way to do it is through the office of the president, that (if) you do any attacks on former presidents or candidates for president, your country gets blown to smithereens, as we say."</p>

<p>Trump also said it was "strange" that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was in New York this week and accorded substantial protection as he attends the United Nations General Assembly even as news of the threats emerged.</p>

<p>"We have large security forces guarding him, and yet they're threatening our former president and the leading candidate to become the next president of the United States," Trump said, referring to himself.</p>

<p>The United States is obligated to extend security to foreign heads of state at the General Assembly under its treaty with the United Nations and its own laws.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Credible intelligence' -</strong></p>

<p>Trump's remarks come as world leaders scramble to try to avert hostilities between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel escalating into a wider regional war.</p>

<p>Iran has rejected accusations it is trying to kill Trump this summer, shortly after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, killing one person and wounding the presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Days later, Trump posted on social media that if Iran did kill him, "I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth."</p>

<p>In a highly critical report on the security arrangements around Trump at the Pennsylvania rally, a US Senate committee noted that the deployment of elite US Secret Service countersnipers was made "in response to 'credible intelligence' of a threat."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 78-year-old Trump suggested the would-be assassin in Pennsylvania had used "potentially foreign-based apps," and that the alleged gunman in the second attempt in Florida had multiple mobile phones that Trump said US authorities have been unable to open.</p>

<p>"They must get Apple to open these foreign apps (and) open the six phones from the second lunatic," Trump said. "Because we have a lot at stake."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland called the attempted assassination bids "abhorrent."</p>

<p>"Our nation has now experienced two assassination attempts against the former President in just the last three months. That is abhorrent," he said.</p>

<p>"The Justice Department will not tolerate violence that strikes at the heart of our democracy. And we will find and hold accountable those who perpetrate it. This must stop."</p>

<p>In August, the United States announced that it had foiled a plan by a Pakistani linked to Tehran to assassinate a US official in revenge for the death of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, killed in 2020 in a US strike in Iraq ordered by then-president Trump.</p>

<p>US intelligence services have also warned of attempted cyberattacks on the presidential campaigns of Trump and rival Kamala Harris by actors it says are backed by Iran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The board of the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday agreed to loan Pakistan $7 billion to bolster its faltering economy, approving a relief package that Islamabad has pledged would be the last from the Washington-based lender.</p>

<p>The three-year loan program "will require sound policies and reforms" to support Pakistan's ongoing efforts to strengthen its economy "and create conditions for a stronger, more inclusive, and resilient growth," the IMF said in a statement.</p>

<p>The South Asian nation in July agreed to the deal -- its 24th IMF payout since 1958 -- in exchange for unpopular reforms, including widening its chronically low tax base.</p>

<p>Pakistan last year came to the brink of default as the economy shriveled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.</p>

<p>It was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries as well as an IMF rescue package, but its finances remain in dire straits, with high inflation and staggering public debts.</p>

<p>"This program should be considered the last program," Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in July when the loan deal was agreed.</p>

<p>Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan.</p>

<p>It came on the condition of far-reaching reforms including hiking household bills to remedy a permanently crisis-stricken energy sector and uplifting pitiful tax takings.</p>

<p>In a nation of over 240 million people where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.</p>

<p>The IMF said Pakistan "has taken key steps to restoring economic stability with consistent reforms." But "despite this progress, Pakistan's vulnerabilities and structural challenges remain formidable," it warned.</p>

<p>"A difficult business environment, weak governance, and an outsized role of the state hinder investment, which remains very low compared to peers," it added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Elon Musk's social media platform X will file documents requested by Brazil's Supreme Court and ask by this Monday that service be restored in the country, according to two people familiar with the situation.</p>

<p>Access to the platform formerly known as Twitter has been blocked in Brazil since the end of August, following an order by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The judge and the U.S. tech firm have been at loggerheads over his investigation of "digital militias" he has accused of spreading hate messages in Brazil.</p>

<p>The dispute led X to close its offices in the country and let go of employees including its legal agent, breaching a local law.</p>

<p>The platform may again be available to Brazilians as early as next week after X provides documents requested by the court proving it now has a legal representative in the country, said the sources familiar with X's plans.</p>

<p>X and the Brazilian Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Last week, X lawyers said the company had appointed a legal representative in Brazil, as ordered by the Supreme Court, but it did not initially provide documents to prove the appointee was formally able to respond for the company. Once the new set of documents have been sent, the firm expects the issue to be resolved, according to the sources.</p>

<p>The sources said X has also started to comply with the court's other demands - blocking profiles of people allegedly spreading fake news and paying a 18 million reais ($3 million) fine via accounts of Musk's Starlink.</p>

<p>The social media firm is keen to smooth over the relationship with Moraes and operate like any other tech company in the country, said one of the sources.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday survived a vote of no confidence, with 211 lawmakers opposing and 120 in favor, in the first major test of his minority Liberal government.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday survived a vote of no confidence in the first major test of his minority Liberal government whose popularity has waned after nine years in office.</p>

<p>His tenuous grip on power, however, is already set to face more challenges in the coming days and weeks, with the main opposition Conservatives vowing to try again to topple the government as early as Tuesday.</p>

<p>Following a heated debate that saw members of Parliament trade insults and slam their fists on desks, they voted 211 to 120 against the Conservative motion to unseat the Liberals and force snap elections.</p>

<p>Far ahead in public opinion polls, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching for a snap election since the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) earlier this month tore up a coalition agreement with the Liberals, leaving the Trudeau administration vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

<p>A combative Poilievre has railed against Trudeau for what he said was a failure to address soaring costs of living, a housing crisis and crime, while doubling the national debt.</p>

<p>The promise of Canada, "after nine years of Liberal government, is broken," he said during a Commons debate on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But other opposition parties, whose support is needed to topple the Liberals, have pushed back against his rightwing agenda.</p>

<p>Liberal House leader Karina Gould accused the Tories of "playing games."</p>

<p>"I think it's pretty lame that they're going to put forward another non-confidence vote tomorrow," she said.</p>

<p><strong>- Try, try again -</strong></p>

<p>Immediately following the no confidence vote, the NDP again sided with the Liberals to pass legislation on capital gains taxes, averting another political crisis.</p>

<p>Poilievre has vowed to keep trying, with the next opportunity to bring down the government to be presented next week. If that fails, he will have a few more chances before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The separatist Bloc Quebecois has also demanded concessions from the ruling Liberals for its continued support in Parliament beyond the end of October.</p>

<p>Trudeau swept to power in 2015, and has managed to hold on by defeating two of Poilievre's predecessors in 2019 and 2021 ballots.</p>

<p>The deal with the New Democratic Party to prop up the Liberals would have kept his government in office until late 2025.</p>

<p>But the NDP, seeing its alignment with the Liberals hurting its own popularity, exited the deal early.</p>

<p>According to a recent Angus Reid poll, the Conservatives are well ahead of the Liberals, with 43 percent of voting intention against 21 percent for the ruling party. The NDP is at 19 percent.</p>

<p>Going forward, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said his party would evaluate each bill in Parliament before deciding how to vote.</p>

<p>With legislation pending on NDP priorities including a national dental plan, political analysts who spoke to AFP suggested an election won't likely be triggered until at least spring 2025.</p>

<p>However, University of Ottawa professor Genevieve Tellier told AFP: "Anything is possible. It could come before Christmas."</p>

<p>In the meantime, a weakened Trudeau administration under constant threat "will find it more difficult to govern," she said.</p>

<p>Bloc leader Yves-Francois Blanchette said Wednesday he would seek to keep the government afloat until the end of October.</p>

<p>But if there has been no movement on its legislative priorities by then, he said the Bloc would turn against the Liberals.</p>

<p>In Canada's Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members.</p>

<p>The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and the NDP 25.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will on Wednesday lay out rival visions for the economy, the top issue for many US voters, ahead of the vice president's first major solo interview since entering the White House race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will on Wednesday lay out rival visions for the economy, the top issue for many US voters, ahead of the vice president's first major solo interview since entering the White House race.</p>

<p>Harris is giving a speech in Pittsburgh, an industrial city in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, in which the Democrat will set out what her campaign says is a "pragmatic" policy, contrasting with that of billionaire former president Trump.</p>

<p>The vice president will then sit down with the left-leaning news channel MSNBC, in a rare test of her ability to deal with unscripted questions since taking over from President Joe Biden as the party's standard-bearer.</p>

<p>Republican contender Trump delivered remarks on what he called a "Made in America" economy, although he made headlines on foreign policy as he upped his harsh rhetoric against US adversary Iran.</p>

<p>The dueling events were taking place against a backdrop of fresh security worries with Trump, who has already escaped two assassination attempts this year, saying that there were "big threats" on his life from Tehran.</p>

<p>A gunman accused of planning to kill Trump at his Florida golf course just over a week ago, Ryan Routh, was indicted Tuesday for the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate.</p>

<p>The election remains on a knife-edge less than six weeks before November 5 voting day, with many Americans saying the economy is the most important issue after years of high prices in the post-Covid rebound.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are both tailoring their economic messaging at the tiny number of wavering voters, in around half a dozen swing states, who are expected to decide the election for a nation of 330 million people.</p>

<p>Since replacing Biden in July, polls have shown Harris gaining on Trump in terms of whom voters trust most on the economy -- but that voters remain unfamiliar with her policies.</p>

<p>- 'Putting America first' -</p>

<p>Harris's campaign said her speech in Pittsburgh would focus on her own middle-class upbringing to show she understands the pressures of making ends meet, in contrast to tycoon Trump.</p>

<p>"For Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors," she plans to say, according to the campaign.</p>

<p>She will also unveil proposals to "make sure America leads the world in manufacturing in the industries of the future."</p>

<p>Trump is making similar pledges to boost American manufacturing, but with his own protectionist twist.</p>

<p>He told supporters in Mint Hill, North Carolina that his "unwavering commitment to putting America first is exactly what this country needs to restore our economy."</p>

<p>Trump complained that the Biden administration had allowed Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian to address to the UN General Assembly in New York with "large security forces guarding him," while the ex-president was under threat from the US adversary.</p>

<p>The comment came the Trump campaign said that top US intelligence officials briefed the candidate on threats from Iran to assassinate him.</p>

<p>"If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country -- in this case, Iran -- that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens," he said.</p>

<p>Harris's MSNBC interview being broadcast at 7pm ET (2300 GMT) is meanwhile part of her effort to define herself after criticism from Republicans for largely avoiding major interviews and giving no press conferences.</p>

<p>Since Biden dropped out she has only given one interview with a national TV network, in August, when she and her running mate Tim Walz sat for a joint CNN interview.</p>

<p>Trump's vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance described the decision to go on liberal-leaning MSNBC as "legitimately pathetic for a person who wants to be president."</p>

<p>Trump has given a number of interviews in recent weeks, but many of those have also been to friendly media -- while several of his events billed as press conferences ended with him taking no questions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of Lebanese engineer Maya Gharib's wedding planned for next month, excited relatives were arranging for her dress to be picked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But on Monday, 23-year-old Gharib, her two sisters and their parents were killed in an Israeli strike on their home in a suburb of the southern city of Tyre, said Gharib's brother Reda, the only surviving member of the family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel says Monday's strikes targeted Hezbollah weapons. Lebanon's health ministry said the attacks left more than 550 people dead, including at least 50 children and 98 women, in Lebanon's bloodiest day since the end of the 1975-90 Civil War.</p>

<p>A screenshot shared with Reuters shows a message sent by a relative to the dress shop after the Gharib family died: "The bride was martyred."</p>

<p>"They were just sitting at home, and then the house was targeted," Reda Gharib, who moved to Senegal last year for work, told Reuters in a phone call.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family were buried in a rushed funeral the next day, with few people in attendance due to the danger of strikes. Reda was unable to fly in as most flights had been cancelled amid ongoing Israeli attacks and rocket fire from Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His father was a retired veteran of Lebanon's army, a cross-sectarian force funded by the US and other countries and widely seen as source of unity in Lebanon. His sisters were all in their 20s.</p>

<p>"We are a nationalistic family with no party affiliation, though of course we stand with everyone who resists aggression," Reda Gharib said, noting no member of the family was a member of Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But he says that now, having lost his family, he wanted Hezbollah to continue fighting Israel "until victory" and not to accept any negotiations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'INDISCRIMINATE'</p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, the day after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel, declaring a "support front" for Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clashes escalated sharply since last week, with hundreds killed and thousands injured in Lebanon as Israel wages an air campaign that has seen strikes in most parts of the country.</p>

<p>In the days since the chaos unleashed by the Israeli strikes on Monday, other reports have emerged of families with many members killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the southern town of Hanouiyeh, an Israeli strike killed eight members of one family and a live-in domestic worker from Gambia, relatives said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mohammad Saksouk, whose brother Hasan was among those killed, told Reuters the strike hit a building next to the family home, which collapsed onto theirs.</p>

<p>He said the family had nothing to do with Hezbollah and criticized the Israelis for "indiscriminate" attacks while also questioning why Lebanon had been dragged into a battle that Hezbollah says is in support of Palestinians.</p>

<p>"Now, we're homeless. We are living in the streets," he said via phone from a temporary shelter. "Before, we were living completely normal lives. Who will give us back our homes?"</p>

<p>The victims included Hasan Saksouk, his adult children Mohammad and Mona, Mohammad's wife Fatima and their 9-month-old daughter Rima, as well as Mona's three children, all under nine years old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anna, the Gambian worker in her early 30s, also perished.</p>

<p>The coastal town of Saksakieh saw 11 civilians killed on Monday, including six women and two children, according to Mayor Ali Abbas, who said there were direct strikes on homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These are civilian homes, they have nothing to do with any kind of military installation," Abbas told Reuters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA said on Tuesday the launch of its Crew-9 mission with SpaceX has been pushed back to Sept. 28 due to Tropical Storm Helene.</p>

<p>SpaceX's upcoming Crew Dragon mission, a routine flight called Crew-9, is expected to send one NASA astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Although Helene is moving through the Gulf of Mexico and expected to impact the northwest of region of Florida, it is large enough that high winds and heavy rain are expected in the Cape Canaveral region, from where the mission is set to be launched.</p>

<p>The Crew-9 mission was originally stated to be launched no earlier than Aug. 18, but was pushed back a month to spend more time analyzing issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which remains docked at the station.</p>

<p>NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov are to launch aboard the Dragon spacecraft to the ISS, on what will be the ninth crew rotation mission with SpaceX under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action on Wednesday endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, saying former President Donald Trump posed a greater danger to the community with his promise to reinstate a travel ban affecting majority-Muslim countries.</p>

<p>The group, which endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020 after first backing Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, says it mobilized 1 million Muslim voters in that election.</p>

<p>Harris already won the endorsement of smaller Muslim groups, including the Black Muslim Leadership Council Fund and the American Muslim Democratic Caucus ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign had no immediate comment.</p>

<p>He says he will reinstate the so-called "travel ban" that restricts entry into the United States of people from a list of largely Muslim-dominant countries. Biden rolled back the ban shortly after taking office in 2021.</p>

<p>The Biden administration, where Harris serves as vice president, has faced calls from both fellow Democrats and international allies throughout Israel's campaign in Gaza to press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to ease the devastating humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The US, Israel's biggest ally and weapons supplier, has sent Israel more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000-pound (900-kg) bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles since the start of the Gaza war in October, US officials told Reuters in June.</p>

<p>The war in the Gaza Strip began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing some 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Since then, Israel's military has leveled swaths of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 41,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladimir Putin today issued a nuclear warning to the West in the event of a "massive" air attack on Russia. This includes the use of cruise missiles which the UK has supplied to Ukraine for Kyiv to target locations deep within Russian territory.</p>

<p>President Putin's remarks came after his urgent meeting with Moscow's top security council to discuss Russia's nuclear deterrence.</p>

<p>Russia's threat comes amid rising concerns in Moscow over Ukraine being allowed by Western powers - especially the UK and US - to use cruise missiles against it.</p>

<p>Last week the UK reportedly cleared the use of its 'Storm Shadow' cruise missile to be used to bomb Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer even flew to Washington DC to meet US President Joe Biden. The two leaders reportedly discussed Ukraine's use of weapons on Russian soil.</p>

<p>The Russian intelligence had information about such a possibility and had said earlier this month that "It has become necessary for Moscow to revise its nuclear doctrine because of the West's escalation of the war in Ukraine."</p>

<p>Speaking about the reports that the United States and United Kingdom are about to give clearance to Ukraine for Kyiv to launch cruise missiles on Russian soil, President Putin said this month that, "The West would be directly fighting with Russia if it gave such permission to Ukraine (to bomb Russia)" adding that Moscow would be forced to make "appropriate decisions" in such a scenario.</p>

<h2><strong>RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR DOCTRINE &amp; TREATY WITH US</strong></h2>

<p>Russia is the world's largest nuclear power. Together, Russia and the United States control 88% of the world's nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Russia's current nuclear doctrine was set in place by Vladimir Putin four years ago, before the war with Ukraine broke out. According to the current doctrine, Russia may use nuclear weapons in the scenario where it comes under a nuclear attack or if a conventional attack threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<p>The United States and Russia have a nuclear treaty called the US-Russia New START Treaty, which entered into force on February 5, 2011.</p>

<p>Under the treaty, the United States and the Russian Federation had seven years to meet the treaty's central limits on strategic offensive arms (by February 5, 2018) and are then obligated to maintain those limits for as long as the treaty remains in force.</p>

<p>According to the US State Department, this treaty enhances US national security by placing verifiable limits on all Russian deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons. The United States and the Russian Federation have agreed to extend the treaty through February 4, 2026.</p>

<p>According to a Reuters report, the Kremlin said that any discussions about a replacement to the US-Russia New START Treaty, which expires in 2026, would need to take into account European nuclear potential - shorthand for the arsenals of Britain and France.</p>

<p>"We have not yet received a response from the Americans to this, but of course an agreement is needed and negotiations should begin as soon as possible," Peskov said when asked about a possible replacement for the New START Treaty.</p>

<h3><strong>THE STORM SHADOW MISSILE</strong></h3>

<p>Ukraine already has the UK-supplied Storm Shadow missile, but uses it only within its territory to combat Russian forces.</p>

<p>So far, there are restriction on Ukraine on the use of advanced western weaponry on targets within the Russian territory, but this is likely to change with clearances reportedly being issued by the UK, with US backing it.</p>

<p>The Storm Shadow is a low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile. It is jointly developed by the United Kingdom and France and has a range of around 500 km. It has already been integrated into Ukrainian fighter aircraft, including the Russia-built Su-24 bombers - a legacy of the past, from when Ukraine was part of the erstwhile Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Developed in 1994 and manufactured by Matra and British Aerospace, the Storm Shadow missile is now made by MBDA Systems. 'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>

<h3><strong>RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE</strong></h3>

<p>Should Ukraine use cruise missiles to attack Russian territory, a Russian response to this could be massive. The international worry is that Moscow may seriously consider the use of nuclear weapons in such a scenario.</p>

<p>According to Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation - a nonpartisan non-profit organisation on nuclear weapons disarmament - Russia maintains a stockpile of an estimated 6,372 nuclear warheads - the world's largest.</p>

<p>Of these, 1,572 of which are deployed on strategic land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. Approximately 870 more strategic warheads and 1,870 non-strategic warheads are in reserve with an additional estimated 2,060 warheads awaiting dismantlement.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Israeli bombs flattened buildings and sent smoke billowing skywards over Lebanon this week, Gazans looked on with both empathy and fear over how the widening war might affect them.</p>

<p>Israel carried out a third day of air strikes against Lebanon on Wednesday, saying it was targeting weapons caches and infrastructure belonging to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah group.</p>

<p>In a dramatic escalation after nearly a year of cross-border violence, Israeli air raids on Monday killed at least 558 people in Lebanon in the country's deadliest day since the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

<p>After the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas against southern Israel, Hezbollah said it began striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-backed group.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, marked by relentless Israeli bombardment that has devastated much of the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>Chadi Nawfal, a 24-year-old resident of Gaza City who said he lost his home in an Israeli strike, told AFP on Wednesday that footage from Lebanon was hard to watch.</p>

<p>"The bloody scenes from Lebanon that we see on our television screens are very harsh images," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"We people in the Gaza Strip are the only ones who can currently feel the pain that the Lebanese people are experiencing."</p>

<p>The sustained Israeli aerial assault on Lebanon is the latest in a series of attacks that began last week with coordinated blasts of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies.</p>

<p>The explosions killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000, and were followed by a deadly strike on Friday on south Beirut, with leading Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil among the dead.</p>

<p><strong>Israeli focus moves north</strong></p>

<p>Another strike on the Lebanese capital on Tuesday killed Hezbollah rocket forces commander Ibrahim Kobeissi.</p>

<p>Taken together, Israel's onslaught confirmed its Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's claim a week ago that the war's "centre of gravity" was moving northward.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fire has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has said it is determined to return them to their homes along the border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>Ayman al-Amreiti, another displaced resident of Gaza City, said he was worried the fighting in Lebanon would mean the ongoing war in Gaza gets less global attention.</p>

<p>"The military weight is now shifting to Lebanon, so even the media attention on the Gaza Strip has become secondary," the 42-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"This encourages the appetite of the occupation (Israel) to commit more crimes."</p>

<p>Hamas's attack on Israel nearly a year ago resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas operatives that day, 97 are still being held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,495 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The United Nations has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p><strong>'The victims are the people'</strong></p>

<p>There are obvious differences in timeframe and scale, but Umm Munzir Naim, 52, told AFP she could not help but see similarities between the fighting in Lebanon and in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The war against Lebanon and Hezbollah is a war like in Gaza. The victims are the people," she said.</p>

<p>"The small, the big, the properties, everything is targeted -- humans, trees...</p>

<p>"They say it's against Hamas and Hezbollah, but on the ground it's people who die."</p>

<p>Amreiti said he hoped the fighting would end soon in both places, and that their fates could even be linked given Hezbollah's past pledges to stop fighting once a Gaza ceasefire comes about.</p>

<p>"The outcome, the hope is that any settlement with Hezbollah will also involve Gaza," he said.</p>

<p>"Right now, that is the hope that the children of the Palestinian people are turning to."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two defendants in a mass rape trial that has shocked France on Wednesday reluctantly admitted they had raped a man's heavily sedated wife as they had not sought her consent.</p>

<p>The main defendant in the case, 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot, has confessed to administering sedatives to his wife to rape her and inviting strangers to join in the sexual abuse from 2011 to 2020.</p>

<p>Another 49 men have also been charged with rape or attempted rape of his wife Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>The hearings began in early September in the southern city of Avignon.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot, who is also 71 and has since divorced her husband, requested the case be heard in public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>In court on Wednesday, the latest of the defendants, 43-year-old Husamettin D., was at first not prepared to accept the charges against him.</p>

<p>He recounted how Dominique Pelicot had invited him over after they met online in June 2019.</p>

<p>Husamettin D. said Dominique Pelicot told him his wife was next to him as they communicated via chat.</p>

<p>He added that he had received a message that read: "I am indeed his wife, and I agree to welcome you."</p>

<p>Husamettin D. headed over to their home in the small town of Mazan that same evening, where he was led into the main bedroom.</p>

<p>"I started foreplay, I saw she didn't react. I said, 'She's dead, your wife.' (Dominique Pelicot) said, 'No, you're imagining it.' He penetrated her and she lifted up her head a little," Husamettin D. said.</p>

<p>The defendant added that they continued for at least half an hour, until he clearly heard Gisele Pelicot snoring. He then decided to leave, he said.</p>

<p>But he added: "I'm not a rapist, that's too much for me to bear. It's her husband. I never thought that guy could do that to his own wife."</p>

<p>Reminded of the definition of rape by one of the judges, an act committed "through violence, constraint, threat or surprise", Husamettin D. however conceded.</p>

<p>"Now I admit it was rape," he said.</p>

<p>Mathieu D., 53, accepted the charges against him.</p>

<p>He said that Dominique Pelicot had told him his wife "would have been put to sleep by him administering her drugs" so that the couple could "later watch the videos together".</p>

<p>He said he did not have the impression he was committing rape at the time, but later "realised" after being arrested that Gisele Pelicot had not given her consent.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot meticulously documented the abuse, with his pictures and videos later allowing investigators to identify dozens of suspects.</p>

<p>Police discovered he had been abusing his wife for almost a decade after he was detained in 2020 for filming up women's skirts, or "upskirting", in a local supermarket.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden warned Wednesday of the possibility of an "all-out war" in the Middle East but said he was hopeful a settlement was still achievable for the conflict-torn region.</p>

<p>Biden's comments as he appeared on ABC chat show "The View" came as Israel put troops on alert for possible entry into Lebanon and the war in Gaza grinds on.</p>

<p>"An all-out war is possible," Biden said when asked about the situation. "What I think is, also, the opportunity is still in play to have a settlement that could fundamentally change the whole region."</p>

<p>Biden appeared to raise the possibility of a ceasefire in Lebanon, where Israeli strikes targeting the Hezbollah militia have killed more than 600 people this week.</p>

<p>"They have a possibility -- I don't want to exaggerate it -- there's a possibility if we can deal with a ceasefire in Lebanon that it can move into dealing with the West Bank as well," said Biden.</p>

<p>Israel has been carrying out deadly raids in the occupied West Bank since late August targeting what it says are Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>Biden added however that "we also have Gaza to deal with", as efforts stall to get a ceasefire deal to end Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza after the group's October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>"But it's possible and I'm using every bit of energy with my team to get this done. There's a desire to see change in the region," he said.</p>

<p>The US president also pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drop his opposition to an independent Palestinian state to end the crisis.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with his (Netanyahu's) position. There needs to be a two-state solution," Biden told the show's all-women panel, led by US comedian Whoopi Goldberg.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army chief told soldiers Wednesday to prepare for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon as US President Joe Biden warned against "all-out war" in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"We are attacking all day, both to prepare the ground for the possibility of your entry, but also to continue striking Hezbollah," Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told a tank brigade, a statement from the military said as Israeli warplanes conducted hundreds of deadly strikes around Lebanon.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's military operations against Hezbollah would not stop until northern residents can safely return to their homes.</p>

<p>Israel's warnings came after Hezbollah said it had targeted Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters on Tel Aviv's outskirts -- the first time it has fired a ballistic missile in almost a year of cross-border clashes sparked by the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health minister said retaliatory Israeli strikes killed 51 people and injured 223, including in mountainous areas outside Hezbollah's traditional strongholds.</p>

<p>Israel said it hit 60 Hezbollah intelligence sites, among hundreds of the group's targets struck across Lebanon.</p>

<p>In Washington, President Biden warned of the possibility of "all-out war" after Israel's troops were put on alert for a possible ground operation.</p>

<p>"An all-out war is possible," Biden told broadcaster ABC.</p>

<p>"What I think is, also, the opportunity is still in play to have a settlement that could fundamentally change the whole region."</p>

<p>Biden added that there was a "possibility" of a Lebanon ceasefire, but "I don't want to exaggerate it".</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's main backer, and Biden said earlier Wednesday a "full-scale war is not in anyone's interest".</p>

<p><strong>Israel calls reservists</strong></p>

<p>Cross-border clashes intensified Wednesday after Israeli raids on Monday killed at least 558 people in the deadliest day of violence in Lebanon since its 1975-90 civil war.</p>

<p>Nour Hamad, a 22-year-old student in the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, described living "in a state of terror" all week.</p>

<p>"We spent four or five days without sleep, not knowing if we will wake up in the morning," she said.</p>

<p>In Tel Aviv, sirens sounded following Hezbollah's unprecedented missile launch at dawn.</p>

<p>Tel Aviv resident Hedva Fadlon, 61, told AFP: "The situation is difficult. We feel the pressure and the tension... I don't think anyone in the world would like to live like this."</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called Hezbollah's attack on Tel Aviv "deeply concerning", but added there was "still time and space for a diplomatic solution here to de-escalate the tensions and to prevent an all-out war".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "over 280 Hezbollah" targets had been struck across Lebanon on Wednesday, and added the strikes were ongoing.</p>

<p>"Fighter jets struck 60 terrorist targets belonging to Hezbollah's intelligence directorate," the army said.</p>

<p>It said two reserve brigades were being called up "for operational missions in the northern arena", adding this would "enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation".</p>

<p><strong>Defiant Netanyahu</strong></p>

<p>The UN Security Council said it would hold an emergency meeting on the crisis in New York later Wednesday, as UN chief Antonio Guterres warned the situation was critical.</p>

<p>"We should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink," he said.</p>

<p>The UN's International Organization for Migration on Wednesday said 90,000 people had been displaced in Lebanon so far this week.</p>

<p>Among them, "many of the more than 111,000 people displaced since October... are likely to have been secondarily displaced", a statement from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs added.</p>

<p>Hezbollah on Tuesday confirmed Israel had killed its rocket forces commander Ibrahim Kobeissi in a strike on Beirut.</p>

<p>Netanyahu delayed his departure for New York until Thursday, where he too is due to speak at the General Assembly.</p>

<p>Israel's premier has defied international calls for restraint.</p>

<p>"We will continue to hit Hezbollah... the one who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his home will not have a home," he vowed on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, condemned Israel's raids, with supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying the recent killing of Hezbollah commanders would not crush the group.</p>

<p>"Some of the effective and valuable forces of Hezbollah were martyred, which undoubtedly caused damage to Hezbollah, but this was not the sort of damage that could bring the group to its knees," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Elusive ceasefire</strong></p>

<p>While the Israel-Lebanon border has seen near-daily clashes for a year, the violence escalated dramatically last week, when coordinated communications device blasts that Hezbollah blamed on Israel killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000.</p>

<p>Then Israel carried out an air strike on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, killing a top military commander and other fighters and civilians.</p>

<p>Efforts to end the war in Gaza, which analysts say are key to stopping the escalation in Lebanon, have yet to make progress.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has been accused by critics of stalling in Gaza ceasefire negotiations and prolonging the war to appease far-right coalition partners.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas operatives, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,495 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.<br />

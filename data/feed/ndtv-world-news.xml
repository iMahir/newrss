       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's DART mission – <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a> – was humanity's first real-world planetary defence mission.</p>

<p>In September 2022, the DART spacecraft smashed into the companion “moon” of a small asteroid 11 million kilometres from Earth. One goal was to find out if we can <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-results-from-nasas-dart-planetary-defence-mission-confirm-we-could-deflect-deadly-asteroids-200835">give such things a shove</a> if one were headed our way.</p>

<p>By gathering lots of data on approach and after the impact, we would also get a better idea of what we'd be in for if such an asteroid were to hit Earth.</p>

<p>Five new studies <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">published in Nature Communications</a> today have used the images sent back from DART and its travel buddy <a href="https://www.asi.it/en/planets-stars-universe/solar-system-and-beyond/liciacube/">LICIACube</a> to unravel the origins of the Didymos-Dimorphos dual asteroid system. They've also put that data in context for other asteroids out there.</p>

<h2>Asteroids are natural hazards</h2>

<p>Our Solar System is full of small asteroids – debris that never made it into planets. Those that come close to Earth's orbit around the Sun are called Near Earth Objects (NEOs). These pose the biggest risk to us, but are also the most accessible.</p>

<p>Planetary defence from these natural hazards really depends on knowing their composition – not just what they're made of, but how they're put together. Are they solid objects that will punch through our atmosphere if given the chance, or are they <a href="https://theconversation.com/our-solar-system-is-filled-with-asteroids-that-are-particularly-hard-to-destroy-new-study-finds-197413">more like rubble piles</a>, barely held together?</p>

<p>The Didymos asteroid, and its tiny moon Dimorphos, are what's known as a binary asteroid system. They were the perfect target for the DART mission, because the effects of the impact could be easily measured in changes to Dimorphos' orbit.</p>

<p>They are also close(ish) to Earth, or are at least NEOs. And they're a very common type of asteroid we haven't had a good look at before. The chance to also learn how binary asteroids form was the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Quite a few binary asteroid systems have been discovered, but planetary scientists don't exactly know how they form. In one of the new studies, a team <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50146-x">led by Olivier Barnouin</a> from Johns Hopkins University in the United States used images from DART and LICIACube to estimate the age of the system by looking at surface roughness and crater records.</p>

<p>They found Didymos is roughly 12.5 million years old, while its moon Dimorphos formed less than 300,000 years ago. That may still sound like a lot, but it's much younger than was expected.</p>

<h2>A pile of boulders</h2>

<p>Dimorphos is also not a solid rock as we'd typically imagine. It is a rubble pile of boulders that are barely held together. Along with its young age, it shows there can be multiple “generations” of these rubble pile asteroids in the wake of larger asteroid collisions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213133716301330">Sunlight actually causes</a> small bodies like asteroids to spin. As Didymos started to spin like a top, its shape became squashed and bulged in the middle. This was enough to cause large pieces to just roll off the main body, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50149-8">with some even leaving tracks</a>.</p>

<p>These pieces slowly created a ring of debris around Didymos. Over time, as the debris started sticking together, it formed the smaller moon Dimorphos.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">How the spin of Didymos could have produced its tiny moon Dimorphos. Video by Yun Zhang.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50148-9">led by Maurizio Pajola</a> from Auburn University in the US used boulder distributions to confirm this. The team also discovered there were significantly more (up to five times) large boulders than have been observed on other non-binary asteroids humans have visited.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50147-w">Another of the new studies</a> shows us that boulders on all asteroids space missions have visited so far (Itokawa, Ryugu and Bennu) were likely shaped the same way. But this excess of larger boulders on the Didymos system could be a unique feature of binaries.</p>

</figure>

<p>Lastly, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50145-y">another paper shows</a> this type of asteroid appears to be more susceptible to cracking. This happens due to the heating–cooling cycles between day and night: like a freeze–thaw cycle but without the water.</p>

<p>This means if something (such as a spacecraft) were to impact it, there would be much more debris thrown up into space. It would even increase the amount of “shove” it could have. But there is a good chance that what lies underneath is much stronger than what we're seeing on the surface.</p>

<p>This is where the European Space Agency's <a href="https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Hera">Hera mission</a> will step in. It will not only be able to provide higher-resolution images of the DART impact sites, but will also be able to probe the asteroids' interiors using low-frequency radar.</p>

<p>The DART mission not only tested our ability to protect ourselves from future asteroid impacts, but also enlightened us on the formation and evolution of rubble pile and binary asteroids near Earth.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The third stage of Russia's non-strategic nuclear exercises has begun, which focuses on the preparation of units for the combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, the Russian Ministry of Defense said on Wednesday on its Telegram channel.</p>

<p>It said that the exercises involve the central and southern military districts as well as the Aerospace Forces, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"As part of this stage, personnel from the missile formations of the central and southern military districts will work on training and combat tasks, including receiving special training munitions for the Iskander-M operational-tactical missile systems, equipping missile carriers, and covertly moving to designated positional areas to prepare for electronic launches," said the ministry.</p>

<p>It added that personnel from the aviation units of the Aerospace Forces involved in the exercise would practice equipping aviation strike assets with special warheads and flying to designated patrol areas.</p>

<p>Earlier, as part of the first and second stages of the exercise of non-strategic nuclear forces, issues of preparing units of the southern and Leningrad military districts, units of the Aerospace Forces and the navy for the combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons were worked out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Lawyers representing jailed Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza said Wednesday that they did not know the dissident's exact location after twice being denied access to the facility where he was supposed to be held.</p>

<p>Rumours are swirling of an upcoming prisoner swap involving Russia and Western countries as numerous high-profile prisoners, including foreigners, have gone missing from Russian prisons where they are serving long terms, in recent days.</p>

<p>"Today a lawyer for Vladimir Kara-Murza for a second day running was not allowed to visit him in a prison hospital. The exact location of the political prisoner is unknown," his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>Kara-Murza, a 42-year-old joint Russian and British citizen, is serving a 25-year sentence in Siberia for treason and other charges.</p>

<p>He suffers from a nerve disease and was moved to a prison hospital earlier this month for medical checks.</p>

<p>The dissident is being represented by a local lawyer in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he has been imprisoned.</p>

<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, the lawyer was told he could not visit his client because he was having a medical examination, Prokhorov said.</p>

<p>Such a refusal of access is a "gross violation", Prokhorov said.</p>

<p>Kara-Murza is due to have a public court hearing Thursday in Omsk over a legal appeal. His defence team are demanding he be allowed to participate via video link.</p>

<p>"Court staff and the administration of the prison hospital have already expressed doubts that tomorrow there will be stable video link with Vladimir Kara-Murza," Prokhorov wrote.</p>

<p>"But at the same time, so far they deny that he has been moved from the hospital," Prokhorov wrote.</p>

<p>AFP contacted the Federal Prison Service, who said they could not provide information on a prisoner without an official request to the penal colony.</p>

<p>At least seven Russian political prisoners have been moved from their penal colonies or jails in recent days, according to lawyers and families.</p>

<p>A lawyer for jailed former US marine Paul Whelan, charged with espionage, was also unsure of his location on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Moscow and Washington have both confirmed there are ongoing negotiations over a swap involving US reporter Evan Gershkovich, sentenced to 16 years for espionage earlier this month in a fast-track trial slammed as a "sham" by the White House.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slovakia's Bratislava Airport was being evacuated due to a bomb alert, local police said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Based on an anonymous announcement regarding the placement of an explosive device on the premises of M.R. Stefanik Airport in Bratislava, the police are currently taking the necessary steps, including evacuating people," the police said in a Facebook post, the News Agency of the Slovak Republic reported.</p>

<p>Arrivals at the airport have not been suspended, but passengers on such flights have to remain on the planes and wait for further instructions, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"A pyrotechnic inspection is being carried out at the site," it added.</p>

<p>The airport said on its website that the airport building has been evacuated since 8:40 a.m. local time, and departures are not being carried out "until further instructions from the police."</p>

<p>Bratislava Airport, or M.R. Stefanik Airport in Bratislava, is the biggest international airport of the Slovak Republic. It is located 9 km from the city centre and handled over 1.8 million passengers last year, according to the airport website.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that polio had been detected in Gaza and warned that children in the war-ravaged enclave would soon be infected by the disease if preventative measures were not quickly taken.</p>

<p>A day after the WHO said there were "very likely" polio cases among Gaza's population, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus took to social media platform X to flag concern about the human cost of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>"The detection of polio in Gaza is another reminder of the dire conditions the population is facing," Tedros wrote on X. "The persistence of the conflict hampers efforts to identify and respond to preventable threats such as polio."</p>

<p>Tedros linked his post to an article he had written in French newspaper Le Monde, published late on Tuesday, in which he said poliovirus has been detected in sewage samples in Gaza.</p>

<p>In the article, the WHO chief wrote that although no cases of polio had yet been recorded, "unless immediate action is taken, it is only a matter of time before the disease reaches the thousands of unprotected children" there.</p>

<p>Poliomyelitis, which is spread mainly through the faecal-oral route, is a highly infectious virus that can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis and death in young children.</p>

<p>Polio cases have declined by 99% worldwide since 1988 thanks to mass vaccination campaigns and efforts to eradicate it.</p>

<p>The WHO is sending more than a million polio vaccines to Gaza to be administered in the coming weeks to prevent children from becoming infected with the disease, Tedros said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concerns grew among Israelis on Wednesday over the fate of dozens of hostages still held captive in Gaza following the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-irans-capital-report-6228024" target="_blank">killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh</a> in Tehran.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's killing "was a mistake as it threatens the possibility of having a hostage deal," said Anat Noy, a resident of the coastal city of Haifa, in his 50s.</p>

<p>"We woke up today with a sense of fear in our hearts that this can escalate even more. There is no calm... we are afraid."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Hamas and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced that Haniyeh, 61, had been killed in Tehran in an Israeli air strike.</p>

<p>He was in the Iranian capital to attend the swearing-in on Tuesday of President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>As the political chief of the Palestinian movement Hamas, Haniyeh was overseeing the negotiations for a deal to end the war in Gaza and release hostages held in the territory in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel.</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said Haniyeh's killing takes the war with Israel to a "new levels," warning of "enormous consequences for the entire region".</p>

<p>The war began after an unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military have confirmed dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,445 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry, which does not provide details of civilian and operatives deaths.</p>

<h3><strong>Time of the essence</strong></h3>

<p>Months of negotiations mediated by Qatar and Egypt, with the support of the United States, between Hamas and Israel have failed to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

<p>Both Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for the delay in striking the deal.</p>

<p>"We will be happy when the hostages come back home and the war will be over," said another Haifa resident, Avit Ben-Ishai.</p>

<p>Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum acknowledged the military gains of the past nearly 10 months of the war, but said "true achievement" can come only with the return of the hostages.</p>

<p>"Time is of the essence, and we implore the Israeli government and global leaders to decisively advance negotiations," it said in a statement released after Haniyeh's killing was announced.</p>

<h3><strong>This is the time for a deal</strong></h3>

<p>Tel Aviv resident Shahar Binyami said she was anxious over how Hamas and allies like Lebanon's Hezbollah movement would react to Haniyeh's killing.</p>

<p>"What stresses me now is the reaction of Hamas and Hezbollah," Binyami, 25, told AFP as she cancelled plans to go to the beach out of fear.</p>

<p>"My partner was in reserve service in the north since September and was told to be on standby."</p>

<p>An Israeli strike late Tuesday targeted Hezbollah top commander Fuad Shukr in a building in a south Beirut suburb, hours before Haniyeh was killed.</p>

<p>Shukr's death has yet to be confirmed by the Lebanese group.</p>

<p>Tel Aviv resident Jacob, who only gave his first name, said he was unsure whether Haniyeh's killing would resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>"Our goal first of all should be the release of the hostages, and the war of October 7 should not have happened," he said.</p>

<p>"Israel is doing its best to exist in the Middle East in peace, all we do is defend ourselves all the time."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in Indonesia was arrested for allegedly stabbing his friend to death after an argument over the classic riddle, "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/indonesia-chicken-egg-question-murder-sulawesi-b2588159.html">Independent,</a></em> the incident occurred on July 24 in Southeast Sulawesi province's Muna Regency, when the suspect, identified as DR, invited&nbsp;Kadir Markus for a drink.&nbsp;After a few rounds of alcoholic drinks, DR asked Mr&nbsp;Markus to answer a riddle for him.</p>

<p>''Which came first, the chicken or the egg,'' DR was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>As the conversation turned into a heated debate, Mr&nbsp;Markus tried to distance himself from the argument, refusing to engage further.&nbsp;Mr Markus decided to go back to his home, but DR grabbed a dagger and chased him on his bike and then on foot before attacking him multiple times.&nbsp;The weapon used in the crime was a badik, a traditional dagger of southern Sulawesi's coastal tribes like the Bugis and the Makassarese.</p>

<p>Despite the valiant efforts of bystanders who rushed Mr Markus to the hospital, the victim tragically succumbed to his injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police said both men were under the influence of alcohol at the time.</p>

<p>Tongkuno police chief Iptu Abdul Hasan confirmed the incident, revealing that the suspect has been taken into custody. The police have also seized the weapon used in the crime and a pair of trousers worn by the suspect. He has been charged with murder, facing up to 18 years in prison if convicted.</p>

<p>Mr Markus was laid to rest on July 26, while the investigation into the senseless murder is still ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a similar incident last year, an Indonesian man stabbed and killed his friend after he was removed from a WhatsApp group. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesian-man-stabs-friend-to-death-after-being-hurt-over-removal-from-whatsapp-group-chat">Straits Times</a></em>, a seemingly trivial dispute in a chat group called XTC Beer 188, centred around motorcycles, ended in tragedy when a perceived taunt sparked a chain of events.</p>

<p>Toyiban, feeling hurt and rejected after being removed from the group by his friend and administrator Adrian, 29, confronted him in person. The situation quickly escalated into a physical altercation, during which Toyiban pulled out a sharp weapon and attacked Adrian, resulting in his death.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States was "not aware of or involved in" the killing of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you what this means. I can tell you that the imperative of getting a ceasefire, the importance that that has for everyone, remains," Blinken said, according to a transcript shared by his staff from an interview with Channel News Asia in Singapore.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was attending the inauguration of Iran's new president when he was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-what-hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-was-doing-hours-before-his-assasination-6231404" target="_blank">killed </a>by an Israeli air strike, Hamas said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lebanon-on-alert-as-israel-vows-severe-response-to-rocket-deaths-said-by-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-6220710" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Washington is Israel's key military backer and has been pushing for a Gaza ceasefire, which Blinken said remains "manifestly in the interests" of the Israeli hostages and Gazans who have been "caught in this crossfire of Hamas's making".</p>

<p>As the political chief of the Palestinian movement Hamas, Haniyeh was overseeing the negotiations for a deal to end the war in Gaza and release hostages held in the territory in exchange for Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel.</p>

<p>Blinken, who is visiting Singapore, said a Gaza ceasefire is also key to preventing the conflict from spreading to the rest of the region.</p>

<p>"We've been working from day one not only to try to get to a better place in Gaza but also to prevent the conflict from spreading, whether it's the north with Lebanon and Hezbollah, whether it's the Red Sea with the Huthis, whether it's Iran, Syria, Iraq, you name it," Blinken told a forum in the city state.</p>

<p>"A big key to trying to make sure that that doesn't happen, and that we can move to a better place, is getting the ceasefire."</p>

<p>Qatar -- a vital mediator in truce talks which also hosts Hamas's political leadership that included Haniyeh -- has questioned the future of negotiations in the wake of the assassination.</p>

<p>Hamas vowed the "cowardly" killing of their veteran leader "will not go unanswered".</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,400 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh visited a theme park exhibition featuring 'Axis of Resistance' landmarks just hours before his assassination in Iran. He was seen alongside Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Ziad al-Nakhaleh.</p>

<p>The 'Axis of Resistance' is an Iran-led coalition of groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis and allied forces in Syria and Iraq. This coalition aims to counter Western influence, particularly from the US and Israel, in the region. The alliance seeks to counteract what it dubs as aggression and interference by these powers, advocating for a Middle East free from external control. Iran plays a central role in providing significant military aid, training, and funding to other members.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Iranian media has released a video of Haniyeh's visit, hours before his death. He was seen talking to reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hamas leader and one of his bodyguards were killed Wednesday morning in an airstrike on the building where they were staying. On Tuesday, Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Hamas has blamed Israel for the attack. "This assassination by the Israeli occupation of Brother Haniyeh is a grave escalation that aims to break the will of Hamas," senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said in <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-irans-capital-report-6228024  ">a statement</a>.</p>

<p>Israel previously vowed to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders in response to the group's October 7 attack on southern Israel. Since then, Israel's war on Gaza has killed close to 39,400 people and injured 90,923 others.</p>

<p>Earlier, Haniyeh's three sons, Hazem, Amir and Mohammad, were killed on April 10 this year when their car was hit by an Israeli airstrike. Hamas reported that Haniyeh also lost four of his grandchildren – three girls and a boy.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US model Bella Hadid has said that she is "shocked, upset, and disappointed" at the Adidas campaign in which she was featured that evoked the memories of a 1972 terrorist attack that killed Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US model Bella Hadid has said that she is "shocked, upset, and disappointed" at the Adidas campaign in which she was featured that evoked the memories of a 1972 terrorist attack that killed Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. Bella Hadid, who is half-Palestinian, was featured this month in the Adidas advertisement for its SL 72 shoes. The shoes were first released for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. During those Games, members of the Palestinian group Black September infiltrated the Olympic Village and killed 11 Israeli athletes. Adidas pulled the ads this month after receiving only backlash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, in an Instagram statement, Hadid wrote, "I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign." She said that she never learned about the "historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972". "I would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My team should have known. Adidas should have known, and I should have done more research so that I too would have known and understood, and spoken up," Hadid, who was born in 1996 to a Palestinian father, added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hadid's statement comes after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/adidas-drops-pro-palestinian-model-bella-hadid-from-ad-referencing-1973-munich-olympics-6143343">Adidas </a>pulled the advertisement with the model and pledged to revise the remainder of the SL 72 marketing campaign. The company said that it did not intend to make any connections "to tragic historical events".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The German company also publicly apologised to Bella Hadid and others who participated in the campaign, saying the company "made an unintentional mistake" and expressing regret "for any negative impact".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokeswoman also confirmed that Bella Hadid had been removed from the campaign, which notes that the shoes were first introduced in 1972 but never mentions the terror attack on the Israeli athletes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bella Hadid, who was born in the US but has Palestinian roots through her father, has been vocal about her support for Palestinian rights since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 triggered the war in Gaza. She has taken part in several pro-Palestinian demonstrations during the conflict and has described Israel's offensive as a "genocide".</p>

<p>In 2021, Bella Hadid, her sister Gigi Hadid and singer Dua Lipa were described as anti-Semitic in an advertisement published in The New York Times by a Jewish group called the World Values Network.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myanmar's embattled military government extended a state of emergency on Wednesday for another six months, state media said, as the junta struggles to maintain its grip on power with fighting flaring on multiple fronts and the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/explained-myanmar-rebel-crisis-and-how-it-spilled-over-to-india-4916257" target="_blank">economy in crisis.</a></p>

<p>Army-run Myawaddy media said the military-controlled National Defence and Security Council extended emergency rule to give the junta more time to put together population data for voter lists. The junta has said it will hold an election next year.</p>

<p>The military put the country under emergency rule for a year when it took power in a February 2021 coup, deposing the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi and triggering nationwide street protests that it violently crushed.</p>

<p>The junta has since extended that every six months, as the protest movement morphed into an armed rebellion that has widened and is now posing an existential threat to the generals.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to restore peace and stability because of ongoing terrorist activities," state-run media said of the latest extension, referring to the armed resistance.</p>

<p>Last week, all responsibilities of Myanmar's figurehead president were handed over to junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, after the nominal head of state was placed on medical leave due to a prolonged illness.</p>

<p>Min Aung Hlaing has repeatedly promised to hold a multi-party election, with the general saying in June that polls will be conducted in 2025.</p>

<p>Previous election timelines have been postponed, citing the ongoing violence as the reason. Min Aung Hlaing has insisted the junta does not plan to hold power long.</p>

<p>The military took power after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won overwhelmingly by Suu Kyi's party, which the party denied. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former BBC news anchor Huw Edwards, one of the most recognisable faces on UK television, pleaded guilty Wednesday to three counts of making indecent images of children.</p>

<p>The 62-year-old -- who resigned from the BBC in April on "medical advice", six months after he was arrested -- faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a minimum of 12 months.</p>

<p>Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Edwards sat impassively during the 25-minute court hearing as he admitted receiving 41 indecent images of children on WhatsApp, including seven of the most serious type.</p>

<p>Under English law, electronic communications involving indecent imagery of children -- including receiving and downloading pictures and videos -- can constitute the offence of making indecent images of children.</p>

<p>The crimes involving Edwards occurred between December 2020 and August 2021, amended from the initial chargesheet which ran to April 2022.</p>

<p>Westminster Magistrates' Court in London heard that the former TV anchor had received 377 sexual images from a man he met online, of which 41 were indecent images of children.</p>

<p>"These images appear to have been received with approval," prosecutor Ian Hope told the court.</p>

<p>Of the gravest, the estimated age of most of the children was 13 to 15, but one was aged between seven and nine, he noted.</p>

<p>Edwards had been told that the male in the "moving film" was "quite young looking" and that he could be sent more that were "illegal".</p>

<p>Although the ex-presenter received that film, he told the man not to send any illegal images, the court heard.</p>

<p><strong>'Serious issues'</strong></p>

<p>Edwards's lawyer, Philip Evans, said that his client's devices had been seized and that it was clear he had not made or shared the images.</p>

<p>"There's no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has... in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort," Evans told the court.</p>

<p>He added that the defendant was of "good character" and that "there are serious issues in relation to Mr Edwards's health both mental and physical".</p>

<p>Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring released Edwards on conditional bail until his next hearing on September 16, when he could be sentenced.</p>

<p>Goldspring ordered probation services to draw up a report, telling Edwards he needed "to read more about you" before sentencing.</p>

<p>"I'm asking the probation service to look at this case, with genuinely all options open," the magistrate said.</p>

<p>Hope had earlier told the court that a suspended sentence might be appropriate, if paired with a community order and a sexual offender treatment programme.</p>

<p>Edwards, the BBC's lead presenter on key events such as the death and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, was suspended in July 2023 when allegations first emerged.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Turkey passed a new law Tuesday aimed at removing millions of stray dogs that animal welfare activists worry could lead to a mass culling.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To combat the number of stray dogs in the nation, Turkish lawmakers recently passed a new rule. The Grand National Assembly passed the bill following an overnight session; the government had pushed for its approval before to the summer break, according to <em>The Times.</em></p>

<p>Municipalities are required by law to gather stray dogs, place them in shelters, and make sure they are spayed, neutered, and vaccinated before being adopted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are worries, though, that certain dogs who are sick to the point of death, in excruciating pain, or who represent a health risk would be put to death.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/how-an-entire-23-member-sri-lankan-handball-team-vanished-without-a-trace-in-germany-6220499"><strong>Also Read | How An Entire 23 Member Sri Lankan Handball Team Vanished Without A Trace In Germany</strong></a></p>

<p>Opponents contend that the law might result in a mass euthanasia or disregard for these creatures. The bill has been dubbed the "massacre law" by opponents of the law and animal welfare organisations, who are pushing for its repeal, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://time.com/7005319/turkey-stray-dogs-massacre-law/">news portal.</a></p>

<p>Some critics also fear that the law might be used to target political opponents, particularly after significant gains by the opposition in recent local elections. The law includes penalties for mayors who do not comply, and the main opposition party has pledged not to implement it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protests have erupted across Turkey, with demonstrations in Istanbul's Sishane Square and outside municipal offices in Ankara. Protesters have voiced their opposition to the law, emphasizing life and solidarity over hostility.</p>

<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who must now sign the measure into law, expressed gratitude to legislators who supported it. The opposition has indicated plans to challenge the legislation in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The legislation primarily addresses the stray dog population, with no provisions for the country's large stray cat population. The government estimates around 4 million stray dogs in Turkey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Israel's war in Gaza rages, a growing number of parents in Israel are demanding sperm from the bodies of their sons, who were killed during the ongoing conflict, to be extracted and frozen, a BBC report said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Israel's war in Gaza rages, a growing number of parents in Israel are demanding sperm from the bodies of their sons, who were killed during the ongoing conflict, to be extracted and frozen, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978m6pl99go">BBC report </a>said.</p>

<p>Since Hamas' all-out offense on October 7 and Israel's brutal retaliation, over 400 Israelis have been killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of these, sperm has been retrieved from as many as 170 men - both civilians and soldiers - according to the Israeli health ministry. This marks a 15 times rise as compared to previous years.</p>

<p>The process involves making an small incision in the testicle to take a piece of tissue from which live sperm cells can be extracted and frozen. The chances of successful retrieval are high within 24 hours after death but the sperm cell can live for up to 72 hours in the body of the deceased.</p>

<p>To ease the process of grieving families, some rules for the procedure have been relaxed but families are still frustrated about the lengthy legal processes they face.</p>

<p>In October, the Israeli health ministry removed a mandatory court order request for parents to use the procedure to extract sperm. While it has become easier to freeze the sperm, widows or parents who want to use it in the conception of a child have to prove in court that the dead man wanted to have children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parents say the whole process can take years, the long wait adding to their grief.</p>

<p>The first Israeli couple to preserve and use their dead son's sperm did so in 2002 after their son, a soldier, was shot dead by a Palestinian sniper in the Gaza Strip. Their granddaughter is now 10 years old.</p>

<p>While experts believe the process has “great meaning” to bereaved families, they also say that "the current rules have created a conflict in the case of single men" as their desire to have a child has to be proven to court for the procedure to be carried out.</p>

<p>As single men often have no clear record of consent, their families, who arealready coping with grief in “a very difficult situation”, can only freeze the sperm but can't use it for fertilisation.</p>

<p>Currently, Israeli lawmakers are attempting to draft a bill to create clearer, more comprehensive rules for the process seeing the high number of deaths in the ongoing war in Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The virtual gathering of prominent Democrats, hosted by Christine Pelosi and Nikki Fried, was held on Tuesday evening to denounce Vance's sexist remarks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance's "childless cat ladies" comment about Kamala Harris has rubbed many the wrong way. Criticism poured in from various quarters, including Harris' stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, and actor Jennifer Aniston.</p>

<p>Now, a group of pet lovers and self-described "cat ladies" has responded to Vance's comments by throwing their weight behind Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. They held the latest in a series of Zoom calls.</p>

<p>JD Vance's original remarks, made during a 2021 interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, said the US was run by Democrats, "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they have made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a virtual gathering of prominent Democrats, hosted by Christine Pelosi and Nikki Fried, was held to denounce JD Vance's sexist remarks. The Zoom call had various participants, including former chair of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, and Illinois congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, who appeared with their dogs.</p>

<p>The meeting, organised by the group 'Pet Lovers Fur Kamala', began with a slideshow of pet pictures set to ABBA's Dancing Queen, with a surprise appearance by Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>Pelosi spoke on the importance of supporting women's freedom to "love how they wanna love, and live how they wanna live," as per the Guardian. She criticised Vance's comments, and said the "cat ladies are striking back," adding, "He didn't realise what an opportunity he was giving us, and what he would unleash."</p>

<p>Nikki Fried, former Florida commissioner of agriculture, warned that a Harris loss would lead to a nationwide embrace of extremist policies, citing her experience with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. "We have been living under Project 2025. We have been the lab rats for the Heritage Foundation," she said.</p>

<p>Christine Pelosi and the organisers provided tips on engaging supporters through social media, phone banks and volunteering for Kamala Harris's campaign.</p>

<p>Last week, JD Vance defended his "childless cat ladies" remark, saying they were meant to criticise the Democratic Party's stance on family and children, not individuals who choose not to have kids.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sealed inside a habitat in Texas and cut off from the outside world for over a year, Kelly Haston was the commander of a first-of-its-kind simulation for NASA to prepare for a future mission to Mars.</p>

<p>From conducting mock "Marswalks" to tending to a vertical garden, and occasionally grappling with boredom -- Haston expressed pride in advancing the cause of space exploration while admitting the experience made her reconsider the reality of life on the Red Planet.</p>

<p>"Going to space would be an amazing opportunity," the 53-year-old biologist told AFP. "But I would say that it would be harder having experienced this, to know how it feels to leave your people."</p>

<p>The overarching goal of the experiment, called CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog) Mission 1, is to better understand the impacts of isolation on a crew's performance and health.</p>

<p>The project lasted 378 days and concluded in early July.</p>

<p>After all, a round-trip to Mars could easily take more than two years, factoring in the transit time of six to nine months and the time NASA hopes to spend on the planet.</p>

<p>For Haston, the hardest part was clear: "I could have been in that habitat for another year and survived with all of the other restrictions, but your people -- you miss your people so much."</p>

<p>Communications with the outside world were delayed by twenty minutes each way, simulating how long it takes a radio signal to travel between Earth and Mars.</p>

<p>They were also some limits on sending and receiving videos, to account for bandwidth restrictions.</p>

<p>The worst feeling was when relatives or friends were experiencing rough times, said Haston. "You couldn't be there for them in real-time."</p>

<p>Her only direct human contacts were her three teammates and fellow Mars colonists -- but she insists they never went stir-crazy.</p>

<p>"Of course, there were times where you had crabby days, or something was bothering us, either as a crew or as an individual," she explained.</p>

<p>"But the communication was extremely good in this group," she said and besides, such problems were few and far between. "Up until the very end, we ate meals together."</p>

<p>Their 1,700-square-foot (160-square-meter) home included crew quarters, common areas and even an area for crops like tomatoes and peppers.</p>

<p>Called "Mars Dune Alpha" the 3D-printed habitat was installed inside a hangar at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>

<p>Simulated "Marswalks" took place in an exterior area that recreated the Martian environment with red soil and cliffs painted along the walls.</p>

<p>Crew members donned spacesuits and passed through an airlock to reach the "sandbox," as it was nicknamed, with tasks coordinated by their colleagues inside.</p>

<h3><strong>Boredom&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"There were days where you did really wish you were outside, I can't lie," says the Canadian who now lives in California. But, to her surprise, these pangs only intensified towards the end.</p>

<p>Periods of boredom are an inevitable part of long space expeditions, and it was precisely this extended isolation that set CHAPEA apart from most prior "analog" missions.</p>

<p>Halston staved off ennui by embroidering mission symbols and images of Mars.</p>

<p>Of course, "analogs can't address all problems or all issues of an eventual mission to Mars," she said, though the lessons learned will aid in planning.</p>

<p>Each team member's food intake was meticulously documented, their blood, saliva and urine samples were collected, and their sleep habits and physical and cognitive performance were analyzed.</p>

<p>"The food system is one of the greatest mass drivers on a human mission for human logistics, and we are going to be resource-constrained on these missions," NASA scientist Grace Douglas said on a podcast.</p>

<p>This makes it critical to determine the minimum necessary provisions to maintain astronauts' health and ensure the mission's success.</p>

<p>For now, NASA is keeping the details of the crew's tasks under wraps to preserve the element of surprise for the next two iterations of the mission. CHAPEA 2 is set for 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forced to formulate a new electoral strategy less than 100 days before the US presidential election, Donald Trump will take part in two campaign events on Wednesday, with new opponent Kamala Harris in his sights.</p>

<p>The Republican's race for the White House was thrown into chaos on July 21 when US President Joe Biden withdrew his candidacy, backing Vice President Harris as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Trump had placed 81-year-old Biden's health at the heart of his political campaign, portraying him as an enfeebled old man.</p>

<p>Now, he faces an entirely different candidate: the country's first Black, woman and South-Asian-origin Vice President, who is almost two decades his junior.</p>

<p>The change in candidate has forced Trump and the Republicans to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-kamala-harris-closes-in-how-donald-trump-is-trying-to-stop-her-6206034" target="_blank">change their strategy rapidly</a>, and it appears that his campaign is still settling on a line of attack against her.</p>

<p>So far, he has described his rival as "Lying Kamala," "Laughing Kamala" and "Crazy Kamala," among other epithets.</p>

<p>He has also taken sharper lines of attack against her.</p>

<p>In North Carolina last week, Trump falsely accused the US vice president of being in favor of "the execution of a baby," mischaracterizing her position on the wedge issue of abortion.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Trump will fly to Chicago to participate in a roundtable discussion with African American journalists that will be devoted to "the most pressing issues facing the Black community."</p>

<p>According to his campaign, Trump will explain how he "accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history by implementing America First policies on the economy, immigration, energy, law and order, and foreign policy."</p>

<p>Later in the day, the former president will hold a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, a battleground state where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt earlier this month.</p>

<p>Saturday will see him head to Atlanta, Georgia, where he will appear in a campaign event alongside running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old Ohio senator was once a staunch critic of Trump, but changed his tune to become one of his most vocal supporters.</p>

<p>Since his selection as Trump's running mate, a series of videos of controversial past statements have emerged.</p>

<p>In one of them, Vance mocks "childless cat ladies," suggesting that those without children were less fit to govern as they were "miserable" and had no "direct stake" in the country.</p>

<p>In recent remarks to donors Vance described Harris's entry into the race for the White House as a "sucker punch" for the Republican camp, according to US media.</p>

<p>Harris, who has criss-crossed Wisconsin, Georgia and Indiana in recent days, will be in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday evening to address a gathering of African-American students.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The week gone by has been a busy period for India in the Indo-Pacific. India's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, attended the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Laos and the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Japan. Jaishankar's visit to Laos also featured a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, following their last meeting at Astana earlier this year. The context for Jaishankar's visit was set by India's enduring pushback against China in key arenas of its interest. Arguably, China remains the pre-eminent concern for India's national security planners. India's China challenge is multipronged, with unresolved border conflict along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), as well as Beijing's expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean. China's more recent overtures in the Indo-Pacific, especially in the South China Sea region, have also compelled India's Quad partners and several Southeast Asian countries to intensify measures to counterbalance Beijing. Thus, the China question was a natural focal point for Jaishankar during both Laos and Japan visits.</p>

<h2><strong>China, A Critical Cog In The Quad</strong></h2>

<p>At the Quad Foreign Ministers' meeting, the four member countries of the grouping released a joint statement which amply addressed their common concerns with regard to China's belligerent posturing in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad members have long resisted the notion that the formulation of the grouping is directed at countering Beijing, instead emphasising that it seeks to harness the emerging opportunities of collective cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. There is no denying, however, that the China factor is a critical cog in the Quad wheel. The latest joint statement released by the Quad countries evidently suggests that concerns regarding China's overtures in the Indo-Pacific appear to be taking centre-stage in the thinking of the grouping. The joint statement expressed concerns over the evolving situation in the East and South China Seas, alluding to China's unilateral actions by use of force and coercion. The statement decried, without naming, Beijing's use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea attributing it to 'dangerous manoeuvres' in the region.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Jaishankar's individual remarks about the state of India-China relations have further garnered attention. Upon being questioned about India's relations with China, Jaishankar unequivocally stated that the bilateral ties between the two neighbours are 'not doing very well'. This admission appears to present continuity in India's enduring pushback against China in light of border skirmishes and conflict since 2020. However, in the Indo-Pacific context, a shift appears to be underway in India's approach towards China. In the past, India's response to China's aggressive overtures in the Indo-Pacific had remained relatively subdued. In its stead, Jaishankar's recent comments at the Quad summit and the joint statement demonstrate India's willingness to push back against China in the Indo-Pacific context as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>An Eye On Distant Seas</strong></h2>

<p>The question arises, what explains India's pushback against China's unilateral actions in the South China Sea? Even though the South China Sea geography does not fall under India's primary maritime area of interest, it remains vital for India's myriad strategic interests, such as the protection of Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs), energy security, etc. Moreover, India's sustained advocacy for a free, open, inclusive, and rules-based order at sea, emphasising the need for adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), makes it imperative for New Delhi to respond critically against Chinese attempts to change the status quo in the region.</p>

<p>Within the wider Indo-Pacific, China's continued attempts to foray into the Indian Ocean region, more recently by way of sending survey and surveillance vessels into the region, have prompted an enduring security dilemma in New Delhi, of People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) imminent launch of carrier task force patrols in the Indian Ocean by 2025. Thus, upping the ante against China in the Indo-Pacific appears to be a logical progression in India's continued efforts to counter Beijing's advances in geographies of India's core interests at sea.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>India's Message</strong></h2>

<p>Notably, Jaishankar has displayed nuance and complex thinking in India's plans to counter the multipronged challenge that China poses. While on the Indo-Pacific front, India has sought to actively engage in minilateral groupings to counter China, upon being asked if New Delhi would encourage third-party intervention for the resolution of the India-China territorial border conflict along the LAC, Jaishankar reiterated that only bilateral engagement based on 'mutual respect, mutual interest, and mutual sensitivity' can restore normalcy.</p>

<p>The message is very clear: New Delhi will not relent in pressing ahead with its pushback against Beijing even as the door is open for China to recalibrate its anti-India positioning.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinians detained by Israel during the Gaza war have largely been held in secret and in some cases subjected to treatment that may amount to torture, the United Nations said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Since October 7, thousands of Palestinians -- including medics, patients, residents and captured fighters -- have been taken from Gaza to Israel, "usually shackled and blindfolded", while thousands more have been detained in the West Bank and Israel, the OHCHR UN human rights office said in a report.</p>

<p>"They have generally been held in secret, without being given a reason for their detention, access to a lawyer or effective judicial review," OHCHR said.</p>

<p>At least 53 detainees from Gaza and the West Bank have died in Israeli detention since the Gaza war began on October 7, the report found.</p>

<p>"The testimonies gathered by my office and other entities indicate a range of appalling acts, such as waterboarding and the release of dogs on detainees, amongst other acts, in flagrant violation of international human rights law and international humanitarian law," said UN human rights chief Volker Turk.</p>

<p>He called on all parties to the conflict to implement a ceasefire, ensure full respect for international law and ensure accountability for violations and abuses.</p>

<p>The report, "Detention in the context of the escalation of hostilities in Gaza", covers the period from October 7 to June 30.</p>

<p>It said that there were "reasonable grounds to believe" that since October 7, Israel and Palestinian armed groups had "committed gross violations and abuses... of the rights to life, liberty and freedom from torture and other ill-treatment as well as rape and other forms of sexual violence, all of which may also amount to war crimes".</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,400 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the last surviving French veterans of the June 1944 D-Day landings has died aged 105, only weeks after he helped welcome US President Joe Biden to Paris for the 80th anniversary of the amphibious assault, the presidency said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Jacques Lewis passed away on Thursday at the Invalides Memorial complex in Paris where he had spent his final years.</p>

<p>He took part in the June 1944 D-Day landings alongside American units on Utah beach, as Allied forces swept into Normandy to begin their offensive to end Nazi occupation of France and Western Europe in World War II.</p>

<p>After landing, he sought out locals from the town of Carentan to map the area to help Allied forces take the town.</p>

<p>He then took part in other battles in France before moving into Germany itself "always alongside his brothers-in-arms from the American division", the Elysee said.</p>

<p>He was caught up in the war from the age of 20, in 1939, while he was a student at Sciences-Po University in Paris.</p>

<p>He first served as an officer cadet in the army before joining the ranks of Free France in London after the 1940 capitulation of France to Germany.</p>

<p>Making it to Britain from occupied France had been anything but easy.</p>

<p>"Crossing the Pyrenees on foot, armed only with a compass, arrested on his arrival in Spain (...) he managed to escape from the prison in Pamplona, boarded a Liberian cargo ship and began the crossing of the Atlantic under German bombardment," the Elysee said.</p>

<p>Speaking good English, he was integrated into the ranks of US General George Patton's 2nd Armored Division where his interpreting skills proved hugely valuable.</p>

<p>He was present in June under the Arc de Triomphe for the welcoming ceremony for Biden in Paris marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte salute "a figure of a French destiny filled with courage and audacity, who preferred to risk his life rather than his honour, and allowed the nation to regain its freedom".</p>

<p>The 80th-anniversary celebrations in Paris and Normandy were widely seen as a final chance for the world to pay its respects to surviving veterans on a major D-Day anniversary.</p>

<p>Just 209 French soldiers took part as infantrymen in the June 6, 1944, Normandy landings out of around 150,000 Allied troops, but their role has been hugely symbolic for France's modern historical memory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Only a ceasefire deal in Gaza stemming from hoped-for talks this week would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil, three senior Iranian officials said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only a ceasefire deal in Gaza stemming from hoped-for talks this week would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil, three senior Iranian officials said.</p>

<p>Iran has vowed a severe response to Haniyeh's killing, which took place as he visited Tehran late last month and which it blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed or denied its involvement. The US Navy has deployed warships and a submarine to the Middle East to bolster Israeli defenses.</p>

<p>One of the sources, a senior Iranian security official, said Iran, along with allies such as Hezbollah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks fail or it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. The sources did not say how long Iran would allow for talks to progress before responding.</p>

<p>With an increased risk of a broader Middle East war after the killings of Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Iran has been involved in intense dialogue with Western countries and the United States in recent days on ways to calibrate retaliation, said the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.</p>

<p>In comments published on Tuesday, the US ambassador to Turkey confirmed Washington was asking allies to help convince Iran to de-escalate tensions. Three regional government sources described conversations with Tehran to avoid escalation ahead of the Gaza ceasefire talks, due to begin on Thursday in either Egypt or Qatar.</p>

<p>"We hope our response will be timed and executed in a way that does not harm a potential ceasefire," Iran's mission to the UN said on Friday in a statement. Iran's foreign ministry on Tuesday said calls to exercise restraint "contradict principles of international law."</p>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry and its Revolutionary Guards Corps did not immediately respond to questions for this story. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office and the US State Department did not respond to questions.</p>

<p>"Something could happen as soon as this week by Iran and its proxies... That is a US assessment as well as an Israel assessment," White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>"If something does happen this week, the timing of it could certainly well have an impact on these talks we want to do on Thursday," he added. At the weekend, Hamas cast doubt on whether talks would go ahead. Israel and Hamas have held several rounds of talks in recent months without agreeing a final ceasefire.</p>

<p>In Israel, many observers believe a response is imminent after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran would "harshly punish" Israel for the strike in Tehran.</p>

<p>Iran's regional policy is set by the elite Revolutionary Guards, who answer only to Khamenei, the country's top authority. Iran's relatively moderate new president Masoud Pezeshkian has repeatedly reaffirmed Iran's anti-Israel stance and its support for resistance movements across the region since taking office last month.</p>

<p>Meir Litva, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University's Alliance Center for Iranian Studies, said he thought Iran would put its needs before helping its ally Hamas but that Iran also wanted to avoid a full-scale war.</p>

<p>"The Iranians never subordinated their strategy and policies to the needs of their proxies or protégées," Litva said. "An attack is likely and almost inevitable but I don't know the scale and the timing."</p>

<p>Iran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz said the Islamic Republic's leaders were now keen to work towards a ceasefire in Gaza, "to obtain incentives, avoid an all-out war and strengthen its position in the region."</p>

<p>Laylaz said Iran had not previously been involved in the Gaza peace process but was now ready to play "a key role."</p>

<p>Iran, two of the sources said, was considering sending a representative to the ceasefire talks, in what would be a first since the war started in Gaza.</p>

<p>The representative would not directly attend the meetings but would engage in behind-the-scenes discussions "to maintain a line of diplomatic communication" with the United States while negotiations proceed. Officials in Washington, Qatar and Egypt did not immediately respond to questions about whether Iran would play an indirect role in talks.</p>

<p>Two senior sources close to Lebanon's Hezbollah said Tehran would give the negotiations a chance but would not give up its intentions to retaliate.</p>

<p>A ceasefire in Gaza would give Iran cover for a smaller "symbolic" response, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters entered southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Since then, nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive in Gaza, according to the health ministry.</p>

<p><strong>APRIL MISSILES</strong></p>

<p>Iran has not publicly indicated what would be the target of an eventual response to the Haniyeh assassination.</p>

<p>On April 13, two weeks after two Iranian generals were killed in a strike on Tehran's embassy in Syria, Iran unleashed a barrage of hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles towards Israel, damaging two airbases. Almost all of the weapons were shot down before they reached their targets.</p>

<p>"Iran wants its response to be much more effective than the April 13 attack," said Farzin Nadimi, senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East policy."</p>

<p>Nadimi said such a response would require "a lot of preparation and coordination" especially if it involved Iran's network of allied armed groups opposing Israel and the United States across the Middle East, with Hezbollah the senior member of the so-called "Axis of Resistance," that along with Iraqi militias and Yemen's Houthis have harried Israel since Oct. 7.</p>

<p>Two of the Iranian sources said Iran would support Hezbollah and other allies if they launched their own responses to the killing of Haniyeh and Hezbollah's top military commander, Fuad Shukr, who died in a strike in Beirut the day before Haniyeh was killed in Tehran.</p>

<p>The sources did not specify what form such support could take.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas is sticking to its demand that Gaza truce talks focus on a deal already discussed with Israel and mediators rather than starting anew, an official said on Tuesday, after Israeli airstrikes killed at least 19 Palestinians in the enclave.</p>

<p>The US said on Monday that it expected peace talks slated for Thursday to go ahead as planned, and that a ceasefire agreement was still possible. Axios reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken planned to set off on Tuesday for discussions in Qatar, Egypt and Israel.</p>

<p>The Israeli government said it would send a delegation to Thursday's talks, but Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that ran Gaza before the war, requested a workable plan to implement a proposal it has already accepted rather than more talks.</p>

<p>A Hamas official told Reuters that a CNN report saying the group planned to attend on Thursday was wrong.</p>

<p>"Our statement the other day was clear: what is needed is the implementation, not more negotiation," said the official, who declined to be named owing to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 Palestinians in the central and southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said.</p>

<p>One strike killed six people in Deir Al-Balah, including a mother and her twin four-day-old babies, while seven other Palestinians were killed in a strike on a house in the nearby Al-Bureij camp.</p>

<p>Four people were killed in two separate strikes on the Al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip and Rafah in the south, and two were killed in a strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north, medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military and the armed wings of Islamic Jihad and Hamas said they were fighting in several areas, 10 months into a war in which almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many commanders and fighters.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had killed Palestinian gunmen and dismantled military structures in Khan Younis, located weapons and explosives in Rafah, and struck rocket launchers and sniper posts in central Gaza.</p>

<p>A ceasefire deal would aim to end fighting in Gaza and ensure the release of Israeli hostages held in the enclave in return for many Palestinians jailed by Israel.</p>

<p>Hamas wants a deal to end the war while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it can only end when Hamas is eradicated.</p>

<p>In Deir Al-Balah, one of the most overcrowded places in Gaza with hundreds of thousands of displaced, many were desperate for a truce.</p>

<p>"Enough, we are no longer able to tolerate the war, the starvation and the frequent displacement," said Ghada, a mother of six who two days ago had to leave her tent in Khan Younis under new Israeli evacuation orders.</p>

<p>"I hope this time they will reach a ceasefire. If they don't, I don't know how much longer we can survive," she told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>A Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 killed some 1,200 people, with more than 250 taken into captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies, in one of the most devastating blows against Israel in its history.</p>

<p>In response, Israeli forces have razed much of Gaza, displaced most of the population, and killed around 40,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry, in a war that has caused horror around the world. Israel says it has lost more than 300 soldiers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK government on Tuesday pledged to prioritise mental health as a report into a fatal stabbing rampage by a psychotic patient identified a litany of errors by medical authorities.</p>

<p>19-year-old students Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber and school caretaker Ian Coates died in the attacks in the central English city of Nottingham last June.</p>

<p>Health Minister Wes Streeting said it was time to put a greater focus on mental health, amid growing public concern about treatment waiting times and big increases in demand.</p>

<p>"It's time we prioritise mental health so we will be updating the Mental Health Act to bring care into the 21st century to ensure that care is appropriate, proportionate and compassionate -- while keeping the public safe," he wrote in The Sun Daily.</p>

<p>Victims' relatives said the report revealed "a catalogue of continual failures" lasting years in the handling of paranoid schizophrenic Valdo Calocane who carried out the killings.</p>

<p>"It's really hard to actually pinpoint one particular point, because the failings are so systemic and they're so gross," said Emma Webber whose son Barnaby died.</p>

<p>And she warned that what happened in Nottingham was "not a one-off tragedy".</p>

<p>"There are more Valdo Calocanes out in our community," she said.</p>

<p>According to the report, repeated medical assessments of Calocane underplayed the serious risk he posed to others.</p>

<p>Key details were "minimised or omitted" such as his refusal to take his medication, violent behaviour and persistent symptoms of psychosis.</p>

<p>"Poor decision-making, omissions and errors of judgments contributed to a situation where a patient with very serious mental health issues did not receive the support and follow-up he needed," said Chris Dzikiti of the Care Quality Commission which produced the report.</p>

<p>Sanjoy Kumar, the father of Grace O'Malley-Kumar, said doctors had to take greater responsibility for releasing "dangerous" patients.</p>

<h3><strong>Public safety</strong></h3>

<p>"It's not about depriving people of their liberty. It's about holding clinicians responsible who put people like that out on our streets," said Kumar, a practising doctor.</p>

<p>"We have lost the absolute love of our life, our lovely, beautiful and brave daughter, Gracie, and at the end of the day what we want to see is that the public is safe," he said.</p>

<p>"I think the nation is crying out for safety from these crimes," he added.</p>

<p>Calocane was given an indefinite hospital order in January after admitting manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.</p>

<p>Prosecutors accepted his not guilty pleas to murder after multiple medical experts concluded he had paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Streeting, a member of the UK's new Labour government, said the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) had accepted the recommendations about improvements to the care of patients with serious mental illness.</p>

<p>Measures already in place include 2.3 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) a year increase in funding "to transform services".</p>

<p>"Action is already underway to address the serious failures," he said in a statement, adding that he wanted to "assure myself and the country" that the errors seen in Nottingham "are not being repeated elsewhere".</p>

<p>There has been growing alarm in the UK at the state of mental health provision over recent years as the NHS struggles with increased demand, a post-Covid backlog and staffing and funding issues.</p>

<p>The NHS says some 5.3 million children and young people were in contact with mental health services in 2023/24, up 8.1 percent on the previous year and over 25 percent in 2021/22.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli strike killed 10 members of a Gaza family in the territory's southern district of Khan Yunis Tuesday, leaving only one survivor -- a three-month-old girl, a medic told AFP.</p>

<p>"Ten members of the Abu Haya family were killed in an Israeli strike on Abassan in east Khan Yunis," the medic from Nasser Hospital told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"There is only one survivor from the family, a baby girl named Rim. She is just three months old," he said, identifying the 10 other members of the family -- two parents and their eight children.</p>

<p>The girl, wrapped in a black cloth, stirred strong emotion in the courtyard of Nasser Hospital, a place now known for grieving families searching for dead or wounded loved ones.</p>

<p>"This little girl was pulled out of the rubble. Her whole family is dead. Who will take care of her now?" asked Ibrahim Barbakh, a resident of Khan Yunis, as he held the baby.</p>

<p>Rescue workers, witnesses and medical sources reported further Israeli air strikes and shelling in several parts of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, some of them deadly.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was sparked by an unprecedented attack by Palestinian operative group Hamas on Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 39,929 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukraine said Tuesday it was not interested in "taking over" territory it had captured during its cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region, calling Ukrainian operations there "absolutely legitimate".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said Tuesday it would not hold on to Russian territory captured in its surprise cross-border incursion and offered to stop raids if Moscow agreed a "just peace".</p>

<p>Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk region last Tuesday, taking over two dozen settlements in the biggest attack by a foreign army on Russian soil since World War II. Russia said Tuesday it had fended off new attacks in Kursk.</p>

<p>More than 120,000 people have fled the area and Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrsky said Monday that his troops controlled about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory.</p>

<p>At least 800 square kilometres was under Ukrainian control as of Monday, according to an AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War.</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy on Tuesday said Kyiv was not interested in "taking over" Russian territory and defended Ukraine's actions as "absolutely legitimate".</p>

<p>"The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace... the sooner the raids by the Ukrainian defences forces into Russia will stop," he told reporters.</p>

<p>Ukraine meanwhile said it was imposing movement restrictions in a 20-kilometre zone in Sumy region along the border with Kursk region due to an "increase in the intensity of hostilities" and "sabotage" activities.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it had "foiled" new Ukrainian attacks in Kursk by "enemy mobile groups in armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory".</p>

<p>Alexander Bortnikov, head of Russia's FSB security service, also said in a statement that Ukraine had carried out the attack "with the support of the collective West".</p>

<p><strong>- 'I saw a lot of death' -</strong></p>

<p>Since launching its invasion in February 2022, Russia has captured territory in southern and eastern Ukraine and subjected Ukrainian cities to missile and drone barrages.</p>

<p>Ukraine's offensive was the biggest cross-border action since the invasion and it caught Russia off guard.</p>

<p>"They didn't protect the border," a Ukrainian serviceman who took part in the offensive and identified himself as Ruzhyk told AFP in Sumy region.</p>

<p>"They only had anti-personnel mines scattered around trees at the side of the road and a few mines that they managed to quickly throw along the highways," he said.</p>

<p>A 27-year-old squad leader, who identified himself as Faraon, was sparing but direct in his description of battles in Kursk.</p>

<p>"I saw a lot of death in the first few days. It was terrifying at first but then we got used to it," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"There have been many deaths," he repeated stood next to a forest road leading to the frontier, without elaborating.</p>

<p>Ukrainian military analyst Mykola Bielieskov told AFP: "Russian complacency prevailed".</p>

<p>"Russia assumed that since it had initiative elsewhere, Ukraine wouldn't dare to do things we've seen," he said, referring to months of Russian advances along the front.</p>

<p>ISW figures also showed that Russian troops had captured 1,360 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Sow discord' -</strong></p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops.</p>

<p>Putin told a televised meeting with officials on Monday that "one of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord" and "destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society".</p>

<p>Putin also said Ukraine wanted to "improve its negotiating position" for any future talks with Moscow.</p>

<p>Regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the same meeting that Ukrainian forces had entered at least 12 kilometres into the region and the new front was now 40 kilometres wide.</p>

<p>Russia had conceded earlier that Ukrainian forces had penetrated up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) into Russian territory in places.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, at the weekend, that Ukraine sought to "stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said thousands of Ukrainian troops were involved in the operation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richard Lugner, an Austrian billionaire known for bringing celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Pamela Anderson to the Vienna Opera Ball, has died at 91. According to<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/billionaire-richard-lugner-dead-91-months-after-marrying-sixth-wife-8693930"> People,</a></em>&nbsp;he died at his villa in Vienna on Monday, just two months after marrying his sixth wife, Simone Reilander.&nbsp;Emergency services rushed to his home but were unable to revive him.</p>

<p>As per AFP, Mr Lugner had been battling various health issues and underwent surgery in recent months. Despite his health challenges, he still managed to attend the prestigious Vienna Opera Ball in February with&nbsp;Priscilla Presley,&nbsp;ex-wife of Elvis Presley.</p>

<p>Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer paid a touching tribute to him on X and wrote, ''Richard Lugner was a successful entrepreneur and a dazzling personality. An Austrian original who never lost his way. May he rest in peace!''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in Bangladesh opened a murder investigation into ousted ex-premier Sheikh Hasina and six top figures in her administration Tuesday over the police killing of a man during civil unrest last month.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India a week ago, where she remains, as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.</p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed during the weeks of unrest leading up to her toppling.</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Sheikh Hasina and six more," said Mamun Mia, a lawyer who brought the case on behalf of a private citizen.</p>

<p>He added that the Dhaka Metropolitan Court had ordered police to accept "the murder case against the accused persons", the first step in a criminal investigation under Bangladeshi law.</p>

<p>Mia's filing with the court also named Hasina's former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and Obaidul Quader, the general secretary of Hasina's Awami League party.</p>

<p>It also names four top police officers appointed by Hasina's government who have since vacated their posts.</p>

<p>The case accuses the seven of responsibility for the death of a grocery store owner who was shot dead on July 19 by police violently suppressing protests.</p>

<p>The Daily Star newspaper reported that the case was brought on behalf of Amir Hamza Shatil, a resident of the neighbourhood where the shooting happened and a "well-wisher" of the victim.</p>

<p><strong>- 'We don't deny this' -</strong></p>

<p>Hasina's government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents.</p>

<p>Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus returned from Europe three days after Hasina's ouster to head a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of steering democratic reforms.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, and is credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.</p>

<p>He took office as "chief adviser" to a caretaker administration -- all fellow civilians bar home minister Sakhawat Hossain, a retired brigadier general -- and has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p>

<p>Hossain said on Monday that the government had no intention of banning Hasina's Awami League, which played a pivotal role in the country's independence movement.</p>

<p>"The party has made many contributions to Bangladesh -- we don't deny this," he told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>"When the election comes, (they should) contest the elections."</p>

<p>AFP has contacted the caretaker administration for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/s-jaishankar" target="_blank">S Jaishankar</a> has painted a bleak picture of where the world might be in five years, warning of a "very grim forecast" given military tension in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/middle-east" target="_blank">West Asia</a>, between <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/russia-ukraine-war" target="_blank">Ukraine and Russia</a>, and in Southeast Asia, as well as economic challenges and the spectre of climate change.</p>

<p>The possibility of such a future "makes the case" for a stronger relationship between India and the United States, Mr Jaishankar said as much, if not all, of the world waits on the outcome of November's US presidential election many believe will be the second coming of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"I am an optimistic person and generally tend to think of solutions to problems rather than the problems that come out of solutions. But I would say, with a great deal of sobriety, that we are going through an exceptionally difficult period," Mr Jaishankar said Tuesday at an event in Delhi.</p>

<p>"... (and) I have a very grim forecast for the next five years... you see happening in the Middle East, in Ukraine, in Southeast and East Asia, and the continued impact of COVID, which those of us who have come out of it take for granted... but many have not come out of it," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>The reference to tension in the Middle East, or West Asia, was underlined Monday by the United States and its European allies calling on Iran to "stand down" as fears mount of yet another a full-scale war.</p>

<p>This follows Israel's attack on the Gaza. Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, have vowed revenge for the killing of the Hamas' political leader and a Hezbollah commander.</p>

<p>India - <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/explained-indias-stand-amid-threat-of-open-war-between-iran-israel-5440444" target="_blank">caught in a tight spot between two friendly nations</a> - has advised both sides to exercise restraint and resolved all issues with "dialogue and diplomacy", Mr Jaishankar's office said in April.</p>

<p>In today's comments Mr Jaishankar built on the threats posed by military conflict to the world and warned this would spill over into economic challenges, such as rising fuel and fertiliser prices precipitated last year by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The kind of economic challenges you see in the world... you see more and more countries struggling. Trade is getting difficult, there are forex shortages... so, you know, disruptions of various kinds," he said, also referring to concerns over increased pirate attacks in the Red Sea by Iran-aligned Houthi militia targeting commercial ships in a 'show of solidarity' with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>"What was happening in the Red Sea (and) climate events... are no longer just news... they have globally disruptive consequences and sometimes entire regions are basically made dysfunctional."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran or its proxies are "increasingly likely" to launch an attack on Israel in the upcoming days, the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/12/world/israel-iran-hamas-gaza-war ">warned</a>, citing intelligence. The potential attack could "happen as soon as this week," spokesperson John F Kirby announced. The warning comes despite the Israeli military's reported "peak readiness" in anticipation of a retaliatory attack.</p>

<p>The Middle East is on high alert after Iran pledged to retaliate against Israel for two recent strikes. On July 31, Israel assassinated Hamas leader Ismael Haniyeh in Tehran, followed by an airstrike on Hezbollah's senior commander, Fuad Shukr, in Lebanon.</p>

<p>As tensions simmer, five world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, urged Iran to "stand down", issuing a joint statement supporting ceasefire efforts between Israel and Hamas. The US, UK, France, Germany and Italy are working to de-escalate tensions and prevent further violence.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took direct steps to address the crisis, each contacting Iran's newly elected President Masoud Pezeshkian to control this military escalation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Discussions on a ceasefire, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, are expected to resume on Thursday. However, the White House spokesperson stated that if Iran were to launch an attack, these discussions might face delays.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli military has increased patrols over neighbouring Lebanon and continued to strike targets daily. Military spokesperson Daniel Hagari announced increased air patrols over Lebanon, home to Hezbollah, and ongoing strikes on targets to "remove threats".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff, Herzi Halevi, conducted a situational assessment with top military leaders, focusing on maintaining a high level of readiness for both "offence and defence."</p>

<p>The US Pentagon has also reinforced its commitment to the region. Pentagon spokesman General Patrick Ryder confirmed that Secretary of Defense Lloyd J Austin III ordered the deployment of the guided-missile submarine USS Georgia to the Middle East, alongside additional combat aircraft and missile-defence ships.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Turkish court on Monday ordered the arrest of a woman on charges of inciting hatred and insulting the president after she criticised a ban on the social media platform Instagram, broadcaster Haberturk and other media said.</p>

<p>Turkey blocked access to Instagram on August 2 for failing to comply with its "laws and rules" and public sensitivities. It removed the ban on Saturday, after it said the Meta Platforms-owned app agreed to cooperate with the authorities to address the government's concerns.</p>

<p>In an interview posted on a YouTube channel last week, when the app was still blocked, the woman was one of several passers-by who were asked what they thought about the ban.</p>

<p>"This is wrong. The president cannot ban Instagram as he wishes," the woman said. She also criticised President Tayyip Erdogan and those who supported the ban.</p>

<p>Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest.</p>

<p>Monday's arrest, ordered by a local court in the western city of Izmir, came after the head of Turkey's broadcasting watchdog RTUK criticised street interviews aired on social media, saying they "manipulate public opinion".</p>

<p>The Instagram access ban came after a top Turkish official accused the social media platform of blocking posts expressing condolences over the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a leader of the Palestinian operative group Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Palestinian prisoners watchdog said Tuesday that a man shot dead by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank the previous day had been freed during the November truce in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Prisoners' Club said the 18-year-old had been released on November 25 during the one-week truce that saw scores of Palestinian prisoners exchanged for dozens of Israeli hostages held in Gaza since October 7.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah said Tariq Ziad Abdul Rahim Daoud was killed "by the occupation forces' bullets near the town of Azzun, east of Qalqilya", in the northern West Bank, on Monday.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the alleged attacker had "fired at an Israeli civilian who was in the city" of Qalqilya, despite Israel forbidding its citizens from visiting Palestinian built-up areas.</p>

<p>The Israeli civilian was wounded along with two Palestinians, the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hamas later issued a statement mourning the death of Tariq Daoud and claiming he was a member of its armed wing.</p>

<p>Violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza. At least 619 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian official figures.</p>

<p>During the same period, at least 18 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks in the territory, according to Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Researchers have developed a novel computer algorithm that can predict various diseases like diabetes or stroke, just by analysing the colour of the human tongue with 98 per cent accuracy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have developed a novel computer algorithm that can predict various diseases like diabetes or stroke, just by analysing the colour of the human tongue with 98 per cent accuracy.</p>

<p>The imaging system developed by Middle Technical University (MTU) and the University of South Australia (UniSA) in Australia can diagnose conditions such as diabetes, stroke, anaemia, asthma, liver and gallbladder issues, Covid-19, and other vascular and gastrointestinal diseases.</p>

<p>"The colour, shape, and thickness of the tongue can reveal a litany of health conditions," said Ali Al-Naji, adjunct Associate Professor at MTU and UniSA.</p>

<p>"Typically, people with diabetes have a yellow tongue; cancer patients a purple tongue with a thick greasy coating; and acute stroke patients present with an unusually shaped red tongue," he added.</p>

<p>The breakthrough was achieved through a series of experiments using 5,260 images to train machine-learning algorithms to detect tongue colour.</p>

<p>Researchers received 60 tongue images from two teaching hospitals in the Middle East, representing patients with diverse health conditions. The AI model matched tongue colour with the correct disease in nearly all cases.</p>

<p>The paper published in Technologies describes how the system analyses tongue colour to provide real-time diagnoses, demonstrating that AI can advance medical practices significantly.</p>

<p>Al-Naji explained that AI is replicating a 2,000-year-old technique from traditional Chinese medicine, where the tongue's colour, shape, and thickness are used to diagnose health issues.</p>

<p>For example, people with diabetes typically have a yellow tongue, while cancer patients show a purple tongue with a thick greasy coating. Stroke patients often present with an unusually shaped red tongue. A white tongue can indicate anaemia, severe Covid-19 cases are associated with a deep red tongue, and an indigo or violet tongue suggests vascular or gastrointestinal problems or asthma.</p>

<p>The study used cameras placed 20 centimetres from a patient to capture tongue colour, and the imaging system predicted health conditions in real time.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A study released Monday using data from NASA's Mars InSight lander shows evidence of liquid water far below the surface of the fourth planet, advancing the search for life there and showing what might have happened to Mars' ancient oceans.</p>

<p>The lander, which has been on the Red Planet since 2018, measured seismic data over four years, examining how quakes shook the ground and determining what materials or substances were beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Based on that data, the researchers found liquid water was most likely present deep beneath the lander. Water is considered essential for life, and geological studies show the planet's surface had lakes, rivers and oceans more than 3 billion years ago.</p>

<p>"On Earth what we know is where it is wet enough and there are enough sources of energy, there is microbial life very deep in Earth's subsurface," said one of the authors, Vashan Wright of the University of California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. "The ingredients for life as we know it exist in the Martian subsurface if these interpretations are correct."</p>

<p>The study found that large reservoirs of liquid water in fractures 11.5 kilometres (7.15 miles) to 20km beneath the surface best explained the InSight measurements.</p>

<p>It notes that the volume of liquid water predicted beneath the surface is "more than the water volumes proposed to have filled hypothesised ancient Martian oceans".</p>

<p>"On Earth, groundwater infiltrated from the surface" to deep underground, Wright said. "We expect this process to have occurred on Mars as well when the upper crust was warmer than it is today."</p>

<p>There is no way to directly study water that deep beneath the surface of Mars, but the authors said the results "have implications for understanding Mars' water cycle, determining the fates of past surface water, searching for past or extant life, and assessing in situ resource utilization for future missions".</p>

<p>The study, whose other authors are Matthias Morzfeld of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Michael Manga of the University of California Berkeley, was published the week of Aug. 12 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>"I'm inspired and I hope the public is also inspired," Wright said. "Humans can work together to put instruments on a planet... and try to understand what's going on there."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Cornell University student was sentenced to 21 months in prison on Monday for threatening Jewish classmates.</p>

<p>Patrick Dai, who was suspended by the Ivy League school in Ithaca, New York, posted the threats anonymously on an online campus bulletin board three weeks after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Dai pleaded guilty to one felony count of making threats and was sentenced to 21 months in prison and three years of supervised release by District Judge Brenda Sannes in Syracuse, New York.</p>

<p>"The defendant terrorized a campus community for days and horrified the nation at a very volatile time," prosecutors said in their sentencing memo.</p>

<p>Lisa Peebles, Dai's lawyer, told the court her 22-year-old client is "autistic" and is actually "pro-Israel."</p>

<p>"In a misguided attempt to highlight Hamas's genocidal beliefs and garner support for Israel," Peebles said, he "made several posts on a campus-related website in the guise of an anti-Semite Hamas extremist.</p>

<p>"He believed, wrongly, that the posts would prompt a 'blowback' against what he perceived as anti-Israel media coverage and pro-Hamas sentiment on campus," she said.</p>

<p>According to the Justice Department, Dai said he was "gonna shoot up 104 west," a dining hall that mostly caters to Jewish students, and "stab" and "slit the throat" of any Jewish males he saw on campus.</p>

<p>Cornell canceled classes for a day in November following the threats.</p>

<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland highlighted the case at the time of Dai's arrest as part of "a significant increase in the volume and frequency of threats against Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities across our country."</p>

<p>Colleges across the United States were rocked for months by protests over Israel's war in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the two runways at Japan's Narita Airport was closed on Tuesday after an American cargo plane made an emergency landing due to an issue with its hydraulic system, officials said.</p>

<p>An Atlas Air Boeing 747 cargo jet en route to Los Angeles turned back to Narita for an emergency landing after the problem became apparent at 1:10 am (1610 GMT), a transport ministry spokesman said.</p>

<p>"The seven crew members of the Boeing 747 were not injured, but tyres were found ruptured and the wheels damaged," the spokesman told AFP.</p>

<p>Narita's runway A was closed for at least seven hours, but the "tyres were changed and the operation of the runway is expected to resume at 8:30 am," he said.</p>

<p>The closure's impact on other flights had been minimal, he added.</p>

<p>No further details of the mechanical issue were immediately available.</p>

<p>The incident comes after a brake glitch on a Singapore Airlines plane forced a runway closure at Narita on Monday.</p>

<p>Fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene after smoke was reported as coming from the arriving Singapore Airlines plane, though responders found no signs of fire and no one was injured.</p>

<p>The company later clarified that the flight had "experienced a technical issue with its brakes upon landing".</p>

<p>Narita's runway B was closed for just under an hour after the flight landed around 7:40 am, airport and fire officials said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The armed wing of Palestinian group Hamas said Monday its operatives had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, "in two separate incidents" in Gaza.</p>

<p>Palestinian operatives seized 251 hostages during their October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, with 111 of them still held in Gaza including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement: "In two separate incidents, two recruits assigned to guard enemy prisoners fired at a Zionist prisoner, killing him immediately, and also injured two female prisoners critically".</p>

<p>The statement, posted on Telegram, did not identify the hostages or say when or where the incidents occurred, but noted "attempts are being made to save the lives" of the two women.</p>

<p>Abu Obeida said Hamas had formed a committee to investigate the shootings.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement that it does "not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas claims".</p>

<p>"We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message", the statement added.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a televised briefing earlier on Monday, said: "We do not forget for a moment the hostages being cruelly held by Hamas in Gaza".</p>

<p>"We are deeply concerned about their physical and mental condition, given the prolonged time that has passed and the harsh conditions of their captivity."</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip since then has killed at least 39,897 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman's body was found early Tuesday inside a burned-out Athens factory, state news agency ANA said, in what is believed to be the first reported death from a disastrous wildfire that has scorched the city's northeastern suburbs.</p>

<p>The woman, believed to be around 60 years old, was found inside the factory building in Patima Halandriou, part of a municipality of over 70,000 people that was partly evacuated on Monday.</p>

<p>Hundreds of firefighters continued to battle for a third day the fire that broke out Sunday afternoon in the town of Varnavas, some 35 kilometres (22 miles) northeast of Athens.</p>

<p>Aided by strong winds, it grew to a 30-kilometre-long front line of flames more than 25 metres (80 feet) high in places, according to state TV ERT.</p>

<p>At least one firefighter has suffered serious burns battling the blaze, while another was hospitalised with breathing trouble, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said Monday.</p>

<p>According to the health ministry, 66 people have been treated for injuries related to the fire since Sunday.</p>

<p>Reinforcements from several EU states as well as Serbia and Turkey are expected on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's President Vladimir Putin will discuss the situation in the Middle East with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Moscow on Tuesday, the Kremlin said late on Monday.</p>

<p>"It is expected that an exchange of views will be held on the situation in the Middle East in light of the current aggravation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip," the Kremlin said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Abbas is in Moscow on a long-expected visit until Wednesday and is to travel to Turkey for talks with President Tayyip Erdogan afterwards.</p>

<p>Russia, which has forged close ties both with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Arab leaders including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has condemned the recent killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, calling on all parties to refrain from further destabilisation of the Middle East.</p>

<p>It has also repeatedly scolded the West for ignoring the need for an independent Palestinian state within 1967 borders.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

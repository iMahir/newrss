       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"When I watched Dangal with Chinese subtitles a few years ago, I noticed an uncanny resemblance between the wrestlers' father and my own," says Chen Shih-hsin, Taiwan's first-ever Olympic gold medallist.</p>

<p>Chen clinched gold in the women's flyweight division (49-kilogram category) in Taekwondo at the 2004 Athens Olympics, ending a 72-year-long gold medal drought for Taiwan. Despite being a self-governing democracy with its own constitution and legislature, Taiwan competes at the Olympics under the fictitious name "Chinese Taipei" - it is neither part of China nor comprised solely of the city of Taipei (which is one of the 23 cities in the island nation).</p>

<p>"My father was a hard taskmaster, much like the father portrayed in the film. I feel he was even tougher on me," shares Chen as she teaches around 100 children at her Taekwondo school in the rural township of Xinfeng, near Taiwan's semiconductor hub, Hsinchu.</p>

<p>"Yes, you could call me a chip off the old block when it comes to inheriting my father's grit and toughness, similar to the characters in Dangal," admits Chen, whose life story is full of dramatic and emotional twists.</p>

<p>She is half-aboriginal, as her mother is from Taiwan's indigenous Atayal community. Her father, Chen Wei-hsiung, ran a Taekwondo training centre in Taipei and introduced her to martial arts at the age of five. By 15, Chen had already made a mark on the world stage by winning her debut appearance at the World Cup in the Cayman Islands in 1994. Two years later, she secured her second world title in Brazil.</p>

<p>However, her career took an unexpected turn shortly after. "I used to despise my father's relentless push. One day, at 18, I argued with him and ran away from home," Chen reveals, recalling her transformation from world champion to a "betel nut beauty" - a term for scantily-clad young women who sold betel nuts at kiosks across Taiwan.</p>

<p>After leaving her family and Taekwondo, Chen survived by vending betel nuts and other products in Taichung. "I felt like a rebel, much like the girl in the Bollywood movie who rebelled after joining the national team. But unlike her outspoken defiance, I simply left," shares Chen.</p>

<p>Three years later, a poignant line in a radio advertisement about a son unable to care for his ageing parents on their birthday led her to return home. Reuniting with her father, she pledged to resume her training and pursue an Olympic dream together. However, the three lost years cost her a chance to compete in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where Taekwondo debuted as an Olympic medal sport.</p>

<p>"Being on my own for those three years strengthened me, helping me cope with the disappointment of missing the Sydney Games," Chen explains.</p>

<p>Her indomitable spirit and her father's unwavering support fuelled her strenuous preparation for the next four years. "When I reached Athens, my biggest adversary was myself, not my rivals from Cuba, Nepal, Canada, or Nicaragua," she reflects.</p>

<p>"The Olympic gold was our shared dream." Chen continues, "Opening a Taekwondo gym and running it for decades was as much my father's goal as it was mine. His ultimate aim was to bring an Olympic gold medal to the gym."</p>

<p>On August 26, Chen made history by defeating Cuban opponent Yanelis Labrada to win the first-ever gold medal for her "invisible" nation, herself, and most importantly, her father.</p>

<p>"Over the years, I've fought countless matches, shed many tears, and accumulated numerous injuries. That final match in Athens was worth it," she expresses.</p>

<p>At 25, Chen decided to retire. "These past twenty-odd years have been challenging, but I've been fortunate to avoid severe injuries thanks to my father's meticulous training," she notes.</p>

<p>Despite achieving her Olympic dream, Chen's life continued to resemble a gripping film script. She pursued a PhD in sports psychology, secured a position as an associate professor at a leading university, and started a family with two children. However, personal turmoil struck again.</p>

<p>An alleged extramarital affair with a fellow coach tarnished her reputation, forcing her to resign from her university post, leave her home, and yield custody of her daughter to her estranged husband. Yet, Chen rose from the ashes, relocating to Xinfeng with her son.</p>

<p>Today, Chen teaches Taekwondo to local children in her self-established dojang, away from the public eye and the bustle of Taipei. Although her Athens Olympic gold medal resides at her father's home, she now dreams of earning a gold medal for her Taekwondo school.</p>

       <description><![CDATA["This is a massive attack on a large scale to paralyse the TGV network," SNCF told AFP, adding that many routes will have to be cancelled and the situation would last "at least all weekend while repairs are conducted".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's high-speed rail network was hit by "malicious acts" including arson attacks that have disrupted the transport system, train operator SNCF said Friday, hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>A source close to the investigation told AFP the attacks were coordinated acts of "sabotage".</p>

<p>"This is a massive attack on a large scale to paralyse the TGV network," SNCF told AFP, adding that many routes will have to be cancelled.</p>

<p>"SNCF was the victim of several simultaneous malicious acts overnight," the national train operator said, adding that the attacks affected its Atlantic, northern and eastern lines.</p>

<p>"Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities," it said, adding that traffic on the affected lines was "heavily disrupted" and the situation would last through the weekend as repairs are conducted.</p>

<p>A "massive attack" against France's high-speed TGV rail network was an "outrageous criminal act", Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said Friday, hours ahead of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.</p>

<p>There would be "very serious consequences" for rail traffic throughout the weekend with connections towards northern, eastern and northwestern France halved, Vergriete said, while rail operator SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said 800,000 passengers were affected.</p>

<p>Trains were being diverted to different tracks "but we will have to cancel a large number of them", the statement said.</p>

<p>The southeastern line was not affected as "a malicious act was foiled".</p>

<p>SNCF urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations.</p>

<h3><strong>Olympics under heavy security</strong></h3>

<p>The attacks were launched as Paris was under heavy security ahead of the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics, with 300,000 spectators and an audience of VIPs expected at the event.</p>

<p>The parade on Friday evening will see up to 7,500 competitors travel down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river Seine on a flotilla of 85 boats.</p>

<p>It will be the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main athletics stadium, a decision fraught with danger at a time when France is on its highest alert for terror attacks.</p>

<p>At Paris's Montparnasse train station, dozens of passengers were waiting for more information about their trips after delays of 30 minutes to almost two hours were announced.</p>

<p>"Normal traffic is expected to resume on Monday, July 29," read one of the signs in the departure hall.</p>

<p>"We arrived around 7:00 am but we were told that we might not be able to leave before Monday," said 27-year-old student Jocelyn, who had planned to travel to Bretagne and refused to give her full name.</p>

<p>"We expected it to be a bit chaotic in Paris with the opening ceremony scheduled for this evening, but we didn't think it could be this bad," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hamas leader in the West Bank died in Israeli custody, Palestinian authorities and the militant group said Friday.</p>

<p>Mustafa Muhammad Abu Ara, 63, died after being moved from a prison in southern Israel to a hospital, according to a joint statement by the Palestinian Authority's prisoners affairs body and the Palestinian Prisoners' Club watchdog.</p>

<p>"We mourn the passing of the leader and prisoner Sheikh Mustafa Muhammad Abu Ara and hold the occupation responsible for his assassination through deliberate medical neglect," Hamas said in a statement.</p>

<p>Abu Ara was arrested in October while suffering severe health problems, the Palestinian body and the watchdog said.</p>

<p>During his detainment he was subjected to torture and starvation, they added.</p>

<p>Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Palestinian authorities accused Israel this month of waging an abusive "war of revenge" against Palestinian detainees since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>At the time, the Israeli military said it "rejects outright allegations concerning systematic abuse of detainees", adding that it acts within international law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Zambada's arrest, accusing him of trafficking cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and fentanyl]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ismael "Mayo" Zambada, the Sinaloa Cartel co-founder arrested Thursday in the United States, is one of Mexico's most-wanted drug traffickers who evaded justice for decades.</p>

<p>Before his startling capture in El Paso, Texas, the 76-year-old had never been to jail.</p>

<p>Despite his efforts to keep a low profile, the elusive boss was one of the US Drug Enforcement Administration's top targets.</p>

<p>The United States had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Zambada's arrest, accusing him of trafficking cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and fentanyl.</p>

<p>The bounty exceeded the $10 million offered for Nemesio "El Mencho" Oseguera, head of the rival Jalisco New Generation Cartel.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mexican-drug-lord-el-mayo-and-el-chapos-son-arrested-in-us-6190402" target="_blank">Zambada</a> was detained Thursday along with Joaquin Guzman Lopez, a son of the Sinaloa Cartel's founder Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who is serving a life sentence in the United States.</p>

<p>Unlike Zambada, El Chapo was arrested three times before being extradited to the United States.</p>

<p>Zambada, who was born in the Sinaloa state capital Culiacan, was the long-time leader of a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel, according to US authorities.</p>

<p>He was "unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail," the US State Department said in 2021.</p>

<p>After El Chapo's arrest and extradition, Zambada became the "unquestioned senior leader of the Sinaloa Cartel," it added.</p>

<p>A former farmer, Zambada started working with the Juarez Cartel in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p>After the death of that cartel's head Amado Carrillo Fuentes, he decided to create his own organization, according to the InSight Crime think tank.</p>

<p>In recent years, Zambada had been weakened by the arrests of his brother, two sons and a nephew, it noted.</p>

<p>Two of them even served as witnesses in El Chapo's trial in New York.</p>

<p>El Chapo's lawyers argued that the real leader of the cartel was Zambada.</p>

<p>Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman alleged that Zambada paid former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto a bribe of $100 million.</p>

<p>In 2017, Zambada survived an attack allegedly carried out by another Sinaloa Cartel leader.</p>

<p>In 2010, the veteran drug lord gave a brief interview to the Mexican magazine Proceso, which revealed that he had begun committing crimes at the age of 16.</p>

<p>Zambada said that he had come close to being captured by the Mexican army on several occasions.</p>

<p>But it was not until Thursday that he was finally taken into US custody in circumstances that were not immediately clear.</p>

<p>Zambada is, according to InSight Crime, "one of the most storied drug traffickers in Mexican history," known for maintaining a low profile and focusing on business over violence.</p>

<p>"In addition, he is one of the few old-guard bosses who has managed to evade justice throughout his criminal career," the think tank said before his detention.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of US Vice President Kamala Harris, has defended her against a derogatory comment made by JD Vance, the running-mate of Republican nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Vance called Harris a "childless cat lady" in a 2021 interview, which resurfaced after President Joe Biden recently endorsed Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee. Ms Emhoff swiftly responded to the remark on her Instagram Stories, writing, "How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added, "I love my three parents."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kerstin Emhoff, Ella's mother, also spoke out against JD Vance's attacks on Kamala Harris, calling them "baseless". In a statement to NBC News, she said, "For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and me. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it."</p>

<p><strong>Who is Ella Emhoff?</strong></p>

<p>Ella Emhoff, 25, is the daughter of Douglas Emhoff and Kerstin Emhoff, and the stepdaughter of Kamala Harris. She was 15 when her father married Harris in 2014, and has since considered her a third parent, affectionately calling her "Momala". Ella and her older brother, Cole, were named after jazz legends Ella Fitzgerald and Cole Porter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Emhoff, a Parsons fashion student, has made a name for herself with her bold style and collaborations. She gained global attention with her Miu Miu coat and partnership with Batsheva Hay. Emhoff debuted at Paris Fashion Week for Balenciaga and has worked with top brands like Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein and Stella McCartney.</p>

<p>Recently, the 25-year-old faced controversy when she posted a link to a fundraiser for <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/16/us-news/kamala-harris-stepdaughter-ella-emhoff-publicly-raising-money-for-unrwa-despite-alleged-terror-ties/">UNRWA</a>, an organisation aiding Palestinian refugees. The group was accused by Israel of hiring individuals linked to the October 7 Hamas attacks, leading to financial withdrawals from various countries. Although she removed the link, the incident reportedly sparked backlash from UN Watch.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["This is going to increase as global warming continues, enhancing the chances of droughts and/or floods."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is driving changes in rainfall patterns across the world, scientists said in a paper published on Friday, which could also be intensifying typhoons and other tropical storms.</p>

<p>Taiwan, the Philippines and then China were lashed by the year's most powerful typhoon this week, with schools, businesses and financial markets shut as wind speeds surged up to 227 kph (141 mph). On China's eastern coast, hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated ahead of landfall on Thursday.</p>

<p>Stronger tropical storms are part of a wider phenomenon of weather extremes driven by higher temperatures, scientists say.</p>

<p>Researchers led by Zhang Wenxia at the China Academy of Sciences studied historical meteorological data and found about 75% of the world's land area had seen a rise in "precipitation variability" or wider swings between wet and dry weather.</p>

<p>Warming temperatures have enhanced the ability of the atmosphere to hold moisture, which is causing wider fluctuations in rainfall, the researchers said in a paper published by the Science journal.</p>

<p>"(Variability) has increased in most places, including Australia, which means rainier rain periods and drier dry periods," said Steven Sherwood, a scientist at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who was not involved in the study.</p>

<p>"This is going to increase as global warming continues, enhancing the chances of droughts and/or floods."</p>

<h3>FEWER, BUT MORE INTENSE, STORMS</h3>

<p>Scientists believe that climate change is also reshaping the behaviour of tropical storms, including typhoons, making them less frequent but more powerful.</p>

<p>"I believe higher water vapour in the atmosphere is the ultimate cause of all of these tendencies toward more extreme hydrologic phenomena," Sherwood told Reuters.</p>

<p>Typhoon Gaemi, which first made landfall in Taiwan on Wednesday, was the strongest to hit the island in eight years.</p>

<p>While it is difficult to attribute individual weather events to climate change, models predict that global warming makes typhoons stronger, said Sachie Kanada, a researcher at Japan's Nagoya University.</p>

<p>"In general, warmer sea surface temperature is a favourable condition for tropical cyclone development," she said.</p>

<p>In its "blue paper" on climate change published this month, China said the number of typhoons in the Northwest Pacific and South China Sea had declined significantly since the 1990s, but they were getting stronger.</p>

<p>Taiwan also said in its climate change report published in May that climate change was likely to reduce the overall number of typhoons in the region while making each one more intense.</p>

<p>The decrease in the number of typhoons is due to the uneven pattern of ocean warming, with temperatures rising faster in the western Pacific than the east, said Feng Xiangbo, a tropical cyclone research scientist at the University of Reading.</p>

<p>Water vapour capacity in the lower atmosphere is expected to rise by 7% for each 1 degree Celsius increase in temperatures, with tropical cyclone rainfall in the United States surging by as much as 40% for each single degree rise, he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old comment by Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance - suggesting childless women are less fit to govern - has sparked a volley of criticism, the latest snap coming from actor Jennifer Aniston.</p>

<p>Vance had singled out Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Presidential nominee, among others during a 2021 interview and said those without offspring, especially "childless cat ladies", had no "direct stake" in the country.</p>

<p>Speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox News, he had said the US was being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too."</p>

<p>"It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC; the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?" Vance was heard saying in the resurfaced clip.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella, with her husband Doug Emhoff and his first wife Kerstin Emhoff.</p>

<p>Vance's comments have drawn sexism charges ahead of the US Presidential elections that the Republicans were touted to win until President Joe Biden bowed out from the race.</p>

<p>Ms Aniston, pointing to her own infertility that she has been vocal about in the past, shared a screenshot of the clip on Instagram stories and said she couldn't believe this was coming from a potential US vice president.</p>

<p>"All I can say is...Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too," Ms Aniston wrote in her post.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris's lack of biological children has been regarded as an issue by the Republicans, but she has received support from politicians, celebrities, and from her own family. Her supporters also pointed out that no US president has ever physically given birth, since all have been men.</p>

<p>Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of Harris' stepchildren, has slammed the attacks on the Vice President as "baseless" in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it," she said.</p>

<p>"I love my three parents. How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I," wrote Ella, 25, on Instagram.</p>

<p>"It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. My God, they went after 'cat people,' good luck with that," Minnesota Governor Tim Walz told MSNBC.</p>

<p>"Now, what the hell?" asked talk show host Whoopi Goldberg.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>55 years after it sank, killing 21 men, Australian scientists have finally located the shipwreck of the MV Noongah. According to the <em>BBC</em>, the huge freighter was carrying steel off the coast of New South Wales when it sank in rough seas in 1969, killing 21 of the 26 crew members on board. The incident sparked one of the biggest maritime searches in Australian history but the remains of 20 of the dead were never recovered. Now, MV Noongah has finally been found more than a half-century after it was lost at sea, Australian scientists announced on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The location of the wreck was confirmed by Australia's science agency CSIRO, using high-resolution seafloor mapping and video footage. As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/News/2024/July/Wreck-of-MV-Noongah-identified">press release</a>, one of the agency's research vessels investigated the wreck in June and determined that, after almost 55 years, the ship was largely intact and situated in an upright position at the bottom of the ocean, roughly 550 feet below the surface. A dive team then explored the wreck up close to confirm its identity.</p>

<p>The Sydney Project - which finds and documents the wrecks of lost ships - is now planning a dive to collect additional vision from the site, in the hope of shedding light on why the ship sank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This tragedy is still very much in the memory of many in the community," CSIRO's Matt Kimber said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1eprng96eo"><em>BBC</em></a>. "We hope that knowing the resting place of the vessel brings some closure for all," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 55 years, the researchers struggled to find MV Noongah. On the day the ship went down, its crew tried for hours to keep the vessel afloat before eventually abandoning it about 30 minutes before the ship sank completely. The radio operator sent out a distress signal around then, which prompted one of the largest search and rescue operations ever carried out in Australia.</p>

<p>Over the next 12 hours, officials found two men at sea in two separate life rafts, and three more clinging to a plank of wood. However, the fate of the rest of the crew and the ship itself has been a mystery ever since.</p>

<p>Notably, locals had spotted the shipwreck years ago in the water off the coast of South West Rocks, about 460 kilometres north of Sydney. However, the lack of technology or diving knowledge needed to identify the wreck stopped the endeavour.</p>

<p>Now, a half-century after the incident, the CSIRO located the location of the shipwreck. Samir Alhafith, who was part of the mission to find the wreck, said in a statement that knowing the ship's location may provide opportunities to answer some of those questions.</p>

<p>"Not only is the discovery of these significant wrecks important for the surviving sailors and families of those that perished during the tragedy but also it allows us to investigate the mystery behind the sinking," Mr Alhafith said.</p>

<p>Others involved in the project to locate the Noongah said they hope knowing where it is will provide a level of closure to those who knew the crew members lost at sea.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is learning the hard way the internet doesn't just love cats but also childless cat ladies, as comments resurfaced in which he claimed those without offspring were less fit to govern.</p>

<p>In a 2021 clip, Vance singled out Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, among others as he told Fox News that those who hadn't procreated, particularly "childless cat ladies," were "miserable" and had no "direct stake" in the country.</p>

<p>The comments have sparked a storm of scorn and accusations that the father of three represents an out-of-touch, sexist Republican mindset that has no place in the modern era.</p>

<p>"It would be funny if it wasn't so sad," Minnesota Governor Tim Walz told MSNBC, adding: "My God, they went after 'cat people,' good luck with that!"</p>

<p>If Harris, who has two stepchildren, beats Republican former president Donald Trump in November elections, she not only becomes the first woman president, but also the first woman of Black and Asian heritage, which has opened her up to a number of attacks along demographic lines.</p>

<p>While multiple Republicans have flagged her lack of biological children as an issue, her online "KHive" of fans has been running defense -- via memes, indignation and supportive posts including from celebrities, politicians and members of her own family.</p>

<p>An outraged Jennifer Aniston pointed to her own infertility, which the actor has been vocal about in the past, while comedian and talk show host Whoopi Goldberg asked "Now, what the hell?"</p>

<h3><strong>'Just a basic fact'</strong></h3>

<p>The resurfaced 2021 clip shows Vance, then a US Senate candidate from Ohio, telling Fox's Tucker Carlson that the United States was being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too."</p>

<p>"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children," Vance said.</p>

<p>"And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?"</p>

<p>Buttigieg, who is the US transportation secretary and adopted two children that same year, told CNN the comments were hurtful given an adoption setback he was facing at the time.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have known that, but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children," Buttigieg said.</p>

<p>Harris has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella, through her husband Doug Emhoff and his first wife.</p>

<p>Their mother, Kerstin Emhoff, said in a statement to CNN that the attacks on Harris were "baseless."</p>

<p>"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it."</p>

<p>Ella, age 25, who refers to Harris as "Momala," meanwhile wrote on Instagram that "I love my three parents."</p>

<p>"How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I."</p>

<h3><strong>'Leaders should have children'</strong></h3>

<p>Harris supporters were quick to point out that no US president has ever physically given birth, since all have been men. A handful have also never produced any offspring.</p>

<p>Chief among them was George Washington, America's first president who like Harris helped raise his spouse's children from a previous marriage.</p>

<p>Meghan McCain, daughter of late Republican senator John McCain, warned that Vance's comments "are activating women across all sides, including my most conservative Trump supporting friends."</p>

<p>The focus on politicians' children comes as reproductive health and abortion access -- topics Harris has championed -- take center stage in this year's election.</p>

<p>"Political leaders should have children. Certainly they should at least be married," venture capitalist and Trump-endorsed former congressional candidate Blake Masters wrote on X.</p>

<p>"If you aren't running or can't run a household of your own, how can you relate to a constituency of families, or govern wisely with respect to future generations?" he said.</p>

<p>In a 2021 speech, Vance went so far as to suggest people with children should have more votes.</p>

<p>"When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power," he said in quotes unearthed by the Washington Post, adding "if you don't have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn't get nearly the same voice."</p>

<p>Vance's campaign has since dismissed the comments as a "thought experiment."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The election will be the first test of the public mood since the height of the 2022 downturn, which caused months of food, fuel and medicine shortages across the island nation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka's first presidential elections since an unprecedented economic crisis spurred widespread unrest will be held in September, the election commission said Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The election will be the first test of the public mood since the height of the 2022 downturn, which caused months of food, fuel and medicine shortages across the island nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Ranil Wickremesinghe, 75, who took office after street protests forced his predecessor to flee the country, has strongly hinted he plans to run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He will face at least two rivals campaigning against austerity measures his government imposed to satisfy an International Monetary Fund bailout package.</p>

<p>The five-week campaign announced by the commission will conclude with a September 21 vote in a country still struggling with a fragile economic recovery and endemic discontent over cost of living issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Economic issues are expected to dominate the campaign as the country emerges from its worst-ever recession in 2022, when the GDP shrank by a record 7.8 percent.</p>

<p>Inflation has since returned to normal levels from its peak of 70 percent at the height of the crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe has also successfully negotiated a restructure of Sri Lanka's $46 billion foreign debt with bilateral lenders including China, following a 2022 government default.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But his policies to balance the government's books by hiking taxes and withdrawing generous utility subsidies have been deeply unpopular with the public.</p>

<p>While the months-long food, fuel and medicine shortages seen at the peak of the economic crisis are now a distant memory, many Sri Lankans say Wickremesinghe's austerity measures have left them struggling to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opposition parties have vowed to renegotiate terms of the $2.9 billion IMF bailout Wickremesinghe negotiated last year.</p>

<p>The president's main challenger so far is Sajith Premadasa, 57, a one-time party ally and current opposition leader.</p>

<p>Premadasa has vowed to continue with economic reforms and the IMF programme but pledged to cushion the public by reducing the tax increases Wickremesinghe imposed to shore up state revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A leftist party is also fielding its leader, 55-year-old former agriculture minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is campaigning against plans to privatise state companies</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe took office following the government default in 2022, after a huge crowd stormed predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa's compound.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajapaksa, who was accused of steering Sri Lanka into the crisis through economic mismanagement, temporarily fled abroad and issued his resignation from Singapore.</p>

<p>Local elections were due to be held last year but postponed indefinitely after the government insisted it had no money to conduct a nationwide vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 17 million Sri Lankans over the age of 18 are eligible to cast a ballot.</p>

<p>The election commission has allocated $33 million (10 billion rupees) for this year's presidential poll.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's doctor Kevin O'Connor on Thursday defended his "excellent" mental acuity days after his shocking decision not to seek reelection.</p>

<p>Dr Kevin O'Connor was asked by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/bidens-doctor-defends-excellent-mental-acuity-insists-prez-doesnt-have-parkinsons-related-ailment/" target="_blank">New York Post</a> about 81-year-old Biden's health.</p>

<p>"It's excellent," he answered.</p>

<p>"Could that change before the end of his term?" the NYP journalist followed up as the presidential physician walked on the White House driveway.</p>

<p>"I hope not," O'Connor, who has never briefed the press during Biden's more than three years in office, responded.</p>

<p>"And how is his mental cognition?" The Post asked.</p>

<p>"It's excellent," Biden's personal doctor said.</p>

<p>He was then asked if there was a reason why they didn't perform a cognitive test on Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We don't need to. He's here every day," O'Connor said.</p>

<p>The journalist then asked him, "Is there anything to that speculation that there might be something related to Parkinson's that he has?"</p>

<p>"No, he's good," O'Connor answered.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-white-house-said-on-parkinsons-doctor-visiting-8-times-in-8-months-6064377" target="_blank">Parkinson's was linked with Joe Biden</a> after reports claimed that an expert on the disease visited the White House eight times in eight months, including at least once for a meeting with Biden's physician.</p>

<p>The White House, however, earlier this month said that it was being incorrectly assumed and insinuated that Biden was being treated for Parkinson's.</p>

<p>His exit made him the first president in US history to pull out so late in an election race, and the first to bow out because of concerns over his mental acuity and health.</p>

<p>He has now thrown his support behind his deputy <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/barack-obama-doesnt-believe-kamala-harris-can-beat-donald-trump-in-2024-us-polls-report-6183175" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a>, who is the first woman in US history to hold the vice presidency.&nbsp;She is set to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bill proposes to treat India as if it were of the same status as the US allies such as Japan, Israel, Korea, and NATO allies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Senator Marco Rubio on Thursday introduced a bill in the Congress that proposes to treat India on par with its allies like as Japan, Israel, Korea and NATO allies regarding technology transfers, support India in its response to growing threats to its territorial integrity and bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if it is found to have sponsored terrorism against India.</p>

<p>"Communist China continues to aggressively expand its domain in the Indo-Pacific region, all while it seeks to impede the sovereignty and autonomy of our regional partners. It's crucial for the U.S. to continue its support in countering these malicious tactics. India, along with other nations in the region, is not alone," Rubio said after he introduced the U.S.-India Defense Cooperation Act in the Senate.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In order to strengthen our partnership with India, it's essential we increase our strategic relationship w/ New Delhi. ?? ??<br />
<br />
Introduced a bill to best support India as they continue to face aggression from Communist China.<a href="https://t.co/QVF1gU7TqP">https://t.co/QVF1gU7TqP</a></p>
— Senator Marco Rubio (@SenMarcoRubio) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarcoRubio/status/1816545452713730184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Given the short timeline of a bitterly divided Congress in an election year, the bill is unlikely to make much headway, but might be reintroduced in the next Congress given that there is a bipartisan level of support on the India-US relationship. The bill notes that the US-India partnership is vital to countering influences from Communist China. In order to strengthen this partnership, it is essential to enhance our strategic diplomatic, economic, and military relationship with New Delhi, it asserts.</p>

<p>Among other things, the bill would set a Statement of Policy that the US will support India in its response to growing threats to its territorial integrity, provide necessary security assistance to India to deter adversaries, and cooperate with India with respect to defense, civil space, technology, medicine and economic investments.</p>

<p>When passed into law, it would provide a limited exemption for India from CAATSA sanctions for purchases of Russian equipment that are currently used by the Indian military and set a sense of Congress that expeditious consideration of certifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design and construction services, and major defense equipment to India is consistent with US interests and it is in the interest of peace and stability India to have the capabilities needed to deter threats.</p>

<p>It proposes to treat India as if it were of the same status as the US allies such as Japan, Israel, Korea, and NATO allies regarding technology transfers; authorize the Secretary of State to enter into a memorandum of understanding with India to increase military cooperation; expedite excess defense articles to India for two years and grant India the same status as other allies; and expand International Military Education and Training Cooperation with New Delhi.</p>

<p>It requires a report to Congress on Pakistan's use of offensive force, including through terrorism and proxy groups, against India; and bar Pakistan from receiving security assistance if it is found to have sponsored terrorism against India.</p>

<p>This is for the first time such an India-centric bill has been introduced in the US Congress that proposes to put India at the same level of that of its treaty ally, exempt it from CAATSA sanctions, and imposes sanctions on Pakistan for promoting terrorism in India.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mexican drug lord Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and the son of his former partner, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, were arrested in Texas, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mexican drug lord Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and the son of his former partner, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, were arrested in El Paso, Texas, on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said.</p>

<p>"The Justice Department has taken into custody two additional alleged leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world," the department said in a statement.</p>

<p>Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo, face multiple charges in the U.S. "for heading the Cartel's criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks," the statement said.</p>

<p>The arrest of Guzman Lopez was first reported by Reuters, ahead of the Justice Department statement.</p>

<p>Two U.S. officials told Reuters that Zambada and Guzman Lopez were detained after landing in a private plane.</p>

<p>Zambada is one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexico's history and co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.</p>

<p>After El Chapo's extradition, his criminal empire was inherited by four of his sons -- known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos -- who took over his faction of the cartel and became some of the biggest exporters of fentanyl to the United States.</p>

<p>El Mayo and Los Chapitos have had a fractious relationship since El Chapo's extradition, and the arrests of the two traffickers may trigger instability or even violence in Mexico.</p>

<p>U.S. federal prosecutors in February charged Zambada with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, which the Drug Enforcement Administration says is the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI on Thursday said it was putting its artificial intelligence engine to work in a challenge to Google's market-dominating search engine.</p>

<p>The startup behind ChatGPT announced that it is testing a "SearchGPT" prototype that is "designed to combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web" to answer online queries quickly and to provide relevant sources.</p>

<p>SearchGPT is being made available to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback, OpenAI said in a blog post.</p>

<p>Search features refined in the prototype will be woven into ChatGPT in the future, according to the San Francisco-based company.</p>

<p>Users will be able to interact with SearchGPT through conversational queries, and can ask follow-up questions as they might if speaking to a person, OpenAI said.</p>

<p>Google recently added AI-generated query result summaries -- referred to as "Overviews" -- to its search engine, causing worries among some that the move would result in fewer opportunities to serve up money-making ads.</p>

<p>This new feature offers written text at the top of results for Google searches, ahead of the traditional links to sites, which summarizes information that the engine believes answers the user's search query.</p>

<p>OpenAI's description of SearchGPT sounded similar to Google's Overviews.</p>

<p>Since the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, companies in the sector have been engaged in a frantic race to deploy generative AI programs for producing text, images and other content through prompts in everyday language.</p>

<p>"We are innovating at every layer of the AI stack," Google chief Sundar Pichai said this week during an earnings call for parent company Alphabet, which he also heads.</p>

<p>OpenAI said it was working with some publishers to refine SearchGPT, which is being kept separate from the training of its generative AI foundation models.</p>

<p>"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers," The Atlantic chief executive Nicholas Thompson said in the OpenAI blog post.</p>

<p>"We look forward to partnering with OpenAI in the process."</p>

<p>OpenAI has invited users to sign up on a waitlist to try SearchGPT.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden is still committed to attending the annual leadership summit of the QUAD countries which is scheduled to be held in India this year, the White House said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"We're still committed to there being a Quad leader summit this year, but there's nothing on the calendar right now for it," White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters at a news conference here.</p>

<p>QUAD, comprising Australia, Japan, India and the US, is an initiative of Biden. In the first 100 days of his presidency, he convened a virtual leadership summit of the QUAD countries in 2020. Since then QUAD leaders have been holding an annual summit on a rotation basis. India is scheduled to host the QUAD leadership summit this year.</p>

<p>Kirby said now that Biden is not running for reelection, certainly, one can expect there will be opportunities on the calendar that may not have been before.</p>

<p>"So we're all exploring what those opportunities can look like in terms of advancing his foreign policy agenda and national security opportunities here and around the world. But I don't have anything on the schedule to speak to now, but I mean, stay tuned,' he said.</p>

<p>"I think there'll be some opportunities that the president is going to want to explore. Look, I mean, we've still got a war in Ukraine, still got a war in Gaza, still got climate change to deal with. We've still got a very restless Indo-Pacific. I mean, I could go on and on. There's plenty of things for the national security team to try to continue to get done," Kirby said in response to a question.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris signaled a major shift in Gaza policy on Thursday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu she had "serious concern" over casualties and telling him to get a peace deal done.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris signaled a major shift on US Gaza policy Thursday, with the presidential hopeful telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seal a peace deal and insisting she would not be "silent" on the suffering in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>Ripping up outgoing President Joe Biden's playbook of mostly behind-the-scenes pressure on Israel, the vice president said after meeting Netanyahu that it was time to end the "devastating" war.</p>

<p>"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time," Harris told reporters.</p>

<p>"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent."</p>

<p>The 59-year-old -- now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after Biden said at the weekend he would not stand in November's election -- said she pressed Netanyahu on the dire situation in the "frank" meeting.</p>

<p>She said she "expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering and Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians."</p>

<p>"And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Get this deal done' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris also called for the establishment of a Palestinian state and went on to call on both him and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal to end the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done," she said.</p>

<p>Harris's outspoken comments were a stark contrast to the largely amiable greetings between Biden and Netanyahu earlier in the day, even if it masked months of tensions between the two men as well as questions over the US president's relevance.</p>

<p>"From a proud Zionist Jew to a proud Zionist Irish American, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel," Netanyahu said in tribute to Biden at the start of the Oval Office meeting.</p>

<p>"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead."</p>

<p>Harris has been more outspoken on Gaza in the past than Biden and there had been speculation that she could adopt a tougher approach on Israel. Officials earlier denied there is any "daylight" between her and Biden.</p>

<p>The White House said Biden would tell Netanyahu there needed to be "compromise" for a deal, after the Israeli premier gave a fiery speech to the US Congress on Wednesday in which he vowed "total victory" against Hamas.</p>

<p>"The president will be reaffirming for Prime Minister Netanyahu that he believes we need to get there, and we need to get there soon," spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p><strong>- 'More optimistic' -</strong></p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu later met the families of US hostages held in Gaza, who said they hoped for a possible new ceasefire proposal in coming days.</p>

<p>"We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November," Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, told reporters after the meeting.</p>

<p>Protesters chanted slogans outside a ring of metal barriers erected around the White House, following rowdy protests during Netanyahu's speech to lawmakers.</p>

<p>While Biden has kept military aid flowing to Israel since Hamas's October 7 attacks, relations with Netanyahu have been deeply strained by Israel's conduct during the war and suspicions that he may be stalling on a deal.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Out of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 39,175 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House on Thursday described as "disgusting" the increasing sexist and racist attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris which has intensified after she became the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic party.</p>

<p>“I think it's desperate. I think it's disgusting and I think it's a dog whistle. We should not forget that she is the Vice President of the United States. She should get that respect. She's been doing this job with the president for almost four years,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference.</p>

<p>"She's a former Senator and has been a critical partner in getting the economy restarted and making sure that -- that we deal with the pandemic. And to hear that is, frankly, disgusting," Jean-Pierre said when asked about the increase in racist and sexist attacks against Harris, who is of both India and African origin.</p>

<p>It increased to such a level that the House Speaker Mike Johnson had to ask his Republican lawmakers to avoid such an attack.</p>

<p>“When you have the speaker of the House, obviously he's a Republican, and this is something that you all have reported, set up a meeting to tell Republican leaders to stop being racist, to stop being misogynist, to stop being sexist, I think that says a lot that they have to be told to not do that,' Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>According to Politico, “House Republican leaders told lawmakers to focus on criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris' record without reference to her race and gender, following caustic remarks from some Republicans attacking her on the basis of identity.” At an election rally in North Carolina, former US president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had said Vice President Harris is “unfit to rule” and described her as a "radical left lunatic".</p>

<p>“For three and a half years, Lyin Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office. We're not going to let that happen,” Trump said on Wednesday as he unleashed a torrent of attacks against her.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Humanity is suffering from an "extreme heat epidemic," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday, calling for action to limit the impacts of heat waves intensified by climate change.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humanity is suffering from an "extreme heat epidemic," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday, calling for action to limit the impacts of heat waves intensified by climate change.</p>

<p>"Billions of people are facing an extreme heat epidemic -- wilting under increasingly deadly heat waves, with temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius around the world," he said. "That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit. And halfway to boiling."</p>

<p>According to the European Copernicus network, July 21, 22 and 23 were the three hottest days ever recorded worldwide, with July 22 holding the absolute record of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Guterres repeated his call for humanity to fight its "addiction" to fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. And the list goes on," he said.</p>

<p>"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction," he stressed, calling in particular on G20 countries to take action.</p>

<p>While 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 could set a new record, temperatures well above 40C (104F) are increasingly common.</p>

<p>In the space of a year, the 50C threshold has even been exceeded in at least 10 places, from Death Valley in the United States (53.9C on July 7) to Agadir in Morocco, and also in China and India.</p>

<p>The intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms or floods, is nonetheless more deadly.</p>

<p>This "silent killer" is responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's "Call to Action" document published on Thursday.</p>

<p><strong>Workers exposed</strong></p>

<p>Extremely high temperatures also have an economic impact, with the UN estimating economic losses from heat stress at work will reach $2.4 trillion in 2030.</p>

<p>According to a report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday, more than 70 percent of workers were exposed to excessive heat in 2020, 8.8 percent more than in 2000.</p>

<p>"The good news is that we can save lives and we can limit its impact," Guterres said Thursday.</p>

<p>The UN has called for the world community to first act to protect "the most vulnerable" -- including young children, the elderly and also humanity's poorest.</p>

<p>In this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, warning populations of the arrival of heat waves and informing them of the precautions to take, the document says.</p>

<p>The call to action also recommends an "increase (to) equitable access to and scale up (of) low-carbon cooling."</p>

<p>This would involve investing in passive cooling systems -- which include climate-sensitive urban design measures, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems -- and the phase-out of climate-warming gases that are used in many cooling systems.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

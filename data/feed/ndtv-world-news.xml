       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 40-year-old Indian doctor was held in a US jail on a USD 2 million bond after being charged with multiple sex crimes for allegedly recording hundreds of nude images and videos of children and women over several years, according to media reports.</p>

<p>Oumair Aejaz was arrested earlier on August 8 after he allegedly placed hidden cameras in a variety of settings from bathrooms, changing areas, hospital rooms, and even his own home where he would record children as young as 2 years old in varying states of undress, Fox News reported.</p>

<p>Authorities became aware of his offences after his wife came forward with disturbing materials. Before his arrest, he had no criminal history.</p>

<p>He also allegedly recorded sexual encounters with numerous women who were unconscious or asleep, the Oakland County Sheriff said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The magnitude of Aejaz's offences is not currently known, but Sheriff Mike Bouchard said it will take months to fully investigate. Authorities suspect there could be many more victims as investigators review thousands of videos found at his home in Rochester Hills, a city in Oakland County in the US state of Michigan.</p>

<p>"The victimisation is so broad and the perversion so great, we're just beginning to wrap our arms around it," he said. "Disturbing on so many levels." He equated the scale of criminality to Larry Nasser, the disgraced sports doctor convicted of abusing dozens of young women in his care.</p>

<p>Several search warrants have been served since Aejaz was arrested on August 8 at his home. They include computers, phones, and 15 external devices. Bouchard said a single hard drive had 13,000 videos on it.</p>

<p>He may have uploaded videos into cloud storage as well.</p>

<p>Aejaz was charged on August 13 with one count of child sexually abusive activity, four counts of capturing an image of an unclothed person and five counts of using a computer to commit a crime and is being held in the Oakland County Jail on a USD 2 million bond, Detroit Free Press reported.</p>

<p>Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said Aejaz's wife produced materials earlier this month that were concerning and the sheriff's office immediately executed a search warrant and confiscated more devices. She said investigators have "sifted through really jarring, alarming images" and continue to do so.</p>

<p>McDonald said Aejaz also preyed on well-respected institutions and hospitals, which she said have been cooperative.</p>

<p>Many of the allegations stem from Aejaz allegedly recording a mother and her kids inside a changing room at the Goldfish Swimming Club in 2023. However, he is also believed to have assaulted patients inside hospital rooms.</p>

<p>"These are children and moms at a swim school," McDonald said. "They're there to teach their kids to swim. Because that brings their kids joy and because they want their kids to be safe around water. They were victimised by a person of trust in the community – a medical doctor." His work history shows he was employed at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital in Clinton Township and Ascension Genesys Hospital in Grand Blanc. His current employment was as a physician contracted with a company that would send him to different hospitals.</p>

<p>Before that, he moved to the US in 2011 on a work visa from India, where he is a citizen. His residency took place at Sinai Grace Hospital before spending time in Alabama. He returned to Michigan in 2018.</p>

<p>Due to the number of victims and the difficulty identifying them, police have provided an email that people can use to contact the authorities.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romanian authorities on Wednesday searched the home of controversial influencer Andrew Tate, who is awaiting trial over human trafficking and rape charges, as part of a new investigation, officials said.</p>

<p>One of the world's best-known influencers known for misogynist and sometimes violent maxims, Andrew Tate has been accused of having formed an organised criminal network in early 2021 in Romania and Britain, along with his brother Tristan. They have denied the charges.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege that 37-year-old Tate, his 36-year-old brother and two women set up a criminal organisation and sexually exploited several victims. A trial date has not yet been set.</p>

<p>On Wednesday prosecutors "conducted a raid this morning, on August 21, 2024, at the residence of the Tate brothers as part of a search related to a new investigation", prosecutors said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Office for Organised Crime (DIICOT), said that four search warrants were executed, in connection with "the crimes of forming an organised criminal group, trafficking in minors", "sexual relations with a minor" and "money laundering".</p>

<p>Neither of the statements indicated whether the new charges targeted the brothers.</p>

<p>They were detained in 2022 in Bucharest and spent three months in detention before being released under judicial supervision to await trial.</p>

<p>The brothers also face rape and assault allegations in separate cases in Britain, where they have also been accused of tax evasion.</p>

<p>In 2016, Tate appeared on the "Big Brother" reality television show in Britain but was removed after a video emerged showing him attacking a woman.</p>

<p>He then turned to social media platforms to promote his divisive views.</p>

<p>Giving tips on how to be successful, along with misogynistic and sometimes violent maxims, his videos have made him one of the world's best-known influencers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though there are only a handful of them among thousands of delegates, the "Uncommitted Movement" delegates at the Democratic National Convention are among the most vocal.</p>

<p>The delegates plan to voice their discontent with the war in Gaza at the party's convention this week in Chicago, during which <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-kamala-harris-arrives-in-chicago-ahead-of-democratic-convention-6367700" target="_blank">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> will formally accept the Democratic Party's nomination in the close race for the White House.</p>

<p>The 30 "Uncommitted Movement" delegates hail from eight different US states and claim to represent some 700,000 voters.</p>

<p>Though they welcomed the news of President Joe Biden dropping out of the race on July 21, they have met Harris's subsequent ascension with caution and skepticism.</p>

<p>"The party needed change," Minnesota delegate Asma Mohammed told AFP. "I don't feel sad about someone who has unapologetically supported a genocidal regime in Israel."</p>

<p>Mohammed came to Chicago hoping to see a renewed perspective within her party, but she said she is disappointed that the convention has no pro-Palestinian voices on the speaker list.</p>

<p>"I know she's (Harris) more empathetic than Joe Biden, I've seen that," Mohammed said. "But those words are not enough. That needs to be followed by policy."</p>

<p>The Uncommitted Movement advocated for adding Tanya Haj-Hassan to the speaker list, wanting the thousands of attendees to hear from a doctor who has treated victims of the conflict between Israel and operatives group Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>However, all that has been permitted at the event so far is a panel at the nearby McCormick Center, outside the main venue. During the panel, the pediatrician described the horrors of war, bringing the audience to tears.</p>

<h3><strong>Both sides</strong></h3>

<p>Among the speakers slated for the DNC are some relatives of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 when it sparked the conflict by attacking Israel, which also left 1,199 dead, according to an AFP tally based on official data.</p>

<p>"Why does it have to be one or the other?" asked Mohammed, who emphasized that more than 40,000 people have died in Gaza from Israel's retaliation, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

<p>For her, there is room to listen to both sides.</p>

<p>Jacob Schonberger, a 17-year-old delegate representing the state of Connecticut, is not part of the "Uncommitted Movement" but shares the sentiment. He arrived at the convention wearing buttons with slogans in support of Israel.</p>

<p>"I think it should be leadership's decision... I have my personal beliefs, but I think that it's important to have both sides," he said.</p>

<p>In addition to the "Uncommitted Movement," protests fomented outside the United Center, the venue for the convention, where hundreds of people chanted "Free Palestine!"</p>

<p>Inside the arena, some delegates covered their mouths as Biden gave his speech Monday night, a gesture made in protest of his response to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We wanted to send the message that we don't agree with what Biden has been doing," said Sabrene Odeh, a delegate from Washington state.</p>

<p>While the DNC is underway, Biden's Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is on a tour of the Middle East in a new attempt to secure a truce between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-us-elections-2024-far-from-over-but-joe-biden-has-high-hopes-for-gaza-ceasefire-6354958" target="_blank">Biden</a> acknowledged the discontent with the death count in Gaza during his speech Monday night.</p>

<p>That did not excite Yaz Kader, another Washington delegate.</p>

<p>"The fact is, he has been a president that has supported a genocide that Israel is committing," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientific discovery is one of the most sophisticated human activities. Can and should a complex process be automated?]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific discovery is one of the most sophisticated human activities. First, scientists must understand the existing knowledge and identify a significant gap. Next, they must formulate a research question and design and conduct an experiment in pursuit of an answer. Then, they must analyse and interpret the results of the experiment, which may raise yet another research question.</p>

<p>Can a process this complex be automated? Last week, <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/">Sakana AI Labs announced</a> the creation of an “AI scientist” – an artificial intelligence system they claim can make scientific discoveries in the area of machine learning in a fully automated way.</p>

<p>Using generative large language models (LLMs) like those behind ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, the system can brainstorm, select a promising idea, code new algorithms, plot results, and write a paper summarising the experiment and its findings, complete with references. Sakana claims the AI tool can undertake the complete lifecycle of a scientific experiment at a cost of just US$15 per paper – less than the cost of a scientist's lunch.</p>

<p>These are some big claims. Do they stack up? And even if they do, would an army of AI scientists churning out research papers with inhuman speed really be good news for science?</p>

<h2>How a computer can ‘do science'</h2>

<p>A lot of science is done in the open, and almost all scientific knowledge has been written down somewhere (or we wouldn't have a way to “know” it). Millions of scientific papers are freely available online in repositories such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>.</p>

<p>LLMs trained with this data capture the language of science and its patterns. It is therefore perhaps not at all surprising that a generative LLM can produce something that looks like a good scientific paper – it has ingested many examples that it can copy.</p>

<p>What is less clear is whether an AI system can produce an <em>interesting</em> scientific paper. Crucially, good science requires novelty.</p>

<h2>But is it interesting?</h2>

<p>Scientists don't want to be told about things that are already known. Rather, they want to learn new things, especially new things that are significantly different from what is already known. This requires judgement about the scope and value of a contribution.</p>

<p>The Sakana system tries to address interestingness in two ways. First, it “scores” new paper ideas for similarity to existing research (indexed in the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a> repository). Anything too similar is discarded.</p>

<p>Second, Sakana's system introduces a “peer review” step – using another LLM to judge the quality and novelty of the generated paper. Here again, there are plenty of examples of peer review online on sites such as <a href="https://openreview.net">openreview.net</a> that can guide how to critique a paper. LLMs have ingested these, too.</p>

<h2>AI may be a poor judge of AI output</h2>

<p>Feedback is mixed on Sakana AI's output. Some have described it as producing “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/research-ai-model-unexpectedly-modified-its-own-code-to-extend-runtime/">endless scientific slop</a>”.</p>

<p>Even the system's own review of its outputs judges the papers weak at best. This is likely to improve as the technology evolves, but the question of whether automated scientific papers are valuable remains.</p>

<p>The ability of LLMs to judge the quality of research is also an open question. My own work (soon to be published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17592887">Research Synthesis Methods</a>) shows LLMs are not great at judging the risk of bias in medical research studies, though this too may improve over time.</p>

<p>Sakana's system automates discoveries in computational research, which is much easier than in other types of science that require physical experiments. Sakana's experiments are done with code, which is also structured text that LLMs can be trained to generate.</p>

<h2>AI tools to support scientists, not replace them</h2>

<p>AI researchers have been developing systems to support science for decades. Given the huge volumes of published research, even finding publications relevant to a specific scientific question can be challenging.</p>

<p>Specialised search tools make use of AI to help scientists find and synthesise existing work. These include the above-mentioned Semantic Scholar, but also newer systems such as <a href="https://elicit.com/">Elicit</a>, <a href="https://www.researchrabbit.ai/">Research Rabbit</a>, <a href="https://scite.ai/">scite</a> and <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a>.</p>

<p>Text mining tools such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/">PubTator</a> dig deeper into papers to identify key points of focus, such as specific genetic mutations and diseases, and their established relationships. This is especially useful for curating and organising scientific information.</p>

<p>Machine learning has also been used to support the synthesis and analysis of medical evidence, in tools such as <a href="https://www.robotreviewer.net/">Robot Reviewer</a>. Summaries that compare and contrast claims in papers from <a href="https://www.scholarcy.com/">Scholarcy</a> help to perform literature reviews.</p>

<p>All these tools aim to help scientists do their jobs more effectively, not to replace them.</p>

<h2>AI research may exacerbate existing problems</h2>

<p>While Sakana AI <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/#limitations-and-challenges">states</a> it doesn't see the role of human scientists diminishing, the company's vision of “a fully AI-driven scientific ecosystem” would have major implications for science.</p>

<p>One concern is that, if AI-generated papers flood the scientific literature, future AI systems may be trained on AI output and undergo <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y">model collapse</a>. This means they may become increasingly ineffectual at innovating.</p>

<p>However, the implications for science go well beyond impacts on AI science systems themselves.</p>

<p>There are already bad actors in science, including “paper mills” churning out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00159-9">fake papers</a>. This problem will only <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01780-w">get worse</a> when a scientific paper can be produced with US$15 and a vague initial prompt.</p>

<p>The need to check for errors in a mountain of automatically generated research could rapidly overwhelm the capacity of actual scientists. The peer review system is arguably <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-peer-review-system-is-broken-we-asked-academics-how-to-fix-it-187034">already broken</a>, and dumping more research of questionable quality into the system won't fix it.</p>

<p>Science is fundamentally based on trust. Scientists emphasise the integrity of the scientific process so we can be confident our understanding of the world (and now, the world's machines) is valid and improving.</p>

<p>A scientific ecosystem where AI systems are key players raises fundamental questions about the meaning and value of this process, and what level of trust we should have in AI scientists. Is this the kind of scientific ecosystem we want?<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crocodile killed a woman bathing in a river in eastern Indonesia, police and locals said Wednesday, with villagers later recovering parts of her body from the slaughtered animal.</p>

<p>Indonesia is home to several species of crocodiles that regularly attack and kill humans.</p>

<p>Halima Rahakbauw, 54, was swimming in a river in Wali village on the Maluku islands after spending Tuesday morning looking for clams when the reptile struck.</p>

<p>Rahakbauw's neighbour, Rustam Ilyas, said relatives and friends started a search when she failed to return home.</p>

<p>After spotting a sandal and a body part in the river, villagers reported the incident to police who killed the reptile.</p>

<p>"The villagers had to cut open the crocodile's belly to remove some of the victim's body parts," a local police officer, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, told AFP Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The crocodile was quite big, around four metres (12 feet)long," neighbour Ilyas told AFP.</p>

<p>Neither the police nor villagers could identify the species.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a 63-year-old tin miner was killed by a crocodile near a river on Bangka island in Sumatra.</p>

<p>In 2018, a mob in Indonesia's easternmost region of Papua butchered nearly 300 crocodiles in revenge after a local man was killed by one of the reptiles.</p>

<p>In 2019 a scientist was dragged by a huge captive crocodile into its enclosure and killed on the island of Sulawesi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In Washington, Rajnath Singh will hold talks with Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan among others.</p>

<p>India's plan to procure 31 MQ-9B Predator drones, the proposed joint manufacturing of Stryker infantry combat vehicles and co-production of GE F414 engines in India are likely to figure prominently in Singh's talks with Austin, officials said today.</p>

<p>"The visit is expected to further deepen and broaden the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership," the defence ministry said announcing Singh's trip to the US from August 23 to 26.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniela Larreal Chirinos, one of Venezuela's best-known athletes and five-time Olympian, has been found dead at her Las Vegas apartment. The retired cyclist reportedly choked on her food, police said.</p>

<p>When Ms&nbsp;Chirinos did not turn up at the Las Vegas hotel where she worked, she was checked on and her body was found at her apartment, according to FOX Sports. The 50-year-old is believed to have died on August 11.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Was Daniela&nbsp;Larreal Chirinos?</strong></h3>

<p>One of the finest athletes ever to represent Venezuela, Daniela Larreal Chirinos is a two-time gold medalist in the Pan American Games and the Pan American Championships. Ms&nbsp;Chirinos featured in five Olympics editions.</p>

<p>She made her Olympics debut in Barcelona way back in 1992 and participated in four Olympic events -- Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004) and London (2012). She also clinched two gold medals at the Central American and Caribbean Games in San Salvador, 2002.</p>

<p>Apart from a storied career in cycling, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was also active in Venezuelan politics. A vocal critic of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, the Olympian accused the late president and his sports minister Hector Rodriguez of funneling money out of the country in the name of sponsoring a "non-existent" racing driver.</p>

<p>In 2013, upon Nicolás Maduro's arrival at the helm in Venezuela, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos called his presidency a dictatorship. She was forced into exile and banned from entering Venezuela. Before moving to Las Vegas where she worked as a food server, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was an Uber driver in Miami.</p>

<h3><strong>How did she die?</strong></h3>

<p>While the “cause and method” of her death was still under investigation, police suspected she died from asphyxiation after they reportedly found solid food remains in her windpipe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/daniela-larreal-chirinos-olympian-dead">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Clark County Coroner's Office said an official cause of death was still pending.</p>

<p>The Comité Olímpico Venezolano (Venezuelan Olympic Committee) shared on X a heartfelt tribute with a picture of Ms&nbsp;Chirinos holding a medal.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine attacked Moscow on Wednesday with at least 11 drones shot down by air defences in what Russian officials said was one of the biggest drone strikes on the capital since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-were-set-for-ceasefire-talks-in-doha-then-a-shock-assault-6362125" target="_blank">The war</a>, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on Aug. 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers into Russia's western Kursk region.</p>

<p>For months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - are rarer.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region.</p>

<p>Some of the drones were destroyed over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. The city in the Moscow region is some 38 kms (24 miles) south of the Kremlin.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever," Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The layered defence of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs."</p>

<p>The attack comes as Russia is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18% of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War Two.</p>

<p>Russian media showed unverified footage of drones whirring over the dawn sky of the Moscow region and then being shot down in a ball of flame by air defences.</p>

<p>Moscow's airports Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky limited flights for four hours but were restarted normal operations from 0330 GMT, Russia's aviation watchdog said.</p>

<p>Sobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported in the aftermath of the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region Alexander Bogomaz wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>Russia's RIA state news agency reported that two drones were destroyed over the Tula region, which borders the Moscow region to its north. Vasily Golubev, governor of the Rostov region in Russia's southwest, said air defence forces destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over the region, with no injuries reported.</p>

<p>The Russia defence ministry did not mention neither Tula nor Rostov in its statement listing destroyed Ukrainian air weapons. Ukraine's military said on Wednesday it overnight struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in Rostov region.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the reports.</p>

<p>The drone attack on Moscow is on a par with the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-alleges-ukraine-attempted-to-assassinate-vladimir-putin-4001694" target="_blank">May 2023 attack</a> when at least eight drones were destroyed over the capital in an attack President Vladimir Putin said was Kyiv's attempt to scare and provoke Russia.</p>

<p>In Kursk, Russian war bloggers said that intense battles were ongoing along the front in the region where Ukraine has carved out at least 450 square km (175 square miles) of Russian territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov on Tuesday inspected Chechen troops and volunteers readying to fight Ukraine, the Kremlin said, in what was Putin's first trip in 13 years to the North Caucasus republic.</p>

<p>The previously unannounced trip to the mostly Muslim republic that is part of Russia comes as Moscow fights to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region two weeks after they smashed through the border in the largest invasion of Russia since World War Two.</p>

<p>"As long as we have men like you, we are absolutely, absolutely invincible," Putin told troops at the Russian Special Forces University, a training school in Chechnya's Gudermes, according to a transcript on the Kremlin's website.</p>

<p>"It is one thing to shoot at a shooting range here, and another thing to put your life and health at risk. But you have an inner need to defend the Fatherland and the courage to make such a decision."</p>

<p>The foreign occupation of Russian land has been an embarrassment for Putin and his army, even as Russian forces continue their gradual but steady advances on the frontline in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Kadyrov, sanctioned by the United States in 2020 and 2022 for alleged human rights abuses and mobilising Chechen troops to fight Ukraine, told Putin at a separate meeting on Tuesday that Chechnya had sent more than 47,000 troops since the start of the war to fight Ukraine, including about 19,000 volunteers.</p>

<p>Kadyrov has often described himself as Putin's "foot soldier."</p>

<p>When asked by a journalist whether "Putin's foot soldiers" like Kadyrov justify his trust, Putin said "If I had more of these foot soldiers, I would be very happy, but even one such foot soldier is worth a lot", reported the RIA agency.</p>

<h3><strong>Beslan and Kursk</strong></h3>

<p>Before heading to Chechnya, Putin visited for the first time in at least 16 years the town Beslan in North Ossetia. The 2004 school siege by Islamic militants there left more than 330 dead in what has been the bloodiest incident of its kind in modern Russian history.</p>

<p>Among those killed were 136 children, Putin said at a meeting in Beslan with the mothers of the children killed in the attack.</p>

<p>"This tragedy will remain an unhealed wound in the historical memory of all of Russia," Putin said, according to the transcript published on the Kremlin's website.</p>

<p>But he also added that Russia continues to face enemies that try to destabilise the country.</p>

<p>"And just as we fought terrorists, today we have to fight those who commit crimes in the Kursk region, in Donbas," Putin said, referring to Ukraine's surprise incursion into the Russian territory and the broader Donbas region in Ukraine's southeast, which Russian forces partially control.</p>

<p>"We will punish the criminals. There can be no doubt about this."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The adult film star was found dead in her New Mexico home on March 1.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six months after adult film star Sophia Leone's death, the official cause has been revealed. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/04/18/porn-star-sophia-leone-death-mom-suicidal-thoughts-drinking-police-report/">TMZ</a>, the 26-year-old's death was accidental, resulting from a drug overdose. Notably, Ms Leone's body was found in her New Mexico home on March 1, with police initially deeming her death "suspicious" and "unique".</p>

<p>Her mother had previously disclosed to a detective that Ms Leone struggled with alcohol dependency and had suicidal thoughts. The investigation has now concluded that Leone's death was an accidental overdose, bringing closure to the case. However, it's not clear which substances she had ingested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The news of her death first came to light when Ms Leone's stepfather Mike Romero sought funds for her memorial on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sophia-leones-memorial-fund">GoFundMe.</a></p>

<p>''The sudden loss of Sophia has left her family and friends devastated and in shock.&nbsp;Sophia was a beloved daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and friend. She had a deep love for all animals, specifically her three pets. She enjoyed travelling and always found ways to make everyone around her smile'', Mr Romero wrote on the fundraising page.</p>

<p>Ms Leone was born on June 10, 1997, in Miami in the US. She reportedly entered the adult entertainment industry at the age of 18 and was said to have a net worth north of $1 million. She was associated with the modelling agency 101 and starred in more than 80 films, according to her IMDB page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In her last post before death, Ms Leone told her fans to "go outside and just appreciate life a little extra".&nbsp;</p>

<p>She sent a heartfelt note to her 300,000 Instagram fans in September. "Go outside and just appreciate life a little extra today," the 26-year-old captioned a picture, where she posed wearing white sunglasses and a white handbag thrown over her shoulder while flashing the peace sign to the camera.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama, 60, turned back the clock Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Chicago, delivering a passionate speech in support of Kamala Harris and ripping into Donald Trump, the Republican pick.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States First Lady <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/michelle-obama" target="_blank">Michelle Obama</a>, 60, turned back the clock Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Chicago, delivering a passionate speech in support of "my girl"&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/kamala-harris" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> for November's presidential election and warning <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;"hope is making a comeback".</p>

<p>Ms Obama's speeches helped propel her husband, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/barack-obama" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a>, to two consecutive terms, and who was widely spoken of as a potential presidential candidate herself, particularly early this year as the Democrats struggled to rally behind a single nominee to replace Joe Biden. And in Chicago last night she brought all of that considerable charisma to bear, and the measure of her popularity was underlined by receiving a welcome bigger than that which greeted Mr Obama in his hometown.</p>

<p>Among the highlights of Ms Obama's speech was her leaning into Kamala Harris' background, highlighting her multi-racial origin as "the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country. "Her story is your story. It is my story," she said, in response to jibes by Donald Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Michelle Slams Trump's "Misogynistic Lies"</strong></h3>

<p>The Trump campaign has attempted to weaponise Ms Harris' racial identity; a tactic perhaps best epitomised by Mr Trump's "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://theconversation.com/us-election-2024-how-trump-and-vance-are-trying-to-weaponise-kamala-harriss-multiracial-identity-236521" target="_blank">I didn't know she was Black... till she happened to 'turn Black'</a> and now she wants to be known as 'Black'" swipe at Ms Harris (to a Black reporter) last month.</p>

<p>Michelle Obama's counterattacks last night were brief but packed a punch, and included a sarcastic dig at the twice-impeached former President for running for "one of those Black jobs".</p>

<p>"We know folks are going to do everything to distort her truth."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Barack and Michelle Obama led the Democrats' charge in Chicago Tuesday night.</p>
</div>

<p>"For years Trump did everything to make people fear us (referring to Mr Obama and herself). His narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by two highly successful and educated people who happened to be Black... who is going to tell him the job he is seeking is now one of those 'Black jobs'?" she said accusing Mr Trump of "ugly, misogynistic, (and) racist lies".</p>

Biden Blasts Trump In Fiery Speech</a></p>

<p>Switching focus to Ms Harris, Michelle Obama said, "The steel of her spine... the steadiness of her upbringing, and the joy and light of her laughter... Kamala knows that regardless of where you come from, who you worship, or what you look like... you deserve a decent life."</p>

<p>"No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American."</p>

<p>"America, hope is making a comeback," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>"Kamala Has Proven Her Allegiance"</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Obama also drew similarities between herself and the Vice President.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris and I built our lives (on) the same values. Our mothers shared the same beliefs in the promise of this country. That's why hers moved here from India... that is why she taught Kamala about justice. She told her daughter, 'don't sit around and complain, do something'."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">US Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democrats' pick for the 2024 presidential race.</p>
</div>

<p>"So, Kamala went out and she worked hard fighting for people, for better wages and cheaper drugs. From a middle-class household Kamala worked her way up to become Vice President. My girl, Kamala Harris, is more than ready for this moment," she declared.</p>

<p>Underlining Ms Harris' credentials in the face of attacks by the Trump campaign, Ms Obama said Ms Harris had "shown her allegiance... not by spewing anger but by living a life of service."</p>

<p>"Let us not forget what we are up against... Kamala and Tim (Walz, Governor of Minnesota and Ms Harris' VP pick) are doing good now but remember... there are still so many people ready to criticise every move Kamala makes..." Ms Obama said. "We must do everything in our power to elect these two bighearted, good people. There is no other choice than Kamala and Tim."</p>

<h3><strong>"Still Only Human"</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Obama also sought to buy the Harris campaign an extended honeymoon and a shield from future attacks by Donald Trump, warning Democrat delegates, supporters, and voters that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz "are still only human... they are not perfect... will make mistakes."</p>

<p>"It is up to us to be the anecdote to the darkness and division. I don't care how you identify politically... this is our time to stand up for basic freedoms and humanity. This is going to be an uphill battle (and) we cannot be our own worst enemies," Ms Obama said to deafening cheers.</p>

<h3><strong>"Yes, She Can", Barack's War Cry</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Barack Obama tweaked the 'Yes, We Can' war cry from his 2008 campaign and delivered another rousing endorsement of Kamala Harris. Mr Obama formally endorsed Ms Harris as the Democrat nominee last month, telling her "this is going to be historic".</p>

<p>On Tuesday the former president launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump, labelling him "a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden elevator nine years ago", and accusing him of divisive politics.</p>

<p>"Trump wants us to think this country is divided between 'us' and 'them'. Between 'real' Americans who support him and the 'outsiders'. It is the oldest trick in politics. His act has gotten stale. We do not need four more years of chaos as we have seen that movie before and we know the sequel is usually worse," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman-led OpenAI on Tuesday announced a multi-year partnership with Condé Nast to display content from its brands such as the Vogue and the New Yorker within the AI startup's products, including ChatGPT and SearchGPT prototype.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>OpenAI has signed similar deals with the Time magazine, Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain's Prisa Media over the past few months.</p>

<p>While these content partnerships are essential for training artificial intelligence models, some media organizations such as the New York Times and the Intercept had sued the Microsoft-backed firm over copyright issues associated with their works.</p>

<p>Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer at OpenAI, said the company is committed to working with Condé Nast and other news publishers to "ensure that as AI plays a larger role in news discovery and delivery, it maintains accuracy, integrity and respect for quality reporting".</p>

<p>News and digital media have faced steep challenges over the last decade as many technology companies eroded publishers' ability to monetize content, Roger Lynch, CEO of Condé Nast, said in a memo to employees.</p>

<p>"Our partnership with OpenAI begins to make up for some of that revenue," Lynch said.</p>

<p>OpenAI launched its AI-powered search engine SearchGPT in July, with real-time access to information from the internet, into a territory long dominated by Google.</p>

<p>The company said on Tuesday it was collaborating with its news partners to collect feedback and insights on the design and performance of SearchGPT.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian politicians could be fined up to 5 per cent of their salary or suspended from the Parliament for bad behaviour under new government workplace laws.</p>

<p>The governing Labor Party on Wednesday introduced new legislation to establish an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission (IPSC) to crack down on politicians and staff who engage in bad behaviour, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The IPSC will have the power to enforce behaviour codes, conduct workplace investigations, and impose sanctions on elected members of both houses of the Parliament, their staff, and other employees in parliamentary workplaces.</p>

<p>If serious misconduct is found to have been perpetrated by a current or former politician, the commission can recommend that they be fined up to five per cent of their annual base salary or suspended from the Parliament.</p>

<p>The IPSC was first proposed in 2021 in a report from the government's Sex Discrimination Commissioner that found 33 per cent of people working in Commonwealth Parliamentary workplaces (CPWs) had experienced at least one incident of sexual harassment and 37 per cent had been subjected to bullying.</p>

<p>The landmark Set the Standard report was commissioned after former government staffer Brittany Higgins went public in February 2021 with allegations that she was raped by a colleague in Parliament House in March 2019.</p>

<p>A federal court judge ruled in April 2024 that Higgins was raped by fellow political staffer Bruce Lehrmann.</p>

<p>"The 2021 Set the Standard report laid bare the serious issues of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault at Parliamentary workplaces," Katy Gallagher, the Minister for Finance, Minister for Women and Minister for the Public Service, said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We've been working hard to put the systems in place so that people can raise workplace complaints, and when complaints are substantiated, that both staff and parliamentarians are held to account for their behaviour."</p>

<p>In cases where alleged behaviour would constitute criminal conduct, the IPSC would be allowed to investigate but any finding would not be one of criminal guilt.</p>

<p>For allegations of sexual assault, it would only be investigated if the complainants consented.</p>

<p>The whole process will be confidential but if the commissioners recommend sanctions against an elected representative it is likely to be made public.<br />

<p>Democratic organisers are inundated with Indian American youth "coming out of the woodwork" to support <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/kamala-harris-thanks-biden-in-surprise-speech-on-day-1-of-democratic-event-827761">Kamala Harris</a>. Rajeev Bhateja, co-founder of the group They See Blue, which mobilises South Asian American voters, points to a spike in volunteer signups to canvas for the Democratic Presidential nominee. "High school and college students are reaching out. It's way more than even Obama, Biden and Clinton years," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leader of They See Blue's youth chapter, Akash Borde, observed that the tide turned when President Joe Biden stepped out of the race. "Kamala's nomination after Biden decided not to rerun raised a lot more excitement among my peers," he says. "With the media narratives around Biden's age and foreign policy issues, we were struggling to bring young people in. Now, my phone is blowing away. The momentum is unprecedented in the South Asian community," says Harini Krishnan, Co-director of the group South Asians for Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2024-national-democratic-convetion-day-2-live-roll-call-today-to-select-kamala-harris-as-democratic-candidate-6381127">Also Read |&nbsp;"Yes She Can": Barack Obama Tweaks 2008 Campaign Slogan For Kamala Harris</a></strong></p>

<p>Hundreds of volunteers across the country have been knocking on doors, running phone banks, and writing postcards to bring out voters for Harris. It's not only her shared heritage but also her "better speeches" compared to Biden that make her resonate with Indian-American supporters. Young voters find her campaign "uplifting", with "hope and positivity" for a "bright" White House amidst the "doom and gloom" that Donald Trump's rhetoric represents for many.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Campaign "Lacked Urgency"</strong></h2>

<p>A July 2024 voter survey has shown Asian-American support for Biden has declined since 2020. His 15-point margin this year contrasts with the nearly 30-point edge he held over Trump during the last Presidential election cycle. The campaign, some say, lacked the "urgency" seen in 2020. "A complacency had set in. Kamala jumping into this race has transformed the landscape," says Krishnan.</p>

<p>According to Sangay Mishra, the author of the book <em>Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans</em> and Associate Professor of Political Science at Drew University, there is palpable change among people who were feeling hesitant after Biden's performance in the debate. "They are much more connected now. The broader trend seems that at the minimum, we will see the kind of support for Harris that we saw for Biden in 2020, probably even more," he says. That may not be entirely off the mark given the robust mobilisation for Harris: crowded rallies, young supporters offering free catchy videos on social media, a 9,000-strong 'South Asian Women for Harris' fundraiser followed by the formation of South Asian Men for Harris (the campaign raised $36 million within 24 hours after she picked Governor Tim Walz to be her vice-presidential candidate), merchandise fashioned around the viral meme 'Lotus for POTUS'.</p>

<h2><strong>Wooing Loyal Republicans Won't Be Easy</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, for all the enthusiasm, shared roots haven't been enough to convert many Republican supporters. Sure, Harris's Indian-American identity does strike a chord with the community, but it may not translate to votes beyond her party.</p>

<p>According to a census survey, Indian Americans are the largest population among Asian Americans in the US. Their votes are critical in narrowly fought elections. But they're not a monolithic voter bloc. Except for a small group, 'Haley Supporters for Harris', which staunchly backed Republican Nikki Haley during her Presidential primary and continues to hold an anti-Trump stance (despite Haley having endorsed Donald Trump), other Republican supporters have largely not switched to Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-praises-kamala-harris-joe-biden-at-2024-democratic-convention-slams-donald-trump-6374851">Also Read |&nbsp;"Kamala Harris Won't Rest, Trump Slept At His Trial": Hillary Clinton</a></strong></p>

<p>"One hundred per cent I support President Trump! I am not voting for Kamala Harris," says Florida-based hotelier Danny Gaekwad, who has raised funds for all Republican presidential candidates since George W. Bush. Issues that matter to him are border security, legal immigration, less government and lower taxes. Gaekwad thinks mere 'home country' affinity shouldn't shape the electoral decisions of immigrant voters. Local issues must define people's choices, he says. "Indians have this habit of finding links in common with prominent Indian Americans, seeking common relatives, uncles, aunties, ancestral villages! What kind of an obsession is that!"</p>

<p>Similarly, Republican fundraiser Pravina Kakodkar hopes that Trump will, as he promised, "drain the swamp in DC". She says, "We need a person who will shake Washington DC. It's become this exclusive class of people who are very disconnected from the rest of the country. I want this smashed, and only Donald Trump has the capacity to do that." Kakodkar's children, on the other hand, are Democrat supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>On Being Indian Enough</strong></h2>

<p>Some Republicans believe that Harris downplays her Indian identity - something Trump has also commented on. "Kamala Harris has always projected herself as a black woman. I have never heard her say once that she's Indian," says Gaekwad. In her autobiography though, Harris has spoken openly about her Indian roots, her Indian grandparents and growing up biracial in California.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there are others who feel that Harris didn't do enough for the community as Vice-President. California-based independent voter Pushpita Prasad, an advocate for the rights of Hindus, acknowledges that Harris's background does create a "certain strong pull of representation", but issues are a priority, she stresses. "It's ironic that the situation of Indian Americans in terms of the immigration process and visas has become so bad. We've had a South Asian person in the office during which we have seen attacks on Hindu temples in the US, even in her home state of California. I really wish for Vice President Harris to condemn those temple attacks and to condemn the violence happening against Bangladeshi Hindus."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Israel-Gaza Blot On Democrats</strong></h2>

<p>There are also Indian Americans who find themselves being single-issue voters in this presidential election. They don't support Trump and his far-right 'Project 2025' agenda, but, at the same time, view America's handling of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-israel-has-right-to-defend-itself-against-hezbollah-6227644">Israel-Palestine</a> conflict as a stain on the Biden-Harris administration. Zainab Hakim, who stands strongly for US divestment from Israel, was at a recent Harris rally in Detroit with a group of protesters, seeking accountability and demanding a ceasefire. But Harris responded to Hakim's slogans by saying that they should let her speak unless they wanted "Donald Trump to win".</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/kamala-harris-to-rishi-sunak-indians-must-be-realistic-about-the-rise-of-indian-origin-leaders-6117384">Also Read | Why Indians Must Be Realistic About The Rise Of Indian-Origin Leaders Abroad</a></strong></p>

<p>Referring to the incident, Hakim says, "She's saying, 'I'm absolutely better than this guy', even while continuing to fund a genocide. She has been the Vice-President for three years. We are set on not voting for somebody that will continue to allow the genocide." For Hakim and others like her, Harris's gender and race credentials mean little against such discontents. "I think it doesn't mean anything for somebody to be a woman, or a black woman or an Indian American in power if they're continuing to sanction the murder of people abroad," says Hakim, who has been at the forefront of student protests at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>Experts note that the Isral-Gaza conflict continues to be a concern among some communities. "There is a lot of pushback among younger people within the Indian American community also. Numerous campuses have South Asian American students who were involved in protests, Muslims particularly," says Mishra.</p>

<h2><strong>Can Kamala Create History?</strong></h2>

<p>Indian Americans do not vote as a bloc; a range of opinions shape their choices. Even so, an AAPI Data survey from July 2024 shows that the majority of them - 55 % - identified as or leaned towards the Democratic Party, while 26% identified or leaned Republican. This is significant because in many of America's battleground states where no single party dominates, the Presidential elections come down to the wire. In the last few election cycles, narrow victory margins in such states have made the Asian-American vote critical, and this is why Indian-Americans are being courted by both parties this time.</p>

<p>Harris will thus have to pull in the undecided and independent voters to come out on top. If she wins this November, she will be the first woman, the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to hold America's highest office. A large section of Indian American voters naturally wish to play a part in creating this history.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 28 Pakistani pilgrims travelling to Iraq for a Shiite Muslim ritual were killed as their bus crashed in central Iran, state media reported early Wednesday.</p>

<p>"A bus carrying 51 Pakistani pilgrims overturned and caught fire in front of Dehshir-Taft checkpoint in the central province of Yazd on Tuesday night," state television reported.</p>

<p>"28 people have been killed and 23 injured so far with the possibility of the death count increasing," it added.</p>

<p>Yazd province crisis management chief Ali Malek-zadeh told the broadcaster that some of the injured were in critical condition.</p>

<p>"Of the 23 injured, six have already been discharged from hospital, while the condition of seven others is critical," Malek-zadeh said.</p>

<p>"The dead consisted of 11 women and 17 men," he added.</p>

<p>The Pakistani pilgrims were headed through Iran to Iraq to attend the Arbaeen commemoration, one of the biggest events of the Shiite calendar which marks the 40th day of mourning for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>Last year, some 22 million pilgrims attended the commemoration in the Iraqi shrine city of Karbala, where Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried, according to official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We hear a lot about women's biological clock and how age affects the chance of pregnancy.</p>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821811#google_vignette">New research shows</a> men's fertility is also affected by age. When dads are over 50, the risk of pregnancy complications increases.</p>

<p>Data from more than 46 million births in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821811#google_vignette">United States</a> between 2011 and 2022 compared fathers in their 30s with fathers in their 50s.</p>

<p>While taking into account the age of the mother and other factors known to affect pregnancy outcomes, the researchers found every ten-year increase in paternal age was linked to more complications.</p>

<p>The researchers found that compared to couples where the father was aged 30–39, for couples where the dad was in his 50s, there was a:</p>

<ul>
	<li>16% increased risk of preterm birth</li>
	<li>14% increased risk of low birth weight</li>
	<li>13% increase in gestational diabetes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The older fathers were also twice as likely to have used assisted reproductive technology, including IVF, to conceive than their younger counterparts.</p>

<h2>Dads are getting older</h2>

<p>In this <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821811#google_vignette">US study</a>, the mean age of all fathers increased from 30.8 years in 2011 to 32.1 years in 2022.</p>

<p>In that same period, the proportion of men aged 50 years or older fathering a child increased from 1.1% to 1.3%.</p>

<p>We don't know the proportion of men over 50 years who father children in Australia, but data shows the average age of fathers has increased.</p>

<p>In 1975 the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/births-australia/latest-release">median age of Australian dads</a> was 28.6 years. This jumped to 33.7 years in 2022.</p>

<h2>How male age affects getting pregnant</h2>

<p>As we know from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-dads-first-time-over-age-50#when-he-was-54-simon-cowell-and-girlfriend-lauren-silverman-became-parents-to-their-son-eric-7">media reports</a> of celebrity dads, men produce sperm from puberty throughout life and can father children well into old age.</p>

<p>However, there is a noticeable decline in <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(18)30269-3/fulltext">sperm quality</a> from about age 40.</p>

<p>Female partners of older men take longer to achieve pregnancy than those with younger partners.</p>

<p>A study of the effect of male age on <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(03)00366-2/fulltext">time to pregnancy</a> showed women with male partners aged 45 or older were almost five times more likely to take more than a year to conceive compared to those with partners aged 25 or under. More than three quarters (76.8%) of men under the age of 25 years impregnated their female partners within six months, compared with just over half (52.9%) of men over the age of 45.</p>

<p>Pooled data from ten studies showed that partners of older men are also more likely to experience miscarriage. Compared to couples where the male was aged 25 to 29 years, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32358607/">paternal age over 45 years</a> increased the risk of miscarriage by 43%.</p>

<h2>Older men are more likely to need IVF</h2>

<p>Outcomes of assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF, are also influenced by the age of the male partner.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2022.03.031">review of studies</a> in couples using assisted reproductive technologies found paternal age under 40 years reduced the risk of miscarriage by about 25% compared to couples with men aged over 40.</p>

<p>Having a male under 40 years also almost doubled the chance of a live birth per treatment cycle. With a man over 40, 17.6% of treatment rounds resulted in a live birth, compared to 28.4% when the male was under 40.</p>

<h2>How does male age affect the health outcomes of children?</h2>

<p>As a result of age-related changes in sperm DNA, the children of older fathers have increased risk of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9957550/">a number of conditions</a>. Autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and leukaemia have been linked to the father's advanced years.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(22)01979-3/fulltext">review of studies</a> assessing the impact of advanced paternal age reported that children of older fathers have increased rates of psychiatric disease and behavioural impairments.</p>

<p>But while the increased risk of adverse health outcomes linked to older paternal age is real, the magnitude of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29471389/">the effect is modest</a>. It's important to remember that an increase in a very small risk is still a small risk and most children of older fathers are born healthy and develop well.</p>

<h2>Improving your health can improve your fertility</h2>

<p>In addition to the effects of older age, some chronic conditions that affect fertility and reproductive outcomes become more common as men get older. They include <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(23)01935-0/fulltext">obesity and diabetes</a> which affect sperm quality by lowering testosterone levels.</p>

<p>While we can't change our age, some lifestyle factors that increase the risk of pregnancy complications and reduce fertility, can be tackled. They include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4639396/">smoking</a></li>
	<li>recreational <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tre.414">drug taking</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tre.414">anabolic steroid</a> use</li>
	<li>heavy <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504800/">alcohol consumption</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Get the facts about the male biological clock</h2>

<p>Research shows <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/4/458/3065332?login=false">men want children</a> as much as women do. And most men want at least two children.</p>

<p>Yet most men <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/4/458/3065332?login=false">lack knowledge</a> about the limitations of female and male fertility and overestimate the chance of getting pregnant, with and without assisted reproductive technologies.</p>

<p>We need better public education, starting at school, to improve awareness of the impact of male and female age on reproductive outcomes and help people have healthy babies.</p>

<p>For men wanting to improve their chance of conceiving, the government-funded sites <a href="https://healthymale.org.au/">Healthy Male</a> and <a href="https://www.yourfertility.org.au/">Your Fertility</a> are a good place to start. These offer evidence-based and accessible information about reproductive health, and <a href="https://www.yourfertility.org.au/fertility-week-2022">tips</a> to improve your reproductive health and give your children the best start in life.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The release dates for new episodes of the "Call of Duty" and "Borderlands" video games were announced Tuesday at the opening of the Gamescom showcase.</p>

<p>The announcements set the scene for the leading international video game show that opens to the public in Cologne on Thursday for four days and is expected to draw more than 350,000 visitors.</p>

<p>The launch of the Borderlands 4 game in 2025 was one of the surprises of the opening night show. The games producers promised that players would "blast their way through hordes of enemies" in the latest version of the game that was adapted for cinema this year.</p>

<p>"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6" will be released on October 25. The latest in the series is set in the 1990s with a security team on a mission to target a senator and gain access to a top-secret site in Washington.</p>

<p>"Deadpool" film maker Tim Miller announced that his new "Secret Level" series based on several video games would be released on Amazon Prime in December. "It is our love letter to games," he said.</p>

<p>Another industry veteran Peter Molyneux said his latest project would be "Masters of Albion". Molyneux made Populous in 1989 and Black and White in 2001 but has been more low-key in recent years with several projects cancelled.</p>

<p>Swedish firm Machinegames said that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/indiana-jones-temple-of-doom-hat-sells-for-over-5-crores-6363901" target="_blank">"Indiana Jones</a> and the Great Circle" will be released on December 9. First announced for Xbox, the game will also come out on Playstation 5 next year, the company said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan serial killer 'Vampire', who confessed to killing 42 women, including his wife, has escaped from police custody, authorities have reported. <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kenyas-ted-bundy-who-killed-mutilated-42-women-including-his-wife-6151844 ">Collins Jumaisi Khalusha</a> was being held at a police station in Nairobi after his arrest in July after&nbsp;10 dismembered bodies and several body parts were discovered stuffed in plastic sacks in the Kware area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, the 33-year-old, along with 12 other inmates, escaped after cutting through wire mesh in their cells and scaling the perimeter wall, said Mohamed Amin, head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This was a high-value suspect who was to face serious charges. We are investigating the incident and will take action accordingly," Mr Amin told AP. He described the incident as "unfortunate".</p>

<p>Khalusha confessed to luring, murdering and mutilating 42 women, including his wife, between 2022 and his arrest in July. He would put their body parts in plastic bags and dump them in a garbage dump. Police found evidence of his crimes at his residence. Among the objects recovered from him were a machete, gloves and nylon sacks.</p>

<p>Detectives also found mobile phones and identity cards belonging to the victims. The evidence suggested a calculated and planned approach to the killings, earning him the nickname "Kenyan Ted Bundy" due to the similarities with the infamous American serial killer.</p>

<p>Forensic examination of the bodies revealed gruesome details. Dr Johansen Oduor, a government pathologist, reported that most bags contained severed limbs and torsos, with only one body found intact. None of the victims had bullet wounds, but one was strangled. DNA analysis has identified two victims, while many remain unidentified due to advanced decomposition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Khalusha was described as a "psychopathic serial killer with no respect for human life."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Khalusha's lawyer has maintained his client's innocence, claiming he was tortured and forced to confess. Two other suspects arrested in connection with the case will return to court on August 26.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's oldest person, Spain's Maria Branyas Morera, who was born in the United States and lived through two world wars, died Tuesday at the age of 117, her family said.</p>

<p>Guinness World Records had officially acknowledged Branyas's status as the world's oldest person in January 2023 following the death of French nun Lucile Randon aged 118.</p>

<p>"Maria Branyas has left us. She died as she wished: in her sleep, peacefully and without pain," her family wrote on her account on social network X. "We will always remember her for her advice and her kindness."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="ca">La Maria Branyas ens ha deixat. Ha mort com ella volia: mentre dormia, tranquil·la i sense dolor.<br />
Fa uns dies ens deia:<br />
“Un dia me n'aniré d'aquí. No tornaré a provar cafè, ni a menjar iogurt, ni a acaronar a la Fada..., deixaré també els meus records, les meves reflexions... ?</p>

<p>Branyas, who had lived for the last two decades in the Santa Maria del Tura nursing home in the town of Olot in the northeastern region of Catalonia, had warned in a post on Monday that she felt "weak".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="ca">“I quan la meva veu calli amb la mort, el meu cor et seguirà parlant d'amor” (Tagore).<br />
Em sento feble. S'acosta l'hora. No ploreu, no m'agraden les llàgrimes. I sobre tot no patiu per mi. Ja em coneixeu, allà on vagi serè feliç, doncs d'alguna manera us portaré sempre amb mi.</p>
— Super Àvia Catalana (@MariaBranyas112) <a href="https://twitter.com/MariaBranyas112/status/1825410650400842128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"The time is near. Don't cry, I don't like tears. And above all, don't suffer for me. Wherever I go, I will be happy," she added on the account which is run by her family.</p>

<p>In the wake of Branyas's death, the oldest living person in the world is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who was born on May 23, 1908 and is 116 years old, according to the US-based Gerontology Research Group.</p>

<p>Branyas, who lived through the 1918 flu, World War I and World War II and Spain's civil war, got Covid-19 in 2020 just weeks after ringing in her 113th birthday but made a full recovery.</p>

<h3><strong>'Endearing woman'</strong></h3>

<p>Her youngest daughter, Rosa Moret, once attributed her mother's longevity to "genetics".</p>

<p>"She has never gone to the hospital, she has never broken any bones, she is fine, she has no pain," Moret told regional Catalan television in 2023.</p>

<p>The head of the regional government of Catalonia, former health minister Salvador Illa, expressed his "heartfelt condolences" to Branyas's family in a message posted on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="ca">Ens ha deixat la Maria Branyas, l'àvia de Catalunya i la persona més gran del món. Perdem una dona entranyable, que ens ha ensenyat el valor de la vida i la saviesa dels anys.<br />

<p>"We lose an endearing woman, who has taught us the value of life and the wisdom of the years," he said, calling her "Catalonia's grandmother".</p>

<p>Branyas was born in San Francisco on March 4, 1907 shortly after her family moved to the United States from Mexico.</p>

<p>The entire family decided to return to their native Spain in 1915 as World War I was under way, which complicated the ship voyage across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The crossing was also marked by tragedy -- her father died from tuberculosis towards the end of the voyage, and his coffin was put into the sea.</p>

<h3><strong>'Completely lucid'</strong></h3>

<p>Branyas and her mother settled in Barcelona and in 1931 -- five years before the start of Spain's 1936-39 civil war -- she married a doctor.</p>

<p>The couple lived together for four decades until her husband died aged 72. She had three children, including one who has already died, 11 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>"I haven't done anything extraordinary, the only thing I did was live," Branyas told Catalan daily newspaper La Vanguardia in 2019.</p>

<p>Manel Esteller, part of a team of researchers from the University of Barcelona who studied Branyas's DNA to determine the source of her longevity told the daily Spanish newspaper ABC in October 2023 he was surprised by her good health.</p>

<p>"Her mind is completely lucid. She remembers with impressive clarity episodes from when she was only four years old, and she has no cardiovascular disease, which is common in the elderly. The only things she has are mobility and hearing problems. It's incredible," the genetics professor said.</p>

<p>The oldest verified person to have ever lived was Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment who died in 1997 at the age of 122 years and 164 days old.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has been hit with a class-action lawsuit in California federal court by three authors who say it misused their books and hundreds of thousands of others to train its AI-powered chatbot Claude.</p>

<p>The complaint, filed on Monday by writers and journalists Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson, said that Anthropic used pirated versions of their works and others to teach Claude to respond to human prompts.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Anthropic said on Tuesday that the company was aware of the lawsuit and assessing the complaint but declined to comment further, citing pending litigation. An attorney for the authors declined to comment.</p>

<p>The lawsuit joins several other high-stakes complaints filed by copyright holders including visual artists, news outlets and record labels over the material used by tech companies to train their generative artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p>Separate groups of authors have sued OpenAI and Meta Platforms over the companies' alleged misuse of their work to train the large-language models underlying their chatbots.</p>

<p>The case filed Monday is the second against Anthropic following a lawsuit brought by music publishers last year over its alleged misuse of copyrighted song lyrics to train Claude.</p>

<p>The authors said in their complaint that Anthropic has "built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books." Anthropic has drawn financial backing from sources including Amazon, Google and former cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, the authors' works were included in a dataset of pirated books that Anthropic used to train Claude.</p>

<p>The lawsuit requested an unspecified amount of monetary damages and an order permanently blocking Anthropic from misusing the authors' work.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

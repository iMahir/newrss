       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza ceasefire talks have been halted after three days of intense negotiations failed to produce a viable outcome, two Egyptian security sources said on Saturday, blaming Israel for lacking a genuine intent to reach agreement.</p>

<p>The sources, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that the behaviour of the Israeli mediators revealed "internal discord".</p>

<p>According to the sources, the Israeli delegation would give approvals on several conditions under discussion, but then come back with amendments or introduce new conditions that risked sinking the negotiations.</p>

<p>The sources said the mediators viewed the "contradictions, delays in responses, and the introduction of new terms contrary to what was previously agreed" as signs the Israeli side viewed the talks as a formality aimed at influencing public opinion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A witness has claimed that he saw the man - who fired at Donald Trump while he was addressing a campaign rally - positioned on the roof of a building near the event grounds.</p>

<p>Greg told the BBC that the shooter was armed with a rifle and had crawled on top of the building.</p>

<p>"The guy crawled up the building 50 feet from us. He had a rifle," he said.</p>

<p>He said that he informed police, Secret Service about a suspicious man on a roof with a rifle.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking to myself 'Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage'... the next thing you know, five shots ring out," he told the BBC.</p>

<p>The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally. 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd in defiance.</p>

<p>His campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.</p>

<p>"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear," Donald Trump later posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Trump said.</p>

<p>The apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump involved "multiple shots (fired) toward the stage from an elevated position outside the rally venue," the US Secret Service said, adding the shooter has been killed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Shots were fired at a campaign rally where former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump was addressing a gathering in Pennsylvania on Sunday. Trump, who was seen with blood on his ear, is "safe" after he was rushed off stage.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The 78-year-old leader was seen ducking on the podium as rapid shots rang out at the rally. He was quickly surrounded by Secret Service agents who escorted him off the stage. The Republican nominee was seen raising his fist and mouthing "fight, fight" as he was whisked off the stage.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Secret Service, a law enforcement agency that protects US political leaders, said that multiple shots were fired from an "elevated position" outside the rally venue.</li>
	<li>"I think that's something that we're going to have to figure out how he got there," Butler County district attorney Richard Goldinger told news agency AFP.</li>
	<li>According to local media, the suspected shooter has died. "Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said two people are dead, including an apparent shooter," The Washington Post said. One spectator died from injuries at a hospital while two others are in a critical condition.</li>
	<li>Taking to Truth Social, a social media company owned by Trump, the former US president said he was "shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</li>
	<li>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," he said.</li>
	<li>The attack has united US political leaders on both sides the spectrum with Trump's rival and US President Joe Biden condemning the attack, saying there was "no place in America for this kind of violence".</li>
	<li>"It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this. The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it," he said, adding that he will speak to Trump shortly.</li>
	<li>Former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have also slammed the "cowardly" attack.</li>
	<li>"Although we don't yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn't seriously hurt, and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics," Obama said.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump, in his first account of being shot at during a rally in Pennysylvania today said, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Trump, who was not seriously injured, said on his Truth Social site.</p>

<p>The former President is "fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," Trump Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>The incident took place about seven minutes into the rally in Butler, in western Pennsylvania, on Saturday. Thousands of Trump supporters were attending the rally when the shooting, which was captured live on news channels, happened.&nbsp; As the bangs ran out, the 78-year-old was seen ducking with the secret service surrounding him. He could be heard making a few comments on an audio feed from the stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd in defiance.</p>

<p>Trump said, “Let me get my shoes,” as he was escorted to the safe place.</p>

<p>The shocking incident happened two days before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump will formally become the party's nominee.</p>

<p>"I want to thank The United States Secret Service, and all of Law Enforcement, for their rapid response on the shooting that just took place in Butler, Pennsylvania. Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured," Trump said in his post.</p>

<p>"It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead. I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Political leaders on both sides of the aisle slammed the violence minutes after the Republican candidate was rushed off stage by the Secret Service with blood running down his face.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing at Rehoboth Beach in Delaware.</p>

<p>He said he hoped to speak with Trump "shortly."</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said on X: "We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt while delivering a speech at a rally in Pennsylvania today, when several gunshots were fired at him. The former US President was evacuated from stage by security agents and is said to be fine.</p>

<p>In a video that captures the moment the horrifying incident happened, Donald Trump can be seen delivering his speech amongst a big crowd of his supporters when several gunshots are heard. After the first couple of gunshots that took Donald Trump unawares, he can be seen touching his right ear before ducking to take cover behind the stage dias. The crowd behind him, visibly confused and scared, also ducks to dodge any bullet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Secret Service agents are quick to come to Trump's rescue as they cover and take him off the stage. Trump, whose right ear can be seen bleeding, raises his fist in the air while being evacuated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump is "fine" and is being checked at a medical facility, his campaign said after the attack. "President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility.

       <description><![CDATA[Republican candidate Donald Trump was evacuated from the stage at a rally on Saturday after what sounded like shots rang out at the event in Pennsylvania, according to AFP.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump was "safe" after he was rushed off stage when gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania, in a shocking incident that will fuel anxiety in the run-up to the 2024 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the bangs ran out, 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd in defiance.</p>

<p>The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.</p>

<p>"The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X.</p>

<p>His campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.</p>

<p>"President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in a bitter replay of their 2020 clash, said there was "no place for this kind of violence in America."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said in a statement, adding: "I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally."</p>

<p>The 81-year-old, staying at his house in Rehoboth, Delaware, gave a televised statement repeating his message, saying "we cannot be like this."</p>

<p>The shooting ramps up tension in a country already on edge about the prospect of unrest and political harassment before the November election.</p>

<p>It took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week.</p>

<p><strong>Shooter Dead</strong></p>

<p>"Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said two people are dead, including an apparent shooter," The Washington Post reported. A second bystander may also have been hit.</p>

<p>The rally in Butler, Pennsylvania descended into chaos after shots were heard and screams and shouts rang out.</p>

<p>"Let me get my shoes," Trump was heard saying on microphone, as security agents helped him back to his feet.</p>

<p>He turned back to the crowd and repeatedly raised his fist, as well as mouthing words that weren't immediately discernable, in what is set to become an iconic image.</p>

<p>Agents bundled the 78-year-old tycoon into an SUV, as he once more raised his fist to the crowd.</p>

<p>"This is an active crime scene," Secret Service officers told reporters, ordering them out of the area.</p>

<p>"We saw a lot of people go down, looking confused. I heard the shots," said John Yeykal from Franklin, Pennsylvania, who was attending his first Trump rally.</p>

<p>US politicians reacted with shock to the incident.</p>

<p>Former president Barack Obama said there was "absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy."</p>

<p>"Although we don't yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn't seriously hurt, and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics," he said.</p>

<p>Republican minority leader Mitch McConnell added: "Tonight, all Americans are grateful that President Trump appears to be fine after a despicable attack on a peaceful rally. Violence has no place in our politics."</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk reacted by quickly endorsing Trump.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk wrote on X, which he owns along with car manufacturer Tesla, as he shared a video of Trump pumping his fist while being escorted away.</p>

<p>The United States has a history of political violence and presidents, former presidents and candidates have tight security.</p>

<p>President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 while riding in his motorcade, and his brother Bobby Kenndy was shot dead in 1968. President Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt in 1981.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a rare occurrence, a 22-year-old man died of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) in Pakistan's Karachi, taking the tally of casualties to three this year, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>PAM is notably a disease of the central nervous system caused by Naegleria fowleri commonly called 'brain-eating' amoeba.</p>

<p>The victim was identified as Aurangzeb. He contracted the disease following a picnic with his friends at a farmhouse in Quaidabad on July 7, where the group had also gone for a swim. The next day, Aurangzeb started showing symptoms, which included nausea and fever.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the hospital on July 10, and the virus was confirmed on July 11. A resident of Cattle Colony, Aurangzeb, was under treatment at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), as per ARY News.</p>

<p>The youth had gone for a picnic with friends at a farmhouse in Quaidabad on July 7, where they swam in the pool. Aurangzeb started showing symptoms on July 8, including fever, headache, and nausea. He was admitted to the hospital on July 10, and the virus was confirmed on July 11.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Aurangzeb was the third victim of the deadly infection this year in the city, with the other two cases reported in Korangi and Malir earlier, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>The infection has claimed the lives of people across various regions of Pakistan earlier as well. At least 10 people died of Naegleria fowleri last year. The infection is found to be fatal in 98 per cent of the cases.</p>

<p>Naegleria, a free-living amoeba, is frequently found in warm, freshwater (lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil.</p>

<p>Only one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects humans.</p>

<p>It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body via the nose. This often occurs when people swim, dive, or submerge their heads in fresh water, such as lakes and rivers. The amoeba then travels up the nose and into the brain, where it damages brain tissue and causes PAM, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>After symptoms begin, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.</p>

<p>The earliest symptoms of PAM often appear approximately five days after infection and may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms may include a stiff neck, confusion, loss of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations, and coma.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI whistleblowers have filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, calling for an investigation over the artificial intelligence company's allegedly restrictive non-disclosure agreements, the Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing a copy of the letter sent to the SEC.</p>

<p>The whistleblowers alleged that OpenAI issued overly restrictive employment, severance, and nondisclosure agreements to its employees, which could have led to penalties against workers who raised concerns about OpenAI to federal authorities, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>The AI company made employees sign agreements that required them to waive their federal rights to whistleblower compensation, according to the letter seen by the Washington Post.</p>

<p>The agreements also required that employees get prior consent from the company if they wanted to disclose information to federal regulators, the newspaper said, adding that OpenAI did not create exemptions in the employee nondisparagement clauses for disclosing securities violations to the SEC.</p>

<p>An SEC spokesperson said in an emailed statement that it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible whistleblower submission.</p>

<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for a comment on the Washington Post report.</p>

<p>OpenAI's chatbots with generative AI capabilities, such as engaging in human-like conversations and creating images based on text prompts, have stirred safety concerns as AI models become powerful.</p>

<p>OpenAI in May formed a Safety and Security Committee that will be led by board members, including CEO Sam Altman, as it begins training its next artificial intelligence model.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Joe Biden's verbal gaffes, shaky voice, and other troubling signs have brought an intense focus on the US President's mental acuity, health experts are calling on him and rival Donald Trump to pass additional cognitive tests, even while warning against leaping to conclusions.</p>

<p>Such tests, experts said, could either help repudiate speculation that the 81-year-old president's mental state is in worrying decline -- or else confirm it -- and could enlighten voters on the mental abilities of Trump, who has had his own share of verbal lapses.</p>

<p>But reliable diagnoses, they caution, cannot be made from afar.</p>

<p>Since Biden's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump two weeks ago, the Democrat's campaign has faced fierce opposition. A growing number of officials in his own party are questioning his ability to lead the country for four more years.</p>

<p>And it didn't help when at a summit in Washington earlier this week Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.</p>

<p>Dennis Selkoe, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School, said the fundamental issue is whether Biden is suffering from "a normal age-related process" or "something that represents a neurologic disease."</p>

<p>"Making a mistake with a name is not automatically a sign of dementia or of Alzheimer's," he told AFP.</p>

<p>But Selkoe, who sees many patients with neurodegenerative problems, said Biden does seem to have the "appearance of an early Parkinson patient" -- including his slow, stiff gait and his low, sometimes barely audible voice, which could be a condition known as hypophonia.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed Tests</strong></p>

<p>In February, Biden underwent a complete physical exam. A published summary of its results indicated that an "extremely detailed neurologic exam" had ruled out Parkinson's.</p>

<p>However, no detail was provided on the exact nature of the tests or their results.</p>

<p>Could a neurological illness have taken root over just the past five months? If the exams in February had been comprehensive, Selkoe said, there should have been early signs of a nascent condition.</p>

<p>In an editorial in March, the scientific journal Lancet called for standardized procedures to examine the health of sitting and prospective presidents to insulate American voters from a "pestilence of speculation, misinformation, and slander."</p>

<p>Absent such reliable testing, "the US public remains beholden to voluntarily released reports from politicians' personal physicians," the journal said.</p>

<p>Jay Olshansky, an expert in aging at the University of Illinois at Chicago, sounded a similar note, saying, "We think the time has arrived for complete transparency."</p>

<p>He urged both major presidential candidates to pass a cognitive test, something former president Trump has frequently challenged Biden to do.</p>

<p>Several such exams, including those known as the MMSE and the MoCA, are available either for an initial screening or as part of a more comprehensive battery of tests.</p>

<p>Biden has said that he effectively passes a cognitive test every day, simply by carrying out his presidential duties.</p>

<p>But "I don't think it's the same," Selkoe said. Being able to conduct familiar tasks one has done for years is one thing, he said, while being able to repeat a list of words heard five minutes earlier, as some tests require, is another.</p>

<p>At a news conference Thursday, the President said he would be willing to take a new neurological exam if his doctors recommended it, but that "no one is suggesting that to me now."</p>

<p><strong>Stereotypes On Aging</strong></p>

<p>Aging changes one's brain, said Allison Sekuler, president of the Baycrest Academy, a hospital specializing in elderly care.</p>

<p>"Garbage is basically building up in the brain," she told AFP, adding that parts of the brain atrophy, or shrink, including parts important to memory.</p>

<p>An early phase known as "mild cognitive impairment" can sometimes develop into Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia, she said.</p>

<p>During their recent debate, both Biden and Trump -- who is 78 -- "exhibited some sort of issues in terms of being able to stay on track with a question," Sekuler said, recommending that both men undergo testing.</p>

<p>But, she added, "we're really only talking about one of them right now because that aligns with our stereotype of what aging is."</p>

<p>Olshansky also denounced what he called "raging" ageism, citing a recent magazine cover that used a walker as a symbol of the Biden-Trump race.</p>

<p>He noted that while there is a lower age limit for would-be US presidents -- they must be at least 35 -- there is no upper limit.</p>

<p>What he called "crystallized intelligence," or the ability to use past experience to improve one's reasoning skills, "gets stronger and stronger" with age.</p>

<p>Olshansky co-authored a 2020 study that gave Biden a 95 percent chance of surviving a first term, based on average life expectancy for someone of his age, plus personal risk factors.</p>

<p>But a similar calculation four years later, on a man now four years older, gave Biden a much lower probability of survival: just 75 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Biden mistakenly referred to Zelensky as Putin at a NATO summit in Washington on Thursday before correcting himself two seconds later.</p>

<p>"It's a mistake. I think the United States gave a lot of support to Ukrainians.

       <description><![CDATA[A couple in the UK have been slapped with a 1,200 pound (Rs1,30,079) fine by their local council after they tidied up the rubbish outside their home.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As responsible citizens, we should keep our streets and neighbourhoods clean by properly disposing of waste and participating in community clean-up efforts. However, in a bizarre event, a couple in the UK&nbsp;have been slapped with a 1,200 pound&nbsp; (Rs&nbsp;1,30,079) fine&nbsp;by their local council after they tidied up the rubbish outside their home, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldyny34kx4o">BBC</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple stated that their road had been plagued with "disgusting" litter for years. Taking matters into their own hands,&nbsp;Veronika Mike and her boyfriend Zoltan Pinter, from Stoke-on-Trent, decided to clean the garbage themselves. On April 29, they&nbsp;filled a cardboard box with food remnants and discarded packaging to stop it from scattering, placing it beside the bins in hopes that the council would take it away.</p>

<p>Days later on May 8, they received a fine from the council who said that they&nbsp;had failed ''to transfer household waste to an authorised authority''.&nbsp;Instead of gratitude, both received 600-pound fines each for their efforts.</p>

<p>The letter from the council read: "This is being issued to you as you failed in your legal duty to transfer controlled waste to an authorised person. Evidence has been obtained that the items in the picture provided originated from your home address."</p>

<p>It added, ''The allegation is not that you placed the waste at the location, but that you failed in your legal duty when transferring household items. It is the legal duty of domestic households to ensure the transfer of waste to authorised persons to stop flying tipping."</p>

<p>Mr Pinter paid the fine immediately while Ms Mike is paying it off in monthly instalments of 100 pounds.&nbsp;''We just wanted to clean our street and that's the thanks we get from the council. At first, I was very angry and I cried. I have volunteered for litter picking before, and I essentially did the same thing and got two £600 penalties for nothing. For the first few years, it was OK but after that, it's always been messy in the street. The bins are in front of our main entrance, it's disgusting,'' Ms Mike said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After their experience, the couple vowed to never clean their streets again "even if the rats come".</p>

<p>They have now <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/cleaning-and-fined">started a fundraiser to help pay off the fines</a> they received for cleaning the area. They have received an outpouring of support and have collected more than 2000 pounds on GoFundMe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>City councillor Amjid Wazir said the matter was considered resolved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police Officer Mark Castillo, who serves as the personal driver and bodyguard for San Antonio Police Chief William McManus, is facing allegations of sending sex-related text messages to a married woman while on duty. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/12/us-news/san-antonio-police-officer-mark-castillo-llegedly-sent-racy-texts-to-married-woman-while-working-as-chiefs-body-guard/">New York Post,</a></em> he allegedly sent explicit photos of himself to a married woman as he worked on his police chief's security detail.</p>

<p>He&nbsp;allegedly sent inappropriate messages to Laura Cisneros, 50, for nearly a month between late April and May 22, often during the hours of 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., his regular work schedule.</p>

<p>Arturo Cisneros, the husband of the woman who received the texts, filed a complaint with the department's Internal Affairs Unit after discovering the messages. Notably, Mr Cisneros knew the police officer&nbsp;through his wife's connections and had encountered him at various public events, including city council meetings and a local restaurant.</p>

<p>''Mmmm, I wish I could....slowly,” the cop said in one series of texts.''Stop. And lol you're going to get me in trouble. My computer is open and they keep seeing you come up,'' Ms Cisneros wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''OK, make sure to erase your messages. TTYL,'' Mr Castillo said in reply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Cisneros told<em> </em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksat.com/news/ksat-investigates/2024/07/09/member-of-mcmanus-security-team-sexted-with-woman-while-on-duty-records-show/"><em>KSAT</em> </a>that he read a month's worth of messages, which appeared to intensify sexually in the days before they were discovered. He eventually contacted family members to inform them that he had found disturbing material on his wife's phone. He then called 911 to report the affair between Mr Castillo and his wife.</p>

<p>The Internal Affairs Unit is now investigating the allegations to determine the extent of Mr Castillo's conduct and whether it violated departmental policies. Mr Castillo could face disciplinary action, which may include suspension or termination from the force.</p>

<p>Laura Cisneros told the outlet that she and Mr Castillo never had sexual intercourse, but they did make out in a car. She has since ended the relationship.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italian police said on Saturday they had freed 33 Indian farm labourers from slave-like working conditions in the northern Verona province and seized almost half a million euros ($545,300) from their two alleged abusers.</p>

<p>Labour exploitation is in the spotlight in Italy following an accident in June in which an Indian fruit picker died after his arm was severed by machinery.</p>

<p>In the latest case, police said the alleged gang masters, also from India, brought fellow nationals to Italy on seasonal work permits, asking them to pay 17,000 euros each and promising them a better future.</p>

<p>The migrants were given farm jobs, working seven days a week and 10-12 hours a day for just 4 euros an hour, which was entirely docked from them until they settled all their debts, the police said, describing the migrants' treatment as "slavery".</p>

<p>Some were asked to continue working for free to pay an additional 13,000 euros for a permanent work permit "which, in reality, would have never been given to them," the police statement said.</p>

<p>The alleged abusers were charged with crimes connected to slavery and labour exploitation, while the victims will be offered protection, work opportunities, and legal residency papers, the police said.</p>

<p>Like other European nations, Italy has growing labour shortages often filled via immigration, particularly in lower-paid jobs, and has a migrant work visa system that has faced cases of fraud.</p>

<p>The country also has a problem with labour law violations. According to 2021 data from national statistics office Istat, about 11% of Italian workers were employed illegally, rising to more than 23% in agriculture.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ronald Roland, a Brazilian drug lord, was apprehended by police after successfully evading capture for two years. Shockingly, the breakthrough in the case came from the social media activities of his wife, Andrezza De Lima, whose Instagram posts inadvertently revealed their location, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/09/brazillian-drug-lord-arrested-wife-reveals-location-instagram-21191163/">Metro </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, authorities had been monitoring De Lima's social media accounts for some time, waiting for a slip that would lead them to her husband. De Lima's posts, which included geo-tagged locations and identifiable landmarks, allowed law enforcement to track their whereabouts. Her posts showcased their lavish trips to various exotic destinations like Paris, Dubai, Maldives and Colombia and provided valuable information for the authorities.</p>

<p>Last week,&nbsp;De Lima posted a photo that included a distinct landmark, enabling police to pinpoint their exact location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was finally captured last Tuesday at his condominium in the coastal town of Guaruja on suspicion of running a sprawling money laundering scheme and supplying drug cartels in Mexico. According to local police, the drug lord made a fortune of 860.2 million pounds in five years which he shuffled through more than 100 shell companies and businesses.</p>

<p>His wife, who was also involved in his criminal activities, used her bikini shop in Guaruja to launder money, sometimes receiving deposits that surpassed 30,000 dollars in a single day.</p>

<p>Following his capture, Roland faces multiple charges related to drug trafficking, organized crime, and evading arrest.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he was also arrested in 2019 after his ex-wife similarly revealed their location on social media.&nbsp;His ex-wife had tagged the location where the couple was in a post on social media, leading to his arrest.</p>

<p>Reports said that police began tailing Roland in 2012 when he worked as an airline pilot. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sent a letter to Brazil's Federal Police, warning them about an investigation into a group of Brazilian pilots involved in "cocaine smuggling." Since receiving the DEA's letter, Roland became a person of interest in several Brazilian police operations targeting drug trafficking networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistan court overturned ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed over allegations of inciting riots.</p>

<p>Khan was slapped with a trio of convictions in the days before the February elections -- cases he says were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.</p>

<p>Those cases have now all been at least partially rolled back on appeal, with a treason conviction carrying a decade jail term overturned in April, and a 14-year graft sentence suspended in June, though the conviction still stands.</p>

<p>Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi had also been sentenced to seven years for allegedly marrying too soon after her divorce in a breach of Islamic law.</p>

<p>But Islamabad Additional District and Sessions Court judge Afzal Majoka announced Saturday that the "appeals of both Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are accepted".</p>

<p>Khan remains locked up, though, with a spokesman for his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party saying a court in eastern Lahore had approved his arrest over three cases alleging he incited riots in May 2023.</p>

<p>Spokesman Ahmed Janjua said in a statement it was "yet another gimmick to keep the illegal imprisonment prolonged".</p>

<p><strong>Courting Controversy</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this month a UN panel of experts found Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".</p>

<p>"Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose," it said, calling for his immediate release after nearly a year in jail.</p>

<p>Candidates loyal to Khan won the most seats in the national election but were kept from government by an alliance of military-backed rival parties.</p>

<p>Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted by a no-confidence vote after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.</p>

<p>In opposition he waged a campaign of defiance against the top generals, who directly ruled Pakistan for decades of its history, even accusing them of an assassination attempt that wounded him.</p>

<p>But the former cricket star's comeback campaign was hobbled by scores of legal cases, which analysts say were likely brought at the behest of the military establishment.</p>

<p>Gallup Pakistan analyst Bilal Gilani said the rolling back of the cases could suggest the establishment was softening its stance on Khan after the election secured their favoured government -- or that the courts were defying their attempts to keep him confined.</p>

<p>"It is an important judgment, because essentially now there are a limited number of cases left," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"Immediate release is quite impossible, but... the chances of release are getting clearer by the day," he added.</p>

<p>Khan was first briefly arrested in May 2023, sparking nationwide unrest from PTI supporters, some of which targeted military facilities.</p>

<p>The government and military cited the attacks as justification for a sweeping crackdown on PTI, which saw its senior leadership decimated by arrests and defections.</p>

<p>An anti-terrorism court in the eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday refused to grant him bail as police investigate his alleged role in the unrest, despite the fact he was behind bars at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Surviving The Crackdown</strong></p>

<p>PTI candidates were forced to stand as independents in the February 8 elections, which had been repeatedly delayed amid political chaos.</p>

<p>Khan's arrest and conviction for graft back in August 2023 meant he was barred from standing for office himself, confined to a cell in Adiala Jail south of the capital Islamabad.</p>

<p>Despite that, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they were blocked from power by a broad coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military.</p>

<p>Polling day itself was marred by allegations of vote-tampering amid a nationwide mobile internet blackout Islamabad said it orchestrated over security concerns.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catherine, Princess of Wales, will attend the Wimbledon Men's final in London on Sunday as she recovers after being diagnosed with cancer, her Kensington Palace office said.</p>

<p>"The Princess of Wales, Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club will attend the Gentlemen's Singles Final of The Championships, Wimbledon on Sunday 14th July," the palace said in a press release.</p>

<p>UK media also reported that the princess will present the trophy to the winner of the final, which will see Serbian all-time great Novak Djokovic go up against defending Spanish champion Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

<p>Catherine last month tentatively returned to UK public life for the first time since her diagnosis, attending a military parade in London to mark King Charles III's official birthday.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old future queen appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony, to cheers from the crowds below.</p>

<p>It came nearly three months after the princess revealed she was receiving chemotherapy treatment. She had not been seen at a public engagement since a Christmas Day service last year.</p>

<p>In a statement released at the time, Kate said she was "making good progress" with her treatment, which is set to last for several more months, but was "not out of the woods yet".</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to attending the King's Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer," the princess added.</p>

<p>Angela Perry, a teacher in her 50s from Reading, told AFP at the event that: "She's our future queen. She's so important," calling Kate's reemergence "reassuring".</p>

<p>Kate's cancer announcement came just weeks after it was disclosed that British head of state Charles had also been diagnosed with the condition.</p>

<p>Neither has revealed what type of cancer they have.</p>

<p>Charles, 75, was given the green light to resume public duties in April after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by his progress.</p>

<p>He has since attended commemoration events in northern France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day.</p>

<p>Royal officials are keen to manage expectations about Kate's gradual return to the public eye and have maintained that her appearances will depend on her treatment and recovery.</p>

<p>Kate explained in her statement that she had "good days and bad days" and was "taking each day as it comes".</p>

<p>The King's sister, Princess Anne, took on more duties during the absences of Charles and Catherine but was herself recently put out of action after being hospitalised for five days following an incident involving a horse.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, returned to public duties on Friday, weeks after she was treated for a concussion.</p>

<p>Catherine and her husband William celebrated her return, writing on social media: "Super trooper! So great to see you back so soon!", signing it "W and C x".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

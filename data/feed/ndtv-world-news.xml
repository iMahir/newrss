       <description><![CDATA[Hamas called on the United States Thursday to "exert real pressure" on Israel to reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was no deal in the making.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas called on the United States Thursday to "exert real pressure" on Israel to reach a Gaza ceasefire agreement as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was no deal in the making. The two sides have traded blame over stalling talks for a ceasefire and hostage exchange as Netanyahu faces pressure to seal a deal following the deaths of six Gaza captives.</p>

<p>Hamas's Qatar-based lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya called on the US to "exert real pressure on Netanyahu and his government" and "abandon their blind bias" towards Israel.</p>

<p>But Netanyahu said there is "not a deal in the making".</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it's not close but we will do everything we can to get them to the point where they do make a deal," he told US media.</p>

<p>Netanyahu insists that Israel must retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border to prevent weapons smuggling to Hamas, whose October 7 attack on Israel started the war.</p>

<p>Hamas is demanding complete Israeli withdrawal from the area and on Thursday said Netanyahu's position "aims to thwart reaching an agreement".</p>

<p>The Palestinian militant group says a new deal is unnecessary because they agreed months ago to a truce outlined by Biden.</p>

<p>"We warn against falling into the trap of Netanyahu... who uses negotiations to prolong the aggression against our people," Hamas said in a statement.</p>

<p>Washington has been pushing a proposal it says could bridge gaps between the warring sides, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying "90 percent is agreed".</p>

<p>"It's really incumbent on both parties to get to yes on these remaining issues," Blinken said during a visit to Haiti.</p>

<h2>'Make them' sign deal</h2>

<p>At Israeli protests in several cities this week, Netanyahu's critics have blamed him for hostages' deaths, saying he has refused to make necessary concessions for striking a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p>"We'll do everything so that all hostages will be with us. And if the leaders don't want to sign a deal, we'll make them," said Gil Dickmann, cousin of Carmel Gat, one of the six hostages whose bodies were found in a Gaza tunnel last week.</p>

<p>Dickmann took part in a rally at Tel Aviv on Thursday evening, where crowds of demonstrators carried symbolic coffins in a procession, an AFP journalist reported.</p>

<p>Key mediator Qatar has said that Israel's approach was "based on an attempt to falsify facts and mislead world public opinion by repeating lies".</p>

<p>Such moves "will ultimately lead to the demise of peace efforts", Qatar's foreign ministry warned.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack by Hamas resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead. Scores were released during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has so far killed at least 40,878 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN rights office.</p>

<p>Israel kept up its bombardment overnight into Friday, with an AFP correspondent reporting a huge explosion in the east of Gaza City.</p>

<p>Six people were killed and others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a house southeast of the city, Gaza's civil defence agency said Friday.</p>

<h2>West Bank deadly assault</h2>

<p>While Israel presses its Gaza offensive, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the military should use its "full strength" against Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>"These terrorist organisations that have various names, whether in Nur al-Shams, Tulkarem, Faraa or Jenin, must be wiped out," he said, referring to cities and refugee camps where an Israeli military operation is underway.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Thursday its aircraft "conducted three targeted strikes on armed terrorists" in the Tubas area, which includes Faraa refugee camp.</p>

<p>A strike on a car killed five men aged 21 to 30 and wounded two others, the territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military handed over the dead body of a 17-year-old, after medics were prevented from reaching him when he was wounded.</p>

<p>Israel has killed at least 36 Palestinians across the northern West Bank since its assault there started on August 28, according to figures released by the health ministry, including children and militants.</p>

<p>One Israeli soldier was killed in Jenin, where the majority of the Palestinian fatalities have been.</p>

<h2>Polio vaccination drive</h2>

<p>Israel's bombardment of Gaza has left the territory in ruins, with the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure blamed for the spread of disease.</p>

<p>The humanitarian crisis has led to Gaza's first polio case in 25 years, prompting a massive vaccination effort launched Sunday with localised "humanitarian pauses" in fighting.</p>

<p>Nearly 200,000 children in central Gaza have received a first dose, the World Health Organization said, and a second stage got underway Thursday in the south, before medics move north.</p>

<p>Louise Wateridge, spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), warned however that the vaccination drive in the south may not reach all children, as some do not reside in the designated zones where Israel has agreed not to strike.</p>

<p>The campaign aims to fully vaccinate more than 640,000 children, with second doses due in about four weeks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia's Winder saw two teachers and two 14-year-old students being killed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The father of the 14-year-old suspected in a Georgia school shooting that killed four people on Wednesday has been arrested with the officials saying he "knowingly allowed his son to have the murder weapon. Colin Gray, 54, was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder, and eight counts of cruelty to children, officials said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"These charges stem from Gray knowingly allowing his son Colt to possess a weapon," Chris Hosey, the director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, told a press conference.</p>

<p>His son, Colt Gray, has been charged with four counts of felony murder and would be tried as an adult, Hosey said.</p>

<p>The shooting at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gunfire-reported-at-high-school-in-us-georgia-currently-under-hard-lockdown-news-agency-afp-6491595" target="_blank">Apalachee High School in Winder</a> saw two teachers - Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53 - and two 14-year-old students - Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo - being killed. Two teachers and seven students were also injured in the attack.</p>

<p>Investigators say that Gray used an "AR platform style weapon," or semiautomatic rifle, to carry out the shooting.</p>

<p>CNN reported that Colin purchased the gun as a holiday present for his son in December 2023. The rifle was purchased at a local gun store as a Christmas present, a CNN report said.</p>

<p>The suspect was interviewed by law enforcement last year over online threats about committing a school shooting.</p>

<p>The US has witnessed hundreds of shootings inside schools and colleges in the past two decades, which has intensified the debate over gun laws in the country.</p>

<h3><strong>"We've Gotta Stop It"</strong></h3>

<p>US Vice President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/time-to-end-this-epidemic-of-us-gun-violence-says-kamala-harris-6492567" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a>, the Democratic Party nominee for president, called the Georgia shooting a "senseless tragedy."</p>

<p>"We've gotta stop it. We have to end this epidemic of gun violence," she said at a campaign event.</p>

<p>The White House said in a statement that US President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting "and his administration will continue coordinating with federal, state, and local officials as we receive more information."</p>

<p>"Jill and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short due to more senseless gun violence and thinking of all of the survivors whose lives are forever changed," Biden said in a statement, calling on Republicans to work with Democrats to pass "common-sense gun safety legislation."</p>

<p>Former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-georgia-school-shooter-sick-and-deranged-monster-6492697" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, the Republican nominee for president, called it a "tragic" event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster," he wrote on social media.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Now that Tala is gone, her parents and brothers are left to marvel at their bad luck, with the strike landing during one of the rare occasions Hussam let one of his children go outside.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At first Hussam Salah Abu Ajwa resisted letting his daughter out to play, but finally he relented so she could zip around on her pink skates near their Gaza City home.</p>

<p>Within two minutes he heard the boom of a strike that made the girl, 10-year-old Tala Abu Ajwa, the latest child fatality in the ongoing war in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She begged me and said, 'Please, Daddy, let me go out'. I felt sad because she wanted to play with the girls" in the neighbourhood, Hussam told AFP after the strike on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the blast he raced outside, but "when I reached the flat that had been bombed, I found her among the rubble", he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I recognised her by her roller skates, the only thing that was visible."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Details of the strike were unclear.</p>

<p>A photograph of Tala has since circulated widely on social media, the skates with white velcro straps and pink wheels sticking out from underneath a white cloth covering her dead body.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mass wartime displacement and destruction of schools have deprived children across the Gaza Strip of chances for recreation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 70 percent of schools operated by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, have been destroyed or damaged, agency chief Philippe Lazzarini said on X this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The longer children stay out of school, the higher the risk of a lost generation, fuelling resentment &amp; extremism," Lazzarini said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"With no ceasefire, children are likely to fall prey to exploitation including child labour and recruitment into armed groups."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>'We don't want wars, Mum'</h2>

<p>For Tala, the problem was more basic: she simply did not like being cooped up indoors all the time, Hussam said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was cheerful and always liked to laugh, and loved to get out of the house," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She had lots of dreams. She was always asking me for lots of things and I responded to her requests. She told me. 'I want a pair of skates', so I brought them for her."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians and including hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 40,878 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that Tala is gone, her parents and brothers are left to marvel at their bad luck, with the strike landing during one of the rare occasions Hussam let one of his children go outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She used to say to me, 'Why don't we live like all the other children in the world? I wish we could live a peaceful life. We don't want wars, Mum. I've had enough of wars'," her mother, Umm Tala, recalled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was one of the best pupils and she excelled, she was very intelligent. She used to say to me: 'I'd like to be able to go to the park and play.' She's dead and so are her wishes."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the "Nostradamus" of US Presidential Polls, predicted that Kamala Harris would win the White House in November's poll.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the "Nostradamus" of US Presidential Polls, has accurately predicted the outcome of nine of the last 10 presidential elections. Now, the expert has given his final verdict about the 2024 race. On Thursday, Mr Lichtman predicted that Kamala Harris would win the White House in November's poll. In a video for the <em>New York Times</em>, he said that the US vice president, who became the Democratic party's nominee after Joe Biden withdrew in July, would defeat former US President Donald Trump on November 5 and keep the White House in Democratic hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The Democrats will hold on to the White House, and Kamala Harris will be the next president of the United States - at least, that's my prediction for this race," Mr Lichtman said in the video, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/05/harris-election-allan-lichtman" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian.</em></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 77-year-old explained that he based his prediction on a historical index model he dubs the "Keys to the White House". This unique system analyses the political landscape through the lens of 13 true-false statements focused on the incumbent president's party. If six or more of the statements are false, then the challenger - in this case, Mr Trump - is predicted to win.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to him, Ms Harris has the advantage in eight "keys" while Mr Trump has three.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The 13 keys to the White House as designed by Mr Lichtman are as follows:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Party Mandate: </strong>Post-midterm elections, the incumbent party secures more US House of Representatives seats than in the previous midterms.</li>
	<li><strong>Nomination Contest:</strong> There's no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.</li>
	<li><strong>Incumbency: </strong>The sitting president represents the incumbent party.</li>
	<li><strong>Third-party Factor:</strong> There's no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign.</li>
	<li><strong>Short-term Economic Stability:</strong> The economy doesn't face recession during the election period.</li>
	<li><strong>Long-term Economic Growth: </strong>Real per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms.</li>
	<li><strong>Policy Shift: </strong>The incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Stability:</strong> There's no prolonged social unrest throughout the term.</li>
	<li><strong>Scandal-Free: </strong>The incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.</li>
	<li><strong>Foreign/Military Mishaps: </strong>No significant failures occur in foreign or military affairs under the incumbent administration.</li>
	<li><strong>Foreign/Military Triumphs: </strong>The incumbent administration achieves significant successes in foreign or military matters.</li>
	<li><strong>Incumbent Charm: </strong>The incumbent party's candidate possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status.</li>
	<li><strong>Challenger Appeal: </strong>The opposing party's candidate lacks charisma or national hero status.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mr Lichtman explained that Mr Harris gained from the absence of a strong third-party candidate following the demise of Robert F Kennedy Jr's independent campaign, positive short- and long-term economic indicators, major legislative achievements enacted by the Biden administration, and the absence of social unrest or scandal attached to the White House. According to the expert, Ms Harris was also favoured in not having to undergo a party nomination battle to succeed Mr Biden, as other candidates quickly lined up to endorse her before last month's Democratic national convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House," Mr Lichtman said in the video.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This leaves Kamala Harris winning the White House, the expert continued. "At least that's my prediction for this race, but the outcome is up to you, so get out and vote," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Lichtman has been forecasting the results of US presidential elections since 1984 and claims to have accurately predicted all but one - George W Bush's contested triumph over Al Gore in 2000. The expert also correctly predicted that Donald Trump would win the 2016 election over Democrat Hillary Clinton. He even forecasted that Mr Trump would be impeached during his presidency - which he was, twice.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Barack Obama's half-brother Abon'go Malik Obama declared that he would be voting for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential elections.</p>

<p>“I am Malik Obama. I'm a registered Republican and I'm voting for President Donald Trump,” he wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am Malik Obama. I'm a registered Republican and I'm voting for President Donald Trump.</p>
— Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObamaMalik/status/1831336318422413511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Obama's brother has supported Trump against Democratic presidential candidates that the former president backed in the last two elections, including Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking to The New York Post, Malik Obama said that he liked Trump because he "speaks from the heart."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Make America Great Again is a great slogan, I would like to meet him [Trump]," he said.</p>

<p>In the past, Obama's half-brother has labelled him a "deep disappointment" and blamed Hillary Clinton for his departure from the party.</p>

<p>Malik Obama, who has also been a featured guest of the Trump campaign in 2016, said he was "110% still with Trump".</p>

<p>An accountant by profession, Malik Obama was the best man at Obama's wedding to Michelle Robinson in 1992 and even visited the White House during his half-brother's time in office.</p>

<p>"I stuck with Barack Obama all through his presidency, until I realized he was all about himself," Malik posted on X in 2022. "That's when I ditched him for President Trump.</p>

<p>The two half-brothers&nbsp;held a cordial relationship before Obama. Still, they had a falling out after Malik Obama launched a charity called the Barack H. Obama Foundation but failed to register it and lied about it being a tax-exempt organisation.</p>

<p>He also added to the conspiracy theory, spread largely by Donald Trump, that claimed that former president Obama was not born in the US and was a Kenyan citizen. At the time, Malik Obama shared a fake image of a birth certificate, dated from before the 1964 establishment of the Republic of Kenya, that purportedly showed his half-brother was born outside the US.</p>

<p>Malik Obama has been vocal on social media about his conservative views on same-sex marriage and abortion. "We Want More Babies. My President," he posted on X last month after Trump pledged that if elected his government would pay for free IVF treatments</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a forecast that went largely unnoticed, Yigal Carmon, a prominent counter-terrorism expert and founder of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), predicted Hamas' violent invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, a month before it occurred. His article, published on August 31, 2023, titled "Signs of Possible War in September-October," was one of the few open-source warnings that accurately pinpointed the specific timeframe of the assault.</p>

<p>On October 7, 2023, the Palestinian group Hamas, backed by Iran, launched a devastating invasion into southern Israel, resulting in one of the deadliest attacks in the country's recent history. The violence left nearly 1,200 dead, and over 250 individuals abducted. The massacre rattled Israel and shocked the world.</p>

<p>In its counter-offensive, Israel launched wave after wave of attacks into Gaza, the besieged Palestinian territory, resulting in the deaths of over 40,000 people, mostly civilians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Lately there have been growing indications that a war against Israel may break out in September or October 2023. The trigger may be spiraling violent clashes resulting in many casualties, or the use of new weapons leading to many fatalities on the Israeli side, in the face of which Israel will be unable to suffice with its regular counterterrorism measures," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.memri.org/reports/signs-possible-war-september-october">Carmon wrote in August 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While neither Hamas nor Hizbullah are eager to start a comprehensive confrontation with Israel, such a confrontation could result from an uncontrolled deterioration on the ground or from the use of new and unusually deadly weapons by these movements," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His August prediction stemmed from rising tensions on Israel's borders, coupled with Hezbollah's increasing territorial demands and challenges to Israel's sovereignty. In his analysis, Carmon warned that while neither Hamas nor Hezbollah seemed eager for an all-out war, the volatile conditions on the ground could easily spiral into a larger conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"During the Jewish holidays in September and October, Jews are likely to visit the Al-Aqsa compound, as happens every year. Hamas and Hizbullah spokesmen have stressed that this could lead to a regional war," he wrote.</p>

<p>As the devastating regional conflict continues, calls for a ceasefire have been largely unsuccessful. A series of meetings in Qatar between stakeholders on both sides have yielded no tangible solution&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump laid out his economic vision for the country on Thursday during a speech at the New York Economic Club.</p>

<p>Here are the new proposals Trump outlined:</p>

<p><strong>SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND</strong></p>

<p>Trump said if he is elected he would create a sovereign wealth fund to invest in "great national endeavors," including major infrastructure projects such as highways and airports.</p>

<p>He said the fund would be created "through tariffs and other intelligent things" but gave no details.</p>

<p><strong>TAX CUTS FOR DOMESTIC PRODUCERS</strong></p>

<p>Trump pledged to reduce the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S.</p>

<p>While he had already said he wanted to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, he had not previously tied that lower rate to keeping manufacturing inside the country.</p>

<p>Trump slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% during his 2017-2021 presidency and in June he vowed to cut it further.</p>

<p>He repeated his proposal to eliminate taxes on income from tips, an idea he first floated in June to appeal to service workers. Current law requires employees to report their tips as income.</p>

<p><strong>ELON MUSK AS EFFICIENCY CZAR</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he would set up an independent government efficiency panel headed by billionaire supporter Elon Musk to root out waste in the federal government. He did not detail how the body would function but said it would develop a plan to root out "fraud and improper payments" within six months of being formed.</p>

<p>The idea is not novel. Other politicians have proposed similar investigative bodies, and Republican President Ronald Reagan set up the Grace Commission to do the same thing during his 1981-89 presidency. Many agencies are already dedicated to investigating fraud and inefficiency within the federal government, including the Government Accountability Office and dozens of separate inspectors general.</p>

<p><strong>ENERGY EMERGENCY</strong></p>

<p>Trump pledged to issue a national emergency declaration to boost domestic energy supply. He said he would use it to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles holding up new energy projects.</p>

<p>Presidents can use emergency declarations to invoke a suite of special powers, though attempts to help energy companies skirt regulators would likely be challenged in the courts and in Congress.</p>

<p><strong>BANNING MORTGAGES FOR MIGRANTS LIVING IN THE U.S. ILLEGALLY</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he would ban mortgages for migrants living illegally in California, after claiming without evidence that they were driving up housing costs. He did not provide specifics on how he would enact such a ban and did not say whether the ban would apply beyond California. Banks can legally provide mortgages to undocumented migrants, but do so infrequently.</p>

<p><strong>HOUSING AFFORDABILITY</strong></p>

<p>Trump pledged to open up portions of federal land for large-scale housing construction, with zones that will be "ultra low-tax and ultra low-regulation."</p>

<p>While he had previously said he would open federal lands to new housing construction, this appeared to be the first time he pledged to create a special tax and regulatory regime to draw homebuilders to those areas.</p>

<p>Trump has previously spoken against proposals to loosen local zoning restrictions that prevent apartments, duplexes and other forms of affordable housing from being built in neighborhoods reserved for single family houses.</p>

<p>The Republican Party's platform calls for boosting home ownership through tax breaks and eliminating regulations, though it does not outline specifics.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Protests roiled college campuses in spring, with students opposing Israel's military offensive in Gaza and demanding institutions stop doing business with companies that support Israel.</p>

<p>Republicans have said the protests show some Democrats are antisemites who support chaos. Protest groups say that authorities have unfairly labeled their criticism of Israel's policies as <span class="marknrqqxngv7" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">antisemitic</span>.</p>

<p>The Association of American <span class="marky5uab93gf" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Universities</span>, which <span class="mark2ex3n7ckf" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">says</span> it represents some 69 leading U.S. <span class="marky5uab93gf" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">universities</span>, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>In the United States, the federal government does not directly accredit <span class="marky5uab93gf" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">universities</span> but has a role in <span class="mark8nihgbzm5" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">over</span>seeing the mostly private organizations that give <span class="markp9r9alkmt" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">accreditation</span> to <span class="markizst5z7l5" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">colleges</span>.</p>

<p>In his speech, <span class="markf09vr31ir" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Trump</span> also said <span class="markvuw7cw51u" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">he</span> would ban refugee resettlement from "terror infested" areas like Gaza and arrest "pro-Hamas thugs" who engage in vandalism, an apparent reference to the college student protesters.</p>

<p>Under both <span class="markf09vr31ir" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Trump</span> and Biden, similar numbers of Palestinians were admitted to the U.S. as refugees. From fiscal year 2017-2020, the U.S. accepted 114 Palestinian refugees, according to U.S. State Department data, compared with 124 Palestinian refugees from fiscal year 2021 to July 31 of this year.</p>

<p>While <span class="markf09vr31ir" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Trump</span> sketched out few concrete Middle Eastern policy proposals for a second term, <span class="markvuw7cw51u" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">he</span> painted a potential Harris presidency in cataclysmic terms for Israel.</p>

<p>"You're going to be abandoned <span class="mark1y3bae7ex" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">if</span> she becomes president. And I think you need to explain that to your people... You're not going to have an Israel <span class="mark1y3bae7ex" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">if</span> she becomes president," <span class="markf09vr31ir" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Trump</span> said without providing evidence for such a claim.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about <span class="markf09vr31ir" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">Trump</span>'s speech.</p>

<p>Harris has <span class="markvuw7cw51u" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">he</span>wed closely to President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic Party that Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the <span class="markvuw7cw51u" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">he</span>avy Palestinian death toll in Gaza.</p>

<p>She has, however, called for a ceasefire in Gaza, calling the situation there "devastating."</p>

<p><span class="markvuw7cw51u" data-markjs="true" data-ogab="" data-ogac="" data-ogsb="" data-ogsc="" style="">He</span>alth authorities in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli assault on the enclave since the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas.</p>

<p>Some 1,200 Israelis were killed in Hamas' surprise attack and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The subsequent assault on Gaza has displaced nearly its entire 2.3 million population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The teen faces four felony murder counts after allegedly killing two fellow pupils, also aged 14, as well as two teachers at Apalachee High School in the southern state of Georgia on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Citing unnamed sources, CNN reported that the gun used in the shooting -- which it described as an AR 15-style assault rifle -- had been purchased for the teenager by his father as a holiday gift.</p>

<p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigation had said the suspect would be charged as an adult. It said that he would appear in court on Friday, and that additional charges are expected.</p>

<p>"The investigation into the shooting at Apalachee HS is still active &amp; ongoing," the agency said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"This is day 2 of a very complex investigation &amp; the integrity of the case is paramount," it continued, adding that all four victims would be autopsied on Thursday.</p>

<p>School shootings are a shockingly regular occurrence in the United States, where guns outnumber people and regulations on purchasing even powerful military-style rifles are lax.</p>

<p>Parental responsibility in mass shootings, particularly by minors, has come increasingly under the spotlight in recent months.</p>

<p>"How could you have an assault rifle, a weapon in a house, not locked up and knowing your kid knows where it is?" lamented President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters in Wisconsin on Thursday.</p>

<p>"You've got to hold parents accountable if they let their child have access to these guns."</p>

<p>In April, the parents of a teenager who killed four people in a school shooting in Michigan were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison, in an unprecedented and closely watched case.</p>

<p>Jennifer Crumbley, 46, and her husband James, 47, were the first parents of a school shooter convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the United States for the actions of their child.</p>

<p>Polls show a majority of voters favor stricter controls on the use and purchase of firearms, but a powerful gun ownership lobby is opposed to additional restrictions and lawmakers have repeatedly failed to act.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telegram founder and chief executive Pavel Durov on Thursday hit out at France for arresting and charging him last month over the publication of extremist and illegal content on the popular messaging app.</p>

<p>In a lengthy post on Telegram, his first comment since his arrest, Durov said it was "surprising" he was being held responsible for other people's content.</p>

<p>"Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach," he said.</p>

<p>He also lashed out at claims that "Telegram is some sort of anarchic paradise" as "absolutely untrue", insisting: "We take down millions of harmful posts and channels every day."</p>

<p>He denied accusations from France that Paris had not received responses from Telegram to its requests, saying he had personally helped French authorities "establish a hotline with Telegram to deal with the threat of terrorism in France".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Growing pains' -</strong></p>

<p>But striking a more conciliatory tone at the end of his message, Durov said Telegram's soaring user numbers -- which he now put at 950 million worldwide -- "caused growing pains that made it easier for criminals to abuse our platform".</p>

<p>"That's why I made it my personal goal to ensure we significantly improve things in this regard," he said, adding that this was being worked out "internally" and more details would be shared in the future.</p>

<p>"I hope that the events of August will result in making Telegram -- and the social networking industry as a whole -- safer and stronger."</p>

<p>He said that when Telegram could not agree on the "right balance between privacy and security" with local regulators then "we are ready to leave that country".</p>

<p>Durov, 39, was charged after four days under arrest in France on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on Telegram.</p>

<p>He has received support from fellow tech tycoon and chief executive of X, Elon Musk, who posted comments under the hashtag #FreePavel.</p>

<p>Durov was arrested on August 24 at Le Bourget airport outside Paris after arriving aboard a private jet and questioned in the subsequent days by investigators.</p>

<p>He was granted conditional release on a bail of five million euros ($5.5 million) and on the condition that he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remaining in France.</p>

<p>An enigmatic figure who rarely speaks in public, Durov is a citizen of Russia, France and the United Arab Emirates, where Telegram is based.</p>

<p>Forbes magazine estimates his current fortune at $15.5 billion, though he proudly promotes the virtues of an ascetic life that includes ice baths and not drinking alcohol or coffee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday urged both Israel and Hamas to finalize a Gaza truce, standing by US assessments that 90 percent of a deal was ready.</p>

<p>Blinken said that the United States would be offering further ideas in coming days through mediators Egypt and Qatar in hopes of sealing an agreement.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview with Fox News on Thursday denied a US official's assessment that 90 percent of a deal was ready, saying "it's not close."</p>

<p>But Blinken repeated the assessment at a news conference during a visit to Haiti, saying, "I think based on what I've seen, 90 percent is agreed."</p>

<p>"It's really incumbent on both parties to get to yes on these remaining issues," Blinken said.</p>

<p>"As close as I believe we are to getting a ceasefire agreement, every day that goes by where it is not finalized and the parties don't say, 'yes, period,' is a day in which something else happens, and there is an intervening event which simply pushes things off and runs the risk of derailing what is a pretty fragile apple cart," he said.</p>

<p>The United States in recent weeks has pushed a proposal to bridge gaps between both sides, which include disagreements over Netanyahu's insistence on leaving some Israeli troops on the border between Gaza and Egypt.</p>

<p>Blinken said he believed that Netanyahu, who has put a top priority on normalizing diplomatic relations with Arab states, could still reach a historic deal with Saudi Arabia, the guardian of Islam's two holiest shrines.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, pleaded guilty Thursday to all nine tax charges he faced, without reaching a deal with prosecutors.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>oe Biden's son Hunter pleaded guilty in a tax evasion trial on Thursday, without reaching the deal he had sought with prosecutors, in a case that has been an embarrassment for the US president.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old admitted nine counts related to failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes over the past decade, money that prosecutors said he splurged instead on luxury living, sex workers and a drug habit.</p>

<p>The pleas came on the day jury selection for a trial had been due to start, and hours after Biden had offered to plead guilty in the hope of striking a deal that might keep him out of prison.</p>

<p>But no deal materialized and Biden made the pleas in open court.</p>

<p>US District Judge Mark Scarsi set sentencing for December 16. Biden faces up to 17 years in prison and a fine in excess of $1 million.</p>

<p>A trial had been expected to re-hash sordid details of a life that the defendant and his family -- including the president -- have long acknowledged had gone off the rails.</p>

<p>"I will not subject my family to more pain, more invasions of privacy and needless embarrassment," US media reported Biden saying in a statement.</p>

<p>"Prosecutors were focused not on justice but on dehumanizing me for my actions during my addiction."</p>

<p>Biden has already spent a chunk of 2024 in court, having been convicted in Delaware of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- an act that is a felony.</p>

<p>He has yet to be sentenced for that crime, and could face up to 25 years imprisonment.</p>

<p>President Biden has the power to pardon his son, but has said he would not do so.</p>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday that his position had not changed.</p>

<p>"It is still very much a 'no'," she said.</p>

<p><strong>- Political battle -</strong></p>

<p>Lawyers for Biden have said he was only being brought before the court because of who he is.</p>

<p>"They want to slime him because that is the whole purpose," Biden's attorney Mark Geragos reportedly said during an August hearing in which he accused prosecutors of attempted character assassination.</p>

<p>Biden's defense team has argued that the non-payment of taxes was an oversight in a life wrought chaotic by a spiraling drug addiction and the trauma of losing his older brother, Beau, to a brain tumor in 2015.</p>

<p>Biden has paid the back taxes, as well as penalties levied by authorities, and had previously reached a plea deal that would have kept him out of jail.</p>

<p>That agreement fell apart at the last minute, and Biden is understood to have been trying to reach another since then.</p>

<p>That has been difficult for prosecutors, whose every move in this election year is being scrutinized by Republicans, who charge the defendant is being treated leniently because he is the president's son.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden has for years been a foil for his father's political opponents, who have sought -- without producing evidence -- to smear the family as a group of criminals who have gained wealth and power because of Joe Biden's career.</p>

<p>The elder Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Kamala Harris has taken much of the zeal out of the Republican drive to make an example out of his son.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, prosecutors appeared unwilling to cut him any slack.</p>

<p>An attempt on Thursday morning by Hunter Biden to enter a so-called "Alford plea," whereby he would admit guilt because of the high probability of conviction but maintain his innocence, was rebuffed.</p>

<p>"I want to make crystal clear: the US opposes an Alford plea," prosecutor Leo Wise told the court. "Hunter Biden is not innocent, he is guilty."</p>

<p>In his statement, Biden, who lives in Malibu, said his drug addiction was "not an excuse, but it is an explanation for some of my failures at issue in this case."</p>

<p>"I have been clean and sober for more than five years because I have had the love and support of my family.</p>

<p>"I can never repay them for showing up for me and helping me through my worst moments.</p>

<p>"But I can protect them from being publicly humiliated for my failures."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump announced Thursday that if elected president he would appoint billionaire Elon Musk to lead an audit of government spending and implement "drastic" reform.</p>

<p>Trump said that at Musk's suggestion, he would "create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government," with the Tesla CEO as its chief.</p>

<p>Trump, who is known for hyperbole and at times outright fiction, told the Economic Club of New York the effort could save "trillions and trillions of dollars."</p>

<p>"This commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months," Trump claimed.</p>

<p>Musk -- who has said he previously voted for Democratic candidates -- has thrown his weight and considerable wealth behind Trump since a gunman tried to assassinate the former president at a rally in July.</p>

<p>Musk has a history of sparring with regulators, as when the Securities and Exchange Commission required vetting of his Twitter posts following 2018 tweets that the agency characterized as "false and misleading."</p>

<p>Other Musk initiatives, such as his pursuit of autonomous driving technology, also face oversight by government agencies.</p>

<p>Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, an NGO, said Trump's proposal to appoint Musk was still too vague to really know if there is a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>But he said Musk should recuse himself from policy influence on decisions that directly affect his businesses, such as government contracts for SpaceX or policy actions on autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Libowitz also thought it was likely that Musk would need to disclose his financial holdings, which would be made public under US regulations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro violated a law limiting political activity by federal employees when he publicly advocated voting for President Joe Biden and criticized former President Donald Trump, the Office of Special Counsel said on Thursday.</p>

<p>U.S. federal employees are subject to the Hatch Act, a law limiting some political activities to keep the government free from partisan influence. It prohibits using official authority to influence the results of an election.</p>

<p>During a speech in London in January 2024 while on official travel, Del Toro said he was "confident that the American people will step up to the plate come November and support President Biden for a second term as our Commander-in Chief."</p>

<p>The Office of Special Counsel, which is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency, said that during the event and in an interview with the BBC later that day, Del Toro also "expressed his electoral opposition to President Trump as a candidate."</p>

<p>"When speaking in his official capacity on a taxpayer-funded trip, Secretary Del Toro encouraged electoral support for one candidate over another in the upcoming presidential election," Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger said.</p>

<p>"By doing so, he crossed a legal line and violated the Hatch Act. This is especially troubling because Secretary Del Toro has himself acknowledged that military work and partisan politics should not be mixed," Dellinger added.</p>

<p>Del Toro self-reported his comments to the watchdog, saying that his intent was to discuss the importance of strong international alliances.</p>

<p>"In retrospect, I believe my response should have been delivered more broadly without reference to specific candidates," he told the office.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is meant to be apolitical, loyal to the U.S. Constitution and independent of any party or political movement. Del Toro was appointed Navy Secretary, a civilian-held post, by Biden.</p>

<p>Potential punishments include a fine or removal from office.</p>

<p>The Pentagon on Thursday said that it was reviewing the report, but generally it was important for the military to avoid any action that could imply support for any political party or campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned the US not to cross Russia's "red lines" on the Ukraine conflict, asserting that Washington is starting to lose its sense of mutual restraint with Moscow, state-owned TASS news agency reported.</p>

<p>In an interview on Wednesday, Lavrov said that Americans have "crossed their own red lines" on the supply of arms to Ukraine, the Russian news agency reported.</p>

<p>"They (the US) should understand that our red lines are nothing to fool with. And they know very well where they are," the report quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>Lavrov said the US is starting to lose its sense of mutual restraint with Russia, calling it "dangerous".</p>

<p>"(US National Security Council spokesman John) Kirby said that the issue of stepping up support for Ukraine should be approached carefully so as not to provoke World War III because it will be sad to see Europe gone," he said, adding that the US has a "deep-seated conviction that they are untouchable".</p>

<p>Lavrov said he hoped Washington would realise the potential consequences of supplying Ukraine with weapons.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that there are reasonable people with significant influence left there. And I hope that the interests of the US will be taken into account," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at a press conference on Wednesday, Kirby said the US welcomes any nation that is willing to try to help end the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Any nation that is willing to try to help end this war and do so in keeping with President Zelenskyy's prerogatives, the Ukrainian people's prerogatives, his plan for a just peace, we would certainly welcome a role like that," he said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin named India among the three countries he is constantly in touch with over the Ukraine conflict, asserting that they are sincerely making efforts to resolve it.</p>

<p>"We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India. I constantly keep in touch with our colleagues on this issue," Putin was quoted as saying in a separate report by TASS.</p>

<p>Putin's remarks came within two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic visit to Ukraine, where he held talks with President Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>On August 23, Modi visited Ukraine, where he conveyed to President Zelenskyy that Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the ongoing war and that India was ready to play an "active role" to restore peace in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said his main aim in Ukraine after 30 months of fighting was to capture the eastern Donbas area -- and claimed that Ukraine's Kursk counter-offensive had made that easier.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said his main aim in Ukraine after 30 months of fighting was to capture the eastern Donbas area -- and claimed that Ukraine's Kursk counter-offensive had made that easier.</p>

<p>Putin was speaking a day after Russia attacked Ukraine's western Lviv region with deadly strikes, and after recent advances by Moscow's forces in the Donbas.</p>

<p>Since the start of its offensive in February 2022 when it failed to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Russia has adapted its aims, concentrating instead on trying to conquer eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>While Ukraine's surprise push into Russia's Kursk region last month caught Russian forces off-guard, Putin stressed that the move had failed to slow Moscow's advance in occupied Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The aim of the enemy (in Kursk) was to force us to worry, hustle, divert troops and to stop our offensive in key areas, especially in the Donbas, the liberation of which is our main primary objective," Putin said at a forum in Vladivostok, in Russia's far east.</p>

<p>Russia claims as its own the eastern Donetsk region and three other Ukrainian regions.</p>

<p>Moscow has advanced strongly this summer and its troops are now around a dozen kilometres from the city of Pokrovsk -- a key logistics hub in east Ukraine from where thousands have now fled.</p>

<p>Putin said that by sending "quite well-prepared units" into Kursk, Ukraine had made Moscow's advance in Donbas quicker.</p>

<p>"The enemy weakened itself in key areas, our army has accelerated its offensive operations," he argued.</p>

<p><strong>'Holy duty'</strong></p>

<p>Putin also claimed that Moscow's army has begun to push out Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region, where Kyiv's troops have held on to towns and villages for almost a month.</p>

<p>"Our armed forces have stabilised the situation and started gradually squeezing (the enemy) out from our territory," Putin said.</p>

<p>It was not possible to verify those claims.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted on Thursday that Ukraine was "maintaining the defined lines" in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>Russia did not mount a large-scale response in the first days of the incursion, which became the largest on Russian soil since World War II.</p>

<p>Putin has since played down the significance of the Ukrainian attack but has hardened his rhetoric in recent days.</p>

<p>"It is the holy duty of the Russian army to do everything to throw out the enemy from this territory and to protect our citizens," he said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Zelensky told US TV channel NBC that Ukraine would hold on to the territory captured in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>Zelensky has previously said that one of Kyiv's "goals" in Kursk was to show Russians "what is more important to him (Putin): occupation of the territories of Ukraine or the protection of his population".</p>

<p>Kyiv has also said that it wants to force Moscow into "fair" negotiations.</p>

<p><strong>Aborted deal</strong></p>

<p>While Russian officials have rushed in recent weeks to say that the Kursk incursion makes any talks with Ukraine impossible, Putin appeared to roll back those statements.</p>

<p>Russia was ready to talk, he said -- but on the basis of an aborted deal reached in Istanbul in 2022, the details of which were never made public by either side.</p>

<p>But Putin has repeatedly said that Moscow can only negotiate with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders four of its regions -- Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p>

<p>"Are we ready to negotiate with them? We have never refused to do so," Putin said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"But not on the basis of some ephemeral demands, but on the basis of those documents that were agreed and actually initialled in Istanbul," he added.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has claimed Russia and Ukraine were on the verge of a deal in the spring of 2022, shortly after Moscow launched its offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>On Thursday, both sides reported fresh casualties near the frontlines.</p>

<p>In Ukraine's Donetsk region, a 74-year-old man died when a Russian shell hit his home in the town of Kostyantynivka, the regional prosecutor's office said, posting a photo of a destroyed building.</p>

<p>Ukrainian shelling killed a man in Russia's Belgorod border region, the region's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An already beleaguered Justin Trudeau has been left in a politically precarious place as key ally Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party (NDP) withdrew support for his minority Liberal government ahead of the general election next year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An already beleaguered Justin Trudeau has been left in a politically precarious place as key ally Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party (NDP) withdrew support for his minority Liberal government ahead of the general election next year.</p>

<p>The NDP leader made the announcement in a video message on social media, saying the Liberals "have let people down" and that they "don't deserve another chance from Canadians".</p>

<p>Though it is unlikely that the Trudeau government would fall, the prime minister would have to seek support from other opposition lawmakers in the House of Commons chamber.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Canadian leader of opposition Pierre Poilievre held a press conference where he dared Jagmeet Singh, who he refers to as 'sell out Singh', to call for elections immediately.</p>

<p>Early elections could suit the Conservatives, who have a good chance at winning amid the anti-incumbency against Mr Trudeau's government over a housing crisis and inflation.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty regarding whether the NDP would push for a no-confidence motion against Mr Trudeau in parliament.</p>

<p>The Trudeau government is safe for now as the power lies with the 32 members of parliament from Bloc Quebecois, a regional political party in Canada. The MPs seemingly are not against Justin Trudeau and his government for the time being. Mr Trudeau, however, would find it difficult to pass any new bills or legislation as his government's numbers are vastly diminished in Parliament. His Liberal party currently has 154 seats in the lower house out of the total 338 seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While believing the Liberals were unable to implement several welfare schemes, the NDP was able to push for laws such as pharmacare, dental health care and a $10-a-day child care scheme, all while supporting the ruling government.</p>

<p>Mr Singh and Mr Trudeau had come together in 2022 to boost the Liberal party's minority government. The agreement was supposed to continue till October next year but an NDP spokesperson said the plan to end the deal was in the works for the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Reacting to Mr Singh's announcement, Mr Trudeau said his government will continue to focus on tackling the affordability crisis in the country.</p>

<p>"These are the things that we're focused on. I'll let others focus on politics. I really hope the NDP stays focused on how we can deliver for Canadians, as we have over the past years, rather than focusing on politics," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The study is the first to provide global estimates of inadequate micronutrient intake across 185 countries. Researchers found widespread deficiencies, with iodine, vitamin E, calcium, and iron being particularly low in diets worldwide.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A well-rounded diet is critical for the body's overall growth, strengthening immunity, and supplying the nutrients required for optimum health; yet, many people do not obtain enough important vitamins and minerals from their food and beverages. More than half of the global population consumes inadequate levels of several micronutrients essential to health, including calcium, iron, and vitamins C and E, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the first study to provide global estimates of inadequate consumption of 15 micronutrients critical to human health. The study was published in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00276-6/fulltext"><em> The Lancet Global Health</em></a> on August 29.</p>

<p>"Our study is a big step forward," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/billions-worldwide-consume-inadequate-levels-of-micronutrients-critical-to-human-health/">said co-lead author Chris Free,</a> research professor at UCSB. "Not only because it is the first to estimate inadequate micronutrient intakes for 34 age-sex groups in nearly every country, but also because it makes these methods and results easily accessible to researchers and practitioners."</p>

<p>The researchers used data from the Global Dietary Database, the World Bank, and dietary recall surveys in 31 countries to compare nutritional requirements with nutritional intake among the populations of 185 countries. (They have made these data, as well as code for analysis, freely available.) They divided populations into males and females belonging to17 age groups: zero to 80 in five-year spans, as well as an 80+ group. The assessment studied fifteen vitamins and minerals: calcium, iodine, iron, riboflavin, folate, zinc, magnesium, selenium, thiamin, niacin, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and E.</p>

<p>The study found significant intake inadequacies for nearly all of the evaluated micronutrients, excluding fortification as a potential source of additional nutrients. Inadequate intake was especially prevalent for iodine (68% of the global population), vitamin E (67%), calcium (66%), and iron (65%). More than half of people consumed inadequate levels of riboflavin, folate, and vitamins C and B6.

       <description><![CDATA[Speaking at the Handelsblatt banking summit, Sewing highlighted the disparity between Germanys work hours and those of other European countries, urging a change in work attitudes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once a cornerstone of stability in Europe, Germany has recently seen a slump. Geopolitical concerns, supply chain interruptions, and growing energy costs are some of the factors causing this economic burden. Key sectors that have historically supported Germany's economic strength, such as manufacturing and exports, have been under pressure as a result of these difficulties. Christian Sewing, the CEO of Deutsche Bank, has now proposed a fix for the sluggish German economy. He has urged Germans to work harder to help restore the country's economy.</p>

<p>"Investors are already doubting our ability to reform, but especially our ability and our will to perform," Sewing said at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/banken/bankengipfel-deutsche-bank-chef-sieht-standort-deutschland-in-gefahr/100063209.html">Handelsblatt banking summit in Frankfurt.</a></p>

<p>"More growth in Germany will come only if we also change our attitude to work; if we are prepared to work differently, but overall to work more and harder."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/05/deutsche-bank-ceo-germany-work-harder/"><em>The Fortune Magazine,</em></a> Sewing is right to point out the disparity in EU and German working hours. Official data from 2023 suggest that the bloc's average weekly work time is 36.1 hours, while Germany's is only 34 hours.</p>

<p>Other European countries exceed the regional average, such as Greece, where the work week lasts 39.8 hours. Workers at Germany's industrial competitor, the US, labour for 36.4 hours on average-closer to the EU average.</p>

<p>Sewing has led the German banking giant since 2018 and has urged policy-level changes in the past to prevent the country from becoming called "the sick man of Europe." Now, he says investors are beginning to question the country's ability to fight back.</p>

<p>"Investors have been telling us for more than a year that they doubt Germany's and Europe's ability to perform, and even worse, the will to perform," Sewing said. "We simply have to tell our fellow citizens that we have to do more again."</p>]]></content:encoded>
